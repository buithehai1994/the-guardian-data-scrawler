Or more likely PTSD. It was like we were in a time warp. Back in the madness of theBrexityears. When otherwise sensible people lost all sense of reason. And when the mad became madder still. The days of betrayal and surrender. When our closest allies for the previous 70 years became our deadliest enemy. Time to stare them down. Britons never, never, never shall be slaves. We take no shit from anyone.Keir Starmer’s EU reset went to the wire. Of course it did. Every negotiation with Brussels always does. It’s in the terms and conditions. There was no way the EU was going to give away something on agricultural standards without getting something on fishing in return. You don’t want to encourage other countries to believe they will get a better deal by leaving the EU. Even by the time of the final communique there were still plenty of loose ends. Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. Remember that? Argh!Still that didn’t stop some of the Brexit lunatics from voicing their opinions long before even an outline of a deal was announced. They already had their narrative. This was a surrender on an unforgivable scale. Daniel – unbelievably now Lord – Hannan was writing on X that Britain had become Europe’s very own gimp. Squeezed into a black leather jump suit with a ball in our mouth. Sometimes you wish Danny would keep his fantasies to himself.Then there was David – unbelievably now Lord – Frost. What is it about Brexit that led to so many people who had objectively made British citizens less well off getting promoted to the upper chamber?Frosty the No Man was desperately trying to rewrite history. Again. He has been doing that for more than five years now. Our very own Lady Macbeth trying to wash away the blood. Boris Johnson’s Brexit negotiator whose whole life is now devoted to trying to uncover the person who negotiated such a bad deal. He was trying to persuade himself that he had always known his fishing deal was rubbish but that the EU would cut him some slack now because they felt sorry for him. The man needs help.It’s as if every Brexiter has had a memory wipe. Has no recollection of how deals are made. That the essence of any negotiation is give and take. That there need to be rules which both sides are obliged to follow. But this was also too much for Boris. He went mad on gimp masks too. God knows what you might find in his internet search history. Let’s hope Carrie hasn’t been keeping tabs on him. Here was how the world worked. Britain was at the top, telling every other country what to do. Anything else would be a total betrayal of our sovereignty.Come late Monday morning, a deal of sorts had been negotiated and António Costa, the president of the European Council; Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, and Keir Starmer were ready to face the media at the Lancaster House press conference. Costa went first. Trying to put everyone to sleep. He has the air of someone who has grown used to the fact that he seldom says anything interesting. It’s how he got the job. Everything was marvellous, he mumbled. This was a new chapter.Von der Leyen was slightly more animated. She was pleased the EU and the UK had reached solutions. We were entering a new era of post-Brexit relations. A security and defence partnership. A deal on energy, fish and food. The youth experience scheme. Downgraded from a youth mobility scheme. A sop to the Brits. On no account should anyone think the UK had backtracked on free movement. Better to think of overseas students living entirely in virtual reality.Then came Keir. Flushed with success after his trade deals with India and the US. This was a triumph. No return to the single market or the customs union. But the next best thing. A reminder that British fishers sell more than 70% of their catch to the EU as we don’t like the ones they are selling. It was time to look forward to the future. To move on from the same stale old fights.Though it was the past the British media wanted to interrogate. Hadn’t we surrendered to the EU? We had sold out our fishers. We had become a nation of rule-takers. Brexit derangement syndrome had gripped the broadcasters. Keir gently reminded everyone he was creating jobs, facilitating trade and growth.Even after nine years, it was still too soon to say the obvious. That Britain had voted to make itself poorer. That Brexiters had radicalised themselves. No one had been insisting we leave the single market and the customs union during the referendum campaign. That had only become a truth some time later. So all Starmer was trying to do was to make the country just a little bit better off. You’d have thought from the reaction that this was a major schism.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Tories were threatening to undo all this, the reporter quavered. Er … How exactly? They aren’t about to win an election any time soon. If ever. As if to prove how unserious the Conservatives have become, Kemi Badenoch chose to call a press conference in a broom cupboard in the afternoon. Just to embarrass herself. The broadcasters could barely be bothered to cover it as the sound continued to cut out. We could have been underwater. Not waving but drowning.Priti Patel went first. Luckily for her she was totally inaudible. She will appreciate this in later years. Then came Kemi, declaring that Starmer had broken her five golden rules. Rules that even her own MPs don’t know or care about. Rules that even the Victorians would have thought nuts. Most Brexit voters now think Brexit was a bad idea. They just want things to return to how they were without anyone reminding them that they had voted for it.We ended with Victoria Atkins and the fish. Vicky had a pet hake who was determined to gasp out his manifesto. “I, Harry the Hake, do solemnly declare that I will live and die British. I would rather be left to rot on the jetty than be fed to some Frenchie or Kraut. God save the queen. Sorry, king.” It had been that kind of a day.Explore more on these topicsBrexitKeir StarmerEuropean UnionForeign policycommentShareReuse this content"

It is a remake (or maybe cover version) ofAkira Kurosawa’s classic downbeat noir High and Lowfrom 1963, transplanting the action from Yokohama to New York – or rather returning it there, because the original source material, Ed McBain’s novel King’s Ransom, is set in a fictional city based on the Big Apple.It’s got a terrific throb of energy and life, moving across the screen with the rangy grace of its superstarDenzel Washington– though a little of the minor-key sombreness and complex pessimism and cynicism of the first film has been lost and the modern technology of GPS (unknown in Kurosawa’s day) has indirectly left it with a very small plausibility issue.In Kurosawa’s movie, the incomparably leonine Toshiro Mifune played Gondo, the prosperous salaryman working for a shoe manufacturer who rashly mortgages the luxurious penthouse-style family apartment with its spectacular views of the city (encouraging hubris, of course) so he can he buy out a controlling interest in the firm. But just as he is about to pull off the deal of a lifetime, a kidnapper takes a boy he wrongly thinks is Gondo’s son, but is in fact the son of Gondo’s heartbreakingly loyal and submissive chauffeur Aoki played by Yutaka Sada. Does Gondo now have to use the money he’s borrowed as ransom cash to save the son of a servant?In Lee’s film the shoe executive is now gigantic music-producer legend David King, played with grinning monarchical assurance by Washington. King beamingly surveys hisNew Yorkrealm from his near-super-rich balcony as the sun rises, and Lee shows this with the inspired musical accompaniment of Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin’ from Oklahoma. His wife Pam (Ilfenesh Hadera) is a philanthropist supporting black causes, and his teen son Trey (older and cooler than Gondo’s kid) is a talented basketball player. Every square millimetre of the wall-space is covered by high-end sports-related artworks or ultra rare memorabilia (reportedly from Lee’s own collection), as well as magazine covers of David’s face, unironically pointing up his massive wealth, prestige and impeccable taste.The awful news about the reported abduction of Trey turns out of course to be a bungling mistaken-identity: the culprit has accidentally taken Trey’s best friend and David’s godson Kyle (Elijah Wright) son of David’s driver and family friend Paul (Jeffrey Wright, Elijah’s dad in real life), an ex-con who is now a Muslim convert.In the original, there was a distinct class or caste distinction between Gondo and Aoki, however well-meaning and conflicted Gondo was. This isn’t the case here: King is no snob and has a real love for Paul – but the basic dilemma is still there. Should David throw away his business plan and risk penury to save someone who isn’t family? (This great music producer rages to his imaginary heroes in his private study: “What would you do Stevie?” etc. He amusingly addresses that hypothetical question to James Brown – and perhaps James Brown’s advice on this point might not exactly provide a Hollywood ending.) Lee shrewdly injects a new note of worldliness with the police’s suspicion about the obvious possibility that Paul might himself have staged the abduction – though it is the racist white cop Detective Higgins (Dean Winters, Tina Fey’s boyfriend in TV’s 30 Rock) who has to say this out loud.In Kurosawa’s film, the paying of the ransom on the train is a classic suspense sequence; Lee for his part makes great use of a New York subway train heading out to Yankee Stadium, crammed with baseball fans chanting “Let’s go Yankees” just as they did in Lee’s 25th Hour. (I’d love to see Lee restage the baseball scene from Kurosawa’s Stray Dog.) The police have put a GPS tracker in the bag with the cash, so the kidnapper and his team of stunt-riding accomplices on motor scooters (where did he get all these people?) must have somehow switched the money out of the trackable bag and it’s not immediately clear how they did that. But who is the bad guy? Suspicion falls on the greedy, sexist (but undoubtedly kind of cool) young rapper played by A$AP Rocky. And Lee contrives a great rap-battle-style face off between him and David.This is a big, muscular picture which aspires to the crowd-pleasing athleticism of Spike Lee’s sports icons; it’s very enjoyable and there’s a great turn from Washington.Highest 2 Lowest screened at theCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmCannes film festivalSpike LeeDenzel WashingtonAkira KurosawaThrillersCrime filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

I asked expertsOne thing is certain: motion sickness, which happens to one in three people, is not a sign of weak characterMadeleine AggelerMon 19 May 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 12.01 EDTShareThe other day, I tried to read an email on my phone while in the backseat of a moving car. Almost immediately, I was overwhelmed with nausea. Next to me, my boyfriend was happily scrolling through news articles. He tried to show me a headline, but I was too busy staring out the window, breathing deeply and trying not to vomit.This happens basically any time I am in a moving vehicle that I am not personally piloting. It’s a little embarrassing. But I’m in good company: approximately one in three people areconsidered“highly susceptible to motion sickness”.What exactly is motion sickness, and why do some people experience it so much more than others? We asked experts.What is motion sickness?Motion sickness is a generic term that encompasses all sorts of travel sickness, including sea sickness, air sickness and car sickness, says Dr John Golding, professor of applied psychology at the University of Westminster, in London.But you don’t need to travel to experience its unpleasant symptoms, which can include nausea, vomiting, burping, drowsiness, dizziness, headaches and blurred vision. When the Lumière brothers first screened a motion picture for the public in 1895, some people in the audience started feeling dizzy and sick, says Golding. This is known as “visually induced motion sickness”.Athletes and fitness influencers use creatine, but what is it? And does it work?Read moreScience isn’t entirely sure what causes motion sickness, experts say, but the most widely agreed-upon explanation is the “sensory conflict theory”. Your body uses visual stimuli,proprioception(the body’s ability to perceive itself in space) and the vestibular system (structures inside the inner ear that help you maintain a sense of balance) to sense where your body is and how it is moving.Usually, these three mechanisms are in sync. But when one of them isn’t – say, you’re reading a static page in the car, but your vestibular system still senses that you’re moving – this sensory conflict confuses the brain. “This neurological tension is what triggers common symptoms such as nausea, dizziness and vomiting,” explains Dr Safia Debar, a general practitioner and executive health physician at Mayo Clinic Healthcare in London.In the case of the Lumière brothers’ first audiences, their vestibular systems and senses of proprioception told them they were still, but their eyes told them they were moving. Today, many people experience this sort of visually induced motion sickness when using virtual-reality headsets.What kinds of movements cause motion sickness?One of the most common misconceptions about motion sickness is that the strength of the movement determines the severity of the reaction, says Golding.But people don’t tend to get motion sickness when they’re bouncing up and down on horseback; that is a “higher frequency” movement, says Golding. Slower-frequency movements, like the rocking of a ship at sea, or the swaying of a bus, are more likely to result in motion sickness.Why do some people experience motion sickness more than others?So why can one person read endlessly in a car while even a quick glimpse at a phone turns another person green?A number of factors seem to influence one’s proneness to motion sickness, says Dr Behrang Keshavarz, senior scientist at the Kite Research Institute and professor in the department of psychology at Toronto Metropolitan University.One is age: motion sickness tends to peak in children between the ages of 8 and 12. “Adults are usually better than kids with motion sickness,” says Keshavarz. But that’s not true for everyone, he clarifies.Research suggests people assigned female at birth are more likely to experience motion sickness than those assigned male at birth, says Keshavarz, though no one’s quite sure why. Genetics may also play a role, says Golding, adding that studies indicate motion sickness might be 50-70% heritable.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Some individuals may also be better at adapting to strange new motions than others, suggests Dr Thomas A Stoffregen, emeritus professor of kinesiology at the University of Minnesota.“Some people are ‘naturally coordinated’ and can learn new motor skills quickly,” he says over email. “Others (like me) are klutzes and take forever to learn new movements.” The latter are more at risk for motion sickness, he argues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(I would like to see this printed on the little airplane vomit bags I so often end up breathing into during landings.)“It’s not about being delicate or anxious,” says Debar. “Some people are simply more sensitive to motion.”About half of novice astronauts get space sick during training, Golding adds. “They’re very fit, very highly motivated and not weak-willed,” he says.I nod. Sitting in the back of a Kia Sorento is a lot like going into space, I tell myself.Is it possible to reduce the effects of motion sickness?There are two approaches to dealing with motion sickness: behavioral and pharmacological.My hours seem to slip away. How can I manage my time better?Read moreBehaviorally, a number of easy measures can help. Sit in the front seat of a car when you can, keep your eyes on the horizon, and avoid reading and screens, says Debar. She also notes that ginger has some natural anti-nausea effects.Pleasant music, fresh air, nice smells and a generally pleasant ambiance may be able to distract you, says Keshavarz. He also suggests car passengers copy the movements of the driver. Drivers rarely get motion sickness because they can anticipate the movements of the car and lean into turns, for example. “If you mimic what the driver does, that helps,” Keshavarz says.Unfortunately, the most effective way to combat motion sickness is also the least pleasant: habituation. In other words, doing the activity over and over again until it doesn’t give you motion sickness anymore.“This is by far the most effective countermeasure,” says Golding, who used it to help desensitize Royal Air Force pilots to air sickness. “It doesn’t have side effects, but it’s very time consuming and can be stimulus specific,” he says – meaning that habituating to car sickness won’t necessarily help you with sea sickness.Over-the-counter anti-nausea medication can be effective, experts say, but they often cause drowsiness. Transdermal patches such as Scopolamine are also helpful for up to three days, but can take six to 10 hours to take effect.Timing is important for such medications, says Golding. Even pills might take 30 minutes to an hour to take effect. And you must take them before you start to feel sick, because once you start to experience motion sickness, your stomach goes into gastric stasis, meaning it is no longer emptying its contents into the gut. “That means you might have taken the pill, but it’s not going anywhere,” says Golding.Finally, you can always “vote with your feet”, says Golding. “Avoid situations where you get sick.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It would be perfect television … if only the script weren’t so laughably repetitiousLucy ManganMon 19 May 2025 09.45 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 12.45 EDTShareIn my next life I am definitely coming back asStanley Tucci. Or Francesco da Mosto (that Venetian count with the exuberant hair who was all over the schedules a few years ago, do you remember?), or Steve Coogan or Rob Brydon or any celebrity, really, who is sent off to foreign parts on jollies disguised as work.I am never going to be a world traveller. But if I were, I would, like most of the above, stop at Italy. Why, honestly, would you go further? Why would you not stay in the place that breaks your heart with its beauty everywhere you look? That is suffused with the confidence and style that screams “We owned the Renaissance! We proved ourselves once and for all. No need to sweat the small stuff now! Sit down, chill, and eat penne al’arrabiata until it’s time to prostrate yourself in awe before some ancient frescoes. And btw, the spirit of Michelangelo wants you to eat your body weight in gelato before bed. That’s why he released David from his marble. So you know you can never compete.”I don’t know if you’ve heard, but Stanley Tucci is Italian. The clue is in the name and in the previous travelogueStanley Tucci: Searching for Italy, a number of autobiographical cookbooks about pasta ’n’ that, and now Tucci in Italy, which is very like Searching for Italy, except, obviously, he’s found it.Each of the five episodes purportedly set out to explore the connections between a region – Tuscany, Lombardy, Trentino-Alto Aldige, Abruzzo, Lazio – and its food. In effect, however, it is simply a love fest between Tucci and everyone he meets, Tucci and everything he eats and, just possibly, for those of us who have started to feel that a little bit of Tucci goes a long way, between Tucci and Tucci.Look, it’s not a grift, obviously. Making telly is not like going down t’pit but it’s hard work of a kind. That said, the absolutely minimal effort put into scripting the narration (Lombardy, for example, is “innovative”, “forward-thinking” and “industrialised” to an almost risibly repetitive degree) and the level of analysis by Tucci of the food disappearing down his gullet (“So fresh!” “This is the greatest day of my life”) feels borderline contemptuous of his audience.But perhaps I am asking too much. We do, after all, get to gaze upon beautiful culinary creations and imagine what it would be like to taste them in ceaselessly inviting restaurants and against endlessly gorgeous backdrops (from every inch of Florence, to cooking fish on the banks of the Sarca River). Miniature amberjack taco with balsamic herbs picked on the kitchen premises, anyone? Or perhaps you’d prefer to keep it simple with a steak that could make the gods weep, from Maremmana cattle raised in northern Lazio by some of the last butteri (specialist cowboys), or with sturgeon caviar atop a simple shrimp and spaghetti dish? Remember – if it’s truly fresh, the caviar should have no smell! What about a revitalised vitello tonnato with an aerated tuna sauce? “I make the other dishes ugly deliberately,” says the chef as he finesses the plate. “So that customers don’t become intimidated.” You wouldn’t believe me if I told you what the Lombardians can do with tripe or the Florentines can do with tongue (make you want to eat it, basically), so I won’t try.But it is by their service stations that you shall truly know them. Italians rejoice in the presence of hundreds of branches of Autogrill, a phenomenon that could exist only in a country that privileges la dolce vita beyond all things. What can I tell you? It’s a chain of motorway service stations that doesn’t think customers should be served fried rat. It serves meals you would be glad to have in any restaurant in England. In its test kitchen – test kitchen! – it is working on making a palatable vegan ragu for the masses. A customer explains how sometimes “you don’t want a full osso bucco” because you would need to pull over for a nap afterwards. Indeed. Indeed.So Tucci and his Tucciness work their magic yet again, even if it is mainly by pointing a camera at Italy, letting Italians speak for themselves and their priorities shine through.

But Sunday’s appearance will now bring an abrupt end to a relationship stretching back 30 years.The reason for his premature departure is unambiguous. Last Tuesday, he reposted a pro-Palestine video on Instagram that included a rat emoji –symbolism used against Jewish people in Nazi Germany– causing immediate anger within the corporation. With 1.2 million followers, his Instagram account has significant reach.Lineker first acknowledged a big error by deleting the post. The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, who happened to be giving a speech on the day of the post,made his disapproval clear. Lineker apologised the following day. Yet some critics were already questioning why his apology had taken hours to arrive – and believed the BBC should have fired him on the spot. While Lineker fronted Saturday’s FA Cup final coverage for the BBC, all sides agreed it was time to part ways.Yesterday, the 64-year-old pundit said he did not see the emoji, but acknowledged it has “awful connotations”.Lineker’s social media posts have repeatedly led to criticisms of theBBC. Previously, the fallout usually involved difficult exchanges between the corporation and its highest paid on-air presenter. He had been known to push back and argue the corporation needed to be more prepared to stand up for itself.But that dynamic has not been repeated in exchanges over the last week. There was swift agreement that an apology was needed and that the time had come for the BBC and its star presenter to part ways. It is understood there was no row over the outcome.Lineker’s appearance on Match of the Day this weekend will be his last duty for the corporation, though even that has been criticised by some as allowing the presenter to leave on his own terms. To others, it is a compromise acknowledging the decades Lineker has spent fronting the BBC’s sports coverage.His departure comes after years of accumulated baggage between the BBC and its star. He had already agreed a deal last year that wouldsee him step down from Match of the Day, but continue to front next season’s FA Cup and the 2026 World Cup.1:50Gary Lineker to leave BBC on Sunday after antisemitism row – videoThat came after a skirmish in 2023, in which he compared the then Conservative government’s rhetoric around immigration to that used in Germany in the 1930s. His suspension led to colleagues walking out in solidarity and a Match of the Day without any commentary or analysis. It also saw the BBC shore up its impartiality guidelines for presenters.By then, he had already touched on other controversial issues on social media, including overseas political donations and sewage. More recently, he was among500 film, TV and other media professionalscalling on the BBC to reinstate its documentary on children and young people living in Gaza. It was removed from the BBC’s iPlayer after it emerged that the film’s 14-year-old narrator was the son of a deputy agriculture minister in the territory’s Hamas-run government.An interview with Lineker last week, conducted before his offending social media post but published after its appearance, warned BBC bosses there could easily be more controversial moments to navigate between now and the next World Cup. “You either have empathy or you don’t,” Lineker said. “I’ll definitely continue pushing humanitarian issues.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The BBC “wanted me to leave”, he told the BBC’s Amol Rajan last month. He also recently ridiculed BBC figures for suggesting that he could pivot to a cookery show.Hovering above the clashes has been a sense that even on the more mundane issues of BBC management, Lineker had ceased to respect the chain of command. In particular, eyebrows were raised inside the BBC at comments he made about the plans for Match of the Day – and apparent criticisms of Alex Kay-Jelski, the BBC’s director of sport.Given that football highlights are now widely shared on social media long before Saturday night, Kay-Jelski is said to be among those trying to find other ways to keep the BBC’s coverage relevant.“He has his reasons, he wants to change Match of the Day a bit,” Lineker told the Telegraph. “Ultimately, I don’t think they will, because I don’t see how you move a highlights show away from being about highlights. I think he wants more journalists – he has come from that background. He has got no television experience.”His departure will mark an extraordinary career arc that has seen him almost personify the changing face of the media world. He started out as a quiet former footballerusing voice coachingto help his move into presenting, but leaves as not only one of the BBC’s biggest names, but also as a media executive in his own right – overseeing the Goalhanger Productions podcast business disrupting the traditional broadcasters.His own podcast, The Rest Is Football, has seen the likes of Lineker and Alan Shearer take a more irreverent and opinionated approach to the game. Such platforms have contributed to the pressures that have led BBC bosses to push for changes to Match of the Day when he leaves.Explore more on these topicsGary LinekerMatch of the DayBBCTim DavieInstagramSocial mediaAntisemitismanalysisShareReuse this content"

That’s natural; we see people like Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Paul Newman, Julia Roberts andTom Cruisein movie after movie, sometimes experiencing a love-at-first-sight lightning-strike moment, sometimes developing a relationship over many years, and sometimes a combination of the two. Directors, for the most part, remain hidden, with a select few – Steven Spielberg, Tim Burton, Martin Scorsese – popping through to broader public consciousness, a process that seems to take twice as long. (Martin Scorsese became a commercial prospect roughly 30 years into his career.)‘Would do more harm than good’: what will Trump’s tariffs really mean for Hollywood?Read moreIt’s a little surprising, then, that the newest crop of directors reaching for (or in some case, already attaining) brand-name status have become the public faces of saving an imperiled theatrical experience.Christopher Nolanwas out front to an arguably foolhardy degree, lobbying for theaters to reopen and show his planned 2020 summer blockbuster Tenet before Covid vaccines were in place. He was understandably pilloried at the time, though now he’s celebrated for his big-canvas vision to the point where an Imax re-release of Tenet (at a safer time for public health) was a big ticket-seller for Warner Bros and helped inspire a similar reissue of his once-maligned sci-fi epic Interstellar.Similarly,Ryan Cooglerhas made a play for rarified Nolan-style air as a mainstream but critic-friendly showman with an affinity for gigantic screens. Like Nolan, he put his distinct touch on a massive superhero blockbuster (with Black Panther outgrossing even The Dark Knight, and scoring a best picture nomination to boot) and parlayed that success into a big-budget original; Sinners just became the highest-grossing original movie since the family-friendly cartoon Coco (and could ultimately become the biggest live-action original in the US since Nolan’s Inception). It returned to a handful of elite real-Imax screens for a second round of sold-out shows this past weekend, a month after its initial release. Before release, Coogler made the rounds on social media in a charming video where he patiently explained the different options for seeing his movie, which is available in formats rare (70mm Imax, which is what came back at the weekend) and wide (ultra-widescreen Dolby-certified presentations).It’s not just directors behind the literal biggest movies coaxing a post-Covid audience back to the theaters. On the awards trail this past winter and spring, newly minted Oscar winner Sean Baker used his spotlight to stump for the theatrical experience, making clear that he makes movies to be seen in theaters, not phones or laptops. Neon, the company that distributed Baker’s film Anora, joins A24 as a marquee indie company that refuses to shorten the theatrical release window down to a token few weeks. Some of their films may hit premium VoD quickly, but they hit subscription streaming months, not days, after their theatrical debuts. The strategy seems to help: four of each company’s 10 biggest hits were released in the past year.Naturally, this promotion still comes back to a movie star: Tom Cruise, one of the more recognizable faces in the world, has essentially appointed himself brand ambassador for The Movies, even without recording a long-playing theater-chain promo like Nicole Kidman or Vin Diesel. He was photographed masked up in an Imax theater for the original run of Tenet; he was there on social media promoting Sinners, a movie to which he has absolutely no creative connection. The man simply loves the movies as a concept. For Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, Cruise has been making the press rounds talking about the technical marvels of film-making, the drive to give the audience a theater-worthy experience and, well, all of the usual talking points he hits when flogging his spectacular action pictures. He was adamant that Top Gun: Maverick avoid either the fate of Tenet (released to barely open theaters where it couldn’t attract a real crowd) or the countless movies sent straight to streaming (which, it should be noted, did provide new entertainment for tons of people stuck at home during a scary and uncertain time).The involvement of Cruise’s cult-like devotion underlines how these Champions of Cinema sometimes seem to run in parallel to the music world’s digitally enabled stan armies. There’s a sense that if Nolan says “my movie should be seen in Imax”, a certain segment of ticket-buyers will dutifully sell out the theater as soon as possible. Coogler, perhaps figuring that it would be hard to sell his movie as “best” in a format that only a dozen theaters can actually play, was further-reaching in his social media video, but the message was similar: go out, get excited and buy those tickets. As such, it’s possible to read a little bit of discomfiting Cruise-style messianic fervor into these campaigns, just as it’s a little unnerving to know that some Taylor Swift fans will spring for $400 tickets, buy half a dozen different-colored vinyl LPs of an album they already own, or swarm perceived enemies online, all in order to pledge fealty to their pop master.Is it just cinephile bias (and its attendant stereotypical maleness) that makes the Champions of Cinema stuff seem more wholesome? Maybe. But at a time when Donald Trump appoints elderly has-beens as “ambassadors” to Hollywood, Nolan, Coogler, Baker and even the nearly senior-citizen-age Cruise seem more plugged in to how to wow an audience, rather than angrily berate the existence of international productions (and in Mel Gibson’s case, cut deals to carve out an exception for whatever movie he wants to make). There’s also something a little unnerving in that what amounts to industrial-strength straight-to-the-public capitalist lobbying feels purer and easier to believe in than countless political campaigns. The idea of movie stars and prestigious film-makers has been under corporate attack by franchise ubiquity over the past decade-plus. Maybe collectible, fan-club auteurism is cinema’s best shot at wresting itself back from the brands.Explore more on these topicsFilm industryRyan CooglerTom CruiseChristopher NolanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But attacks came immediately from rightwing parties, which said the deal would make the UK a “rule taker” from Brussels.From fishing to Erasmus: what the UK’s deal with the EU will meanRead moreStarmer emphasised the tangible benefits the deal would do for Britons, including cheaper food in supermarkets and an end to passport queues at European airports witha deal for travellers to use European e-gates. No 10 hopes both can be clinched within a year.The deal also paves the way for the UK’s return to the Erasmus university exchange programme, and the creation of a youth mobility scheme that would allow young people access to the EU through work, study, au pair or travel.1:37Starmer denies claim ‘win-win’ UK-EU deal has sold out fishing sector – videoUK ministers have insisted the scheme will be capped and time-limited, similar to those deals struck with Australia and New Zealand. But officials said there were hard negotiations yet to be done on whether the capped numbers would be from individual member states or EU-wide.Acknowledgingfor the first time the damage done byBrexitto Britain’s trade, Starmer said the deal to remove restrictions from agrifood trade would give a boost of £9bn to the UK economy. In a government briefing, No 10 said it would redress the 21% drop in exports and 7% drop in imports seen since Brexit.It is the third deal Britain has struck this month, after agreements withIndiaandthe US.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, one of the biggest Europhiles in the cabinet, said Monday’s agreement was “the best deal with the EU for any country” and would show “Britain now is the place to put investment and do business, because we’ve got preferential deals with the biggest economies”.But the price for the trade boost was controversial. The UK will grant EU fishers access to British waters for an additional 12 years, an eleventh-hour concession from the UK three times as long as it had originally offered, which led to cries of betrayal from the Conservatives and industry figures. Boris Johnson, the former prime minister who signed the Brexit deal, said Starmer was “turning this country once again into the orange ball-chewing, leather-trussed gimp”.The National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations said it was “very disappointed” with the deal and that it “surrenders the best prospect that the fishing industry and coastal communities had for growth over the coming decade”.No 10 said the industry would benefit many times over from the export deal which would allow some foods including shellfish to be exported to the EU for the first time since Brexit.The wide-ranging deal struck at the Lancaster House summit on Monday includes:A defence pact as the first step towards securing British access to a new €150bn (£126bn) EU rearmament fund, though the UK will pay into the fund.Faster access for travellers who will be able to use e-gates at airports on the continent, although the timeline is unclear.A landmark emissions-trading deal, meaning UK exporters will avoid £800m of carbon border taxes.Closer cooperation on crime and migration, including access to the EU facial recognition data, a key request from Starmer.UK officials said they had agreed the long-term fishing settlement to give the industry certainty – and that the EU had originally demanded a permanent fishing deal or to time-limit the agrifood deal, which British negotiators refused to accept.Negotiations went late into Sunday night. The final details were offered by UK negotiators at about 10.30pm and negotiations on the language continued until 3am. EU ambassadors met in the early morning to rubber-stamp the three agreed texts.The fraught final hours came after tempers flared in Brussels, particularly when Downing Streetbriefed on Saturday night that the deal was done– but the 12-year fishing deal was not agreed till the following day. Sources suggested that Starmer’s apparent acceptance of a youth mobility deal in an interview on Friday gave EU negotiators an opening to push for further concessions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe agrifood deal paves the way for the removal of checks on British food exports, allowing everything from the “great British burger to shellfish” to be sold again with ease in the EU, Starmer said. It crosses one of the totemic red lines of the Brexit negotiations under the Conservatives, accepting dynamic alignment with EU standards and a role for the European court of justice.The change, once formally agreed, will need primary legislation in parliament, though unlike under the Conservatives there is no prospect of Labour MPs holding up the change, though some are uneasy about the deal.Addressing Labour MPs after the summit, Starmer said he would face the political threat from Reform head on, making the case that trade deals would save jobs and put money in people’s pockets.“Reform are our main rivals for power,” he added. “We have a moral responsibility to make sure [Nigel] Farage never wins. We have to be clear that every opportunity he has had in this parliament to back working people he’s voted against. We will take the fight to him. We will fight as Labour.”The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, claimed it would make it “much harder” to get a free trade agreement with the US, where chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef, banned in the EU, are allowed.There is no legal agreement on any of the deals announced and negotiations will now begin on the fine print. But von der Leyen said she hoped that the UK would be able to join the defence agreement “within weeks”.Starmer said he wanted UK holidaymakers to be able to use e-gates in EU countries “as soon as possible”, but the final move will be up to individual states. “There’s no inhibition on this, so I want to see it done quickly,” he said. “For holidaymakers wanting to get out this summer they will want to know that they can do so easily and without delay and chaos.”Badenoch said: “This deal is taking us to the past and that is why we call it surrender.” She stopped short of saying she would rip up the terms of the deal, saying only that she would seek to renegotiate should the Tories return to power.Major supermarkets and food and drink companies hailed the agrifood deal as a gamechanger, though it is expected to make relatively little impact on GDP. The Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that Brexit reduced the UK economy’s long-term productivity by 4%.Salmon Scotland said it was a “breakthrough that eases the burden on our farmers, processors and the communities they support, and we welcome efforts to implement it at pace”.The NFU, an employers’ association representing British farmers, said the benefits would ultimately depend on how much say the UK had over standards it had to adhere to. “This deal will deliver many benefits for agrifood exports to the EU,” the NFU said. “However, there remain important questions about what is within the scope of this agreement and, where current rules and regulations do differ, if there will be any exclusions.”Explore more on these topicsBrexitEuropean UnionEuropeForeign policyKeir StarmerUrsula von der LeyennewsShareReuse this content"

If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response,” the three allied governments said in a statement on Monday.Netanyahu responded to the message, saying Israel will continue to defend itself until total victory was achieved. “The leaders in London, Ottawa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7 while inviting more such atrocities,” Netanyahu said.International pressure over a looming famine forced the Israeli prime minister to announce on Sunday night that he would ease the 11-week siege ofGazato prevent a “starvation crisis”.‘Our hearts ache’: the fight for survival in Gaza amid Israel’s new offensive and no aidRead moreNearly 24 hours later the UN said nine trucks of aid had been cleared to enter. This is less than 2% of daily shipments before the war, when Palestinians in Gaza were well fed and the strip had its own agricultural sector, and will make no meaningful difference to the crisis now gripping most of its 2.3 million population.Britain,Franceand Canada described Israeli measures as “wholly inadequate”, warned it risked breaching international law and called for “a return to delivery of aid in line with humanitarian principles”.Netanyahu’s decision to allow even a trickle of food in to Gaza had been attacked by far-right critics including members of his own cabinet. On Monday he shared a video on social media explaining his hand had been forced by close allies.For weeks, Israeli officials insisted that there were “no shortages” in Gaza. But “senators” who are Israel’s “greatest friends in the world” had warned they would drop support for the country over images of starving Palestinians, Netanyahu said.“[They told me]: ‘We cannot accept images of hunger, mass hunger. We cannot stand that. We will not be able to support you,’” Netanyahu said. He added that deepening desperation inside Gaza was taking Israel towards a “red line, to a point where we might lose control”,without clarifying what he was referring to.He did not name his critical “friends”, but last week at the end of trip around the region – which did not include a stop in Israel – Donald Trump said“a lot of people are starving” in the strip, and claimed he would “take care” of the situation.After he secured the release of a dual US-Israeli national hostage from Hamas last week, there had been hopes the US president would broker a lasting ceasefire for the entire strip. Instead, Israellaunched a new ground offensive inside Gazaalmost immediately after he left the region.Heavy bombardments killed hundreds of Palestinians over the weekend. Strikes also targeted the strip’s battered hospitals, bringing the total toll from the war inside Gaza to 53,486, most of them civilians.“The fighting is intense and we are making progress. We will take control of all the territory of the Strip,” Netanyahu said in a video posted on Telegram on Monday.The Israeli military declared all of central Khan Younis city a “combat zone”, ordering civilians to leave. Most have been displaced repeatedly, are weakened by hunger and with much of the strip in ruins have nowhere to go.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its director, Jake Woods, a former US marine, said the GHF would be “up and running before the end of the month”, but it is not clear who will pay for the aid.The UN and international humanitarian groups who have brought food into Gaza since the war began have said they will not work with GHF, because its armed contractors and links to the Israeli military compromise key principles including neutrality and put staffers at risk.Israeli foreign ministry officials declined to comment on funding.Israel launched the war after cross-border attacks by Hamas killed 1,200 people, the majority civilians. Another 250 were taken hostage, with 58 still in Gaza – but nearly two-thirds of them are thought to be dead.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelGazaHamasFranceCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

Putin also suggested his country’s maximalist objectives in the war with Ukraine were unchanged.In contrast, Trump offered a far more positive spin, saying in a post on his Truth Social network that the talks went “very well”.“The tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent … Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War,” he wrote, suggesting that the Vatican should host future Russia-Ukraine negotiations.Trump’s statement after the call with Putin also suggested the US would be stepping back from the negotiations. He said the conditions for a deal could only be negotiated by the “warring parties”, despite his earlier claim that he could end the war in a single day.Trump later said it would be “great” to hold peace talks at the Vatican, but again suggested the US could abandon its involvement, telling reporters that if there is no progress: “I’m just going to back away.”Beyond Trump’s occasionally optimistic rhetoric, no breakthrough appears in sight. Despite previouslydemanding an immediate ceasefireand backing Europe’s ultimatum for Russia to halt hostilities, he now appears to be once again easing off pressure on Moscow. He made no mention of his previous threats to impose sanctions on Russia if it did not agree to halt the fighting.Moscow has consistently rejected extended ceasefire proposals, arguing they would give Ukraine time to rearm and regroup at a time Russian forces are making battlefield advances.On Monday, Putin claimed Russia supported a halt to hostilities, but said it was necessary to “identify the most effective paths toward peace”.Crucially, Putin repeated his longstanding refrain that the “root causes” of the war must be addressed: a reference to Russia’s far-reaching demands that would severely undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty.These demands include forcing Ukraine to “denazify” and demilitarise, cutting back its armed forces, barring it from receiving western military support, and imposing sweeping limits on its sovereignty.Since Trump’s re-election, Putin has been engaged in a delicate balancing act with the US president, appearing to support peace talks to stay in Trump’s favour, while pushing for terms that in effect amount to Ukraine’s capitulation.In an apparent show of confidence and nonchalance, Putin took the call with Trump on Monday while touring a music school in Sochi. His bravado is fuelled by Russia’s slow but steady battlefield gains, Europe’s disjointed response, and a domestic economy increasingly adapted for a prolonged war.Trump said he spoke with Zelenskyy and several European leaders after his call with Putin.In a statement late on Monday, Zelenskyy insisted Ukraine was ready for a full ceasefire and direct negotiations with Moscow, but said: “If the Russians are not ready to stop the killings, there must be stronger sanctions. Pressure on Russia will push it toward real peace.”He added: “If Putin puts forward unrealistic demands, this will mean that Russia continues to drag out the war, and deserves that Europe, America, and the world act accordingly, including with further sanctions. Russia must end the war it started, and it can begin doing so any day.”Zelenskyy also rejected Russia’s demands for Ukraine to withdraw its troops from the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, which Russia claims to have annexed but does not fully control. “No one will withdraw our troops from our territories,” he told reporters.The Ukrainian leader also urged the US not to “distance itself from the talks and the pursuit of peace”.“The only one who benefits from that is Putin,” he said.The flurry of diplomatic activity on Monday came days afterthe first meeting between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in three years, held in Istanbul. Those talks broke down after Russia demanded more territory as a condition for halting the fighting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The US leader proclaimed “nothing will happen” on the peace talks until he met Putin.But Putin and Trump remained silent on the prospect of a meeting on Monday.Despite Putin’s continued refusal to agree to a temporary ceasefire, Trump has stopped short of directly criticising him – even asa growing consensus in Washingtonsees the Russian president as the main obstacle to progress in the peace talks.As in previous calls, Putin appeared to cultivate a personal rapport with Trump, congratulating him on the birth of his 11th grandson, according to Putin’s top foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov.Putin has publicly praised Trump on several occasions, flattering him as “courageous” after the 2024 assassination attempt at a campaign rally. He also claimed to have prayed for “his friend” after Trump was grazed by a bullet.According to Ushakov, Trump told Putin during the call: “Vladimir, you can pick up the phone anytime. I’ll be happy to answer and happy to talk with you.”Speaking before the call between the two leaders, the US vice-president, JD Vance, said Trump would press Putin on whether he was “serious” about ending the war.“We realise there’s a bit of an impasse here. And I think the president’s going to say to President Putin: ‘Look, are you serious? Are you real about this?’” Vance said as he prepared to depart from Italy.“I think honestly that President Putin, he doesn’t quite know how to get out of the war,” Vance said, adding that he had just spoken to Trump.He said Trump may offer Putin economic incentives to accept some concessions on Ukraine in return for peace.But the vice-president also raised the prospect of the US walking away from the talks – a scenario that will unsettle European allies and raise doubts about America’s willingness to keep providing military and economic aid to Ukraine.Vance said that it “takes two to tango. I know the president’s willing to do that, but if Russia is not willing to do that, then we’re eventually just going to say, this is not our war.Fearing that Trump might strike a deal with the Kremlin at Ukraine’s expense, European leaders rushed on Sunday to sway his thinking before the talks.The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, said he held talks with the leaders of the US, Italy, France and Germany on Sunday evening to coordinate efforts to pressure Russia into accepting an unconditional ceasefire, warning that new sanctions could be imposed if Moscow refuses to engage seriously.The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said in a statement: “Putin must show he wants peace by accepting the 30-day unconditional ceasefire.”Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropeVladimir PutinDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

In 2022,a coroner ruled that she would most likely have survivedif doctors had identified the warning signs of her rapidly deteriorating condition and transferred her to intensive care earlier, which her parents had asked doctors to do.Thompson, a specialist in paediatric liver disease, and the on-duty consultant – although he was on call at home – on 29 August 2021, is accused by the General Medical Council (GMC) of misconduct that impairs his fitness to practise.Opening the GMC’s case at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service on Monday, Christopher Rose said, based on a review of the case by Dr Stephen Playfor, a medical examiner at Manchester Royal Infirmary, Thompson:Should have taken more “aggressive intervention” between noon and 1pm on 29 August, including referring Martha to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU).Should have gone into the hospital from about 5pm to carry out an in-person assessment of a rash Martha had developed.Gave “false, outdated and misleading information” in a phone call at approximately 9.40pm to Dr Akash Deep in the PICU team.Rose told the tribunal that during the call to Deep, Thompson gave a “highly inaccurate description” of Martha’s condition as “stable”. He said Thompson told his colleague that Martha’s systolic blood pressure was at 100mmHg when it had been below that level since 2pm, and did not mention the rash.Thompson also told Deep that a review of Martha by someone from the PICU team would just get her parents “more stressed and anxious”, the tribunal heard.Rose told the disciplinary panel: “Prof Deep said Prof Thompson told him that Martha was stable and did not need a review … Martha was not stable and GMC say it was entirely incorrect for Prof Thompson to have given Prof Deep that impression.”Thompson denies the allegations against him. Rose told the tribunal that Thompson claims that he acted according to established medical literature. The doctor also says that his assessment that Martha did not need a review, as communicated on the call with Deep, was separate to his concern about causing her parents increased stress or anxiety.Martha was transferred to intensive care on 30 August 2021 by which time she had septic shock, according to a serious incident report produced for KCH.She had sustained an injury to her pancreas when she fell off her bike on a summer holiday. Doctors at King’s College did not listen to the concerns of her parents, Merope Mills, a senior editor at the Guardian, and her husband, Paul Laity, including that she could have hadsepsis, a significant cause of avoidable deaththat kills an estimated 40,000 people a year in the UK.Martha’s rule came as a result of pressure on politicians,NHSbosses and doctors after Mills and Laity spoke out about their experience.The hearing in Manchester continues.Explore more on these topicsHospitalsSepsisNHSEnglandHealthDoctorsnewsShareReuse this content"

Deaths among women that age rose by 46% and among men by 31%, between 1990 and 2023.In contrast, mortality has fallen in 19 of the 21 other countries studied, with only the US and Canada showing the same rise as the UK. Britain now has the fourth highest overall female mortality and sixth highest overall male mortality rate among the 22 nations. The US topped both league tables.Jennifer Dixon, the Health Foundation’s chief executive, said: “This report is a health check we can’t afford to ignore – and the diagnosis is grim.“The UK is becoming the sick person of the wealthy world, especially for people of working age. While other nations moved forward, we stalled – and in some areas slipped badly behind.”Dixon pointed out the improvement in UK death rates since 1990 slowed significantly during the 2010s, with the austerity policies pursued by the coalition government after 2010 a significant factor. Smoking, alcohol misuse and bad diet also help explain Britain’s increasingly sick population.By 2023, women in the UK had a 14% higher death rate than the median in the other countries, while among men of all ages it was 9%.Prof David Leon, who led the research at LSHTM, said: “What is particularly disturbing about our findings is that the risk of dying among adults in the prime of life – those who have not yet got to the age of 50 – has been increasing in the UK for over a decade, while in most other countries it has declined.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The rate of such deaths in 2023 – 93 per million population – was double the 43.5 per 100,000 that occurred as recently as 2012, which underlines the sharp increase in drug mortality.Mortality due to suicide has also risen but alcohol-related deaths plateaued for women and fell for men between 2009 and 2019, the thinktank found.The Local Government Association and WithYou, a drugs charity, called for the government to make it easier for drug users, people close to them and health professionals to access and use naloxone, an emergency antidote to overdoses involving heroin, methadone and other drugs.Robin Pollard, WithYou’s head of policy and influencing, said: “We also know getting people into structured treatment is critical to reduce the numbers of drug deaths, and so we continue to call for easier access to higher-quality opiate substitution treatment.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Every death from the misuse of drugs is a tragedy.

Half (50%) would support a “digital curfew” that would restrict their access to certain apps and sites past 10pm, while 46% said they would rather be young in a world without the internet altogether.A quarter of respondents spent four or more hours a day on social media, while 42% of those surveyed admitted to lying to their parents and guardians about what they do online.While online, 42% said they had lied about their age, 40% admitted to having a decoy or “burner” account, and 27% said they pretended to be a different person completely.The results came after the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, hinted that the government wasweighing up the possibilityof making cut-off times mandatory for certain apps such as TikTok and Instagram.Rani Govender, the policy manager for child safety online at the NSPCC, said that digital curfews, while helpful, could not stop children being exposed to harmful materials online without other measures being put in place.“We need to make clear that a digital curfew alone is not going to protect children from the risks they face online. They will be able to see all these risks at other points of the day and they will still have the same impact,” she said.Govender added that the primary focus for companies and the government was to ensure kids are using “much safer and less addictive sites”.The study, conducted by the British Standards Institution, surveyed 1,293 young people and found that 27% of respondents have shared their location online with strangers.In the same survey, three-quarters said they had spent more time online as a result of the pandemic, while 68% said they felt the time they spent online was detrimental to their mental health.Andy Burrows, the chief executive of the suicide prevention charity the Molly Rose Foundation, said it was “clear that young people are aware of the risks online and, what’s more, they want action from tech companies to protect them”.He added that algorithms can provide content that “can quickly spiral and take young people down rabbit holes of harmful and distressing material through no fault of their own”. New laws were “urgently required to finally embed a safe by design approach to regulation that puts the needs of children and society ahead of those of big tech”, he said.Explore more on these topicsInternetYoung peopleSocial mediaDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

This includes the war inUkraine, which has forced countries to grow fewer crop types, leaving pollinators without diverse food throughout the season.The researchers found microplastic particles were contaminating beehives across Europe, with testing from 315 honey bee colonies revealing synthetic materials such as PET plastic in most hives. Artificial light from street lamps has been found to reduce flower visits by nocturnal pollinators by 62%, and air pollution has been found to affect their survival, reproduction and growth.Antibiotics, used in agriculture, have made their way into beehives and honey. They have also been found to affect the behaviour of pollinators including reducing their foraging and visits to flowers. Pesticide “cocktails” also play a significant and emerging role; although some pesticides are now regulated to be kept below “safe” limits for bees and other wildlife, research has found they can interact with other chemicals and cause dangerous effects.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This is not just a conservation issue. Pollinators are central to our food systems, climate resilience and economic security. Protecting pollinators means protecting ourselves.”The authors have called for a number of measures to protect bees, including stronger laws limiting antibiotic pollution that harms bee health, transitioning to electric vehicles to reduce air pollution affecting pollinators, creating flower-rich habitats within solar parks, and breeding crops with enhanced pollen and nectar for better pollinator nutrition.The report’s co-author Dr Deepa Senapathi, also from the University of Reading, added: “It will take effort from everyone to address these threats. We need to maintain, manage and improve our natural habitats to create safe spaces for pollinators. Individual actions like providing food and nesting areas in our own back gardens can help in a big way. But policy changes and individual actions must work together so everything from gardens and farms to public spaces and wider landscapes can all become pollinator-friendly habitats.”Explore more on these topicsBeesInsectsWildlifeUkrainePollutionPlasticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Barawi ran out to the street and saw that his cousin’s house had been bombed, with 10 people inside. The strikes on Beit Lahiya came days after Israel launcheda major new offensive, named Operation Gideon’s Chariots.“They were all martyred. Only a six-year-old girl survived, and she is now in the hospital. We started pulling them from under the rubble – their features were disfigured, their bodies covered in dirt, their clothes torn. Their skin had turned grey from the ash and dust. I felt my heart tearing apart as I carried them and handed them over to others,” the 46-year-old university lecturer said.View image in fullscreenPalestinians from Beit Lahiya flee with their possessions amid intensified Israeli military attacks.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesHours later, Barawi loaded his own family into a battered hired car along with as many belongings as could fit. They headed south towardsGazaCity in search of relative safety.“I went there without knowing where we would settle, and I don’t know anyone around me … Our bodies and faces are no longer as they were before the war. We don’t recognise ourselves, so how can others recognise us?” he told the Guardian.Abdel Khaleq al-Attar had also fled to Gaza City after witnessing the bombing of Barawi’s cousins. Attar and his family had been living in a tent, after being displaced eight times during the 19 month-long conflict.“It was one of the hardest nights Beit Lahiya has ever experienced,” the 23-year-old said. “When we evacuated, we only brought personal belongings and two blankets. The road was dangerous and exhausting. There were hundreds of people walking while carrying their belongings, others sitting on the roadside completely worn out. Now we are sleeping in our tent in the street.”Hundreds have died in waves of airstrikes in Israel’s new offensive, mostly civilians according to medical and civil defence officials in Gaza, though the leader of Hamas in Gaza has reportedly been killed tooNow in Gaza City, Attar faces another threat. Gaza has been under a tight blockade imposed by Israel 11 weeks ago and stocks of food, medicine and fuel are almost exhausted. Israel says the measure is necessary to prevent Hamas exploiting aid to fund its military and other operations.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises after an Israeli attack on the Tuffah neighbourhood in Gaza City.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesHowever, the consequences for the shattered, traumatised population are clear. The small supplies of essentials are unaffordable for many, and food security experts have describeda critical risk of famineamid already soaring acute malnutrition.Few in Gaza place much confidence in the announcement on Sunday night by Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that “basic aid” would now be allowed into Gaza.“We are facing real starvation. I have three children to feed,” Attar, a labourer, said.The war in Gaza was sparked by a surprise attack launched by Hamas into Israel in October 2023, which killed 1,200, mostly civilians. The militant Islamist organisation also took 251 hostages, of whom 57 remain in Gaza, though more than half are thought to be dead. The successive Israeli offensives have killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians.The Israeli military did not offer an immediate comment on the strikes in Beit Lahiya but had previously said it followed international law and took “feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm”. Israel also accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields – which the group denies. Israel issues evacuation orders before some strikes to warn civilians of forthcoming operations but no recent such orders appear to cover Beit Lahiya.Among the war’s most recent casualties was Nesma Salem’s older brother. The 20-year-old student and her family decided to flee Beit Lahiya on Friday morning after nights spent “in utter darkness, in every sense of the word”. But as they loaded her brother’s car with their belongings for the trip to Gaza City, artillery shells began to fall nearby.View image in fullscreenDisplaced Palestinians flee from Khan Younis.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/AP“People started fleeing in all directions. We tried to get out as fast as we could, but we weren’t fast enough,” Salem said.There were three sudden explosions. When Salem looked around, she saw bodies scattered in the street – children, men and women.“I turned around and saw my brother Rajeb lying on the ground. He told me he was OK, but then he lost consciousness. I checked his pulse – it was still there. I tried to find someone to help carry him or treat him, but everyone around us was injured themselves,” Salem said.“I ran back home and found my uncle who helped carry my brother. Then ambulances transported him to the hospital. The doctor checked him and immediately declared him dead. I couldn’t believe it. I begged the doctor to check again, to try to resuscitate him. They said there was no hope. I started screaming.”Rajeb Salem, who was 22, was hastily buried in Beit Lahiya. Then the family fled.“My father drove my brother’s car, but many of our belongings were lost or damaged in the strikes so we only managed to bring some food, summer clothes, and blankets. The road was exhausting, packed with cars full of displaced families’ belongings, rubble everywhere, and the sky covered in smoke from the nonstop bombardment,” Nesma Salem said.The family found shelter in the house of a relative in Gaza City, already overcrowded with fugitives from elsewhere. They too face hunger as well as grief and shock.“Our stock of aid is gone. The flour is gone. We used to grind pasta and bake it as a bread substitute – now even the pasta is finished. Today, we ground lentils and kneaded into dough,” said Salem.She has little interest in the continual rumours of a new ceasefire.“What difference does it make to me? Will they bring my brother back to life? I no longer care about ceasefires or Beit Lahiya. I will never go back there. I can’t imagine our home without my brother in it … Our hearts ache.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

A potential link between the two cases looks likely to form part of the investigations being carried out by the Georgian and Sri Lankan authorities.The charges facing the women, as suspected mules for organised crime gangs, could hardly be any more serious.If found guilty, Lee, from south London, could face a 25-year sentence, while anything from 20 years in jail to life imprisonment would be on the cards for 18-year-old Culley, from County Durham, according to prosecutors.It is, however, the context that will perhaps be most alarming for any parent whose children may be talking of finding adventure in south-east Asia.Thailandwas the first country in Asia to legalise the use and purchase of cannabis leaves in February 2021 and the whole plant in June 2022.The Thai authorities were trying to alleviate the overcrowding in their prison system.The evidence suggests that the result has been an opening of the floodgates for the international drug smugglers, who regard naive young travellers as easy prey.View image in fullscreenThe National Crime Agency has described a ‘dramatic’ increase in the amount of cannabis being seized at UK airports.Photograph: National Crime Agency/PALast summer, the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) issued a warning of hefty prison sentences for those coming with cannabis from Thailand, the US and Canada, where the laws on possession have been softened to various degrees in recent years.The reason for alarm was what the NCA described as a “dramatic” increase in the amount of cannabis being detected and seized at UK airports. Almost 27 tonnes was discovered in 2024 compared with just five tonnes in the previous year. That was up from 2 tonnes in 2022.Of the 750 smugglers arrested at airports in 2024, the NCA said that 460 had arrived from Thailand. Those being picked up were often young people lured into a false sense that a softening in the laws of their country of departure could be taken as a signal.“I think it goes on a lot more than people think,” said Darrell Jones, who became the first full-time drug expert witness officer within the Metropolitan police in 2016. “What with legislation coming in certain countries around the world and society in general being desensitised to a certain extent by cannabis use, and with the ability for people to travel so easily, with a focus on easy money.“Those sorts of groups of people get involved in this sort of consumption of cannabis legally in those countries and before they know it, they’re talking to some people who are offering them probably a significant amount of cash. And they think it’s a great idea at the time, and especially if they’re running out of money.”In the case of Lee, it is known that she had flown out to Thailand in April to celebrate her 21st birthday courtesy of her older sister, who was meeting her from Australia, where she lives.British teenager Bella May Culley is being held in Georgia on drug charges.Photograph: East2WestShe had previously enjoyed a summer contract as a cabin attendant for Tui but she had been training as a beauty therapist specialising in eyelashes. Lee had the travel bug – her social media profiles were full of photographs of white sandy beaches and parties abroad. But money was tight. Photographs published by the Sri Lanka customs narcotics control unit in Colombo suggest that the drugs allegedly in Lee’s luggage were in large vacuum packed bags, indicating a high level of professionalism.The drugs found in the luggage of Culley, who has claimed in her only court appearance in Tbilisi that she is pregnant, were also allegedly discovered in hermetically sealed packages.Her family said she had initially gone abroad at Easter with a friend on a backpacking adventure after finishing an access course at Middlesbrough college. She wanted to be a nurse.Her grandfather, William Culley, said that her first port of call had been the Philippines to “see somebody, a lad there, who she used to go out with a couple of years ago, who was working out there”.She had then gone on to Bangkok on 3 May, according to her mother, Lyanne Culley, but had not called last Saturday as arranged, causing alarm.Culley’s social media profiles suggested that a boyfriend was in tow. She was photographed riding on the back of motorcycles and lounging on sunny beaches in the company of a male figure who was never clearly pictured or named.One TikTok was captioned: “Don’t care if we on the run baby as long as I’m next to u.”Another video showing her relaxing, had the caption: ‘Blonde or brunette? Erm, how about we get up to criminal activities side by side like Bonnie n Clyde making heavy figures and fcking on balconies all over the world.”Culley is now reportedly being held in Tbilisi prison No 5, Georgia’s only female prison.“I really didn’t want her to go to Thailand,” her mother was reported as saying. “I begged her to come home. I don’t trust some of the boys over there. But she wanted to meet up with some friends she made over there on a previous trip. I don’t know who any of them are.”Giorgi Lekishvili, a former prosecutor who is now a defence lawyer at Lawyers.ge, said that there would be a preliminary hearing by 1 July but that Culley faced nine months in jail before the case even got to trial.Culley has been utterly shaken by events, her lawyer has said, and is yet to see her father, Niel Culley, 49, who has travelled from his home in Vietnam to be with her.“When I explained to her that what she was accused of was an especially severe crime then she was concerned and visibly shaken,” said Ia Todua, a defence lawyer provided to Culley by the Georgian authorities. “My impression was that she ended up in Georgia without even knowing what she was doing. She looked like she didn’t expect it to have such severe consequences.”Explore more on these topicsSri LankaDrugsThailandAsia PacificSouth and central AsiaCannabisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The talks lasted until about 2am on Monday morning, when the prime minister finally signed off on a deal that included 12-year-long quotas instead.“There was a last-minute wrangle over fish which went right up to the wire on Sunday night,” said one British government source. A European official added: “The UK’s final offer had been four years, but even by Sunday night we were yet to square the circle.”Anand Menon, the director of the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank, said: “The EU has used the fact that we were thedemandeurto leverage what they have long wanted. The French will be absolutely chuffed – there is no doubt that we had to concede on that.”It was a big last-minute concession by Starmer, but one that allowed him to stand up about 12 hours later and declare: “Britain is back on the world stage.”Despite his best efforts to restore order to Britain’s international relations, the final 48 hours of the prime minister’s first big negotiation with Brussels ended in much the same way those of his predecessors did – with frantic phone calls and late-night concessions.Both sides, however, say the trouble was worth it, bringing certainty to businesses on both sides of the Channel and reinforcing the UK’s position as a trusted external partner to the EU.Starmer’s aim from the beginning had been to show that EU negotiations could be done differently – quietly and without what he calls “megaphone diplomacy”.It was an approach that infuriated some. Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, accused the prime minister on Monday of conducting “secret negotiations away from parliament, the media and the public”.But British officials say that this veil of secrecy was essential to agreeing such a complex deal, which could have tripped on any one detail, and nearly did so at the 11th hour.But if Starmer’s public position was emollient, behind the scenes negotiators say the UK was demanding a lot from its European partners.“Britain came to these talks with 50 different demands,” said one European source. “This deal benefits everybody, but it would be wrong to suggest the UK did not get a lot of what it wanted.”For months the detailed negotiations have been led by Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister who is close to Starmer and whose office is linked to Downing Street by a corridor at the back of Whitehall.Others in the cabinet have taken the lead on different aspects of the deal, however, such as the foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the defence secretary, John Healey, on the defence and security pact.Healey said: “Back in July, you didn’t have the UK leading the coalition of the willing [in support of Ukraine]. You didn’t have the Trinity House agreement [between Britain and Germany]. You didn’t have the prospect of an EU-UK defence agreement. All things are part of strengthening British security.”The harder elements to agree were on a future youth mobility scheme and how long the agricultural trade pact and the fishing deal should last.The UK ideally wanted a one-year fishing agreement and an indefinite agricultural one. Officials thought they could secure such a deal by offering up a youth mobility scheme, which is badly wanted in many European capitals.But when Starmer appeared to give way on the mobility scheme, it allowed the French to make a new demand: if the agricultural trade deal was to be indefinite, then the fishing quotas should be too. If one was to be time-limited, both should be.With the two sides at a standoff, EU ambassadors met three time within five days in an effort to avert diplomatic disaster. When they met at 2.30pm on Sunday, the text was still not agreed.Over a long and exhausting day of negotiations, officials worked until the early hours trying to untangle the last-minute disagreement. In the Cabinet Office, Thomas-Symonds and his team ordered a Nando’s takeaway while they made repeated calls to European capitals and back to Downing Street.The cross-continental phone calls irritated some in Brussels, who felt that Britain was trying to play “divide and conquer” with European capitals, much as they felt Boris Johnson had done in the past.Also causing irritation was a press release Downing Street issued on Saturday stating baldly: “This week, the prime minister will strike yet another deal that will deliver in the national interest of this country.”Even as the negotiations continued, European leaders began landing in London on Sunday evening.Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, arrived at about 7.30 – her flight having been tracked minute-by-minute by some junior British officials. Kaja Kallas, the high representative for foreign affairs, landed two hours later.At 10.30pm, the British sent their final substantive proposals, including, crucially, the concession on fishing quotas. Even then, talks went on for another four hours as officials argued, in the words of one, “over commas”.None of the last-minute tensions were apparent on Monday lunchtime, however, as Starmer and several of his cabinet presented the deal at a chummy press conference in central London.The delegations had originally sat separately but at the suggestion of Maroš Šefčovič, the EU trade commissioner, they all swapped places so they could sit among each other.“That’s what this deal is all about,” Starmer told the press conference. “Building the relationships we choose, with the partners we choose and closing deals in the national interest.”Speaking on BBC Radio 4 on Monday morning, Kallas had a slightly different take: “Any deal means making compromises on both sides. If both parties are not entirely happy, that means it’s a good deal.”Explore more on these topicsBrexitEuropean UnionLabourKeir StarmerForeign policyFishing industryUrsula von der LeyennewsShareReuse this content"

We are in a kind of alternative present or recent past; some of the film appears to take place before France adopted the euro in 2002, or perhaps in this imagined world, the euro didn’t happen.Thirteen-year-old Alpha (Boros), from a Moroccan-French family, royally freaks out her mother (Golshifteh Farahani) one evening by coming back from a party with the letter A tattooed on her arm. (This incidentally indicates a kind of badass rebellious attitude that she never really displays again.) With a dirty needle? A shared needle?Her mother, a doctor, is beside herself because her hospital is now overwhelmed with infection cases of a bizarre new disease, which turns the sufferer into a marble-white statue. However, despite the near-riot developing outside the hospital, Ducournau doesn’t show any restrictive hygiene practices and appears to suggest that society ultimately pretty much copes with the white-marble disease, with unstressed doctors and nurses in the same hospital smilingly dealing with a row of patients.This fictional situation could therefore be said to gesture at Aids or Covid, although it is not particularly compelling or scary either on its own literal terms or as metaphor. It could relate to respectable society’s horror of drug addicts – who include Alpha’s emaciated smackhead brother Amin (Tahar Ramin) whom Alpha’s mom once very rashly allowed to babysit the five-year-old Alpha in some scuzzy rented room while patently out of it – he is evidently intended to be some sort of magically sacrificial figure.As for Alpha, her tattoo, and her leaking bandage, earn her some bullying ostracism from the class, who are themselves angrily preoccupied with the disease, and the various infections of misogyny and homophobia are arguably also being satirised.But the madly, bafflingly overwrought and humourless storytelling can’t overcome the fact that everything here is frankly unpersuasive and tedious. Every line, every scene, has the emoting dial turned up to 11 and yet feels redundant. Ducournau surely has to find her way back to the cool precision and certainty of Raw.Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalFestivalsHorror filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Not since Harry Potter had a publication caused such asensation: computers were hacked in search of the manuscript and advance copies were kept under lock and key. With classic Atwood timing, the novel coincided with the phenomenal success of theTV adaptationof the original – not to mention the arrival of Trump at the White House. The Testaments won Atwood her second Booker prize, shared (controversially) with Bernardine Evaristo’sGirl, Woman, Other.View image in fullscreen9Oryx and Crake(2003)A world ravaged by a deadly global pandemic? Atwood got there first in her dystopian MaddAddam trilogy, which also includes The Year of the Flood (2009) andMaddAddam(2013). We meet Snowman, apparently the lone human survivor, along with genetically engineered smart pigs (pigoons) and the humanoid Crakers (untroubled by sexual desire and sunburn). Globalisation, rogue science and big tech are all targets for Atwood’s satire.ReviewingThe Year of the Flood in 2009, the late Ursula K Le Guin took her friend to task for resisting the label of science fiction. Atwood’s many sci-fi fans may be cross it’s not higher on this list. Atwood herself described it as “a fun-filled, joke-packed, adventure story on the end of the human race”.View image in fullscreen8Hag-Seed(2016)Afteragreeingto rewrite The Tempest for Shakespeare’s 400th anniversary, Atwood reread the original three times and then again, backwards. Betrayal, revenge, grief, freedom and creativity: you can see why this is the play she picked. Prospero’s island becomes a prison in Canada in 2013, with Felix, the wronged artistic director of a theatre festival, mourning his daughter Miranda. “So many contradictions to Prospero! Entitled aristocrat, modest hermit? Wise old mage, revengeful old poop?” Felix reflects.Atwood puts her own inimitable spin on the play.7The Edible Woman(1969)Atwood’s first published novel, a satire on consumerism and misogyny, was written when she was 24, the dark result of “speculating for some time about symbolic cannibalism”, as you do. Atwood later insisted the novel was “proto-feminist”, because “there was no women’s movement in sight” when she wrote it in 1965. Thus began her unofficial role as feminist figurehead and soothsayer. Here we see her sharpening her teeth.View image in fullscreen6The Blind Assassin(2000)“Ten days after the war ended, my sister Laura drove a car off a bridge.” So opens Atwood’s epic novel, told by 82-year-old Iris Chase. The book’s key object is a steamer trunk, a fitting metaphor as Atwood throws everything into this story-within-a-story-within-a-story: the social and political upheavals of 20th -century Canadian history; a host of narrative tricks (flashbacks, multiple time schemes); and a mix of genres including sci-fi, whodunnit and romance. According to the New Yorker’s Michiko Kakutani, of all Atwood’s novels, The Blind Assassin“is most purely a work of entertainment”. It won her the Booker prize for the first time.View image in fullscreen5Paper Boat: New and Selected Poems 1961-2023Atwood became a writer when a poem suddenly came to her on a school football pitch when she was 16.Paper Boatbrings together 60 years’ worth of poems from her first collection, Double Persephone (1961), to her last,Dearly, published in 2020, the year after the death of her partner of 48 years,Graeme Gibson. As the years pass, youthful questioning gives way to grief and wisdom. Atwood has called poetry “the most joyful” of literary forms, and it is here, perhaps, that you see the writer at her most gentle and unguarded. “How to keep track of the days? / Each one shining, each one alone? Each one then gone. / I’ve kept some of them in a drawer on paper, / those days fading now.”View image in fullscreen4Burning Questions: Essays 2004-2021(2022)The environment, democracy, women’s rights – these are just some of the urgent issues addressed in this collection of Atwood’s essays written this century (at one point she was averaging 40 pieces a year). Here you will find tips on how to be a writer (look after your back) and how to escape a crocodile (zigzag), alongside celebrations of authors and the musicianLaurie Anderson. Atwood is interested in everything: from the sex lives of snails to the future of the planet, nothing is too small or vast. Many of these essays were lectures, but you never feel you are being lectured. No one combines intellect, straight-talking and silliness like Atwood – sometimes all in the same sentence. Her motto: “Tell. The. Truth.”View image in fullscreen3Alias Grace(1996)In 1843 Toronto, Grace Marks, an Irish Canadian scullery maid, was convicted for the double murders of her employer and his mistress. This notorious case was the inspiration for the Booker-shortlisted Alias Grace. Temptress or victim? Power, truth and the slipperiness of history, some of Atwood’s favourite themes are here. The question of believing a woman’s story assumed a heightened resonance with the2017 TV adaptation, which landed in the midst of the #MeToo revelations. Hilary ManteldescribedAlias Grace as “impressive at a horribly deep level” – you can’t argue with that.View image in fullscreen2Cat’s Eye(1988)“Little girls are not made of sugar and spice and everything nice,” Atwood said ofCat’s Eye. She is the least autobiographical of novelists, but Cat’s Eye draws on her shock at leaving the Canadian outback, where she roamed wild with her elder brother, to attend school for the first time in Toronto. The narrator Elaine is thrown into “a whole world of girls and their doings”, with schoolmate Cordelia the original mean girl. Cat’s Eye captures the byzantine hierarchies and covert cruelties of schoolgirl politics, usually overlooked by literature. Wolf Hall for prepubescent girls. Heartbreaking and terrifying.View image in fullscreen1The Handmaid’s Tale(1985)Atwood’s feminist dystopia has entered the popular imagination as well as the canon. Even if you’ve never read the novel or seen the TV series, you will know that it imagines America in the grip of a theocracy where women are enslaved for their fertility. Atwood wrote the novel in Berlin in 1984 – of course she did – in response to the regressive US Reagan government, but not even she could have predicted its second life post-Trump. Famously, she didn’t include anything that hadn’t happened somewhere in the world already. “If I was to create an imaginary garden, I wanted the toads in it to be real,” shewrote. Today, the pond is even murkier and the toads are bigger and uglier. All together now: “Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.”To explore any of the books featured, visitguardianbookshop.com.

Please do not read unless you have seen episodes one to six.Back in early 2023 The Last of Us launched toadmiring reviewsand millions of viewers around the world. When it wasquickly renewed for a second seasonthere was speculation about how showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann would approach the task. Would they skip straight to adaptingthe second (and so far final) video game, which picks up the action five years after the original? Or would they take a more scenic route, inventing new post-apocalyptic adventures for surrogate father-daughter duo Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) to have during that considerable time gap? It would certainly be an easy way to eke another lucrative season or three out of the source material.View image in fullscreenMore time together … Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and Joel (Pedro Pascal) in The Last of Us.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved.In the end, Mazin and Druckmann chose to remain faithful to the video game byjumping five years aheadandbrutally killing off Joelin the early running. But tonight’s extended flashback episode shaded in some details of what happened in the interim. Like a stone skipping over a gorgeous Wyoming lake, it jumped ahead a year at a time (rather like the recent final season ofAndor) to track the ebb and flow of Joel and Ellie’s relationship as she matured from rebellious young teen to even more rebellious older teen.For those who had been keenly feeling the absence of Joel, an hour in the company of Pascal as he tried to whittle down some of his character’s more anguished edges felt like a thoughtful, handcrafted gift. There was also an all-too-brief but memorable appearance from Joe Pantoliano. But first there was the surprise of seeing Joel himself as a scowling, defiant teen.Meet Mr MillerAn opening flashback to Austin, Texas, in 1983 sees young Joel and Tommy stressing about their father coming home. It’s obvious that Tommy has done something very naughty but Joel is determined to take the blame so that his younger brother avoids a beating. The first surprise is that Mr Miller (played by Tony Dalton) is a cop. The second is that his approach to disciplining Joel – whom he instinctively knows is covering for his sibling – involves offering him a can of beer. As they sip their Buds, Miller Sr tells a story from his own childhood about being caught shoplifting. His vengeful father broke his jaw with one punch. He is clearly aware that raising his hands to his own sons is perpetuating a cycle of violence. But by not sending them to the hospital he thinks he is at least managing to do things “a little better than my father did”.Happy birthday(s) to EllieView image in fullscreenA Repair Shop-style miracle … Joel whittles Ellie a guitar.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved.After the credits, we are still in flashback mode but it is now two months since Joel and Ellie got back to Jackson Hole at the end of season one. Joel is preparing a surprise for Ellie’s 15th birthday, trading salvaged Legos with gruff bartender Seth (Robert John Burke) to secure a cake and some materials he needs to restore an acoustic guitar. But his Repair Shop-style woodworking reverie is interrupted by Tommy (Gabriel Luna) rushing an injured Ellie back to the house.While working in the settlement’s kitchen she badly burned her forearm on a cooking pot. It’s obvious Ellie did this deliberately to obscure the suspicious bite mark on her arm. The injury does not put a dampener on her birthday celebration the next morning, but it does mean she cannot actually strum the acoustic guitar that Joel has given her. He allows himself to be cajoled into performing a rough cover of Pearl Jam’sFuture Days. It earns him some uncharacteristically high praise from Ellie: “Well … that didn’t suck.”Space explorationView image in fullscreenSuch joy … Joel takes Ellie on a space mission for her 16th birthday.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc.

Perhaps inspired by being out in nature, Joel attempts to broach the subject of the birds and the bees, which goes about as well as you might imagine. (“You mean dicks and vaginas?” is the response.) But while Ellie has had to grow up fast, Joel seems obsessed with carving out space for some happy childhood experiences. He has planned this trip to a ruined Wyoming museum so Ellie can see an actual Apollo space capsule and, at least for a moment, imagine what it might be like to leave their compromised world behind. Her joy is palpable.Another year later, things aren’t going quite as smoothly. Joel’s attempt to surprise Ellie with a 17th birthday cake sees him awkwardly gatecrashing a date that ticks off every fear in an overprotective parent’s nightmare: sexual experimentation, drug use and getting a tattoo. Joel even finds himself reaching for a hoary old mantra that will probably outlast any apocalypse: “This is my house, and when you’re under my roof …” But after a quick consultation with town shrink Gail (Catherine O’Hara) Joel seems to see the sense in giving Ellie her own space by letting her move into the garage. He even has some complimentary words about her new moth tattoo.A tough break for EugeneView image in fullscreenMoth arm … Joel compliments Ellie’s new tattoo.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved.This time the jump ahead is two years, to Ellie’s 19th birthday, and by now she and her Nirvana posters are fully installed in the garage. We eavesdrop as she rehearses asking Joel some awkward questions about what really happened in Salt Lake City. Five years on, she has begun to realise his story about how they escaped does not stand up to scrutiny. She is interrupted by Joel, who is belatedly granting her desperate wish to go out on patrol. It will turn out to be a baptism of fire.An emergency call over the radio sends Joel and Ellie racing to protect another patrol from an infected attack. It is too late for poor Adam but they see a confused Eugene (Joe Pantoliano), who reveals that he has been bitten. All he wants to do is get back to the outskirts of Jackson before he turns so he can say goodbye to his wife, Gail. Under pressure from Ellie, Joel agrees to help. But after he sends Ellie to retrieve their horses it seems that his plan all along was to escort the doomed Eugene to the shore of a peaceful lake and shoot him there.As the pair ride back to the settlement, dragging Eugene’s body, Joel impresses on Ellie that he intends to tell Gail “what she needs to know and nothing more”. She now has stomach-churning confirmation that Joel will flat-out lie if he thinks it serves a greater good. But when faced with Gail’s grief Ellie refuses to let Joel sugarcoat what happened and tells everyone the truth: Joel shot him in the head.‘I’ll pay the price …’There is one final time jump, to nine months later and the New Year’s Eve shindig fromthe opening episode. We see the dancefloor confrontation between homophobic Seth and the canoodling Ellie and Dina from Joel’s point of view as he unwisely wades in. But we also see more of the aftermath, as he and Ellie have a bruising heart-to-heart on their porch. She gives him “one last chance” to tell the truth about what happened in Salt Lake City, but it is so traumamatic that Joel cannot even speak. All he can do is shake his head or nod as Ellie works through her questions and finally gets truthful answers. This is the point where their relationship could shatter for ever. But there is still room to end on an unlikely glimmer of hope. “I don’t think I can forgive you for this,” says Ellie. “But I would like to try.” Is it uplifting to know that our heroes could have rebuilt their relationship? Or is it even more heartbreaking to hear with the foreknowledge that Joel is fated to die the very next day?Notes and observationsIf Dalton and his moustache looked familiar, he has appeared in Disney+ Marvel showsHawkeyeandDaredevil: Born Againas New York socialite Jack Duquesne, AKA dashing vigilante Swordsman. Dalton will also star in forthcoming PlayStation 5 gameIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophetfrom The Last of Us creators Naughty Dog.Yes, Pearl Jam didn’t release the songFuture Daysuntil 2013, which makes it a little weird to hear Joel covering it when the world-wrecking outbreak took place back a decade earlier.

Now a gorgeous new book is celebrating these ‘museum-worthy’ imagesJim FarberMon 19 May 2025 10.32 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 12.45 EDTShareIn the late 1950s, when photography critic Vince Aletti was in his mid-teens, he stumbled upon a clutch of magazines at a local newsstand that seemed to speak directly to him. From their covers to the pages inside, the pocket-sized magazines were packed with strikingly composed images of nearly naked, finely muscled men, many of whom appeared to have a secret rapport with each other. “I remember getting really turned on by that,” Aletti recalls, sitting in his apartment in New York’s East Village. “I also remember being really worried that my mother might find those magazines in my room.”Physique magazines, as such publications were generically known, operated on a coded system, designed to function as smoke signals for gay men during an era of heightened repression and censorship that lasted from the 1930s until the early 70s. The magazines, which were pumped out in cities across the US, made sure to pass as health and fitness publications, but the style and content of their photos were clearly created for the tastes and desires of gay men. In the decades since, physique images have often been written off as campy relics of a sad past, but Aletti wants audiences to consider them anew.View image in fullscreenThe models’ poses were frequently architectural.Photograph: Courtesy of Don Whitman (Western Photography Guild), SPBH Editions, and MACK.In his gorgeous new book, titled Physique, Aletti makes the case for such images to be seen not as mere historical documents or what he calls “porn-adjacent” ephemera, but as museum-worthy art. “The pictures are beautifully made,” he says, “and the photographers clearly took pride in what they did. The poses are artfully handled and the lighting and setting they used referred back to classic ways of looking at the nude. If these pictures had been flimsy or ill-made, I never would have kept collecting them.”In fact, he has collected more than 10,000 such works over five decades. Throughout Aletti’s sprawling apartment, the photos are stacked up in towers that ascend like stalagmites from the furniture and floor. Lining the walls are photos by well-respected photographers such as Peter Hujar, Nan Goldin and Larry Clark. Aletti – who has served as a photography critic for the New Yorker, curated photo exhibits and published several other art books – wants readers to notice the care taken in works by physique image-makers such as Bruce Bellas, who worked under the pseudonym “Bruce of Los Angeles”, or Alonzo Hanagan, AKA “Lon of New York”.View image in fullscreenCollector … Vince Aletti.Photograph: Matt Borkowski/BFA.com/ShutterstockTo help evade the ever-probing attentions of the censors, these artists often modelled their work on well-established images from ancient Greece or Rome, replete with Doric columns, phallic swords and warrior poses, all of which only intensified their homoerotic allure. The models’ poses were frequently architectural, with arms outstretched like load-bearing beams and legs planted as sturdy as Parthenon pedestals. The compositions are finely balanced and well-framed, while the lighting in the earlier work echoes the voluptuous glamour of classic Hollywood portraits by George Hurrell or Clarence Sinclair Bull.Perhaps the earliest antecedent of the physique photographers wasWilhelm von Gloeden, whose sepia-toned images of young Sicilian men from Taormina date back to the 1870s. Born to an aristocratic family near Weimar Germany, Von Gloeden escaped to the Italian island to cure his tuberculosis but, once there, found a wealth of beautiful young men who agreed to display their physiques for his camera. Many of his photos place the men in the landscape so seamlessly they seem to have sprung primordially from the earth.One of the most prolific and successful of the later physique artists,Bob Mizer, ran the Athletic Model Guild (AMG) for more than four decades, starting in 1945. In his prime, Mizer worked out of four properties near downtown Los Angeles where he created hundreds of thousands of homoerotic images, films and videotapes while also publishing one of the form’s most popular titles, Physique Pictorial.“I used to swipe magazines from a newsstand in Hollywood,” says John Sonsini, who worked with Mizer at AMG. “God forbid I should ever be caught!” Sonsini, an artist and lecturer, takes me on a tour of the area where Mizer created his works. We stop by a former movie theatre that used to play his films for gay audiences. The complex includes a pool for faux athletic adventures.View image in fullscreenOther images were more focused on everyday scenarios.Photograph: Courtesy of Bruce Bellas (Bruce of Los Angeles), SPBH Editions, and MACK.As exciting as the images were to Sonsini, he was equally struck by the fact that names were assigned to the models: although many were likely pseudonyms, it still indicated that these were real people, a revelation in an age when closets were overwhelmingly shut tight. Readers could write to publications such as Physique Pictorial asking to buy individual images tailored to their taste. “The fact that those men were willing to put their names, addresses and phone numbers out there was incredible in the 1950s,” Sonsini says. “In that way, I believe these magazines played a role in advancing gay liberation. The magazines were a milestone that helped people out, in every sense.”By the time he reached college, Sonsini was painting male nudes, including men who had posed for AMG. That helped land him a job with AMG in 1986, painting backgrounds for the photos. “I was having the time of my life,” he says.Most of the models found their way to AMG by word of mouth among the hordes of aspiring actors and bodybuilders who have historically gravitated to Hollywood. Sonsini says the mood on the sets during the shoots was very professional – and not at all erotic. “When you work with these guys day in and day out,” he says, “that’s just not there.” The models, who were overwhelmingly straight, knew that the readers of the magazines were gay, and were, says Sonsini, largely cool with it. “A lot of these men were kind of bohemian people. Bodybuilders in those days were not part of the athletic mainstream. They were very marginalised. Many were very attuned to the theatrical world.”View image in fullscreenFull-frontal nudity was banned.Photograph: Courtesy of Chuck Renslow (Kris), SPBH Editions, and MACK.One of the best-known models to appear in physique publications was Joe Dallesandro, the Warhol superstar famously mentioned inLou Reed’s Walk on the Wild Side(“Little Joe never once gave it away”). Dallesandro was the subject of a film Mizer made in 1966, and Sonsini speculates that some of the models may have hustled gay men for sex on the side. He was warned by Mizer not to solicit them or to be alone with any of two of them in a room at the same time. As the 1980s wore on, drugs had a devastating effect on the scene, as did Aids.They had a clear impact on gay visual artists, from Francis Bacon to Robert MapplethorpeDuring shoots, the photographers had to be careful about which parts of the models they showed. “The penis is always a problem, at least in the modern world,” Aletti says. Even so, physique photographers were creating full-frontal nude portraits as far back as the 1930s at the request of individual clients. In print, meanwhile, the photographers had to get creative about hiding “the candy”, sometimes with objects such as a coiled snake, fishing nets or washing-up cloths.Banning full-frontal nudity also meant that the photographers sometimes concentrated more squarely on the butt, although at times, says Sonsini, the censors were less alarmed by which body part was shown than by the expression on a model’s face. “A smile,” he says, “would drive the censors crazy.”Many of the photographers faced harassment, fines or jail time. In 1947,according tothe Bob Mizer Foundation, Mizer spent a year at a work camp in California after being “wrongly accused of having sex with a model who was a minor, among other charges”. Although Sonsini says Mizer didn’t consider himself a political person, he believes his work had a hand in liberating the minds and bodies of gay people, aided by editorials he wrote in his magazine damning the forces that tried to shut him down. “Mizer was very courageous in a lot of ways,” Aletti says.Beefcakes and monkeys: Bob Mizer’s muscle men – in picturesRead moreBy the start of the mass gay movement at the dawn of the 1970s, hardcore gay porn began to proliferate, making the old physique portraits seem coy and dated. But at the same time, the early physique works had a clear impact on gay visual artists, evident in the work of Francis Bacon in the 1950s and 60s, as well as photographers of the 70s and 80s from Robert Mapplethorpe to Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Weber’s photos most brazenly mimicked the faux battle poses and homoerotic camaraderie that defined so many classic physique layouts.Over the years, there have been many books and collections devoted to vintage physique photos, but Aletti’s book stands out by pushing the formal composition of the works over their more basic function. “It’s clear when you look at the way the works are lit and designed that the photographers weren’t just making pictures to turn people on,” he says. “They were making something beautiful.”Physique by Vince Alettiis published by SPBH EditionsExplore more on these topicsPhotographyMagazinesLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bring the outside in? Ditch your white-noise machine for a babbling brook going through your living room?A home that went on the market last monthinArizonaoffers all this and more. Sidewinder Ranch is a 40-acre hillside property built over natural rock formations. Every room is of geological interest, with a TV shelf perched on rock and boulders creeping to the foot of the bed. A fountain built inside has the feel of a mountain stream, and the property has stunning desert views. “Buy 40 acres but it might as well be 400,”read the listing.It amounts to a rugged, no-frills version of Frank Lloyd Wright’scelebrated Fallingwater. And the three-bedroom house is incredibly secluded, about a half-hour from the town of Willcox, population 3,200. For $225,000, you get the house, the property and a free bulldozer.It does take a certain adventurous spirit just to get up [the hill] to this placeClay Greathouse, realtorIt does have some downsides, however: the current owner “regularly pulls rattlesnakes out” of the bathroom, according to the realtor, Clay Greathouse ofArizona Desert Rat Realty. A prospective new owner also got attacked by bees from a hive in the wall, Greathouse says. Apparently, that only added to its charms; Greathouse accepted an offer from the bee-stung buyer on Monday night.The origins of Sidewinder Ranch are a mystery. “It looks like a mining shack or something, but there’s no traces of any mining that I see around there. So it just has me puzzled,” Greathouse says. The person who built it, he told the localNBC affiliate 12News, “had to have been some, I want to say, a hippie-dippie guy, got a lot of time on his hands”. Greathouse estimates the house was built in the 80s or 90s, though an abandoned nearby structure dates to the 1920s. The original owner stopped paying taxes for unclear reasons – perhaps death – and the house has exchanged hands a few times since.View image in fullscreenThe house amounts to a rugged, no-frills version of Frank Lloyd Wright’s celebrated Fallingwater.Photograph: Courtesy Desert Rat RealtyThe current owner doesn’t live there full time; instead, he treats it as a sort of “cabin” for getaways, says Greathouse. “It does take a certain adventurous spirit just to get up [the hill] to this place.” The treacherous ascent requires four-wheel drive.The owner bonded with the new buyer over a shared love for motorcycles and, presumably, isolation. A creased book the realtor found in the building fell open to a “pretty appropriate” section on living in solitude.Despite the rustic nature of the place, it is connected to the power grid. Its kitchen is “better than you’d expect”, according to the property blogZillow Gone Wild. It boasts a septic system, a well and a bathroom with a shower and spa. Greathouse believes it has its own aquifer, making it immune to big agriculture’s water wars. Add a few solar panels and “it could definitely be aprepper place,” Greathouse says.View image in fullscreen‘It’s kind of a freedom-loving, do-as-you-want sort of place.’Photograph: Courtesy Desert Rat RealtyStill, the new owner has some work ahead of him to “make it livable”, he adds. “When the present owner bought it, one of the biggest tasks he had was chasing the pack rats out.”Many other homes in Cochise county, Arizona, are unusual, and that’s no coincidence. Alegal provisionin the county eases the permitting process, aiming to “encourage the use of ingenuity” and facilitate “the use of alternative building materials and methods”. Homes in the county are made usinggeodesic domes,rammed earthandstraw bales. “It’s kind of a freedom-loving, do-as-you-want sort of place,” Greathouse says.View image in fullscreenThe treacherous ascent up to the property requires four-wheel drive.Photograph: Courtesy Desert Rat RealtyFurther afield, the American west hosts plenty of other architectural oddities. Three years ago, a house fit for the Jetsons – essentially agiant disc on a pole– hit the market in Tulsa, Oklahoma. California’s Bay Area is home to what’s known asthe Flintstones house, a cartoonish, dinosaur-filled property that has long delighted onlookers (the occasional legal complaint notwithstanding). Sidewinder Ranch, on the other hand, is for those chasing the real Flintstonian dream of living directly on bedrock.Explore more on these topicsArizonaArchitectureHomesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Talk about bouncing back: this new show is the opposite of that epic fail, a deliriously enjoyable hour of comedy meets magic meets more of the real Mohammed than we’ve ever before seen on stage. That’s a surprise, given he’s in character as his alter ego, the camp and bumptious northern know-it-all Mr Swallow. But the persona is more porous than before, transforming into Mohammed before our eyes – as if this were a coming out party for a comedian who has remained incognito until now.For long-term watchers of theTed Lassoman, that could hardly be more fascinating – the more so because Mohammed tells us it’s strategic, that he’s been compelled to get personal for careerist reasons. There’s a racial dimension to that, too, which he endlessly teases in Show Pony, replaying an encounter with a TV producer demanding Mohammed’s sitcom pitch be more ethnic, and offering up a fantastically twisty sketch about his supposedly white right foot.Ted Lasso’s Nick Mohammed: ‘I didn’t think about comedy seriously until doing a PhD in seismology’Read moreSo are we getting a glimpse of the real Mohammed? Or is he just giving us what the culture requires to hear? The 44-year-old makes that zone of uncertainty hilariously his own this evening, in a show mixing autobiography, self-abasement and the memory and mentalism tricks that have long been among his specialties. The teacher who inspired Mr Swallow is brought unforgettably back to life in a flashback to young Nick’s classroom. Mohammed’s skit-gone-wrong at last year’s Baftas is recalled with a cringe. And there’s some casually mind-blowing stuff with a Rubik’s Cube and a pack of cards – even if a lie detection stunt (by a man soon to appear on Celebrity Traitors) is sabotaged by a tipsy audience member.You could argue there are several discrete shows in here, pulling in opposing directions. But that’s partly the point of this fantastic offering, which both dramatises the tension between the different acts Nick Mohammed could be, and delights us with all of them.Touringuntil 11 NovemberExplore more on these topicsComedyMagicTheatreTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Once nestled in the arms of Nato, now alarmingly alone, we have no choice but to embrace neighbours we shunned. Thanks to Vladimir Putin, (nearly) all Europeans now see clearly what was always the case. In danger we need each other, never mindfishor dynamic alignment.But talking about less important things was always the British way. So headlines and the Today programme bang on about the12-year continuanceof the fishing deal struck by Boris Johnson, allowing French boats into our waters. It’s hard on fishing communities, but not worse than before. The Brexiters used and cheated fishers. But a government has to weigh up winners and losers when fishing contributes just0.03% to UK GDPand10,000 jobs. Now set that against the 2.5% of GDP we spendon defencewith 164,000 jobs. As the pathway opens up for British defence industries to bid for contracts from the giant €150bn EU defence fund, that’s altogether another kettle of fish.But there we go again, at risk of making the same old remainer mistakes we made last time. Economics be damned when an implausible picture of Nigel Farage grinning at the cameras with abox of fishas he floated down the Thames tapped more deeply into mythic memories of ancient Britain ruling the waves and sou’wester-clad fishers than any spreadsheets of GDP figures. He is straight out there now claiming this deal “will be the end of the fishing industry”, alongside those shouts of “surrender” and “total capitulation”. Oh dear, out pops the Tory lord Stuart Rose, former Marks & Spencer head, calling that “nonsense”: he was the disastrous leader of theofficial remain campaign.This is the question: will this “reset” get the old war cries going, reopening the terrible times that split the country in half, broke families, turned friends into enemies? It still runs deep enough for pollsters to rely on leave/remain as a key voter identifier. Labour remainers were stricken by the allegation that they had lost any connection with working-class, non-graduate, left-behinders they thought they had championed all their lives, bringing grief to the very people bound to suffer most from Brexit’s damage. How could they? Labour has been paralysed by Brexit red lines, and so the Liberal Democrats, who never identified with the workers anyway, sweep up remainer votes with apledge to rejoin. (They are Labour’s danger now, of which more later.)Labour will carefully avoid popping remainer corks, though this deal is remarkably good for Britain, setting us on a path to repair colossal Brexit losses. Just hold on to this one figure: the Office for Budget Responsibility says that without Brexit Britain’s GDP would be4% higher. Imagine what we could do with that, when every percentage point isworth another £25.6bn.Yes, I know, those are more remainer numbers, but amid the direst squeeze on everything, with a horrendous spending round coming up shortly, most people know those numbers convert into real things – GP and dentist appointments, benefits for children and disabled people, reopening those hundreds ofclosed swimming pools, lost playing fields andshut libraries, and filling all the potholes. These losses, which I chronicle in the bookThe Only Way is Up, co-written with David Walker, are the baseline inheritance from which to judge Labour over the next few years. This EU deal is most likely to start yielding results first, while sustainable energy offers more hope; new towns or1.5m more homeswill take time. The very fact of easing cross-Channel trade should speed investment into Britain, brightening our prospects.Eurovision results suggest we are not loved: Erasmus and youth exchange will open doors and maybe hearts. But to make this an experience for all, the government must dash to set up exchange programmes not as class-bound opportunities for the university half, but as the chance for apprenticeships, BTec courses and craft-skill experiences around Europe. Labour is alert to making EU links relevant to every household: no queues atpassport e-gates; sharing data on crime, terror and traffickers; more jobs; cheaper food; pet passports and selling our sausages.From fishing to Erasmus: what the UK’s deal with the EU will meanRead moreBut there is more to be done. TheBrexitomertà has to end here. Labour cannot continue the Blair/Brown mistake of refusing to talk of European values. There were good signs today as Keir Starmer and Ursula von der Leyen spoke not just of policy but of common political and social values, with democracy everywhere under threat. The EU has its fifth column to fight off from within – as Romania just did, with Poland and Portugal at the polls – resisting the threat of the Hungarian/Slovakian pro-Russian right.That’s our fight, too. Starmer needs to take this beyond one day’s news and make bold speeches about this welcome EU friendship. He may find he gains respect for telling the truth about what Brexit has done to us, confronting head-on those who misled the country into Brexit calamity. The boot is on his foot, so kick hard, when only30% of voterssay Britain was right to leave, and just 11% that it has gone well. A good 64% are on his side, wanting closer EU relations: that casts the right wing on the wrong side. Here’s the best weapon against Farage, the man to blame for this fiasco, and it’s a death-dealer against the expiring Tories.This is about defence of the realm, real danger, for which Starmer should raise defence bonds. Patriotism demands closer alliances. Those who raised the Brexit spectre of a “European army” as the ultimate EU shocker are now stranded on the beaches and Starmer’s “Britain is back on the world stage” is a good rebuke to them.Labour’s political self-interest rests with stopping the exodus of support to the rejoining parties, the Lib Dems and the Greens.

Britain is crying out for bold, transformative policy-makingMon 19 May 2025 12.10 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 12.21 EDTShareJust why has Keir Starmer’s government proved such a catastrophe? This is a question that must be posed to his cheerleaders, or at least those who were at one time cheerleaders: the road from the last general election is lined with silently discarded pompoms. The idea here is not to rub their faces in a political project that is now both electorally toxic and morally bankrupt, but to determine what happens next.First off, the failure should be considered absolute. It is projected that aLabour governmentwill drive more than a million Britons into – or more deeply into – poverty through an assault on disability benefits. The same government imposed hardship on many pensioners by stripping away thewinter fuel payment, and it refuses to reverse the Tories’ two-child benefit cap, the UK’sbiggest single generator of child poverty. Not content with waging war on the poor only at home, the government opened a new front abroad by slashing the international aid budget. It alsocan’t bring itself to condemn Israel for a single crime – including deliberate starvation – and continues to supply crucial components forF-35 jet fightersto rain more death on Gaza’s traumatised survivors. The government not only demonises immigration and promotes punitive crackdowns, but it also echoes therhetoric of Enoch Powell. It does all of this while its polling collapses to the low 20s, withNigel Farage’s Reform UKparty boasting a 10-point lead over it in one poll.Did Starmer’s supporters expect such an agenda – one as gruesomely reactionary as it is bereft of an obvious electoral base of support? Did they believe it would prove so devoid of principle as to allow Farage to dictate the national political conversation before they’d even completed one year in power? The real problem is clearly this: Starmer, an empty vessel who wanted to be prime minister for its own sake, made a pact with the most cartoonishly Blairite factionalists that Labour has to offer. They sought to apply the political formula of Tony Blair’s government when it was falling apart in the mid-2000s to a completely different context some 20 years later.One of the main problems is that the Blairism of the mid-2000s was more about vibes than substance. When New Labour first assumed office, its project of humanising Thatcherism at least meantsomething – and the minimum wage, tax credits and public sector investment clearly reduced hardship and improved lives. The party could even show moralleadership, equalising the age of consent andabolishing section 28despite polling at the time showing vast opposition to both – alas, trans people today enjoy no such political courage.But by New Labour’s third term, the government had become more about defining itself against progressives than anything else. Having already infuriated many naturalLabourvoters by helping George W Bush set Iraq on fire, Blairism became about relishing that it wasangering, say, trade unions by extending market dogma into public services, or defenders of civil liberties with authoritarian crackdowns. The more anyone deemed leftish squealed, New Labour advisers believed, the more they were on the right track.In truth, New Labour’s success at the time depended on a mirage. It could maintain social peace with rising living standards and improved public services thanks to an unsustainable dependence on big finance. As it was, that approach was already running out of road before Lehman Brothers went pop: four years before the big crash, theincomes of the bottom halfof the population began to stagnate, and for the bottom quintile actually started to fall. So began what became known as the cost of living crisis. This is what has driven our age of discontent – from Brexit to Scottish nationalism to Corbynism.After the crash, and out of power, New Labour’s acolytes had nothing to say. They became arsonists, defining themselves purely against the party’s new masters. Ed Miliband sought to grapple with the fact that the world was changing, but the ideas were lacking. In the 2015 leadership election, the Labour right’s barren political cupboard was devastatingly exposed. Jeremy Corbyn assumed the leadership by a landslide precisely because his opponents were bereft of ideas, whereas the left sought to abandon the stifling straitjacket of austerity. The Blairite candidate, Liz Kendall, offered a pitch that could hardly have been better designed to antagonise Labour supporters: combining cuts to the welfare state with more arms spending. Remind you of anybody?UK’s F-35 exports more important than stopping genocide, lawyers to argueRead moreKendall’s campaign manager, Morgan McSweeney, seemingly learned not to make that mistake again as he drove Starmer’s brazen conning of the Labour membership in 2020. The problem was this: the Labour right had half a decade in exile to produce a new prospectus. It came up with nothing. It dedicated all its energy to burning Corbynism to the ground regardless of the damage that would inflict on the party. (Recall Lord Mandelson, now ambassador to the US, saying in 2017 that he tried to undermine Corbyn’s leadership “every single day”.) Labour did not win in 2017, as we are constantly reminded, but a rational party would have understood that the surge from 30% to 40% of the vote share in just two years after a drubbing was driven above all else by a transformative policy offer.But the truth is, late-stage Blairism applied to the Britain of 2025 could never be anything other than a disaster. Labour’s ruling faction knows how to destroy but not how to build. Starmer’s original true believers seemed to believe that a general sense of competence was sufficient. But what was really needed wasn’t the “grownups back in the room” – it was a transformative policy agenda to replace a broken system that has stopped delivering social progress. And if that isn’t understood, then don’t be surprised when a Labour government defined by increasing poverty and immigrant-bashing comes crashing down in ignominy.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Others blame the police. But ultimately, the Crown Prosecution Service has questions to answerMon 19 May 2025 14.24 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 16.01 EDTShareEarlier this month, Nicola Packer was found not guilty of illegally terminating a pregnancy, after taking abortion pills beyond the legal limit of 10 weeks. She had spent more than four years living in the shadow of this prosecution, every detail of which –as reported by Phoebe Davis– is completely harrowing. In 2020, Packer was arrested before she left Chelsea and Westminster hospital, still bleeding from major surgery.View image in fullscreenNicola Packer.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianPacker is one of six women to be prosecuted for this crime inEnglandsince the end of 2022, under the Offences Against the Person Act, which had previously only been used in such cases three times since its introduction in 1861. Even that striking, inexplicable figure doesn’t begin to describe how many people have fallen victim to these prosecutions. There have been cases of women denied contact with their children while police investigated a charge that came to nothing. A teenager who had a late miscarriage was arrested in front of her entire street – her privacy, her education, her peace of mind completely destroyed.The consequences are so dire if you get caught in this net that informed women would rightly think twice about being honest with healthcare professionals – so quality of care is undermined for everyone. And while attempts are being made in parliament to take abortion legislation out of criminal law altogether, so that no woman is ever prosecuted in this intrusive and barbaric way in the future, as things stand at the moment, the situation is getting more perilous for women, not less.The case of Nicola Packer tells us this: Britain is shamed by its abortion laws – and must change them | Jonathan LordRead moreCampaigners in the field – notably Jonathan Lord, who is co-chair of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists abortion taskforce, and Hayley Webb, co-chair of Doctors for Choice UK – believe that some midwives and nurses are mistaken or confused about their duty of patient confidentiality.Abortionproviders such as the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) wonder whether the emergency measures taken during Covid – to allow abortion pills to be prescribed remotely, rather than in person – have ushered in new anxiety around women’s autonomy.Last December the National Police Chiefs’ Council issued new guidance on “child death investigation”, advising that women’s devices be checked for period tracker apps, Google searches, any communications that might “establish a woman’s knowledge and intention in relation to the pregnancy”. WhenHampshire police found a human placenta in woodland in 2023, they asked BPAS for a full list of women who had made inquiries about a termination and then disengaged. BPAS was astonished by the request – it could have swept in hundreds of women, and didn’t even have the legitimacy of a court order.‘I was right to be frightened’: Nicola Packer on the humiliation and trauma of her trial for illegal abortionRead moreSometimes it is the police that seem overzealous, as in Packer’s case; the Crown Prosecution Service wanted to drop it, and the Met successfully appealed that decision. Ultimately, though, it would be far-fetched to try to chase down a new anti-abortion tendency in assorted police forces. If there are increasing numbers of investigations and prosecutions, which there are, it is for the director of public prosecutions for England and Wales to explain why.Two years ago, I sought that explanation from the then DPP, Max Hill KC. The most formulaic response came back: he said he had “a duty to ensure that laws set by parliament are properly considered and applied when making difficult charging decisions”. This law having been in place for more than 150 years, further explanation would have been helpful as to why that duty had become so pressing after 2020.Hill was succeeded the same year by Stephen Parkinson, who is now being urged by campaigners to do a more robust public interest test on cases like Packer’s. Many women’s groups question whether there is ever a public interest case for prosecuting a woman under these circumstances.It remains unknown what is driving these prosecutions, between an excess of caution post-Covid, a new wave of cultural misogyny finding its expression in reproductive surveillance, and a failure of institutional memory on the part of some healthcare workers as to what their duties are to their patients – or all these factors and more in some tangled feedback loop. Whatever the cause, everyone must now do their bit. Parliamentarians musttake abortion out of the criminal law altogether, and the law itself, in the meantime, must rediscover its proportionality and reason.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsWomenOpinionAbortionWomen's healthReproductive rightsEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

Both in terms of rebalancing the relationship between the US and the region, and in scrambling perceptions. In Riyadh, he told the Saudi royals there would be no more “lectures on how to live”. He lifted sanctions on Syria so that the country may have a “fresh start”, and hefawned over the camelsand lavish architecture (“as a construction guy,”he said at one Qatari palace, “this is perfect marble”). Never has Trump appeared more in his element, surrounded by the wealth of sovereigns, the marshalling power of absolute monarchies, and their calculated self-orientalisation and over-the-top flattery.The same man who enacted the Muslim ban in his first term wasstrolling around mosquesandshrugging off the radical path to powerof the Syrian president: “Handsome guy … Tough past, but are you gonna put a choir boy in that position?” His call for recognising the new role of Gulf states both as political and economic powerhouses, and matter-of-factly taking their lead on what Syria needs right now, whatever the history, is excruciating. Because it reveals how painfully sclerotic and inconsistent previous administrations were. Joe Biden promised to take a hard line with the Saudi government for its role in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and in the Yemen war, and then seemed toforget about it, or realised he couldn’t follow through. From Trump, there is no such mixed signalling: you are rich, we need you. You do you.The Democrats lectured while abjectly failing to enforce the standards of international law. Trump is dispensing with the pretence of international law altogether, and in doing so ending the theatre that the US was ever some virtuous protagonist in the region. The result is a transactionalism of equals, thebillion dollar dealsand quid pro quos cut in plain sight. For the three Gulf countries that Trump visited, Qatar, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, Trump’s recognition of their colossal national projects in economic transformation, and political positioning in terms of foreign policy, slaked an appetite to be seen. To be acknowledged not just as wealthy ignoramuses to be managed, but sophisticated power brokers in their own right.There is a particular brand, that is still being finessed, of shaping politics in the region and diversifying from natural resources. Take the UAE’s financing of adevastating war in Sudanin order to get a foothold on the African continent, and, at the other end of the spectrum, Qatar’s quiet emergence as thenegotiating capital of the world.What is clear is that the centre of gravity is shifting for the US away from European capitals and transatlantic alliances, towards a region that, as far as Trump is concerned, is not bothering him with any moral condemnations on Ukraine, doesn’t have the pesky matter of a voting public to worry about, and has spare billions to invest and flamboyantly flatter. Keir Starmer can have a good stab at getting Trump on side by offering a “historic” royal invitation for a state visit, but can heproject the stars and stripeson the world’s tallest building?But there is a fundamental disjuncture to Trump’s trip that was apparent in parts of Middle Eastern state media and political pronouncements last week. As Israel intensified its strikes in Gaza, signifying its lack of interest in negotiating any meaningful ceasefire, there was arising clamourin condemnation of the assault. As Trump was received with US flag waving, one stark issue could not be broached – that he leads the country that is supplying the weapons and political support for a military campaign that is destabilising the region.It was a disconnect that characterised the entire trip. Among all the emphatic language and imagery of a bloc of rising powers, the question remained of what exactly that power could be used for. Is it purely one that gives these states the right to supercharge their economies through more favourable trading relationships with the US? And gives them licence to pursue foreign policy escapades and projects on their own turf without fear of censure or “lecturing”? Or is it power that can be wielded to meaningfully influence political outcomes and persuade the US to change course on Israel-Palestine, an issue that now lies at the heart of not only Middle Eastern but Arab politics.The war has now extended to Lebanon and Syria, Jordan and Egypt are under extreme pressure, and even in ostensibly unchallenged monarchies, it is a public opinion and PR hot potato that needs to be handled very carefully. Trump is still shopping his ethnic cleansing plan that aims to “resettle” people from Gaza,this time to Libya, and the momentum of the early days of his administration to secure a ceasefire is now gone, as Israel intensifies its campaign tooccupy more parts of Gaza. As lavish scenes unfolded across the Gulf, and Trump commented on the quality of marble, there was one unavoidable thought – no food, water or medicinehas been allowed into Gaza for months.The question of the limits of this new US deference is crucial in correctly estimating what just happened. Because even though it looked as if something historic took place, that Trump had blown away the cobwebs of old foreign policy in the region, broken with orthodoxies, and made overtures that overturn decades-old tropes and perceptions, it may all still come to nothing where it matters most. If these forces still have no ability to dictate what happens in their own back yards, no ability to stabilise and determine the region’s political future, or indeed, assume the mantle of leadership in which they have the power and responsibility to save other Arabs from hunger, displacement and bullying, then it’s all elaborate theatre with a measure of economic windfall. No lecturing is nice, but being the master of your own fate is all that really matters.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Will England listen?Rhiannon Lucy CosslettOlder relatives might roll their eyes at this generation’s approach, but it is overdue in a country where smacking is still legalMon 19 May 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 12.25 EDTShareAnew trend is circulating on social media where adults ask their children to complete some of the toxic parenting phrases they remember from their own childhoods. Sayings such as “I’ll give you something to ... [cry about]”; “children are to be … [seen and not heard]”, and “I brought you into this world … [and I can take you out of it]” are reconfigured by a new generation of little kids who have been raised in more loving and respectful ways.“I’ll give you something to …” one parent asks, as their child replies “help you with”. “Children are to be … children” and “I brought you into this world and … made you happy”. It’s powerfully moving, seeing how this generation of parents are trying their best to break the cycle of abuse that has frequently masqueraded as discipline over previous decades.And for good reason. Being shouted atcan alter a child’s brain, and the mental health consequences of having hostile, demeaning or humiliating words used against you in childhood can be lifelong. “[Verbal abuse] can profoundly shape our sense of self and whether we feel lovable and confident in navigating an unpredictable world,” Prof Eamon McCrory, chief executive of the mental health charity Anna Freud, told MPs last month. “As a clinical psychologist, I see in my clients how childhood messages – both negative and positive – shape who they become.”Reading this makes me feel even worse about the few times I have raised my voice in frustration with my son, but parents have to wrestle with these debates all the time, not to mention reflect on their actions even years later. This month,Michelle Obama admitted that she used to smack her daughters. “It took a couple of spankings for me to be like, yeah, you know what, this is a little kid and the fact that I can’t think of any better way to get my point across than to smack somebody on the butt, I felt embarrassed,” she said.I admire her for speaking out, and for not using the sort of self-justifying language that many adults now do when reflecting on how they punished their children. I’ve heard many victims of such punishments minimise them, too. Whenever anyone says: “I was smacked, and it didn’t do me any harm,” I always think: “But it did, because you are standing there, saying those words, justifying what is ultimately a cruel and abusive act against a child.” The idea that people who love us and try to do their best by us can also sometimes hurt us is a very difficult thing to contend with.Older people sometimes roll their eyes at this generation’s gentle parenting methods – the phrase “you’re making a rod for your own back” is deployed to the point where it’s become a cliche – but like it or not, the shift to more child-centred methods is a backlash to the kind of stern parenting that came before. I wasn’t raised being shouted at, or hit – but lots of my peers were. That smacking continues to be legal in England and Northern Ireland (it is illegal in Scotland and Wales) never ceases to pain and surprise me. This is despite multiple calls from charities, children’s rights experts and,most recently, leading paediatriciansto make it unlawful.Smacking a child is just an act of violence. Why do England and Northern Ireland still allow it? | Frances RyanRead moreThere will no doubt be those who are reading this who feel uncomfortable with what I am saying about punishment. Some of you will feel guilty, and others perhaps, angry. I expect some of you may feel even more uncomfortable about what I am going to say next, which is that verbal and physical punishment are a children’s rights issue. “Smacking is one of the very few things in parenting where you can say absolutely 100% this is not good for children, either children in the future, or in terms of how it makes children feel now,” says Eloise Rickman, the author of It’s Not Fair, a manifesto for children’s rights. Children’s rights experts use the term adultism to describe the ways in which adults deploy power and rules against children. It’s a concept that many adults find highly challenging, but when you open your mind to it you realise how conditioned we are to treat children as “less than”, and how normal we feel it is for adults to have full control over children. Children hate to be shouted at and smacked. It upsets and frightens them. But how often in a discussion about it do we hear their voices? How often are their thoughts and opinions centred?Rickman believes thatEnglandis an especially inhospitable country when it comes to parents and children, and I agree with her. It isn’t just the pressures that parents are under – from housing to childcare – but the way our communities respond when parents and children are out in public. If you live in a place where, if your child starts crying, you receive sympathetic and supportive looks and comments, offers to help, and expressions of solidarity, you are much less likely to become stressed and raise your voice, or feel that you have to “perform discipline” than you will in a place where you’ll get tuts and judgmental comments. Parenting in the UK can often feel more like the latter than the former. I’m still not sure why: is it a legacy of Victorian values? A stiff upper lip thing?View image in fullscreenA family having fun drawing at home. Posed by models.Photograph: Santiago Nunez/StocksyWhatever it is, we need a fundamental shift, and that requires knotty conversations beyond just “we should ban smacking”, which of course should be illegal. There needs to be a debate about how we can best support parents, and what it means to live in a society that values children, as opposed to one where the idea of children’s rights is treated as a bit of a joke. Why is it assumed that our voices matter more than those of children, that we should be the ones in power? The UK has signed up to the UN convention on the rights of the child, but we haven’t embedded it into English law. We should examine why that is.As we speak, Rickman and I get talking about Italy, a famously child-friendly place where a crying child would be more likely to solicit the sort of solidarity I mentioned earlier, and how their child-centred Reggio Emilia educational approach arose as a direct response to fascism. In the context of the global rise of the far-right, perhaps it’s worth thinking about how anti-fascism begins at home, with the most vulnerable group of people of all, and how living anti-authoritarian values means not forcing children to be obedient, shouting at, or hitting them.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSocietyOpinionChildrenEnglandNorthern IrelandCorporal punishmentcommentShareReuse this content"

An annualised rate of $600m was large but you can understand why: Canadian whisky and Mexican tequila are big sellers for Diageo into the US.ThusMonday’s number of $150m, after a few more spins of Trump’s tariff dial, could almost be considered cheery news. This one is for a full 12 months, note, and the makeup has changed entirely. The original 25% Canadian and Mexican tariffs have gone (at least on the latest iteration) but 10% on UK and EU exports to the US have entered the frame. Bad news for Guinness and scotch whisky, where Diageo’s well-stocked cabinet is led by Johnnie Walker, but the overall picture for the group is better. And Diageo thinks it will be able to “mitigate” about half of the impact permanently.Cue an outbreak of relief in the share price? Not really. The stock has performed no worse than other international drinks groups in the past three months but is still lower than it was in February and, crucially, is still 40% below its post-pandemic party-time highs from early 2022.That is evidence that the hangover from chief executive Debra Crew’sthumping profits warning in November 2023, caused by overstocking in Latin America, has yet to clear. The whole spirits market globally is in a soft patch, but investors remain a long way from trusting Diageo again. In February, when the group scrapped its longstanding target of shooting for “medium-term” organic sales growth of 5% to 7%, it was because nobody believed the figure would be hit any time soon.In that context, Monday’s pledge to find $500m of cost savings and achieve $3bn of free cashflow every year from 2026 represent the start of a repair job with investors. Neither ambition seems especially challenging in the context of a group with high gross margins and annual sales of $20bn but, given Diageo’s recent reputation, it is probably best to set targets that are seen as likely to be met.The intriguing mixer was the promise of disposals “above and beyond smaller brands”. What does that mean? Not Guinness, it is safe to assume. But the definitions were left vague. The last rump of the east African spirits business? The local Chinese spirits operation? The Indian Premier League cricket franchise, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, owned by Diageo’s majority-owned Indian subsidiary? All might be considered odd fits if you’re to sell a story of corporate leanness to the City but admit that it could take until 2028 to get debt ratios into the desired range.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Monday’s quarterly revenue number was strong, but was plainly inflated by US wholesalers trying to get ahead of tariffs. In the long term, Diageo ought to be fine: tariffs get absorbed, the portfolio of brands is strong, and cost efficiencies, if done properly, should keep the profits line moving faster than the sales line. But, given the turmoil of the past couple of years, the market wants to see it happen. Diageo is not there yet.Explore more on these topicsBusinessNils Pratley on financeDiageoFood & drink industrycommentShareReuse this content"

When Jaouad’s leukaemia returned last year, well-wishers urged her to live each day like it was her last, but the pressure tocarpeeach second of every damndiemleft her feeling panicked and exhausted. Instead, she cultivated a sense of freshly hatched curiosity and playfulness, which she says helped.I loved this, but doubted the feasibility – can you really convince your tired, cynical self to feel joyful astonishment? I tried living yesterday as if it were my first; not like an actual newborn (red-faced, frequently crying, utterly incompetent – I’m all that already), but with childlike wonder. I had some success being captivated by my breakfast banana – great design and colour – and even more with the magical elixir that makes me not hate everyone (coffee).Then I opened the postbox with Christmas-stocking levels of anticipation: a window cleaner’s card and an HMRC letter about Making Tax Digital! After lunch, confronted with our dishwasher’s habit of popping open whenever I try to shut it, I attempted to cultivate curiosity rather than rage: surely this helpful marvel has its reasons? What might they be? I was left no wiser but marginally calmer.Living a dental hygienist appointment as if it were my first proved more challenging: my body remembered this was not my first scratchy hook and humiliation rodeo, whatever my brain tried to tell it. But a sense of playful discovery did help, sort of. I distracted myself beforehand, flicking in wide-eyed amazement through tooth makeovers in the waiting room brochure. Then, in the chair, I surrendered, childlike, to the transporting strangeness of cold gritty stuff blasting my molars, my tongue getting accidentally sucked into the spit-hoover and what I chose to tell myself was the “intensely interesting sensation” of manual plaque removal.I wouldn’t call it a joy, exactly, but it was absolutely less of an ordeal.

In several key areas, the agreement announced in London on Monday is really a commitment to have more meetings at which negotiators will try to make more agreements.On the issue ofvisas for young peopleand the UK’s mooted return to the Erasmus university-exchange scheme, there is little clarity beyond the rebranding of “youth mobility” as “experience”. A decision on the level of fees that European students must pay has also been booted forward. So have some details of how the UK will work with the bloc on policing and security, including the use of controversial facial-recognition technology in tackling drug and people smuggling across borders.Increased cooperation on defence is significant and timely, given the ramping up of geopolitical instability under Donald Trump – although British arms businesses will have to go on pushing for access to the EU’s £150bn fund. Onfood and fishing, terms have been decided. Fewer checks on exports, including meat, will benefit UK food producers, particularly the smaller ones that were worst affected by Brexit. For Europeans, mainly the French, the big win is a 12-year agreement on fishing in British waters.The 41% of UK goods exported to the EU, worth £358bn, aremore than is sent to the US and India combined– making this by far the most important of this month’s trade deals. Though the UK remains outside the customs union, and regulations governing other goods including medicines have not been relaxed, the new measures mark a significant easing of trade.By contrast, the new dispensation for UK travellers to join European passport queues, and looser rules about pets, are more about style than substance. But while conveniences like these will not bring theeconomic benefitsthat Sir Keir seeks, they do send a signal. For ministers, any hint of an interest in rejoining the EU remains taboo. Instead, this modest scaling back of Tory-erected barriers is designed to show voters that his is a rational and responsible government that puts the interests of British businesses and consumers first.It should not have taken nine years since the referendum to reach this point. A group of around 60 Labour MPs is rightly pushing for the government to be more ambitious, emboldened by polling showing thatmost voters now think Brexit was a mistake. Free movement, however, remains a red line, and one inked in all the more vividly after the strong showing of Reform UK in recent local elections and national polls. Given the weakness of the economy, Sir Keir may yet come to rue his decision to capitulate to anti-immigration sentiment, rather than counter it.Among disappointing omissions is the lack of a mechanism to maketouring by musiciansand other artists easier. But after the damaging rhetoric surrounding last week’s immigration announcement, Sir Keir’s upbeat tone was a step forward, even though he overstated the actual gains.Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, was more accurate when she spoke of this week’s deal as “framing” an improved future relationship. If Sir Keir wants to effectively unpick the damage done to the country since Brexit, he will have to paint a picture of why an outward-looking, interconnected UK is more likely to succeed.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But elsewhere in Europe, the far right continues to flourishMon 19 May 2025 13.59 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 14.30 EDTShareAs Romanians voted on Sunday in arguably the most consequential election in the country’s post-communist history, Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, will have been preparing to welcome a fellow disruptor to the European stage. The first round of a controversiallyre-runpresidential contest had been handsomelywonby George Simion, a Eurosceptic ultranationalist who views Donald Trump as a “natural ally” and opposes military aid to Ukraine. On the back of a 20-point lead, Mr Simion, a 38-year-old former football ultra with a taste for violent rhetoric, was so confident of winning that he made aconfrontationalvisit to Brussels in the last days of his campaign.Those expectations were confounded in remarkable fashion at the weekend. In a dramatic reversal of fortunes, Nicușor Dan, the centrist mayor of Bucharest, benefited from the highest voter turnout in 30 years to triumph comfortably. One of the first foreign leaders tocongratulateMr Dan was a relieved Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who, in Hungary and Slovakia, already has to contend with two Putin-friendly governments on Ukraine’s western border.First and foremost, the stability promised by Mr Dan’s victory is good news forRomania, which has been in political turmoil since the original presidential election was cancelled amid allegations of Russian interference. Having made his name as a politically independent anti-corruption campaigner, he must now attempt to unite a deeply polarised country in which inequality, graft and poor public services have proved to be, as elsewhere, a launchpad for far-right populist insurgents.More broadly, the size of the second-round turnout – which included a huge diaspora vote – suggests that hitching a ride on the Trump bandwagon is as liable to motivate a mainstream backlash in Europe as generate Maga-style momentum. Given the global volatility unleashed by Mr Trump’s reckless, bullying style, and the dark shadow cast over eastern Europe by Vladimir Putin’s geopolitical ambitions, the strategic attractions of hugging the EU and Nato close are more readily apparent than they used to be. Handed the opportunity to turn east, a substantial majority of Romanian voters looked west.Elsewhere though, on a “super Sunday” of three European elections, outcomes were more ambivalent and less uplifting from a progressive perspective. The centre also held in Poland, where the liberal mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski,narrowlywon the first round of another crucial presidential election, ahead of the nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki. But the high combined vote for hard- and far-right candidates suggests that result may be reversed in two weeks’ time. One and a half years after Donald Tusk wasgivena prime ministerial mandate to bring Poland back into the European mainstream, Eurosceptic ultranationalism remains a force to be reckoned with.In Portugal, a snap election triggered by the centre-right governing party saw it retain power, but wasnotablemainly for the record number of votes cast for the far-right Chega party. Postal ballots could yet propel Chega to second place, ahead of the Socialist party, after a dismal night for the Portuguese left.Mr Dan’s famous victory was undoubtedly the story of the night, confounding a narrative of an inexorable rightwards shift in central and eastern Europe. But amid anongoingcost of living crisis, and as mainstream parties echo far-right agendas on migration, the politics of Europe continue to feel anxious, polarised and alarmingly unpredictable.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But against a Brighton team still desperate to qualify for Europe next season, the Dutchman and his side were brought back down to earth as Jack Hinshelwood’s late winner with his first touch off the bench sealed a memorable comeback for Fabian Hürzeler’s side.It was no more than the hosts deserved after twice falling behind to goals from Harvey Elliott and Dominik Szoboszlai, with Yasin Ayari and then another substitute – Kaoru Mitoma – equalising acrobatically to spark a frantic finale. Slot had no complaints as Mohamed Salah endured a night to forget in front of goal and Trent Alexander-Arnold looked relieved that he didn’t even get on the pitch after beingbooed by his own fanslast week. Brighton can now travel to Tottenham on the final day knowing that their fate is in their own hands having edged ahead of Brentford in the race for eighth spot.Brighton 3-2 Liverpool: Premier League – live reactionRead moreQualifying for the Conference League still relies on results elsewhere but this was a stirring response as Liverpool were beaten having led a match at half-time for the first time since December 2016, a run of 156 games. “I was pleased with the togetherness we showed,” a delighted Hürzeler said.Slot’s players would probably rather have still been on the beach in Dubai after their exertions this season. Federico Chiesa looked rusty as he was finally handed his first league start of the season after joining last summer, although Liverpool could have been out of sight had Salah taken a golden opportunity at the start of the second half.“We saw how close the margins can be if we are missing two or three per cent,” Slot, whose side have now scored in every away game for the first time ever in a league campaign, said. “We’ve been very close with every team we have played and that’s why it is such a big compliment that we have won the league so early.”View image in fullscreenDominik Szoboszlai celebrates after his cross-cum-shot flew over Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen to restore Liverpool’s lead.Photograph: Ian Walton/APThe Liverpool supporters did not seem too concerned about the result as they greeted the final whistle with jubilant scenes despite suffering a fourth league defeat of the campaign. They barely noticed Alexander-Arnold making a brief appearance on the pitch at the end before going down the tunnel ahead of his impending departure to Real Madrid.It had taken only nine minutes for his replacement’s name to be sung by the away end after a blistering start by the visitors. Conor Bradley was given acres of space after being picked out by Salah and driving into the area, with Elliott on hand to tap home.Having spent the weekend watching bitter rivals Crystal Palace win their first piece of major silverware, the Brighton supporters hadn’t been thrilled to see their players giving Liverpool their latest guard of honour. But Hürzeler’s side played their part in a high-tempo first half, even if Bradley should have doubled Liverpool’s lead when he was set up by Chiesa’s quick feet but the Northern Irishman dragged his shot wide.Kostas Tsimikas was fortunate to escape when Danny Welbeck’s header appeared to strike his hand as it was deflected just off target but there was no sign of any intervention from the video assistant referee.Brighton didn’t have to wait long for their equaliser as a lovely combination between Brajan Gruda and Ayari allowed the Sweden midfielder to deceive Alisson with a clever finish. Yet a lapse of concentration cost them on the stroke of half-time when no one picked up Szoboszlai from a quick free-kick and his cross-cum-shot flew into the top corner.Hürzeler looked less than happy as he disappeared down the tunnel and his side came out with renewed purpose after the break. Alisson produced a full-stretch save to tip away Welbeck’s free-kick before holding on to a stinging drive from Gruda as Yankuba Minteh waited to pounce.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The good thing for us is this hardly ever happens and, if it happens, you can be sure that he will score in the third game of the fourth game.”Welbeck had almost as good an opportunity at the other end following a sumptuous backheel from Gruda inside the area but his shot was straight at Alisson. That was the prompt for Slot to ring the changes just as Alexander-Arnold emerged to warm up for the first time before promptly taking his seat again. Darwin Núñez almost had an instant impact when he and Bradley set up Salah again but Bart Verbruggen made a sharp save.View image in fullscreenKaoru Mitoma fires in Brighton’s equaliser for 2-2.Photograph: Ian Walton/APInstead, it was a Brighton substitute who had the crucial impact as Mitoma lashed home after Alisson parried Welbeck’s drive into his path. The equaliser seemed to breathe new life into Hürzeler’s players.The hosts thought they had a penalty when Mats Wieffer went down in the box, before the goal by Hinshelwood – whose 17-year-old cousin Harry Howell was also brought on for his debut late on – was confirmed after an agonising wait for VAR to show Matt O’Riley was onside before he crossed the ball.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrighton & Hove AlbionLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In the days since, however, provenance has been raised as a problem.Farrell selected in his squad three players born in New Zealand, two in Australia and two in South Africa. Willie John McBride – a legend of five Lions tours – is apparently “bothered” by it and is not alone in expressing concerns at the number of foreign-born players in the 38-man squad.Mane event: Lions’ road to Australia begins with get-to-know-you coffeesRead moreAll seven are, of course, entirely eligible. Mack Hansenand Sione Tuipulotuwere born in Australia but qualified for Ireland and Scotland respectively via a parent or grandparent. Bundee Aki, Jamison Gibson-Park, James Lowe, Pierre Schoeman and Duhan van der Merwe all qualified on residency grounds. For the record, Marcus Smith was born in Manila and Joe McCarthy in Manhattan while Huw Jones was born in Leith, moved to the south of England as a child and spent his formative rugby years in South Africa.In short, nationality is a complex issue and each player has had their own journey towards a seat on the plane to Australia. Tuipulotu admits he “didn’t grow up dreaming of playing for Scotland or the Lions, that’s the truth,” before adding: “But this is where my path has led me.” He speaks of feeling the need to prove his allegiance and Lowe agrees. “Obviously when you don’t have the blood running through your veins, there is a little bit of that,” said Lowe.The merits of the residency rule have long since been debated and, when World Rugby extended the qualification period from three years to five, it felt like the admission of a loophole needing to be closed, or at least tightened. Certainly, the proliferation of “project players” has dried up since then.That Farrell’s selections have provoked criticism now should be met with unease, however. Hansen was the last of the seven players to make his Test debut three years ago and it is sanctimonious to suggest players with more than 300 Test appearances between them are not befitting the precious red jersey.View image in fullscreenMack Hansen pops up on the big screen during the Lions squad announcement.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters“When I play rugby, I play better when there is a chip on my shoulder anyway,” says Tuipulotu. “I’ve been nothing but embraced by the Scottish public since I’ve been playing for Scotland. There are always going to be a couple of people like there are for some of the Irish boys, but I take that in my stride because I don’t blame those people either. I’m looking forward to showing how committed I am to playing for the Lions with how I play and I can’t wait to get over there.”After making his comeback from a long-term pectoral injury last weekend, Tuipulotu is the frontrunner for the Test No 12 jersey in Australia. Before injury struck, he captained Scotland against the Wallabies last autumn and his grandmother, Jaqueline, who grew up outside Glasgow, flew over from Australia to take her place in the Murrayfield crowd.“In those early days, just to be completely transparent, you have that feeling of: ‘Am I part of this?’” Tuipulotu says. “When my gran came over before the Australia game, it allowed the public to put a face to the story, listen to how much it meant to her. I think that gave eyes to the public that my story is authentic.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2017 he lined up at full-back as the Māori All Blacks were well beaten by Gatland’s tourists in Rotorua. “I think everyone would admit that was their first actual Test match, the first one they properly turned up for,” Lowe says. “It was an introduction into what it actually meant to the boys playing for the Lions and a level of intensity that was unmatched.“When I was first selected for Ireland, all the people come out of the woodwork saying: ‘How is this person representing Ireland?’ But the rules are there. We’ve all done our time. I am fully embedded in the culture of Ireland. Sione’s captained Scotland. You don’t have to question where his allegiance lies. My old man walks around in an Ireland jersey and a Leinster jumper.“Everyone’s got a different story, my story just didn’t start in Ireland. But I can see it ending in Ireland.

Spurs have won nothing since the 2008 League Cup.“It will be a big thing, of course, because everybody knows that when you join Tottenham, you get the words through of: ‘Ah, you’re not going to win a trophy, you will be trophyless for the rest of your career,’” Van de Ven said. “All the guys that came up here were like: ‘We’re going to change something about this club.’“It was the gaffer and it was the whole squad who said: ‘We’re going to come here and change something.’ For us, it’s the job now to make this happen in Bilbao.”The bin fire strikes back: United and Spurs’ song for Europe is a bit of tasteless fun | Jonathan WilsonRead moreVan de Ven was asked who had told him he would never win anything after going to Spurs. “It’s these people on social media, you know?” the 24-year-old replied. “These banter people that you don’t take really serious. It did not play on my mind, not even a little bit.”The Dutch defender is among the many players who continue to fight for Postecoglou, who ison the brink of losing his jobafter 21 league defeats this season – the most in club history over a 38-game campaign.“We have all been standing behind the gaffer since day one, since he joined here,” Van de Ven said. “He showed his quality, he brought us to a European final. Of course, he’s getting a lot of doubt from the media and we see these things. But I think he proved all you guys wrong and we’re standing in a European final, so hopefully we can lift the trophy. Not only for us but also for him.“We all know we play for a big club. This club deserves trophies. That’s the truth. If you look at the quality in the squad, we deserve a trophy. It has been a tough season but we can end this perfectly by winning a prize.”View image in fullscreenMicky van de Ven says he has a ‘strong connection’ with Cristian Romero in the Spurs backline.Photograph: Dalton Bowden/ShutterstockPostecoglou’s hopes have been fired since Van de Ven and his other first-choice defensive selections returned from injury.

On the other side it’s the same – when I have the ball, he knows how to cover me.“From the beginning I felt a strong connection with him but the more games you play together the more you start feeling each other and knowing each other’s qualities.

She had lost against Kasatkina, who recently changed her allegiance to Australia, in each of their three previous meetings.Raducanu made a searing start by breaking her opponent in the opening game of the match. Despite being broken straight back, the 22-year-old proceeded to reel off the next five games to take the first set 6-1.The second set started in the same vein for Raducanu, who held serve and then broke to lead 2-0 and take her run of games to seven. Kasatkina quickly broke back, but five more breaks of serve in a row presented a chance for the Briton to serve for the match at 5-3.Raducanu found it anything but straightforward so close to the winning line, spurning her first two match points due to a crisp Kasatkina return, and then a backhand slice hit into the net. Kasatkina once again stepped up to save a third match point before Raducanu finally managed to get over the line at the fourth time of trying.“To bring that level here, I’m really proud,” Raducanu said in her on-court interview after the match. “I think as I spend more time on clay I’m starting to get to like it a little bit more, and I’m kind of building my relationship with the surface.”Having taken a late wildcard for the tournament, Raducanu will next face the American Danielle Collins, who defeated her compatriot Sofia Kenin in three sets.View image in fullscreenHarriet Dart was well beaten by Ukraine’s Anastasiia Sobolieva in French Open qualifying.Photograph: David Winter/ShutterstockHarriet Dartwas knocked out in the first round of French Open qualifying after being defeated 6-1, 6-2 by Anastasiia Sobolieva.

The last time England played a Test match against Zimbabwe, in 2003, Rob Key was in the middle order instead of the managing director’s job, Jimmy Anderson was a 20-year-old tearaway playing in his very first series, and the England and WalesCricketBoard was just about to launch the world’s very first professional Twenty20 tournament. Zimbabwean cricket has changed, too. Back then the team was in the earliest stages of a transformation that was meant to turn cricket from a minority game, played by the small white population, into a sport that better represented the whole country.They have been hard years, riven by player strikes, political interference, maladministration and a miserable drop-off in results. The team temporarily withdrew from Test cricket, suspended their domestic competition and were repeatedly censured by the International Cricket Council. They lost so many players through emigration to England, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, that even now you could build a hell of a good Zimbabwean squad out of people who are making a living overseas. And yet, at the end of it all, the process was, by one important measure, a success. The squad that came on tour in 2003 was majority white, the team that has come this year is majority black.Blast from the past: Zimbabwe are finally coming in from the coldRead more“Despite all the politics, despite all the chaos that we’ve been through, cricket is now a national game,” says David Coltart, “supported by an overwhelming majority of Zimbabweans, black and white and other races.” Coltart is the elected mayor of Bulawayo, a white man elected in a mostly black city. He has spent his life navigating the bitter, heated, complicated politics of his country. He has been fighting for the Zimbabwe he believes in ever since the 1990s, first as a founding member of the Movement for Democratic Change and a key figure in the opposition to Robert Mugabe, then as minister for education and sport in Morgan Tsvangirai’s coalition government.More than five million people have emigrated from the country in that time. Coltart is one of the ones who stayed. “I believe in Zimbabwe with a passion,” he says, “I believe in its people and its future, and I believe it is a country worth fighting for.”View image in fullscreenDavid Coltart: ‘I believe in Zimbabwe with a passion.’Photograph: Zinyange Auntony/AFP/Getty ImagesWhen Andy Flower and Henry Olonga made their public protest against “the death of democracy” in their country in 2003, it was Coltart they asked to help draft their statement. “My sadness is that Henry and Andy didn’t stay in the country,” he says, “because they remain hugely influential figures. It’s not a criticism. I understand why they felt compelled to leave. But we need figures like them.” He mourns Heath Streak, who did stay, butwho died in 2023. “Heath provided inspiration to people on both sides of the argument. He was a white man who was fluent in Ndebele, and who attracted a lot of sympathy and affection from a lot of black people, and yet he remained an inspirational people for white farmers who’d been dispossessed of their land.”For Coltart, the Zimbabwean team is emblematic of the society it represents. “We punch above our weight.” Which is why he believes transformation had to happen.“It was very necessary,” Coltart says. “Cricket in Zimbabwe 30 years ago was a minority sport. If you just looked at the crowds they were, relatively speaking, very few black people in them. Even aside from the principle of the matter, that situation was completely unsustainable.” He just wishes it had been done differently. He makes a comparison with the redistribution of land, and the violent farm takeovers which were the cause of so much pain, grief and injustice in the 2000s. “The land holdings were unjust,” he says, “But we could have done it without violence. Now, there wasn’t violence in cricket, but I think that when you look at the dreadful collapse of cricket in 2004, that could have been avoided.”View image in fullscreenColtart is against a boycott of Afghan cricket due to his belief in ‘the power of sport to bridge divides’.Photograph: KM Chaudary/APWhen Zimbabwe stopped playing Test cricket, Coltart helped lead the campaign to restore it. In government he spent a lot of time lobbying the English to start playing fixtures against his country again. The ECB turned its back on the country, even after the end of the Mugabe regime. It was only when Richard Gould took over as the chief executive of the ECB that things finally changed. “They disregarded us and while I understand the reasons, I’ve never felt that England should not be playing Zimbabwe,” Coltart says. “Although I’m a strident critic of the Zimbabwean regime, I’ve always believed in the power of sport to bridge divides.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Use the game, the opportunities it provides, to build relations, and to hold them to higher standards.”He is still trying to do that in his own country now, as mayor. Bulawayo has just won the right to host theStreet Child Cricket World Cup. But Coltart is deeply concerned about the way the sport is being run. “There’s still far too much politics involved in Zimbabwe Cricket, in the running of the organisation, and even in the selection policies. I still fear that we’re not spending the money that we get as best we should. I’m a politician, but I don’t think politicians should be anywhere near cricket administration. I would rather see people whose primary attribute is a great passion for cricket being involved in the running of the sport. I’d like to see our best players from the past dominating the selection panel, black and white.”Still, he beams when he thinks that Zimbabwe are going to play a Test at Trent Bridge this week. “Despite the politics, despite the abuse of the rule of law and corruption in the country, all the concerns that I have regarding the government, the vast majority of Zimbabweans are united. It’s a wonderful country and you will see that in our cricket, we are a passionately multiracial team, and that’s a wonderful projection of our country.”Explore more on these topicsZimbabwe Cricket TeamCricketEngland cricket teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Glasner’s side will be without Adam Wharton and the captain, Marc Guéhi, against Wolves on Tuesday night, with Wharton also ruled out of their final match against Liverpool after sustaining a concussion that forced him to miss the celebrations. From their final two games Palace need a draw to surpass their record points tally in the Premier League.Parish said after the Cup win on Saturday thathe wanted to extend the manager’s contractbeyond next summer and acknowledged playing in Europe would be “a challenge” for a club of Palace’s resources. Glasner insisted he was “100% here” and had started planning for next season, although he warned it was important not to get carried away by the success.“This club has always progressed – not huge steps,” he said. “You can be a one-hit wonder. But then you’re back, then you’re gone. It just makes no sense. That’s why we said our planning shouldn’t be: ‘Now we play in Europe.’ We do crazy things and everything collapses. How is the pathway? And we follow the pathway.“Now it’s going step by step. Maybe getting a player we couldn’t get if we didn’t play international football; – this can help us make the next step. But not being a top-four club in England.“For me the next step is to play between [positions] eight and 12 [in the league]. Very stable. Because you can see in the Premier League there are a few top teams, huge clubs. Because quickly you can be at the bottom of the league table. This is why I think it’s very good.“One of the guarantees is the chairman here. He’s very stable.

The England international, signed for £100m four years ago, has fallen down the pecking order at the Etihad Stadium since his starring role in the 2023 treble-winning campaign.The 29-year-old has made just seven Premier League starts this term and was not summoned from the bench during Saturday’sFA Cup final defeatby Crystal Palace. That has fuelled speculation he could move on this summer, but Guardiola insists nothing has yet been determined and discussions will take place between outgoing director of football Txiki Begiristain, his successor Hugo Viana and the player’s representatives.Guardiola said: “We didn’t talk, I didn’t talk with him. People don’t believe me, but these things belong to the agents and the club and Txiki, and in this case Hugo as well. Both will decide. What is going to happen will happen, but he has to come back to start to play minutes again.”Premier League and FA Cup final: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreGuardiola accepts Grealish, who has two years remaining on his contract, will not be happy about his lack of action. He said: “It’s not [only] Jack. There is not one player in my locker room, and I think all the locker rooms around the world, that is happy [when they] do not play. When the team is winning and winning they have to figure out how everything happens – but they are not happy. They are here to play and, when they don’t play, they are not satisfied. That is the normal position in all the clubs.”Meanwhile, Guardiola has offered no guarantee that Kevin De Bruyne will starthis final home game for City. De Bruyne, who is leaving when his contract expires this summer, is set to play at the Etihad for one last time in a City shirt against Bournemouth on Tuesday. Yet with the clubstill to secure Champions League qualification, Guardiola will not be guided by sentiment in his selection, even though De Bruyne will receive a send-off after the game. The manager said: “What Kevin wants is that we win the game to qualify for the Champions League next season. That is what Kevin wants. It cannot be otherwise. I’m going to decide the best so that we can have the best chance to win the game against Bournemouth.”View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola has offered no guarantee that Kevin De Bruyne will start against Bournemouth.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PADe Bruyne is to be given a guard of honour by teammates at full time before he gives a speech on the pitch. He will then be presented with gifts by the wife and son of the late City legend Colin Bell.Victory in what is a game in hand would lift City to third heading into their final league game at Fulham on Sunday. Defeat would leave them sixth and mean one point would separate the teams from third to seventh in the battle for top-five places. City have played in the Champions League every season since they qualified for the 2011-12 campaign.“Of course it’s important,” Guardiola said. “We have been in for the last 14 or 15 years and it is where we want to be, but if we are not there it is because we don’t deserve it, and we will play the Europa League. But I’m thinking we’re going to qualify. I control my mind and I think that. The first step is to finish in third position in the Premier League and that is the main target.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It had been 10 long, hard months of “solidarity and commitment … methodology, work, honesty and dedication”, their manager said, yet this was no late lament, all that for nothing; instead, this was reward and release, “time to enjoy it”, to let go, so they did. Outside at Montjuïc, Barcelona had begun their party, even 2025’s first league defeat and killjoy keeper Wojciech Szczesny saving anoutrageous overhead kickfrom his own son not spoiling the fun; inside the dressing room, the club from the small town 200 miles south had begun theirs too, and nothing could ruin this either. Someone putLa Morochaon and the players were bouncing about, drumming the rhythm on the ceiling when, in another triumph for cheap construction, the first beam came down. Captain Juan Foyth, looking like a kid who’d put a football through the neighbour’s window, raised his arm to protect his teammates, quietly laid it to one side,and they carried on.The track was changed, Handel now, and they lined up. Some tipped their heads back, gazing at the ceiling they had broken. Others put hands on hearts. Most laughed. All of them scatted and sang, at least the word they knew: maybe notdie meister, maybe notdie bestenorles grandes équipes, and definitely noteine grosse sportliche veranstaltung, but certainlythe champions. The flag they carried read “the village wants the Champions League” and now they had it. Villarreal, the team from the place whose population could fit into Montjuïc, had come to Catalonia, handed thenewly crowned championsa guard of honour and then beaten them 3-2, helped byBarça’s hangovers, to secure fifth and a return to Europe’s biggest competition with a week to spare. The season, Santi Comesaña said, had been “almost perfect”.“Back on 10 July, few people thought we would finish in the Champions League,” the manager, Marcelino García Toral, said. That wasn’t actually true; plenty predicted this, or even better. Comesaña’s “almost”said as much: it was a pity, he admitted, thatVillarrealcan’t finish fourth, which would have also given them access to the Super Cup. Instead, Athletic Club will. Only Madrid, Barcelona and Atlético have bigger budgets than Villarreal. They finished last season with two defeats in 18, then signed 10 players. No one outside the Big Two has a footballer better than Álex Baena. They had no European competition to distract them, playing a dozen games fewer than Athletic and Betis. And this isn’t the first time they’ve qualified for the Champions League; it’s the fifth.View image in fullscreenMarcelino García Toral barks instructions from the sidelines at Monjuïc.Photograph: Toni Albir/EPAIt wasn’t the first time that Marcelino had, either. It’s not even the first time he has with Villarreal. Maybe this time, he had joked to friends after they beat Leganés 3-0 last week, he’ll actually be allowed to experience it. And that was the point. Both points, in fact. The fact that it was Marcelino was a reason to trust in Villarreal being the best of Spain’sotherteams. This is the man who brought Real Zaragoza from the second divisionto the first, took Recreativo de Huelva up andinto eighth, their best-ever finish, and qualified Racing Santander for Europe the only timein their history. He turned Valencia around,finishing fourthtwo years runningand wonthecup. Then he went to two Copa del Rey finals with Athletic Club (albeit the firstbelonged to Gaizka Garitano,really) andwon the Super Cup. And the last time he was at Villarreal, he took them from the second division to a Europa League semi-final and back intothe Champions League, pride and place restored in only three years.And then they sacked him,a week before the season began.It took six years and a lot of soul searching, a lot of bridges rebuilt for Marcelino to return. It took a crisis at the club too, for them to need him and him to want to help. And that’s the other point: why this felt special to him, something deeper there, why he could talk tales of the unexpected, of achievement; why Champions League qualification is healing: not just a hope for the future but a fixing of the past, all well with the world. When Villarreal sacked Marcelino in August 2016, the club’s owner Fernando Roig had described it as a painful decision but one that had to be made. When they called Fran Escriba to take over, he was on his way downto get an ice-cream. He hadn’t been expecting to receive a call and Villarreal hadn’t expected to make one.There had been a storm after Villarreal were defeated by struggling Sporting Gijon – Marcelino’s local club, the one he supports, played for, coached and is most associated with – and his wife had posted a message on social media saying “our work here is done, we leave you in the first division”. That had hurt Roig, damaging manager and club. A divide had opened up and the relationship was tense with Roig’s son, the club’s CEO. In the dressing room there were difficulties too, particularly with Mateo Musacchio, Marcelino later admitting: “There was one player with who I couldn’t coexist.” When he effectively gave an ultimatum, the club chose the players over the coach.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Yeremy Pino, Ayoze Pérez and Álex Baena have been cooking up a storm at Villarreal.Photograph: Maria Jose Segovia/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockFor a while, Escribá’s arrival had a liberating effect: Marcelino can be demanding, overwhelming. For a time, the tension eased, the atmosphere too. He lasted a year. Javier Calleja came,was sacked, and came back again sixweeks later. Unai Emery arrived as an upgrade, won the Europa League and departed for Aston Villa. Quique Setiénfinished fifthand then was sacked just four weeks into the following season, his lament a familiar one: the club, he felt, had chosen the dressing room. When José Rojo Martín, “Pacheta”, took over, he could hardly believe his luck but soon saw how superficial that was: there was so much talent, it wouldn’t take much to be a decent team. He was gone in two months, defeated. He had won one of eight league games.It was November 2023. Over time, José Manuel Llaneza, the man who hadbuilt the club with Roig, had intervened to mend the relationship, seek some rapprochement between Marcelino and the Roigs. Slowly, they had started talking again, a little affection allowed, excuses found to contact each other. When Marcelino had a serious car crash at Christmas in 2017, that brought perspective; when Llaneza passed away in 2022, there was warmth, wounds healing through mutual support. When Villarreal contacted Marcelino now – professionally this time, although this was an opportunity to make amends personally – he had escaped the crisis at Marseille and turned down Sevilla. His condition for returning was simple: we’re not going to argue.“Some people call me Marcelino,” Marcelino said at his presentation. “Some call me Marcelino García Toral. Those who know me well tend to call me Marce. My name is not Saviour. And my surname is nor Miracles.” And, yes, Saviour Miracles – Salvador Milagros – could be a real name in Spanish. And, no, he was not. But nor was he so far off.View image in fullscreenThe Barcelona players pose with the league trophy despite their defeat.Photograph: Toni Albir/EPAVillarreal were 13th, they had 12 points from 12 games. Defensively they were struggling badly. There were injuries, European games adding to the strain. They were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by third-tier Unionistas in January, which was embarrassing but probably helped; there was time to train, focus turned to stopping the bleeding. At the other end, no one provided more assists than Baena. Asked what Marcelino demands of him, Baena replied simply: “That I don’t walk.” Alexander Sørloth scored nine in the last eight weeks,15 in the last 16. Villarrealbeat Barcelona, drew with Real Madrid and lost twice in the last 18, finishing just short of a European place.Then this summer, 16 players went including Sørloth, a shift in group dynamics as well as style. Once that might have been a source of tension, disagreements. But lessons have been learned and this was going to be more like a Marcelino team, more his. There was a move towards athleticism, even height: direct, counterattacking, set up in 4-4-2, with one winger coming in, the other going out. Thierno Barry came for €13.5m, Logan Costa for €17m. Nicolas Pépé and Pape Gueye were free. So too Sergi Cardona; no full-back has more assists. Tea-loving Ayoze Pérez was the signing of the summer at €4m,Marcelino making him more of a centre-forward, from where he has 19 league goals. Baena, who spent 11 hours agonising over a Saudi Arabian offer in January, decided to stay: no one has created more chances. “He is very, very,verygood” Pérez says. “The ability he has to find you is incredible; as soon as he gets the ball I just have to move and he reaches me.”Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowAtlético Madrid 4-1 Real Betis, Barcelona 2-3 Villarreal, Celta Vigo 1-2 Rayo Vallecano, Las Palmas 0-1 Leganés, Mallorca 1-2 Getafe, Osasuna 2-0 Espanyol, Real Sociedad 3-2 Girona, Sevilla  0-2 Real Madrid, Valencia 0-1 Athletic Bilbao, Real Valladolid 0-1 Alavés.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Together, they were bouncing about Montjuïc on Sunday night while Villarreal put up a tweet of their manager, standing there all AI, decked in gold holding the Champions League ball. There were no words, just his name:Salvador Milagros.“Few thought this on 10 July, but we planned well, built well, and worked very hard,” Marcelino said. “Last year was very difficult: we came into a complicated situation but we were convinced we could turn it around and between us all we have; I want to say thank you to everyone. A year ago, we were scared the team was going down but this is a good club, very well managed. The second half of last season our numbers were practically Champions League numbers. We did a wide restructuring and we got it right. The key is having good players who are also good people. These are the values you need to make a team … and it is always theteamsthat achieve their objectives.

Narrowly trailing him was Karol Nawrocki, backed by the populist rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS), with 29.54% of the vote.Trzaskowski had long beenseen as the frontrunner,whose election would allow Poland to end themonths-long standoffbetween the centrist-led parliament and populist right presidency.Tusk and his coalitiontook powerin 2023, promising to reverse the erosion of democratic checks and balances that had marked PiS’s eight years in government.Their efforts, however, have been in part stymied by the outgoing president,Andrzej Duda, a close ally of the previous PiS government and a supporter of Donald Trump. Duda has used his presidential veto to repeatedly block the new administration’s reforms, prompting Tusk to comment last month in parliament: “It’s hard to govern alongside a hostile president, with all those vetoes.”Poland’s presidential candidates seek to broaden appeal on campaign trail after nail-biting first round vote – Europe liveRead moreThe stalemate has loomed over the presidential election, turning the ballot into a question of whether voters want to carry through with the political overhaul that began in 2023 when PiS was ousted from power in the country’s parliament.As the closer-than-anticipated result rolled in on Sunday night, Tusk took to social media to try to galvanise voters. Everything was at stake now, he wrote, adding that “the next two weeks will decide the future” ofPoland. “Not one step back!”he said.On Monday, hours after the first-round results came in, the two candidates were back on the campaign trail. Trzaskowski was in the south-central city of Kielce, handing out sweet yeast buns amid promises of reforming judicial institutions and liberalising the country’s laws on abortion. Nawrocki was in Gdańsk, offering donuts to those drawn to his admiration for Trump, strong language against migration and pledges to crack down on “woke” liberal values.It was a glimpse of what probably lies ahead for the country. “The campaign in the next two weeks will be very polarising and brutal – a confrontation of two visions of Poland: pro-EU, liberal and progressive versus nationalist, Trumpist and conservative,” Piotr Buras, head of the Warsaw office of the European Council on Foreign Relations, told the Associated Press.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For Trzaskowski, the effort is made more difficult as rightwing and far-right candidates received just over half the votes in the first round.The supporters of Sławomir Mentzen, a libertarian radical-right candidate who came in third with 14.8% of Sunday’s vote, could prove key to the second round.A Eurosceptic who is staunchly opposed to abortion and migrants, Mentzen had taken aim at the country’s 1 million Ukrainian refugees, accusing them of taking advantage of Poland.Just over 6% of voters backed Grzegorz Braun, catapulting the lawmaker from the far-right Confederation party into fourth place. Braun isunder investigationafter he used a fire extinguisher to put out Hanukah candles in the Polish parliament in protest against the celebration of Jewish holidays.About 14% of votes were cast for the centre-right Szymon Hołownia, the New Left’s Magdalena Biejat and hard-left candidate Adrian Zandberg.With two weeks left before voters return to the polls, it was anyone’s guess who might end up elected as president, said Aleks Szczerbiak, a professor of politics at the University of Sussex. “I think there’s absolutely everything to play for,” he said. “I think it’s completely neck and neck, and in many ways the campaign is just kind of resetting.”Explore more on these topicsPolandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He died 22 days later.Staff called police after Burgess, who had one leg, was seen poking a care worker in the stomach with a cutlery knife after flicking food at her. Managers wheeled him back to his room and tried for half an hour to calm him before calling 999.The officers were dispatched under a grade 1 call, meaning it was treated as the highest level of emergency.Prosecutors claim the officers used “unjustified and unlawful” force within seconds of entering the pensioner’s room.Southwark crown court was told on Monday that 1 minute and 23 seconds elapsed between the officers arriving and Burgess being shot with the Taser.Smith, 51, denies two counts of assault by using Pava spray and a baton, and Comotto denies one charge of assault by discharging her Taser.The prosecutor, Paul Jarvis KC, said Burgess was sitting in his wheelchair holding a small serrated cutlery knife when the officers entered the room.They did not speak to the staff or explain to Burgess why they were there, jurors heard.Instead, Smith told him: “Do you want to put the knife down or you will be sprayed or Tasered. Those are the options.”Footage from body-worn cameras played to the jury showed Smith then discharging the spray directly into Burgess’s face.“Comments made by Mr Smith suggest he emptied all of the canister into Mr Burgess’s face,” Jarvis said.Seconds later, Smith drew his baton and struck Burgess.Comotto deployed her Taser and Burgess cried out in pain. The officers took the knife from him.Jurors were told there was nobody within arm’s reach of Burgess at the time and it should have been clear he was not mobile.“This was an elderly, vulnerable man who may not have understood what was going on,” Jarvis said.“Rather than being met with understanding and sympathy, he was confronted by irritation and annoyance on the part of the defendants.”Burgess, who suffered from health conditions including diabetes and carotid artery disease, had been a resident at the home since 2018.Jarvis told the jury: “I want to make it clear – these defendants are not responsible for his death.”The trial was adjourned until Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He will now in effect end his 30-year relationship with the BBC after fronting his lastMatch of the Daythis weekend. It is understood his departure does not include a financial settlement.The decision to allow him to present the finalMatch of the Dayof the season has also led to criticism, with some industry figures accusing the BBC of allowing him to leave on his own terms, despite admitting a serious error of judgment.Reports of Lineker’s early departure emerged on Sunday night, a day after he presented the BBC’s FA Cup final coverage. It was confirmed on Monday byTim Davie, the BBC’s director general. “Gary has acknowledged the mistake he made,” he said. “Accordingly, we have agreed he will step back from further presenting after this season.“Gary has been a defining voice in football coverage for the BBC for over two decades. His passion and knowledge have shaped our sports journalism and earned him the respect of sports fans across the UK and beyond. We want to thank him for the contribution he has made.”It brings to an end a decades-long relationship with the BBC, in which the corporation developed the former England striker into its leading sports presenter. His final Match of the Day will come 26 years after he took over from Des Lynam.Last week, the 64-year-oldapologisedafter it emerged he had reposted a pro-Palestine video on Instagram that criticised Zionism and included an illustration of a rat. Lineker has 1.2m followers on the platform.A rat is an antisemitic trope that was used in Nazi Germany to characterise Jews as vermin. Lineker said in a statement that he would “never knowingly share anything antisemitic” and had deleted the post “as soon as I became aware of the issue”.Yesterday, Lineker acknowledged that the post had “awful connotations”, but said he had not seen the emoji. “I would never consciously repost anything antisemitic – it goes against everything I stand for,” he said. “I recognise the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am. Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.”Davie had been facing calls to sack Lineker, who was paid £1.35m by the BBC last year. The BBC will now begin a new era of coverage without Lineker. He will be replaced on Match of the Dayby Gabby Logan, Kelly Cates and Mark Chapman.It comes after a tumultuous few years in the relationship between Lineker and the BBC. In March 2023, hewas temporarily suspendedover comments he made criticising the Conservative government’s asylum policy.In February this year, he was also among 500 high-profile cultural figures who called on the BBC to rebroadcast a documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, calling it an “essential piece of journalism”.The broadcasterremoved the documentaryfrom BBC iPlayer after it emerged that the film’s 14-year-old narrator was the son of a deputy agriculture minister in the territory’s Hamas-run government.Danny Cohen, the BBC’s former director of television who has been a leading critic of the broadcaster’s handling of the issue, said that it was right that he is leaving. However, he questioned why he was allowed to front one last show.“He should not be allowed a final swan song this weekend,” he said. “And why the BBC’s statement does not even mention antisemitism is hard to understand.“If the racist content had been directed at another community I do not believe a presenter would be allowed to carry on for another week. The BBC has a serious and wide-ranging problem with antisemitism. Only much stronger executive leadership can change that.”Another BBC staffer said: “It seems like BBC bosses have done the bare minimum of damage limitation. As a Jewish member of staff, that feels like a betrayal.”The producer Leo Pearlman, chief executive of Fulwell Entertainment, also accused the BBC of “weak and ineffectual leadership” and said there was no victory in Lineker leaving “seemingly on his own terms”.The BBC declined to comment on the criticisms. However, a source said the decision to allow Lineker to present the season’s final Match of the Day recognised the presenter’s long relationship with the corporation. They did not accept that the BBC had a wider problem with antisemitism.Explore more on these topicsGary LinekerBBCMatch of the DaynewsShareReuse this content"

According to the police, the suspect arrived at her house disguised as a delivery man and shot Estupiñán in the face when she opened the door. Surveillance camera footage showed the suspect fleeing shortly afterwards.“She was a young, enterprising woman with a whole life ahead of her, but those dreams are cut short like the dreams of many women in this country,” said Magda Victoria Acosta, the president of the national gender commission of the Colombian Judiciary.‘Nowhere is safe’: Colombia confronts alarming surge in femicidesRead moreAuthorities later confirmed that Estupiñán had previously been a victim of domestic violence, and that preliminary investigations point to a possible femicide, the intentional killing of women and girls because of their gender.“It could be a case of femicide, since she filed several complaints for domestic violence in previous years, but that is a matter of investigation,” said Col Leonardo Capacho of the Cúcuta police.Estupiñán had previously reported her ex-partner for domestic violence, according to women’s rights lawyers. The day before her death, a judge reportedlyruled in Estupiñán’s favour,ordering the abuser to compensate Estupiñán with 30m pesos, approximately $1,554.Activists say the Colombian state is implicated in the crime. Alejandra Vera, the director of Cúcuta-based feminist collective Woman, Speak Out and Move It, said the murder was “preventable” but that the “state fails to act”.“The brutal murder of María José is the result of a system that normalises violence against women,” said Vera. “Colombia is facing a pandemic of femicides – every 28 hours, a woman is a victim. Each crime reflects a systematic pattern of impunity and state negligence.“María José, like thousands, did what the system demands: she reported the crime, presented evidence, and asked for help. But the state let her die,” said Vera. “There are no effective protection orders, no follow-up care for abusers, and no shelters with the capacity.Womenare left completely unprotected, and the perpetrators know it.”Femicide does not refer to any homicide of a woman, but rather to the murder of women for their gender.According to the Colombian Observatory of Femicides, femicides in the South American nation reached a seven-year high in 2024, with886 recorded. The NGO said that up untilMarch 2025, 207 femicides had been reported. Figures vary, however, with theattorney generalacknowledging 640 cases by November 2024.Human Rights Watchhas previously warned that gender-based violence in Colombia “is widespread” and that perpetrators are “rarely held accountable”.Mexican beauty influencer shot dead during TikTok live streamRead moreVera said that laws exist to protect women in Colombia, “but they are dead letters”. According to Woman, Speak Out and Move It, the police lack staff and resources, prosecutors are not trained to investigate gender-based violence, and repeat offenders are not monitored. Meanwhile, the National Women’s Network NGO said that 73% of femicides in Colombia between 2021 and 2023 went unsolved.Estupiñán’s killing as been compared to the 13 May shooting of 23-year-old influencer Valeria Márquez in Mexico,who was killed when livestreaming at a salon. The Mexican state prosecutor’s office has said it was investigating the crime as femicide.Women’s rights activists are now calling for marches in Cúcuta and Bogotá to demand justice for Estupiñán.At her funeral this weekend, a family member said: “María José, life for you was a wonderful journey, but very short.

After an influencer directed their many followers to enjoy its pristine waters and golden sands, the location was swamped daily by thousands of visitors.Last June, María Pons, the local mayor, held a press conference saying that 4,000 people and 1,200 vehicles were going there every day. She pleaded with journalists and tour operators never to mention the cove again.Now the local authority has removed all images of the bay from its website.At Es Vedrà on Ibiza, the local authority has closed access to the popular lookout point after residents complained about overcrowding and accumulated waste.The backlash against influencers extends from Bali, where the authorities have complained about touristsposing naked at sacred sitesand imposed large fines on people filming in specific areas, to Vermont in the north-east United States where the small town of Pomfret, famed for its autumn foliage, has beenforced to restricttourists during autumn.With Spain expecting record numbers of tourists this summer after close to 100 million visited last year, protests against the impact of mass tourism, in particular its effect on the cost of housing, have already kicked off, with a water pistol attack on tourists in Barcelona last month.At the weekend, tens of thousands of protesters marched in the Canary Islands under the slogans “Massive tourism is making us homeless” and “The Canaries are not for sale.” Last year the archipelago (population 2.2 million) received a record 17 million visitors.Across Spain, the lack of affordable housing is the dominant social issue, with tourist apartments seen as the chief culprit. Last year the issue brought tens of thousands on to the streets of Tenerife, Palma de Mallorca, Sevilla, Madrid, Barcelona and elsewhere and similar protests are expected this year.Meanwhile, Spain’s consumer affairs ministry, with the backing of the supreme court, has ordered the tourist apartment platformAirbnbto remove the listings of 65,000 illegal lettings across Spain. Last March, the ministry produced a list of 15,200 illegal tourist apartments in Madrid alone.Airbnb has been threatened with fines of €100,000 (£84,000) or up to six times the value of the profits made from the illegal flats if it fails to comply.The company has appealed against previous government requests to remove the adverts, but a Madrid court urged the California-based firm to “immediately” withdraw 5,800 ads, the ministry said in a statement.A company spokesperson said Airbnb would continue to appeal and criticised the “indiscriminate methodology” of the ministry, which it said was not competent to enforce tourist accommodation rules.The ministry “has deliberately ignored” Spanish supreme court rulings that meant not all adverts on Airbnb required a registration number, added the spokesperson.Explore more on these topicsSpainBalearic Islands holidaysEuropeOvertourismSocial mediaAirbnbnewsShareReuse this content"

Each egg mass can produce 30 to 50 spotted lanternflies.The US’s war on spotted lanternflies might be having an effectRead moreSo far, the dogs have uncovered more than 4,000 of the masses, meaning they’ve helped eradicate as many as 200,000 of the sap-sucking bugs that damage grapes, fruit trees, hops and hardwoods, said Connie Hausman, senior conservation science manager at Cleveland Metroparks.In just a few hours in April, the dogs found about 1,100 egg masses at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, Hausman said.View image in fullscreenGail Samko and Australian shepherd-cattle dog mix, Rio (left), and Paige Malone and her cardigan Welsh corgi, Bronco, search for spotted lanternfly egg masses in Garfield Heights, Ohio.Photograph: Sue Ogrocki/APHowever, not just any dog can go out searching, she said.“They all have wonderful noses, but they’re not all eligible,” she said. “They had to pass tests to prove their service.”The dogs were trained through a research project led by a group atVirginiaTech University, which is setting out to slow the spread of the insects that are native to eastern Asia and recognizable for their distinctive black spots and bright red wing markings. A grant from the US Department of Agriculture facilitated the project, unofficially called the Canine Citizen Science Study. Professors at Virginia Tech partnered with researchers at Texas Tech University to call on dog owners to put their pets to work.The four dogs working in Cleveland owned by local residents already had scent training before they worked with Virginia Tech to hone their noses to detect the spotted lanternflies.Once they spot a new mass of eggs, the dogs get a treat from their handlers who scrape away the mud-like masses.View image in fullscreenSpotted lanternfly hunters walk on a trail in Cleveland Metroparks on 5 May.Photograph: Sue Ogrocki/APFemale spotted lanternflies typically start to lay their eggs in late August through November, or until the first frost. While the adults freeze to death in the winter, their egg masses can survive. Spotted lanternflies can lay their eggs on a variety of surfaces, including tree trunks, telephone poles, rocks and the undercarriage of vehicles.Flint, a border collie, was trained to sniff out the offending bugs by owner and trainer Sally Dickinson, who attends Virginia Tech.Dickinson took Flint out to Virginia Tech’s agricultural center to test out his sniffing skills. As Flint showed off his impressive olfactory capabilities, Dickinson encouraged dog owners to train their dogs to help eradicate the pests, no matter the breed.“There is plenty of research out there that indicates that all dogs can smell,” she said. “Maybe the ‘smooshy’-nosed dogs aren’t as good in the really hot weather to work for five hours straight, but they can definitely do it.”Virginia Tech News contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS newsInvasive speciesInsectsDogsAnimalsOhioVirginianewsShareReuse this content"

Now researchers say it could even improve your mood, help you relax and give you better sleepThe age of extinction is supported byAbout this contentPhoebe WestonMon 19 May 2025 05.00 EDTShareIn 2012 Dianne Hoffman, a retired consultant, became a peeping Tom. For five hours a day she watched the antics of a couple, Harriet and Ozzie, who lived on Dunrovin ranch in Montana.The pair were nesting ospreys, being streamed live as they incubated their clutch of eggs. The eggs never hatched, but the ospreys sat on them for months before finally kicking them out of the nest.“I do think they experienced grief,” says Hoffman, now 81, who watched the birds from 2,000 miles (3,000km) away in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania.View image in fullscreenThe Dunrovin ranch web cam shows an intimate view of ospreys nesting and raising their chicks every summer.Photograph: Dunrovin ranchHoffman was processing her own grief after the loss of her husband, brother and father, and watching the live streams was how she “rejoined the world”.“It was a very black time,” she says. Although Ozzie died in 2014, she still watches the nest and its current occupants for an hour a day. “I can’t think of anything the internet has done better for me than these cams.”Nature-focused live streams, set up near nests, water holes, dens or landscapes to provide a live, constant feed of the natural world, have proliferated over the past two decades, helped by cheap cameras and remote internet connections. The drama of nature – or sometimes the lack of it – is what draws people in.View image in fullscreenIn Sweden, continuous live footage of the annual moose migration is broadcast each year.Photograph: SVT/APThe seventh season of theTV series The Great Moose Migrationfrom the Swedish broadcaster SVT involved 20 days of continuous live footage, drawing in millions of viewers. Norway’s NRK has aired18 hours of salmon swimming upstreamand 12 hours of firewood burning. A viralfish doorbellallows viewers to watch migrating fish in a lock in Utrecht.If you can imagine it, there is probably a live stream about itRebecca Mauldin, the University of Texas at ArlingtonIn an increasingly urbanised society, as people spend more time on screens they are less connected with nature. “While technology can draw us away from the natural world, we have also learned that technology can connect us with nature in unique ways,”researchers wrote in a paperpublished in March.It came afteranother studythat found nature live streams could “improve the lives of those who cannot leave their homes or live far from natural environments”.Researchers from the University of Montana first put up a camera focused on Harriet and Ozzie’s nest in 2012. At the end of the breeding season, the owner, SuzAnne Miller, turned it off but scores of people contacted her. “[They said] please don’t do that. We want to watch your ranch,” Miller says. As well as the birds, they could see what was going on behind the nest, she says, and wanted to keep watching.View image in fullscreenHoffman says the livestream helped her through a period of grief, and she still watches for an hour every day.Photograph: Rachel Wisniewski/The GuardianInitially, Miller did not understand why someone would livestream her doing mundane tasks such as scooping up horse dung. “I did at first find that very odd,” she says. But she added three more live streams of the river, paddock and a bird feeder. It was only when she became ill and was not able to leave the house for six months that she understood the value of it – she too got hooked on live streams of the farm.If someone leaves a gate open, within minutes a viewer will contact the ranch to warn them. Members watched a vet put down a horse after it slid on ice and broke its neck. The horse’s head lay in Miller’s lap as it died. “Many of these people are older and facing death themselves,” she says. “It got them talking about death.”Collapsing bird numbers in North America prompt fears of ecological crisis – researchRead moreThe stream has 275 paying subscribers, most of whom have never been to the farm. It cost $8 a month to be a member, and most are older people or those with reduced mobility. Several members have had their ashes scattered there despite never having set foot on the farm, because it became their favourite place in their final years.Many of these sites allow viewers to message one another or post messages on discussion boards.

A new study awaiting publication shows that playing nature-focused live streams increased the wellbeing of some of the older residents in a care home, improving their mood, levels of relaxation, and sleep. A previousstudyhas also found Dunrovin webcams have a “significant positive change” for care-home residents, and could be an “innovative and effective way” to improve wellbeing more broadly.“I’ve realised it is not just for older adults – there are all sorts of reasons why you might not have full access to nature,” says Mauldin.View image in fullscreenThe Africam live stream has cameras across the continent, capturing footage of animals such as this herd of giraffes in Namibia.Photograph: AfricamThere are hundreds of webcams across 35 of the US’s national parks.

Conservationists are using alive camto study grey seals at South Walney nature reserve, which is free from human disturbance as there is no public access to the beach. “One of our trainees spotted the first-ever seal pup born on the reserve via the camera – a small, white, fluffy pup nestled among the adults,” says Georgia de Jong Cleyndert, head of marine at Cumbria Wildlife Trust.For some birds such as the ospreys, permanent cameras double up as CCTV. “The osprey cam is primarily for security, to ensure that these protected birds and their nests are safe, and to act as a deterrent to anyone who would wish to harm them,” says Paul Waterhouse, reserves officer for CumbriaWildlifeTrust.View image in fullscreenThe osprey nest cam at Rutland Water nature reserve showing female Maya and male 33(11), who have bred together since 2015 and have raised 27 chicks.Photograph: Rutland Osprey Nest Cam Live StreamMauldin says her research shows nature live streams relax people and help them put their own concerns into perspective.“It also tells a lot about human curiosity – we like to learn, we like a sense of surprise – sometimes it’s nothing, sometimes it’s something amazing. It’s yearning for connection with the world around us,” she says.What to watchKeen to start watching nature online? Here are six of the most popular live streams to get you started:Bears going fishing:From late June and throughout July, bears flock to Brooks Falls in Alaska to catch migrating salmon. At times up to 25 bears can be seen onscreen at once (if you can’t wait until June, here aretwo hours of footageas a taster)Bats on the move:In the daytime, all is quiet on the live stream of Bracken Cave, Texas in the US – but in the evening, you can catch its 20 million resident Mexican free-tailed bats streaming out of the cave to go on the hunt.Baby storks:Knepp Estate in Sussex in the UK is home to a growing population of white storks which bred for the first time in 2020 after an absence of hundreds of years. A livestream shows the nest currently playing host to four fledged offspring: Isla, Ivy, Issy and Ivan. At the time of writing they are tearing up a small dead rabbit.Love Island for osprey:This has been like a series of the hit reality show, with four osprey couples battling for space in one nest at the Loch of the Lowes wildlife reserve in Scotland. After weeks of grafting and being mugged off, two birds have claimed top spot and appear to be putting their eggs in one basket.Going for a drink:This live streamspies on a watering hole in Tembe elephant park at the border of South Africa and Mozambique, and you can watch a steady stream of elephants, lions, rhinos and buffalo stopping by for a sip. After dark, the cam’s night vision lights up a calming, spinning world of moths and fireflies.Live jelly cam:Monterey Bay Aquarium’s jellyfish cam offers a hypnotic experience, immersing you in the serene world of sea nettles, native to the eastern Pacific Ocean.

They measured nitrate, phosphate, ammonia, electrical conductivity, temperature and turbidity on 76 catchments, along with visual observations and photographs.Only 16% of English rivers are considered to be in good ecological status, with phosphate levels at an upper limit of 0.306ppm. The report reveals almost 34% of samples collected by angling volunteers breached that upper limit.Nitrate levels have no upper limit but Angling Trust volunteers were given independent guidance that nitrate concentrations of 5ppm or more were excessive in a freshwater habitat. This level was exceeded in 45% of samples collected.The pollution is not evenly spread, the report reveals. In the Medway catchment, which is mostly in south-east England, including Kent, Surrey and East Sussex, 100% of site averages – based on eight or more samples in the year – failed to meet good ecological status as defined by the water framework directive, which is part of English law.In the Avon catchment in Warwickshire, 86% of phosphate site averages failed to meet good ecological status.Anglers are calling on the government and water companies to improve water quality.Alex Farquhar, the campaigns and advocacy officer at the Angling Trust, said: “This report paints a picture of the continued ill health of our rivers and the systemic failure to make the rapid shifts in governance needed to bring them back to life. Listening to citizen science initiatives like this one is essential to this process.”The extent of pollution still affecting English rivers was revealed as Labour MPs refused to consider adding extra protections for chalk streams, which would designate them as irreplaceable habitats in the planning and infrastructure bill – designed to driveLabour’s target of 1.5m housesand grow infrastructure delivery across the country. All Labour members examining the draft law rejected an amendment containing the extra provision.Anglers from the rivers Test and Itchen, two world-renowned chalk streams in Hampshire, used the data gathered over 12 months to expose how SouthernWaterwas contributing to polluting the waterways.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Every sample breached the upper limit for good ecological status (GES) due to high phosphate levels.The anglers put pressure on theEnvironment Agencyto create a joint monitoring group that exposed how more than 90% of pollution problems were from direct outputs and outflows from wastewater treatment works and combined sewer overflows, which were the responsibility of Southern Water.In Warwickshire, more than 50 anglers took part in the monitoring. Their sampling showed 86.4% of sites regularly tested in 2023-24 had average phosphate readings breaching good ecological status – significantly higher than the national average.Andy Hammerton, a Water Quality Monitoring Network volunteer with the Girling Angling Society, said: “While our efforts to force the water companies and Environment Agency to improve may be perceived by some to be too little too late … my hope is that by applying the pressure now, my grandchildren will benefit from a clean and safe natural river environment where wildlife and fish will once again flourish.”Explore more on these topicsRiversWaterFishingConservationMarine lifeWildlifeEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

But respite is hard to come by in Rajendra Nagar, a slum in south Bengaluru. “It’s just as hot outside, but it feels worse indoors. It’s been really hot for the past five or six days, but at least there’s an occasional breeze outside,” says the 36-year-old.Inside Begum’s dimly lit living room, ceiling fans whir.

With a nostalgic smile, Begum recalls her green and breezy village in Kishanganj district in Bihar state. “It’s actually hotter in our village, temperature-wise,” she says. “But when it got unbearable, we would go and take a stroll by the river. Here, there’s nowhere to go, just up and down this street.”While the government’sheat advisoriesurge people to stay indoors between noon and 3pm, it’s pointless advice for most families in Rajendra Nagar. “The fans just circulate hot air,” she says. “We keep drinkingmatke ka paani[chilled water from clay pots] and step outside from time to time, but there’s nothing else to do to escape the heat inside.”Indoor heat is recognised as aserious health hazardfor vulnerable groups. Among them are low-income families in informal settlements where poorly ventilated homes are built of heat-trapping materials, and have irregular electricity and water supply. Outdoors, there’s little relief on offer because of limited access to green, open spaces.View image in fullscreenSumaiya Fatima, in her home in Rajendra Nagar.

According to theBengaluru Climate Action and Resilience Plan, the city’s average temperature has risen by approximately 0.23C per decade since 1975, with a sharper increase of nearly 0.5C since 2009. In April, Bengaluru recorded temperatures of about 35C (95F).View image in fullscreenA woman walks past the parched banks of Bengaluru’s Nallurahalli Lake during a water shortage in April 2024.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn Rajendra Nagar and nearby slums such as LR Nagar and Ambedkar Nagar, most homes are built on compact plots of roughly 300 sq ft, and each household typically has five to seven members. There are power cuts several times a week, lasting from a few hours to a few days, and water is available only on alternate days or even every third day. Running fans or cooling the body with “spray bottles, damp cloths [or] ice towels”, as agovernment heat advisory suggests, can be challenging for people in these neighbourhoods.Begum’s home has one window, facing a quiet side road. However, the municipality recently began road building work and is widening the sewers. “We open the window only during long power cuts,” her daughter Noor Nagina, 14, says. “Otherwise, we have to deal with mosquitoes and dust from all the work.”Researchers at the Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS), Bengaluru, point out that most heat action plans (HAPs) in India have overlooked indoor heat, especially in low-income and informal settlements. Areview of 10 city-level HAPs, published in the journal Plos Climate, revealed that only two cities – Rajkot and Bhubaneshwar – explicitly acknowledged indoor heat vulnerability.“Overall, while a few plans highlight indoor heat risks … there is a significant gap in comprehensive, scalable strategies to address these challenges,” says Swati Surampally, one of the review’s authors.View image in fullscreenBabu, pictured, says frequent power cuts and mosquitoes make summers unbearable inside his house in Rajendra Nagar.Photograph: Vivek Muthuramalingam/Migration StoryPoor ventilation does not help, says Radha N, who works with Rajendra Nagar-based NGO Swabhimaan. “Most houses in the area have narrow, tunnel-like entrances, with rooms arranged one behind the other in a straight line. This leaves little to no space for air to circulate indoors and as a result, the concrete walls heat up,” she says.“Children sometimes wake up crying because of the heat, power cuts and the mosquitoes. As a result, their parents, who spend most of the day working outdoors, are unable to get enough rest at night.”This, she adds, badly affects their ability to function the next day.Sometimes, I sit by the door hoping for some air, but that’s rare now.

The project, Climate Change Local Adaptation Pathways (Claps), found that indoor heat disproportionately affects women, who shoulder paid work and unpaid domestic responsibilities.“Women face a triple burden: they manage paid work alongside domestic chores, endure prolonged exposure while cooking in unventilated spaces, and often eat last or inadequately, heightening fatigue and health risks. Together, these factors make indoor heat a deeply gendered and under-recognised health challenge,” says Surampally, a senior research associate at IIHS, also working with Claps.‘I feel dizzy but I can’t stop’: global heating is already making kiln workers’ lives unbearable.

Surampally emphasises the need for heat-resilient housing through subsidies for cool roofs and improved ventilation; access to reliable electricity and water; enforcement of labour protections such as rest breaks and hydration for outdoor workers; and multilingual campaigns tailored to migrant communities.“Many migrants compare Bengaluru’s heat to their even hotter native towns and, therefore, underplay its risks,” Surampally says. “This perception, along with limited financial resources, means that the urgency to adapt is low, even when physical discomfort is high.”View image in fullscreenJennifer in her Rajendra Nagar home.

A sense of feeling safe falls from 7.2 in year 7 to 5.9 in year 9 among female pupils, compared with a decline from 7.4 to 6.6 for male pupils.Almost every country with available data sees a decline in engagement as children advance through school, but the report says it is more pronounced in England, “suggesting that disengagement is not just a symptom of age, but something atypical happening in our context”.The findings come from the Research Commission on Engagement and Lead Indicators (RCELI), led by theImpactEdgroup in partnership with the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), the Confederation of School Trusts (CST), and other education organisations.The commission chair, Sue John, said: “It is crucial that we identify the points at which pupils are starting to disengage with school, so that we can intervene to stop a disconnection leading to non-attendance and poorer outcomes.“This research provides rich and nuanced insights into pupil engagement at a school and classroom level, which will enable leaders to act fast and understand more complex dynamics in their schools, such as what is happening at age 11 for different pupil groups.”Margaret Mulholland, Special educational needs and disabilities (Send) and inclusion specialist at the ASCL, said: “The transition between primary and secondary school is a hugely important stage of a child’s education.“It can also be an unsettling time where issues with anxiety and behaviour can arise. As this study shows, a drop in engagement during this period can be hugely detrimental to a pupil’s wellbeing and attainment.”Leora Cruddas, chief executive of the CST, added: “There are many factors beyond schools which may be contributing to this picture. We need to delve deeper into what the factors are that are driving this disengagement and how we might reconnect these pupils with schooling.”Explore more on these topicsEducationPrimary schoolsSecondary schoolsSchoolsChildrenTeachingMental healthnewsShareReuse this content"

He called for the sum to be written off given the department failed to stop the overpayments as promised.“The DWP’s negligence and failure to follow even its own low standards have led to this ridiculous situation that they promised to have sorted out years ago,” he added.“They are making criminals out of the vulnerable families they are supposed to be helping, and piling unnecessary debt, hardship, anxiety and massive adversity on to them in order to avoid taking responsibility for their own failures. It would be much fairer to write the whole thing off.”AGuardian investigationinto carer’s allowance over the past year has detailed the horrific financial and emotional impact on carers of overpayments, but the latest figures also highlight the extent to which official failures meant huge amounts of taxpayers’ money was needlessly wasted.Tens of thousands of carers have unwittingly fallen foul of earnings rules each year since the DWP permanent secretary Sir Peter Schofield promised MPs in 2019 that new technology would eradicate the problem by preventing overpayments “in some cases before they happen”.The verify earnings and pensions tool, known as VEP, introduced in 2018, was meant to enable DWP to swiftly check thousands of electronic alerts of potential earnings breaches by carer’s allowance claimants each month.However, the DWP decided as a matter of policy to only investigate half of all VEP alerts, meaning breaches could go unidentified for long periods. This led to carers unwittingly running up huge avoidable overpayments, and typically having to repay sums between £1,000 and £5,000 but in some cases as much as £20,000.In the five years after VEP was presented as a “solution” to the problems of carer’s allowance, more than 262,000 overpayments totalling in excess of £325m were clawed back from carers, and 600 carers were prosecuted and received criminal records,according tothe National Audit Office.Ministers last month announced they would invest £800,000 toproperly staffthe carer’s allowance section to enable 100% of VEP alerts to be reviewed. This would enable overpayments to be tackled “when they arise” rather than “waiting until carers have built up large debts”.Carers UK’s calculations were based onfraud and error datapublished by the DWP last week. The DWP report claims VEP has helped the department reduce levels of fraud and overpayment on carer’s allowance since they were last measured in 2020.A DWP spokesperson said: “The carer’s allowance overpayment rate is the lowest on record. And we are going further by increasing funding and bringing in more staff to check 100% of alerts to help prevent carers falling into debt.“We are absolutely clear that we want to eliminate waste and ensure people get the money they are entitled to, so we can invest in our public services as part of our plan for change.”Explore more on these topicsCarersSocial careBenefitsnewsShareReuse this content"

Specially trained officers are continuing to support Kayden’s family.“We believe this was a targeted attack and there is no risk to the wider public.“We have a dedicated team of officers working on this investigation and I am again asking anyone who may have information which could help us and who has not yet come forward to please contact us.“No matter how small it may seem, it may be the key piece we need. I would like to thank the community in both Irvine and East Kilbride for their support so far.”Supt Jim McMillan added: “This was a shocking and deeply upsetting incident for not just those at Irvine beach on Saturday, but for Kayden’s family, friends and the wider communities affected. We are engaging with the communities in both Irvine and East Kilbride.“There continues to be a police presence in the area and additional patrols will be carried out where required. I would urge anyone with question or concern to approach a local officer – they are there to help.”Kayden was a pupil at Duncanrig secondary school in East Kilbride.On behalf of the school, its headteacher, Annette Alexander, paid tribute to the teenager.She said: “We are deeply shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of our former pupil, Kayden Moy.“Kayden was a kind and caring young man and full of character. He touched the lives of many within our school community.”The 16-year-old was a former youth player for Busby AFC where those involved in the club have been left “devastated” by his death.In a statement posted on social media, the club said: “Kayden played in our youth set-up for several years and it has hit everyone hard.”The club has set up a GoFundMe appeal in memory of the teenager, which has already raised more than £9,200.A South Lanarkshire council spokesperson said: “This has been a tragic event and our profound sympathies go out to Kayden’s loved ones.“We are very much aware that it will have a wider impact on many people, including a number of our pupils.”Police said several people were believed to have been filming on their phones around the time of the incident and have urged anyone with information or footage to come forward as investigations continue.Detectives haveset up a websitewhere people can access a form to send information directly to the major investigation team, and anonymity can be maintained.Police Scotland can also be contacted on 101 quoting incident number 3106 of Saturday May 17 2025 while Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.Explore more on these topicsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The prison would be built in Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, a town bordering Suriname that once received prisoners shipped by Napoleon III in the 1800s, some of whom were sent to the notoriousDevil’s Islandoff the coast of French Guiana.The French justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, announced plans to build the high-security wing during an official visit to French Guiana on Saturday. He said in a Facebook post that 15 of the wing’s 60 spaces would be reserved for Islamic militants.Darmanin was quoted by Le Journal du Dimanche, a French weekly newspaper, as saying that the prison also aims to keep suspected drug traffickers from having any contact with their criminal networks.“We are seeing more and more drug trafficking networks,” he told reporters in French Guiana. “We must react.”French media, quoting the justice ministry, reported that people from French Guiana and French Caribbean territories would be sent in priority to the new prison.The announcement angered many across French Guiana, an overseas French department located in South America. It was once an infamous colony known for holding French political prisoners, including army Capt Alfred Dreyfus, who was accused of being a spy.Dreyfus was incarcerated on Devil’s Island, a penal colony that operated for a century and was featured in the bestselling French novel Papillon, which later was made into two movies.Jean-Paul Fereira, the acting president of French Guiana’s territorial collective, an assembly of 51 lawmakers that oversees local government affairs, said it was taken aback by the announcement since the plan to build a high-security wing was never discussed ahead of time.“It is therefore with astonishment and indignation that the elected members of the Collectivity discovered, with the entire population of Guiana, the information detailed in Le Journal Du Dimanche,” he wrote in a statement posted on social media.Fereira said the move was disrespectful and insulting, noting that the agreement French Guiana signed in 2017 was for the construction of a new prison meant to alleviate overpopulation at the main prison.“While all local elected officials have long been calling for strong measures to curb the rise of organised crime in our territory, Guiana is not meant to welcome criminals and radicalised people from (mainland France),” he wrote.Also decrying the plan was Jean-Victor Castor, a member of parliament in French Guiana. He said he wrote directly to France’s prime minister to express his concerns, noting that the decision was taken without consulting local officials.“It’s an insult to our history, a political provocation and a colonial regression,” Castor wrote in a statement issued on Sunday as he called on France to withdraw the project.A spokesperson for France’s justice minister did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He wasarrested in September 2024and has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.Richard, a former member of the pop group Danity Kane, began testifying on Friday afternoon and continued into Monday morning.She told the court she witnessed Combs physically abuse his former girlfriend, singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, who testified for four days last week and detailedyears of alleged physical and emotional abusefrom Combs during their relationship, which lasted from 2007 to 2018.First week of Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs trial: huge media attention and disturbing details of alleged abuseRead moreOn Friday, Richard recounted a 2009 incident at Combs’s Los Angeles home where she alleged she saw Combs attempt to hit Ventura with a skillet, before kicking and beating her.Richard testified that the next day, Combs threatened her and another witness to keep silent about the incident, warning them that where he comes from “people go missing if they say things like that, if they talk”.On Monday, Richard testified that she “frequently” saw Combs be violent toward Ventura and that she saw her with visible injuries.“Frequently, he would punch her, choke her, slap her in the mouth,” Richard said on Monday. “I saw him kick her, punch her in the stomach.“It could be because Cassie was speaking up for herself, it could be random.”Richard also claimed that members of Combs’s staff, including his bodyguards, also witnessed him being violent with Ventura, but told the court that “they wouldn’t react” or “do anything”.Defense attorneys for Combs tried to challenge Richard’s credibility during cross-examination, noting inconsistencies in her account of the 2009 incident.Richard finished testifying around 11.45am ET on Monday and told the court that she has a pending civil lawsuit against Combs.After Richard concluded her testimony, Kerry Morgan, a former longtime friend of Ventura, was called to the stand.Morgan, Ventura’s best friend from 2001 to 2018, testified that she witnessed Combs assault Ventura twice. One instance was in Jamaica, where Morgan alleged she saw Combs drag Ventura by her hair and throw her to the ground; another was in Los Angeles, where Morgan said she saw Combs hit Ventura and that one of his security guards refused to intervene.Morgan also recounted a separate incident from 2018 where she was personally assaulted by Combs, which Ventura also testified about last week. She said Combs struck her in the head with a wooden hanger and choked her while Ventura was in the bathroom. She later went to urgent care for a concussion.Cassie Ventura concludes testimony in Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sex-trafficking trialRead moreFollowing that incident, Morgan said that she considered filing a lawsuit but ultimately did not. Instead, she met with Ventura about a month later, who told her that she would be receiving $30,000 from Combs in exchange for signing a non-disclosure agreement. Morgan said that she received the money and signed the NDA.Both Morgan and Ventura testified that their friendship ended soon after the 2018 altercation.Morgan said that they stopped being friends because “her boyfriend assaulted me” and she added later, under cross-examination: “The reason I stopped speaking with her is because she was not supportive of me after that incident.”Morgan further testified that during Ventura’s relationship with Combs, Ventura would tell her that she couldn’t leave him, as he “controlled everything” in her life, including Ventura’s career and her apartment.Morgan said Ventura “lost” her self-confidence over time, noting that Combs would criticize Ventura’s appearance and behavior.The defense asked Morgan whether Ventura was ever jealous of Kim Porter, the mother of several of Combs’ children, with Morgan saying she was, and that Ventura “was jealous because she could never go to New Year’s Eve parties”.After Morgan concluded her testimony on Monday afternoon, the government called its next witness: David James, a personal assistant who worked for Combs between 2007 and 2009.James testified that during his 2007 interview for the job, a female executive pointed to a photo of Combs on the wall and said: “This is Mr Combs’s kingdom and we are all here to serve in it.” He also recalled that Combs once described Ventura as “moldable”.Additionally, James testified that he once suggested to Ventura that she leave; he said that she told him she couldn’t because Combs controlled her life and career.Court adjourned around 3pm ET. James will resume testimony on Tuesday.The federal trial beganlast week in Manhattan. Prosecutors allege that Combs ran a criminal enterprise that facilitated his drug-fueled sex sessions, referred to as “freak-offs”, involving paid sex workers.The government alleges that Combs used threats, violence and drugs to coerce women into participating in the freak-offs, including Ventura.During opening statements, Combs’s attorneys argued that the sexual encounters were consensual and part of a “swingers lifestyle”. They acknowledged Combs’s history of domestic violence and drug use, but argued that this doesn’t mean he is guilty of sex-trafficking or racketeering, and denied any criminal enterprise.A timeline of allegations and charges against Sean ‘Diddy’ CombsRead moreLast week, most of the focus was on the testimony from Ventura, Combs’s former girlfriend and the prosecution’s star witness.Ventura testified that Combscoerced and blackmailedher into participating in the drug-fueled sex parties with male sex workers he called “freak-offs”, and also alleged that Combs raped her in 2018 after their breakup.Over the week, prosecutors portrayed Combs as controlling and abusive, and as someone who exerted power over nearly every aspect of Ventura’s life and decisions.Attorneys for Combs tried to undermine Ventura’s credibility and sought to depict her as a willing and consenting – and at times enthusiastic – participant in the “freak-offs”.The trial is expected to last about seven more weeks.

You all think they can manage all this. I don’t think [they can],” he said.Dimon said he saw an “extraordinary amount of complacency” and added that he believes the possibility of stagflation – a recession with rising prices – was far higher than investors believe.Moody’s downgrade came asDonald Trumpstruggles to pushhis “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill through Congress, Moody’s said it expected the US budget deficit to keep rising.“Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” Moody’s said, announcing its downgrade. “We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration.”Trump administration officials sought to play down the significance of the setback. “Moody’s is a lagging indicator,” Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, told Meet the Press on NBC on Sunday.The US president has himself remained silent on the downgrade. On Monday morning, he used posts on his Truth Social platform tocriticize celebritiesincluding Beyoncé and Bruce Springsteen, whocastigated Trump on stagein Manchester last week, for supporting his political rivals.During a rare Sunday night vote, House RepublicansadvancedTrump’s tax cut and spending package out of a key committee.

Yields rise as bond prices drop; an increase signals that investors are seeking a higher return for holding US debt. The dollar weakened against a basket of currencies.“Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat,” said Moody’s. “In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government’s debt and interest burden higher.

Obtained from a source in southern France and traditionally served on ice with a slice of lemon, Perrier has long been long known as the “champagne of table waters”.But the report said the Swiss food giantNestlé, which acquired the brand in the early 1990s, had used purification filtering treatments that were not authorised for products labelled as “natural mineral water”.The senators said the “highest levels” of the French government had been alerted to the filtering treatments by Nestlé itself, but had failed to act quickly or to alert legal authorities.The senate report said that President Emmanuel Macron’s office at the Élysée “had known, at least since 2022, that Nestlé had been cheating for years”.Senators stressed there had been “no proven health risk to consumers”. But they said that consumers and local authorities had been misled.The report said: “In addition to Nestlé Waters’ lack of transparency, it is important to highlight the state’s lack of transparency, both towards local and European authorities and towards the French people.”The report found that government advisers handled the issue, but Élisabeth Borne, the then prime minister, appeared “not to have been informed”.EU regulations strictly limit what treatments are allowed for any product marketed as “natural mineral water”. Tap water is filtered and treated. But natural mineral water – which sells for 100–400 times the price of tap water – must be processed naturally and cannot be disinfected or treated in any way that alters its characteristics.France is one of the world leaders in natural mineral water production, with 104 natural sites across the country, a market worth €2.7bn (£2.3bn) and more than 41,000 direct and indirect jobs.But the industry was shaken in 2019 when a whistleblower raised an alert about one producer, Sources Alma – whose brands include Cristaline and Vichy Célestins –allegedly using non-authorised treatments to microfilter the water. A representative of Sources Alma later told the senate committee it had not used illegal treatments and its water was safe.The senate report said that, after the whistleblower’s warning, Nestlé Waters, whose brands include Vittel and Perrier, had voluntarily contacted the French government in 2021 – and later the president’s office – to say it had used filtering treatments. It submitted a plan to tackle the issue, which was later approved by the authorities.Alexis Kohler, then secretary general of Macron’s office at the Élysée, had met Nestlé executives, according to senators. But he declined to give evidence to the senate committee. In February, Macron denied any knowledge of the case.The senate said the relationship between Nestlé and the government became so close that the wording of a state report on water had been altered to fit with Nestlé’s requests. The Socialist senator Alexandre Ouizille, who led the six-month senate committee on mineral water said this was “inexplainable, inexcusable, incomprehensible”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It said it had always defended the safety of its products and had been transparent to authorities. It denied having put pressure on government.The company paid a €2m fine to avoid legal action over the use of illegal water sources and filtering. It said at the time that that the replacement filters were approved by the government and that its water was “pure”.Foodwatch, an independent food monitoring NGO, has filed a complaint against Nestlé Waters, accusing it of deceiving consumers. An investigation has been launched by a judge in Paris.Nestlé Waters’ chief executive, Muriel Lienau, stated during her hearing before the senate committee in March, that all of the group’s waters were “pure at the source”.In a statement to Agence France-Presse, Lienau said she acknowledged the senate report, which “recognises the importance of sectoral issues requiring regulatory clarification and a stable framework applicable to all”.Nestlé Waters also insisted that it had “never contested” the legitimacy of the senate’s work.Explore more on these topicsFranceFood & drink industryWaterEuropeEmmanuel MacronNestlénewsShareReuse this content"

We were told to lay down a 20-second backing track, a guide vocal – then go and play table tennis’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 19 May 2025 09.33 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 12.07 EDTShareKevin Godley, singer, songwriterLol Creme and I left 10cc at the height of the success because we felt things were starting to become repetitive. We came from an art school background and we were thinking visually. Even at that stage, there were two film-makers waiting to come out.We made a short video to promote our single An Englishman in New York, and thought the medium was brilliant. After we made theFade to Greyvideo for Steve Strange’s Visage, people like Duran Duran and Herbie Hancock asked us to make videos for them.We were in New York editing a Police concert film when we met Trevor Horn in the hotel bar, and we decided to make some music together. We had this idea for a song called Hit the Box based on channel-hopping in the US but realised it wouldn’t work in the UK because there were only three channels. Then we remembered a song we’d started to write 15 years previously. All we had was the first verse – “You don’t know how to ease my pain” – but Trevor liked it.We had always produced ourselves, but Trevor and his crack team were revolutionising the way records were being made. We laid down a 20-second backing track and a guide vocal and were told to go and play table tennis while their machinery ingested it. When we came back they’d created this lovely bed of sound. Lol added some delicious chords and I was told to “Just sing something” to fill four minutes. The lyrics were stream of consciousness, but we knew we had something special.We wanted Torvill and Dean to skate in the video! But their diaries didn’t match. So we picked loads of faces from a casting book and filmed them all singing Cry. Some said they could lip-sync but couldn’t, but it all looked great in 35mm black and white. This was before morphing, so we used these things called “wipes” which meant one face could dissolve into another. A man might turn into a woman or a punk into an old person, creating an entity that didn’t exist before. It felt magical. Of course, Lol and my faces are in it. Our “plan B” ended up becoming one of the most talked about videos of the 1980s. Years later Elbow asked me to recreate the Cry video for their songGentle Storm. Guy Garvey said that when he was a kid it had been a “seismic event”.Trevor Horn, producerI was in New York trying to produce Foreigner when Thereza Bazar from Dollar rang to tell me she was hanging out with Godley & Creme in the bar at the Meridien, and asked if I’d like to come over. Someone in the Foreigner crew had been trying to turn me on to ZZ Top by making me smoke this really strong weed called “Thunderfuck”, so I was pretty spaced out. Kevin and Lol said: “Don’t worry, so are we.”We started hanging out and one night I started to manipulate the dial on the hotel room TV rhythmically, like scratching, which was the beginnings of Hit the Box. I had the studio set up for Foreigner so that weekend we used it to record that Godley & Creme track. But on the Monday morning Foreigner said: “We heard you came in at the weekend and we heard what you did. It’s fucking awful.” They were so angry with me that I suggested to Kevin and Lol that we put the project to one side and reconvene in England.By then I’d done loads of 12-inch singles and was getting sick of abstract electronic stuff so I asked them: “Haven’t you just got a nice song?” They found this very funny – “A ‘nice song’?!” Kevin and Lol were like a comedy duo in those days, but they got a guitar and played me Cry.We were in Surrey Sound Studios with Nigel Gray, a brilliant engineer/producer who made Andy Summers’s guitar sound so good on the Police records. Nigel got Lol a great guitar sound. Kevin always had a beautiful voice. JJ Jeczalik from the Art of Noise did the rhythm track and Steve Lipson engineered it. We used Fairlight and Synclavier synths.It was all done very quickly and I thought it came out well. Once you saw the video you couldn’t hear the song without imagining it.In 2017 my band played Cry live at Fairport’s Cropredy festival, with a guy called Jamie Squire singing. I just thought: “God, this track sounds really great.” It’s been in our setlist ever since.The 11CD box set Parts of the Process – The Complete Godley & Creme is out now on Demon/Edsel.

He remembers their last days together – and what truths he learned from the darkly moving filmMon 19 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 08.10 EDTShareTim Roth reclines in his chair and exudes an unexpected lightness, as if the Atlantic Ocean is casting a summer spray over this corner of Galway. He is upbeat about life, film and even acting, which he once called anightmare professionhe would not recommend to anyone.“Oh, did I say that?” he asks, surprised. “I don’t feel that way at all, actually. I must have been having a bad one, but that’s OK.” He shrugs and smiles. “I actually love it more and more at the moment.”It’s a cheering sentiment, and incongruous. As an actor and director Roth is known for plumbing human darkness, a “swallowed pain”. And we are here on a damp morning at afilm festivalon Ireland’s west coast to talk about grief, a fictional grief depicted in his latest film Poison and an all too real, brutal grief that ambushed his family soon after the cameras stopped rolling.“The film was actually dealing with something which now is very, very poignant as far as our family is concerned,” he says quietly, the accent pure London, even after decades in Hollywood. “There is no one way of grieving. People react differently – everyone does – otherwise there would be a cure for it.”View image in fullscreen‘He was unfazed’ … with son Cormac in Cannes in 2021.Photograph: Sébastien Nogier/EPAPoison, a directorial debut by Désirée Nosbusch, casts Roth andTrine Dyrholmas an estranged couple who reunite a decade after the death of their son, who must be exhumed because toxins are leaking into the cemetery. Based on aplayby the Dutch writer Lot Vekemans, it is a raw emotional duel shot almost entirely at a real Luxembourg cemetery.In October 2022, a few months after filming wrapped, Roth’s son Cormacdied at the age of 25. The guitarist and composer had been diagnosed with stage 3 germ cell cancer a year earlier. Roth had considered dropping out of the pending shoot, which was a long flight from the family home in Los Angeles, but Cormac urged him to do it. “He was unfazed by me doing the film. He thought it was a good thing. He was probably wanting to get me out of the house as well,” says Roth, with a wry smile. “It had his seal of approval, otherwise I wouldn’t have done it. If he needed me to stay close, I would have been staying close.”I don’t look right for action films – they never really crop upShooting required Roth and Dyrholm to spend extended periods in the cemetery – filming paused during funerals – but the actor remained hopeful about Cormac. “At that point we were trying to remain positive because he was still with us,” Roth recalls. The tone is matter-of-fact, the pain shielded.Poison depicts a couple torn apart by bereavement, a forensic dissection of an inability to share loss. “The film has such a truth to it because it shows that how you grieve is as individual as a fingerprint,” says Roth. “Now with my friends and family I see that everyone is doing and handling that differently and need to be respected for it.”Before filming Roth told Nosbusch his son was ill. The director had had a scare with her own son years earlier when he was diagnosed with diabetes – an experience that drew her to Vekemans’ play. She says she gave the actor time and space: “I did not go up to him every day to ask, ‘How is it?’ It was all with looks. Sometimes he needed a break and I go, ‘Sure.’”View image in fullscreenIn a Luxembourg cemetery … Roth on location with Nosbusch (left) and Dyrholm.Photograph: Hyde Park Entertainment/©Mark-de-BlokNosbusch was devastated when she learned Cormac had died. “I was heartbroken because I honestly for a moment felt like, ‘Was my movie bad luck? Did my movie become a reality?’” Roth told her he had no regrets about making the film and that in a way it helped him to face what was to come.In a statement after Cormac’s death Roth, his wife Nikki Butler and their other son Hunter said the grief “came in waves” and that they had lost a “wild and electric ball of energy”. They quoted one of Cormac’s mottoes: “Make sure you do the things you love.”Perhaps it is a comfort to Roth senior that in pursuing acting, which he fell in love with as a teenager, he has heeded the injunction. The result is a long, varied career ranging from obscure art house to blockbuster, with Roth’s passion for his craft always evident on screen.The genesis was a school musical of Dracula. “I did a bad knockoff of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. But I was hooked.” He briefly did other jobs, packing shelves at Tesco, sorting Christmas mail, phone hustles. “I was one of those guys that would ring you up and try and sell you advertising. I was awful at it.”His first break was the 1982 television playMade in Britain, which cast Roth as a racist skinhead and brought leading roles in Tom Stoppard’s 1990 Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead, Robert Altman’s 1990 biopic Vincent & Theo and as Mr Orange inQuentin Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs. The New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael described Roth’s acting as “a form of kinetic discharge”.An eclectic, non-stop career followed. “I made a conscious decision very early on … that I wanted to be an actor and not a movie person,” says the 64-year-old. Asked if he would consider a Liam Neeson-style swerve to action flicks, he almost laughs. “I don’t look right. It’s never really cropped up. I just don’t fit.” Actually he might: he is lean, with a trimmed beard, jeans and boots.View image in fullscreenFirst break … in 1982’s Made in Britain.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockRoth divides jobs into two categories. “There are the ones to pay the rent. Your agent will call and go, ‘Money job if you need one.’ And there are the ones you do for yourself.” The former has bequeathed some cringes, he concedes. “I’ve done some atrocious work.” Roth declines to supply a list of shame – “No! You all know it” – but No 1, surely, was playing Sepp Blatter inUnited Passions, Fifa’s 2015 derided love-letter to itself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionStill, debacles teach you things, says Roth. “Sometimes they’re the most valuable experiences. You have to do your best even if your heart is not in it. Sometimes, when you’re doing a bad film, those are the best experiences.”Some big budget fare he recalls with affection. He says he played Abomination in The Incredible Hulk – a villain he reprised in Disney’s TV series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law – to embarrass his children, who were then at school. Other lavish productions included Tim Burton’s Planet of the Apes and Sky Atlantic’s crime dramaTin Star.To not taint the memory of a shoot Roth does not watch his own films or read reviews. “Youkeep them in your head and the battering they take down the line is a separate issue. Maybe it’s just protection.” That applies even to films that are well received, though he made exceptions to watch Tarantino’sThe Hateful Eightand Michel Franco’s dramaChronicabout an end-of-life care nurse.Having directed The War Zone – a harrowing drama of incest and sexual violence that drew on hisown abuse as a boy– Roth is sympathetic to first-time directors. “I love watching them figure it out on set as they’re going along. It takes a long time to get to that position, quite often, and hard graft. Then they get their day.”Poison fits that profile. Nosbusch, an actor and former Eurovision presenter, spent a decade wrangling funding and talent. “It’s two people talking in a cemetery. It took a lot of convincing,” she says.View image in fullscreenMr Orange … Roth, third from right, in Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs.Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/Rank Film/AllstarThe next time I speak to Roth is over Zoom from New York, where he is making a “comedyish” film set on Staten Island in the run-up to theJanuary 6 Capitol attack. I wonder what he thinks of the growing anxiety over far-right populism.“Trump? I think he’s doing incredibly well,” says Roth. There is a pause, then he cracks a wry smile. “It’s thoroughly depressing and heartbreaking. It feels like he is the guy that opens the door for the real dangers … so even when he’s gone, I worry about what will be left behind. It is quite scary.” Roth has had no problem entering or leaving the US, where he lives, but he worries about friends. “I’m in pretty good shape, I’m a white Londoner. That’s just the fact of it.” But he has friends “who are in danger”, he says, without elaborating.He is puzzled by Trump’s announcement oftariffs on foreign films, ostensibly to boost production in Hollywood. “None of us quite understand it. I don’t think he does. Until something actually happens we don’t know how to react.”Roth is delighted the Tories no longer rule his homeland – “a very good thing for humanity” – but sounds underwhelmed at the Labour government’s record so far. He worries thatNigel Faragewill gain momentum. “I like calling him Farridge,” says Roth, rhyming the name with cabbage. “I don’t like calling him anything, actually.”Roth’s home in Pasadena, north-east of LA, narrowly escaped thewildfires. “They were up in the mountain just above us. Trees were flying; we were very lucky that they didn’t fly into the house.”Despite the perils of politics and nature, and the occasional fantasy of moving to Europe, Roth has no plans to leave. “We went there because the schools were good. That was it. That’s the only reason we moved out there and I love it. It’s where my kids grew up. It has incredible history for me.” Left unsaid, in the silence that follows, is the grief etched in that history.Poison is on Sky Cinema on 18 MayExplore more on these topicsTim RothfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In Alberta, Canada on a palaeontology dig being filmed for the return of the BBC seriesWalking with Dinosaurs, I have been allowed to unearth a dinosaur bone.It has not seen the light of day for about 73m years, and now, armed with just a hammer, awl and brush, I am chipping away at the rock around it to bring it to human eyes for the first time. One tap too hard in the wrong place and the fossilised bone could break.Fortunately, I’m guided by more than just my recollections of the archaeology seriesTime Team. Overseeing me at Alberta’s Pipestone Creek Bonebed is leading Canadian palaeontologist Emily Bamforth, one of the advisers on the revival of WWD – the hit turn-of-the-millennium series which recreated extinct species through CGI and animatronics.The bones we are excavating, Bamforth says, are thought to have been caused when a flash flood or fire engulfed a herd of horned, herbivore dinosaurs (found only in North America) called Pachyrhinosaurus. As if the poor creatures hadn’t suffered enough, they now have me trying to unearth them.View image in fullscreenRock steady … The dig team uncovers a fossil.Photograph: BBC Studios/Stephen CooterAt first it is hard to differentiate between rock and remains. But Pipestone Creek Bonebed has one of the densest concentrations of dinosaur bones in the world, up to 200 bones per square metre. The prehistoric graveyard contains an estimated 10,000 creatures that will take more than a century to excavate – so it is not long before the “bone salad”, as one of the dig team calls it, is apparent.Fortunately, with Bamforth’s guidance (and while humming theJurassic Parktheme tune under my breath) I complete my task without breaking anything. I then watch her team expertly remove a large bone from the ground using a plaster “jacket” to protect it during its journey to be cleaned and analysed in a laboratory at thePhilip J Currie Dinosaur Museumwhere Bamforth is curator.Her work, and that of more than 200 palaeontologists around the world, has helped inform the look of the new WWD, with their discoveries informing the dinosaurs’ behaviours and appearance on screen.A lot has changed since the Kenneth Branagh-narrated series first aired in 1999, including the fact that many people now believe dinosaurs, like dragons, did not actually exist. WWD showrunner Kirsty Wilson explains that talking to people while travelling during the two years of filming, she realised, “so many people … used to seeing [dinosaurs] in Jurassic Park etc … think of them as mythical animals”. One taxi driver even asked her if dragons are real.Whether our post-factual world, AI or the popularity of TV series such asHouse of the Dragonare to blame, who knows? But Wilson hopes this series will disabuse people of that notion. She says whereas the original WWD “was purely visual special effects and animatronics [with] no dig sites involved at all, this time around, we’re … doing our homework for the audience to see. We wanted to feature the real science that goes on.”View image in fullscreenMore scientifically accurate … a Tyrannosaurus rex with lips in Walking with Dinosaurs.Photograph: BBC Studios/Lola Post ProductionFocusing on one individual dinosaur in each of the six episodes – now narrated by actor Bertie Carvel – is another difference from the 1999 original. This will, Wilson says, “bring to life really cracking stories that will keep everybody engaged. What we really hope is that people will be emotionally involved with these animals as real animals.” They range from a single dad Spinosaurus – the largest carnivorous dinosaur to walk the earth – to a lovesick, herbivore Lusotitan.BBC Studios executive producer Helen Thomas says the genesis for reviving WWD was its 25th anniversary plus the runaway success in 2022 of a show she worked on calledDinosaurs: The Final Day with David Attenborough, which used a prehistoric graveyard to tell the story of the demise of the giant reptiles.Wilson explains: “We wanted to bring back WWD and tap into that nostalgia, legacy, and all the things that made the series so brilliant, but also completely reimagine it … bring it up to date and do something new and exciting with it.”That includes the latest thinking about some dinosaurs’ appearance, which might prove a huge surprise. In the Currie Museum’s lab and collection, Bamforth and WWD assistant producer Sam Wigfield show me some of the fossils of leaves, skin, teeth and bone that have changed palaeontologists’ view of dinosaurs.“In our Tyrannosaurus rex episode, the T rexes have lips, which is not a Jurassic Park feature because they want to show off all the teeth. But actually the growing consensus is they had lips, which is less Hollywood, but more scientifically accurate,” says Wigfield.View image in fullscreenA far more exciting range … a utahraptor displays its feathers.Photograph: BBC Studios/Lola Post ProductionAs well as showing that various dinosaurs were feathered, the reptiles will also be depicted in a much more exciting range of skin tones than the previous brown or green.“In the natural world we see a vast array of very bright colours,” says Wigfield. “We worked with palaeontologists and experts to introduce flashes of colour … So we have Albertosaurus – terrifying predators – with pink eyebrows.”To make the show more realistic, the computer-generated dinosaurs have been put against real-life locations similar to their own habitat. Crew members like Wigfield and production manager Emma Chapman acted out the parts of the creatures using cutouts, tape measures and tennis balls on poles so every move could be worked out. They even used pizza boxes on their feet to smooth over their tracks to save having to pay VFX specialists to “wipe out” their prints on screen.Chapman – who has been instrumental in making the show’s logistics work – recounts another trick used to save VFX money: 3D-printing a giant blue screen dinosaur head to get the right ripples in water.Getting moving water to look natural is expensive, so a 2-metre model of a Spinosaurus head was made and shipped to the filming location in Portugal. But she says even that was quite challenging, “because the director wanted it to sink, because a Spinosaurus swims. So we were in a swimming pool, burrowing holes in it to try to get this thing to sink!”Due to fans’ love for the first series, there is “added pressure”, says Chapman, but after the release of the trailer, excitement is building among fans of the original – many of whom now have children and will bring a new generation to what Thomas calls the “BBC’s iconic intellectual property”.With its worldwide appeal (the first series was watched by 700 million viewers globally) WWD is likely to make thePhilip J Currie Museuma TV tourism hotspot, particularly as it is offering “palaeontologist for a day” trips to go on a dig.Speaking after my dig, Bamforth says she is “hopeful” WWD will make dinosaurs “more real for people” who may “struggle to understand that dinosaurs were real in the sense that animals today are real. It’s so long ago and they’re so alien to anything we have today.”Walking withDinosaursairs on BBC One and iPlayer on 25 MayExplore more on these topicsTelevisionDinosaursFossilsPalaeontologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And then what do we get?”The easily distracted US president has not elaborated further on his film tariff plans since the announcement on 5 May. Anopen lettersigned by major studios, film industry unions and Trump’s own “Hollywood ambassadors” Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone instead calls on the government to try to revive America’s film industry with tax incentives, specifically mentioning those in place in the United Kingdom and Australia.The Phoenician Scheme review - Mia Threapleton shines in Wes Anderson’s muted new confectionRead moreIn The Phoenician Scheme, Puerto Rican actor “““, a ruthless and egocentric industrialist who grows concerned about his fortune’s future after surviving an assassination attempt and begins to glimpse the error of his ways.Anderson described Korda as embodying “the darkness of a certain kind of capitalist”, and as “a character who is not really concerned with how the big decisions he has empowered himself to make for the world are affecting populations of workforces and landscapes”.View image in fullscreenMichael Cera, Benicio del Toro and Wes Anderson during the Phoenician Scheme press conference.Photograph: Monica Schipper/Getty ImagesThe Phoenician Scheme stars an array of Hollywood royalty, with major and minor appearances from Bill Murray, Tom Hanks, Benedict Cumberbatch, Scarlett Johansson and Michael Cera.

Night and day, I slaved away, dipping strips of newspaper into a mix of flour and water, then patting it onto a giant-sized balloon. Never have I defined myself as anything close to arty. So why did I decide to dedicate a significant portion of my life to an elaborate craft project? The answer, of course, is simple. The olive costume is iconic, as the signature feature of the greatest teen movie ever made.Just ask any girl who grew up in Britain in the noughties, and they’ll recognise the image: Georgia Nicholson, played by Georgia Groome, frantically running through the streets of Eastbourne dressed as a mammoth green hors d’oeuvre. Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging, the film based on the first two books inLouise Rennison’s series, was studied at our teenage sleepovers. We pored over it, reciting its lines as if they were from a sacred text. Even now, I can reel off the classic quotes without thinking. “Boys don’t like girls for funniness,” if you didn’t already know.‘A plea for tolerance’: why Wagon Master is my feelgood movieRead moreDirected by Gurinder Chadha, the film encapsulated the essence of girlhood, with all its sweaty-palmed anxieties and humiliations. Fourteen-year-old Georgia is riding the rollercoaster of adolescence in all of its glory. There are birthday parties to plan, boys to “stalk” and fall head over heels for, and embarrassing mums and dads to control. To the 12-year-old version of me, these were the important issues. So, freshly released from our parents’ clutches, my friends and I joined the cinema queues to meet our soon-to-be idol. Georgia Nicolson spoke for all of us – about mistakenly shaved eyebrows and the horror of being caught wearing huge knickers; a hero of our age and time.With its killer soundtrack, featuring the likes of the Maccabees, the Rumble Strips and Lily Allen, it became the film that defined the summer of 2008. We watched the film religiously, on our own or all together, copying the games Georgia and the Ace Gang played and rating our limited sexual experiences on “the snogging scale” they’d devised. The Ace Gang had characteristics that we recognised in ourselves: they were people ashamed of their very existence but desperate to climb into adult life.Over the years, the film’s narrative became an easy point of comparison. When the first of my female friends got a boyfriend and became significantly less interested in the rest of us, she was a traitor “just like Jas” in the movie. Fake tan mishaps turned our skin a shade “even cheesier” than Georgia’s “Wotsits” legs. Recently, I heard that a boy I know was writing a song about someone he’s dating. “Let’s hope it is more Ultraviolet than Bitch in a Uniform,” I joked with a friend.Why exactly did it seep into our vernacular? Maybe it was because it was the first film we saw that took our teenage problems seriously. While others treated girls’ stresses as something trivial, Chadha’s movie made them feel epic, on the scale we actually felt them. Watching Georgia worry about passing off as normal was refreshing, and in times of crisis – like if I had argued with one of my friends or the boy I was obsessing over that school year got a new girlfriend – I’d play the movie again and again.‘Pure sugar-rush mayhem’: why I Wanna Hold Your Hand is my feelgood movieRead moreImportantly, for our spiralling young minds, Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging was not all doom and gloom and even provided us with glimmers of hope. Because, guess what? The ending proves that Georgia’s “sex god” boyfriend, Robbie, actually likes her “just the way” she is. This, somehow, meant that we might also be OK as ourselves.The hormonal chaos of teenagehood now feels long ago. But a session watching Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging takes me right back to the era of Motorola Razr phones, fluorescent-coloured tights and when kissing with tongues felt like a terrifying milestone. It was a time that felt truly mortifying but gloriously eye-opening, too.And so, I tried to relive it, for nostalgia’s sake. Like Georgia, I wore my olive costume to a fancy dress party, where many of the other guests were dressed as devils and cats. But, unlike Georgia, my outfit was well received – celebrated even – by basically every woman in attendance. That’s the magic of Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging for our generation. It reminds us of the joyous madness of our school days, when everything was awkward, messy and packed with heart.Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging is available on Hoopla and Kanopy in the US or to rent digitally or on Amazon Prime and Paramount+ in the UKExplore more on these topicsFilmMy feelgood movieComedy filmsRomance filmsTeen moviesComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their songs of the 1970s and 80s are pure pleasure; sun-kissed, smooth and mellow. It is a music of high noon, no shadows.But what happens when twilight comes? Daryl Hall is 78. The partnership with John Oates, 77, has reacheda messy end, with lawyers involved. Now he is on the road, under his own name, playing the songs of his gilded youth in a more tarnished age.He strolls on to the Glasgow stage in a broad-brimmed hat and spends much of the set seated at a grand piano. His voice is not what it was in the same way as the Colosseum is not what it was: what remains is an interesting ruin. Where once his singing was a wonder of clarity, stamina and control, he now struggles. Sometimes, trying for high notes, he places a hand at the top of his chest, as if the effort is a strain. His slick six-piece band do a lot of heavy lifting on backing vocals. He has made an addition to the lyrics of Sara Smile that feels telling: “After all these years … time is talking to me.”Yet there is beauty in this brokenness. Everytime You Go Away is a highlight because the feeling of bruised experience in his voice suits the subject of the song – a sad letting-go.Daryl Hall & John Oates: ‘We had a lethal ability to experiment’Read moreThe big feelgood moments come from his sidemen. Shane Theriot’s guitar solos on Private Eyes and Rich Girl are undeniably cool, though not as cool as Charlie DeChant, a glitzy wizard with long white hair and a gold-sequined jacket who started playing with Hall & Oates in 1976. To see him shuffle forward and perform the insouciant sax break on Maneater is to witness a little moment of pop magic.Such virtuosity magnifies rather than hides the diminishment in Hall’s voice. It feels at times like he is the weak link in his own great music. Perhaps he should do a Dylan: rework the songs radically so that he can do them justice. But would his fans go for that?Daryl Hall plays Royal Albert Hall, London, 19 May. Then tours the UKuntil 25 MayExplore more on these topicsPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

It was an adventure playground in Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island and a rowdy neighbour in Daphne du Maurier’s Jamaica Inn. It played the wine-dark seducer in Homer’s Odyssey and the snot-green tormentor in Joyce’s Ulysses. But while its colour can change and its humour may vary, its fictional properties remain reassuringly stable. The sea is our unconscious, a repository of memory, the beginning and end of all things. It’s what Jules Verne described as the “Living Infinite”.In Madeleine Thien’s rapturous fourth novel, The Book of Records, “the Sea” is the name given to a gargantuan migrant compound, sprawled on the shoreline a decade or two in the future. Lina and her ailing father, Wui Shin, occupy an apartment on the labyrinthine 12th floor, from where they can watch the refugee boats pull in and depart. The pair have fled the flooded Pearl River Delta, leaving behind Lina’s mother, brother and aunt but carrying three volumes from an epic biographical series entitled The Great Lives of Voyagers. These tattered instalments cover the respective histories of the German-Jewish philosopher Hannah Arendt, the Chinese poet Du Fu and the Portuguese-Jewish scholar Baruch Spinoza. They provide both a link to the past and a sextant to navigate by. The world exists in endless flux, Lina is told, and yet here in the Sea nothing ever goes missing. Its chambers fill and empty like locks on a canal. Different portions of the compound appear to correspond with different decades. “The buildings of the Sea are made of time,” Wui Shin explains.Naturally this near-future migrant fable is also by extension a novel of ideas. It’s about the ways in which experience and knowledge are handed down or slip free, to the point where we inherit and inhabit the lives of those who have gone before. Wui Shin once worked as a “cyberspace engineer” for a state-controlled tech firm, restricting access to the Chinese internet. His daughter’s story, though, plays out as an unfettered open inquiry, cross-referencing the laws of physics with the writings of Kafka, Proust and Italo Calvino. Thien – who was born in Canada to Chinese parents – is fascinated by the relationship of memory to history and by the cross-pollination of separate cultures and writers. Intriguingly, her 2016 Booker-shortlisted novelDo Not Say We Have Nothingcontains a close cousin of Lina’s Great Lives series: the fragment from a book of historical records which has been copied by hand and smuggled out of China. The Sea recycles its wares, just as novelists do. Each standalone story is like a beaker dipped and drawn from a wider body of work.Lina will go on to spend many years in the Sea, but as the book begins, the girl has no sooner settled into her apartment than the doors slide open to reveal her neighbours. The refugees gather around the new arrival like Dorothy’s companions in The Wizard of Oz. They breezily introduce themselves as Jupiter, Bento and Blucher, but they are also the avatars of Du Fu, Spinoza and Arendt. It is through their stories that we learn how Spinoza was labelled a heretic in 17th-century Amsterdam and Arendt went to ground in Nazi-occupied France. “You do know a lot about Du Fu,” Lina tells Jupiter at one point. “What am I,” Jupiter replies, “other than the things I know?”The 12th floor of the Sea is a rarefied realm. Conversations constantly circle back to the big subjects: history and language; freedom and identity. And yet The Book of Records offers more than an intellectual talking shop. Its cramped apartment is the springboard from which the story glides out through various vibrant subplots, each furnished with a cast of vivid bit-players, some of whom (the blond visa clerk with the runny nose; the apprentice lens grinder with the bandaged hand) are described and dispensed with in a deft line or two. Lina’s three migrants are essentially ghosts themselves, passing through history in the blink of an eye. But their respective quests are made to feel urgent and ongoing, and we thrill to their adventures as though they are happening in real time. Arendt and her husband eventually cross the Pyrenees on foot, stumbling on the narrow mountain path, watching out for border guards. They dream of a safe Atlantic passage and a fresh start in New York, “a place in the future where the past can meet”.The Book of Records is a rich and beautiful novel. It’s serious but playful; a study of limbo and stasis that nonetheless speaks of great movement and change. If this turbulent, mercurial tale has an anchor, it is its belief that “in order to extend life and preserve civilisation, we are obliged to rescue one another”. Thien explains in the acknowledgments that she has lifted this quote from The Book of Mountains and Rivers, a 2012 essay collection by the Chinese writer Yu Qiuyu. She hands it on from Arendt to Blucher to Lina in the Sea, as though it’s a baton or a lifeline that connects all the world’s great voyagers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The implication that AI is a class-A injectable substance, liable to render the user stupefied and addicted, was presumably unintentional. But then what on earthdidthey mean about AI’s potential, and did they have any good reason to believe it?Not according to the authors of this book, who are refreshingly sarcastic about what they think is just another tech bubble. What is sold to us as AI, they announce, is just “a bill of goods”: “A few major well-placed players are poised to accumulate significant wealth by extracting value from other people’s creative work, personal data, or labor, and replacing quality services with artificial facsimiles.”Take the large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, which essentially work like fancy auto­complete and routinelymake up citationsto nonexistent sources. They have been “trained” – as though they are lovable puppies – on vast databases of books as well as scrapings from websites. (Meta has deliberately ingested one such illegal database,LibGen, claiming it is “fair use”.) Meanwhile, “a survey conducted by the Society of Authors found that 26% of authors, translators, and illustrators surveyed had lost work due to generative AI.”Better to think of LLMs, Bender and Hanna suggest, as “synthetic text-extruding machines”. “Like an industrial plastic process,” they explain, text databases “are forced through complicated machinery to produce a product that looks like communicative language, but without any intent or thinking mind behind it”. The same is true of other “generative” AI models that spit out images and music. They are all, the authors say, “synthetic media machines” – or, as I like to call them, giant plagiarism machines. “Both language models and text-to-image models will out-and-out plagiarize their inputs,” the authors write, noting that the New York Times issuingOpenAI for just this reason.But reliance on AI is not just bad for artists in garrets; it’s bad for everyone, as Bender and Hanna persuasively argue. The fact that internet search results now start with an AI-generated summary, they point out, is likely to dull critical thinking – and not just because such summaries have in the past told people that they should eat rocks, but because “scanning a set of links gives us information about what information sources are available” and so builds “our understanding of the information landscape”.The real appeal of AI, as the authors see it, is that it promises to enable the making of vast numbers of people redundant. They recount, for example, how the National Eating Disorders Association in the USreplacedtheir hotline operators with a chatbot days after the former voted to unionise. According to the World Economic Forum’s 2025 report, 40% of employers are planning to reduce staff headcounts as they adopt AI in the coming years.I, for one, do not want to live in a cultural wasteland of AI-generated garbage. But, amusing as this book’s broadside against the giant plagiarism machines is, it tends to lump everything else that can be called “AI” in with them. And the authors do know better: “AI is a marketing term,” they note at the start. “It doesn’t refer to a coherent set of technologies.” They do allow, subsequently, that there are “sensible use-cases” for such tech, such as image processing that helps radiologists, but there are many more that go unmentioned.Under a broader definition of “AI” as machine-learning systems, emerging tools can, according to a recent overview by the Economist, manage load on the electricity grid more effectively, cut the time required to inspect nuclear facilities and help reduce emissions in trucking, shipping, steelmaking and mining industries. The British engineer Demis Hassabis won the Nobel in chemistry last year for his company DeepMind’s work on protein folding, which may yet have profound applications in drugmaking. And, less glamorously, machines can now automatically transcribe doctors’ notes: an example these authors present as a reason it’s bad that AI is infiltrating the NHS, but surely one that is a win-win for doctors and patients alike.Nevertheless, Bender and Hanna are right to insist that each such case should be scrutinised for its utility, the biases it might smuggle in, and its propensity to destroy jobs that depend on human judgment. They cite a famous old rule from IBM: “A computer can never be held accountable, therefore a computer must never make a management decision.” But that is precisely why some in power want to hand decision‑making capacity to computers: it promises a sunlit utopia of profit without blame. Once AI is mainlined into our veins, we may be too doped up to care.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

There are three of them (a nod to Botticelli’s three graces): one silver, one black, one white, all made from polyester jazzed up with colourful mosaic and shimmering mirrors. She has captured them mid-twirl, arms tossed in the air like they just don’t care, legs kicked out at jaunty angles. They are joyful and radiant, monumental and robust, dancers and warriors.Snakes and Nanas: the voluptuous art of Niki de Saint Phalle – in picturesRead moreSaint Phalle, a French American artist, began creating her abstract sculptures of women in the mid-60s, a decade after she first met the Swiss sculptor Jean Tinguely in Paris. He was married and so was she but five years later, both divorced, they got together; by the time they were married in 1971 both were seeing other people. It was a complicated, sometimes competitive relationship – romantically and artistically – that saw them collaborate and support each other creatively until Tinguely’s death in 1991. Saint Phalle looked after his legacy until her own death in 2002. Now, on the centenary of his birth, a new exhibition is presenting their work side by side – at least once we get off the grass and into the gallery.View image in fullscreenTirelessly devoted … Tinguely and Saint Phalle at work in 1967.Photograph: Courtesy Niki Charitable Art Foundation and Hauser & Wirth Harry Shunk and Shunk-KenderAs if to make up for the solo Saint Phalle welcome outside, the first room is almost entirely dedicated to Tinguely’s strange kinetic sculptures – presided over by another powerful Saint Phalle belle. Having grown up in Basel, where he later worked as a window decorator and studied drawing, Tinguely moved to Paris in 1952 and began to animate his Calder-esque wire works with electric motors. Here, half-a-dozen contraptions made with scrap metal and found materials from branches to rubber belts stutter to life every few minutes, clanking and clattering in time with their moving parts. Originally visitors would have pressed buttons to make them move. Sadly, now they’re old and rickety, they are programmed to turn on one by one (though apparently the rockers can be a bit erratic).Built from the 1950s until his death, Tinguely’s whirring designs might verge on comic but they’re as relevant today as they were when first exhibited. A physical (and audible) manifestation of the anxieties of automation, his semi-robotic assemblages – among them his Métamatics, or drawing machines – were initially met with resistance. At Hauser & Wirth, one device doodles in pen on to an unfurling roll of paper while another scribbles on a single sheet. Standing in front of them, questions inevitably arise about authenticity and the creative capabilities of man vs machine.View image in fullscreenLa Grande Tête (The Big Head).Photograph: Ken Adlard/Courtesy Niki Charitable Art Foundation and Hauser & WirthViewed alongside his angular scrap metal, Saint Phalle’s sculptures are deliciously colourful and curvy. When viewed together, they hum with life. The couple began collaborating in the late 1950s; for her first sculpture, she commissioned him to create an iron armature which she covered with plaster. A black-and-white polyester head with a rosy pout sits on the shoulders of a motorised contraption made from wood and iron; when the motor starts, the head shifts back and forth, its lightbulb crown flashing. Elsewhere, a miniature nana performs an arabesque on an iron stand that spins her round like a ballerina in a jewellery box. On display for the first time are the gold pieces of furniture Saint Phalle made for A Dream Longer Than the Night (1976), the bizarre and frequently frightening film she wrote, directed and acted in with Tinguely.There’s often a shadowy undercurrent, as well as strength in the face of adversity (in Saint Phalle’s case, sexual abuse and a strict Catholic upbringing). It’s there in the 11 roebuck skulls Tinguely fixed to a bicycle wheel in 1990, titled The Infernal Circle of Death. It’s there in Saint Phalle’s provocative plaster and bronze altarpieces, piled high with small plastic dolls which bring to mind the good and the damned imagined by Hieronymus Bosch. In 1961 she started her famous shooting paintings, firing a rifle at low reliefs and exploding bags of bleeding paint across the surface. Produced against a backdrop of political unrest in France, the three on display burst with rage and defiance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The final room features intimate drawings and letters by Saint Phalle, with creatures real and imagined and a load of love hearts. Tinguely is here, too, his name squiggled in ink, a rusty chariot-like contraption supporting a Saint Phalle-style goddess Athena, sensuous and strong. And there, glimpsed through the window, are the three Nanas on the lawn, still twirling, still sparkling.It may be Tinguely’s centenary but Saint Phalle is the star of this show – and the show is all the better for it.Niki de Saint Phalle and Jean Tinguely: Myths & Machinesis at Hauser & Wirth Somerset until 1 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsSculptureArtExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, 37 years later, the doe-eyed sculpture that once adorned the grave of the American singerJim Morrisonhas been found, in what Paris prosecutors described as a “chance discovery”.Police in France said they had been carrying out a search related to a fraud case when they happened to stumble upon the bust of the frontman of the Doors. The announcement,made on social mediaon Monday, was accompanied by a photo showing the graying sculpture still covered in graffiti and missing a chunk of its nose,reportedlysliced off by souvenir hunters before its disappearance.Conceived as a tribute to Morrison, the sculpture was carved after his death by the Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin. It was placed at his grave at Paris’s Père-Lachaise cemetery in 1981, 10 years after the singer died in the French capital at the age of 27.Morrison hotel featured on Doors’ album cover burns in Los Angeles fireRead moreWhile the exact circumstances of Morrison’s death remain shrouded in mystery, most early accounts say the singer died of cardiac arrest in his bathtub.From its perch on top of Morrison’s headstone, the statue welcomedthe throngs of visitorswho came to snap photos, lay flowers and – before the hiring of a guard to watch the site – smoke pot and party with one of Père-Lachaise’s most famous residents.Seven years after the bust was placed at the site, it disappeared. Rumours swirled over what might have happened:some spokeof two fans who had managed to cart off the bust, reportedly weighing 128kg, on a moped in the middle of the night; others repeated the seeminglybaseless claimthat authorities had hidden the sculpture in order to protect it.In 1994, after years had gone by without any sign of the sculpture, two Americanswere arrestedfor attempting to erect their own bronze version of the bust at Morrison’s grave site.Todd Mitchell, who said he had travelled from Utah and spent thousands of dollars of his own retirement fund to resurrect the bust, said the security guard was initially confused when he came across him and his nephew scrambling to bolt the bust to Morrison’s headstone in the dark. “He just looked dumbfounded … Most people are destroying stuff in that cemetery,” Mitchell told the Salt Lake Tribune in 1994.On Monday, as fans of Morrison celebrated what police described on social media as an “unusual discovery”, there was little news on whether the bust would be returned to the singer’s tomb. Benoît Gallot, the curator of the Père-Lachaise cemetery,told Le Figaro: “The police haven’t contacted us, so I don’t know whether the bust will be returned to us.”Explore more on these topicsJim MorrisonParisPop and rockFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We meet the team who helped her become the first learning-disabled person to make the award shortlistEddy FrankelMon 19 May 2025 03.00 EDTShareOne day, out of the blue, everything changed for Nnena Kalu. For more than a decade, she’d been making a certain kind of drawing, in a certain kind of way – repeated shapes, clusters of colour, all organised in rows. “Then, in 2013, she just suddenly started to gowhoosh,” says Charlotte Hollinshead, Kalu’s studio manager and artistic facilitator, making big, swirling, circular hand gestures. “Everybody in the studio just stopped. She was somebody who had such a set way of working, for years and years and years, repeated over and over. For this to suddenly change was really quite shocking.” It was a shock that would set Kalu on the path to becoming the first learning-disabled artist to be nominated for theTurner prize, as she was last month.Her drawings are incredible: vast, hypnotic, swirling vortices of repeated circular marks on pale yellow paper. But it’s her sculptural installations that have garnered the most attention: huge cocoons made of found fabric and VHS tape, wrapped into massive, tight, twisting, ultra-colourful knots. It was an installation of these heady sculptures at Manifesta 15, a pan-European art biennial held in Barcelona last year, that brought her to the attention of the Turner committee.The minute we opened that floodgate, there was no way to close itKalu, who has limited verbal communication, was born in Glasgow in 1966 to Nigerian parents, but moved at a young age to Wandsworth in London, where she still lives in supported care, not far from her studio at ActionSpace, a charity that provides space and assistance to learning disabled artists. She is autistic with complex support needs, and Hollinshead leads the team that has been helping to nurture her creative endeavours since 1999. “From the beginning, her need to make was off the scale,” says Hollinshead, who has been at Kalu’s side for almost 30 years.It was at Hill House day centre in nearby Tooting in the late 1980s that Kalu first started exploring her creativity, before developing a more focused art practice, centred on drawing, when she joined the ActionSpace studio. But she was limited by space. “I always knew Nnena had potential for sculptural work,” says Hollinshead. “I held back on it slightly because we didn’t have the room or the budget. Nnena requires a lot of materials.”View image in fullscreenTight, twisting, ultra-colourful knots … Kalu’s sculptures.Photograph: Ivan Erofeev/PAIt wasn’t until the council gave ActionSpace access to empty shops in 2010 that Kalu could really let loose. “For the first time, she had loads of room, so I laid out some materials, and she just blew our minds,” says Hollinshead. “She started making these cocoons, assembling them really quickly and attaching them all over the place. It was amazing to suddenly see somebody actually be free. She was glowing. The minute we opened that floodgate, there was no way to close it.”Slowly but surely, bigger opportunities followed. In 2016 she showed alongside contemporary artists including Laure Prouvost at an exhibition in Belgium; in 2018, she took part in Glasgow International; 2024 saw her first commercial gallery show at Arcadia Missa in London. She’s just opened a major institutional exhibition at Norway’s Kunsthall Stavanger. It’s a career trajectory that any contemporary artist would aspire to.Her work has echoes of Phyllida Barlow or Sheila Hicks: it wouldn’t be out of place in a Tate or Pompidou. “I think out of all the artists we work with, Nnena’s work stood out from the very beginning as really fitting in within contemporary art,” says Hollinshead. “It was always just significantly different in terms of its ambition and quality and approach. It always felt really fresh and exciting and immediate. So we have always insisted that she be seen as a contemporary artist, so that she doesn’t get sidelined as an outsider or disabled artist.”The challenge is how to present Kalu’s art, and her disability, to an audience unused to dealing with both at the same time. When I first reviewed her work, in 2024 at Arcadia Missa, there was an insistence on her disability not being mentioned. “We were just starting to work out how we do this,” says Hollinshead. “How do we support an artist with limited communication, who isn’t in a position herself to say how she wants to be described, how do we honour her work? We were really worried that the learning disability would be fetishised, and that the focus wouldn’t be on the work.”Kalu has since been given a bigger platform, and that’s now viewed by Hollinshead as an opportunity to talk about her experience rather than hide it away: “We have to celebrate this. She’s an amazing role model.”Besides, in contemporary art, context is everything. You can’t talk about the three other artists nominated for this year’s Turner prize without talking about their backgrounds. Zadie Xa’s Korean heritage, Mohammed Sami’s youth in war-torn Iraq, Rene Matić’s experience growing up queer and mixed-race in Peterborough. These things are all integral to their work, ingrained in everything they do. Why would it be any different for Kalu?View image in fullscreenMajor exhibition … Kalu’s work at Norway’s Kunsthall Stavanger.Photograph: Erik Sæter Jørgensen“I feel that it’s as much a part of her identity as being a woman and being Black and being in her 50s and everything else,” says Sheryll Catto, ActionSpace’s director. “What we don’t want to get into is a forensic discussion about exactly what her disability is, because it’s irrelevant. We’re not engaging with the diagnosis or anything. We’re engaging with Nnena as an artist.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe ultimate aim is balance, an attempt to feel out how best to present the work. How do you focus on Kalu’s art without erasing her experience, and how do you talk about that experience without fetishising it? “I don’t know what the majority of our artists at ActionSpace have got,” says Hollinshead. “I don’t know any clinical diagnosis. And I don’t want to know, because they’re people. I know that Nnena adores Abba …”“And dancing, and champagne, and cake!” Catto chimes in.“And that’s more important than anything else. We’re focused on the joyous wonderfulness of all of our artists, that’s what we do.”Hollinshead and Kalu are obviously close, with a relationship built on a huge amount of trust. “For a learning-disabled artist to succeed, it takes a team of people, and it’s a family approach, it needs a lot of love and support. I’ve spent a huge amount of time with Nnena in her studio, in nightclubs, in Nando’s. She’s like part of my family.”Kalu is working on two huge, swirling drawings on my visit, making repeated, obsessive but precise marks that twist and turn over the paper. The two works echo each other, the same marks appearing across both, neatly mirrored. As well as champagne, Abba and cake, Kalu loves beautiful fingernails and proudly shows off some immaculate lilac gel nails while looking thoroughly unimpressed at my own chewed up cuticles. I ask Hollinshead how Kalu feels about the Turner nomination. “I think the enormity of the Turner prize is a very abstract idea, but she absolutely loves putting exhibitions together, and this will be another big exhibition. She will understand about the award situation, I think, when she gets to the award ceremony.”This is clearly a watershed moment for arts and disabilities, a total shifting of the traditional art paradigm. “The nomination is phenomenal,” says Hollinshead. “It’s seismic. Someone said to me the other day, ‘It’s like someone’s just thrown a bomb into the Turner prize – and it is like that. A good bomb.”Explore more on these topicsArt and designArtTurner prizeAwards and prizesDisabilityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was a founding father of Transcendentalism, the literary movement rooted in English and German Romantic traditions.These four short poems are from the group of individual verses entitled Quatrains, first included in the collection Mayday and other pieces (1867).They can be read herein their initial sequencing. The suggestion, made on the basis of Emerson’s own comments, is that they respond formally to the Persian genre of epigrams and gnomic verses.The first, Poet, is particularly four-square and hymn-like, but its command, “to mask a king in weeds” has different possible interpretations. Does it declare the poet’s obligation to speak truth to power, or suggest that the poet must refuse to acknowledge worldly power altogether? And what about “weeds”? It’s an old word for clothes so might suggest a king disguised in a non-ceremonial, simply woven garment, but there’s an inevitable hint, too, of the botanical kind of weed in all its clambering natural vigour.It’s also interesting to imagine the king as emblematic of the major cultural figures Emerson names in his poemSolution. Solution is a rather long-winded companion poem to another shorter one,The Test, in which the Muse sets us a puzzle: to identify the five creative spirits whose work burns brightest. The answer is: Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Swedenborg and Goethe. In Poet, Emerson might be reminding himself that the “craft of genius” lies in resisting the display of such influences, using “simple words” rather than grand, imitative gestures. Or perhaps the matter is more basic and technical: any “fiery thought” in a poem is stronger if it creates the impression of having occurred as naturally as a weed.The Gardener of the second quatrain is addressed as “true Brahmin”, a priest of Brahma. In Hindu thought, Brahma is the supreme being, manifesting himself throughout the universe. Artists sometimes depict him with four heads – and perhaps the quatrain form itself distantly reflects that cardinal structure.Emerson, deeply influenced by eastern philosophies, unites the Brahmin, the Gardener and the (ideal) Poet. Because of his particular identification with nature, “hid in vines, peeping through many a loop”, his vision will be sharpened and refined rather than obscured. In the imagery of the vines and the “beurré”, a variety of pear whose ripening causes its branch to “stoop”, there may be an echo of the opening lines of Keats’s Ode to Autumn. And despite the specifically Sanskrit reference Wordsworth, I think, would not have found the “Vedas of the violet” an alien concept.Heri, Cras, Hodie (Yesterday, Tomorrow, Today), juggling the usual, chronological word order of the Latin list, expands on the ancient eastern theme of mindfulness, (described engagingly hereas “not wobbling”). The three chronological units, Past, Future and Present, are skilfully evoked, with a rather effective shift into personification characterising the Present as an outcast, a “poor relation”, almost: “To-day slinks poorly off”. There’s a rhetorical force which works especially well in the vatic tone of the last couplet: “Future or Past, no richer secret folds, / O friendless Present, than thy bosom holds.” This poor relation offers wealth to those who can ignore the ever-attractive “shine” of times past and the tendency to squint, vaguely hopeful, at something that cannot in fact be “seen”.My selection of Quatrains ends with a return to the Poet as central figure.Casellaisn’t himself a poet: he is the composer and singer who appears in the second canto of Dante’s Purgatorio, and who, it seems, has set the poet’s own work to music. I can’t help feeling that Emerson, while a huge admirer of Dante, is making fun to some extent of Casella, or of romantic love itself. The dactylic rhythm isn’t the only feature that suggests a comic undertow. There’s the end-rhyme of the last couplet, with its insistence on a mis-stress (if not a mistress). If you stress the word “OF” instead of “YORE” as the metre demands, the result is one of those double-rhymes that often signals bathos: “OF yore” and “LOVE-lore”. The poem might have trembled more empathically, it’s true, but I warm to that possible flash of good-humoured mockery.Emerson the writer is remembered today as a major essayist rather than a major poet. His poems are at their best, I think, when their focus is small-scale. The Quatrains are poetic distillations of his key ideas, but have the directness and vitality that prove them more than a by-product.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He discusses how he balances his beliefs with his businessMon 19 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 08.10 EDTSharePatrick Grant is on his feet, giving the full tour of his outfit. He tugs down the waistband of his jeans to show off his white underpants elastic. His undies were made in south Wales, he says. His shoes in Bolton, the socks in Sussex. More than a man who got dressed this morning, he is a walking compendium of clothing.The provenance of his garments is important to Grant. In fact, the provenance of his everything is important. We are meeting in the office of Cookson & Clegg, the Blackburn clothing factory he bought in 2015. Within a few minutes, I’ve learned that the table we’re sitting at came from Freecycle in Crystal Palace, the bookcase from a skip. I suspect these details have always mattered to Grant, 53, who is best known as a judge onThe Great British Sewing Bee, but they’re especially pertinent since his book, Less, argues that we should all buy fewer things. Grant is very exercised about this idea, and the book’s affably bossy subtitle is a much better clue to his personal energy than its minimalist title: Stop Buying So Much Rubbish: How Having Fewer, Better Things Can Make Us Happier.Less is a sort of anti-shopping guide, a plea to think very carefully before we part with our cash. Which might seem surprising given that Grant has himself for 20 years been a retailer, designer and clothing manufacturer. But his businesses have emphasised quality over quantity – he bought Norton & Sons, a Savile Row tailor, in 2005 after seeing it advertised for sale in the back of the Financial Times. And in 2016, he launched Community Clothing, a for-profit social enterprise. While the aim is to make a profit, its declared focus is “creating jobs”. All the clothes are made at UK factories, in an effort to help revitalise industrial regions. Last week it launched a crowdfunding campaign.View image in fullscreenJudgement day … Grant with The Great British Sewing Bee host Kiell Smith-Bynoe and fellow judge Esme Young.Photograph: James Stack/BBC/Love ProductionsWhat it’s very muchnotabout is fashion. “The whole idea of fashion with a big ‘F’ is a deliberate act on the part of commercial businesses to encourage people to buy things they don’t need,” Grant says. That’s how we ended up with fast fashion and “this acceleration and shitification of the whole thing”.At Community Clothing, there are no sales or seasons. In style terms, it’s a collection of high-quality basics, like the luxury brand Sunspel but at a third of the price. Grant comes across as a thoughtful provider of goods rather than a salesman. When I say I have my eye on a couple of things on the website, he asks sternly, “What do youneed?”The philosophy he sets out is simple. We should make things locally, and make things to last, thereby taking better care of both our planet and local communities. “Pretty much every government I can remember has fallen back on the idea that if we can just get the economy growing, everything will be great. And of course, that’s complete nonsense,” he says. “We’ve had a growing economy for the last 50-odd years and most people don’t feel any better off at all. Most of the growth is coming from businesses that don’t give anything back to the average citizen of Britain.”Instead, it would be “simple for us to consume differently … we can simply choose to buy less.” But surely it isn’t that simple? The reasons we shop are complex. “I think you’re right,” he says cheerfully. “I’ve oversimplified.”Grant hardly buys anything himself. With his trademark side parting and finely trimmed moustache, he is supremely well turned out, but he can’t remember the last time he stepped into a clothes shop and came out with something. He only goes in charity shops.Each day he puts on a navy crew neck – a uniform that’s his equivalent of the Steve Jobs turtleneck – and a pair of Community Clothing trousers, usually khaki or beige “cameraman pants” or “army pants”. (All the trousers here have jobs.) The washing machine doesn’t appear to intervene too much. “Most days I just have fresh pants and socks, and the same stuff as yesterday. Every other day, or every third day, I’ll change my T-shirt.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m definitely decisive’ … Grant photographed at the Cookson & Clegg Factory.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianI can’t help wondering if the morning will come when Grant leaps out of bed, throws open the doors to his wardrobe and recoils in horror at how boring it all looks.“I don’t know,” he says thoughtfully. “Occasionally I do wear a bright sweatshirt. A really lovely cobalt sweatshirt.”But maybe he has a dark past – or in his case a really colourful one. Because some years ago he complained in an interview about the “very drab palette” of menswear. “Oh! Don’t believe the crap I’ve said in the past,” he says merrily. He did love fashion, though. “I used to wear some quite high fashion stuff.” As a teenager growing up in Morningside, Edinburgh, he stuck pictures torn from Vogue on his wall (Béatrice Dalle, Kristin Scott Thomas) and saved up to shop the sales.“In the late 80s, early 90s, I had bits of Issey Miyake, quite a few bits of Jean Paul Gaultier, bits of Vivienne Westwood. I had those beautiful high-waisted stripy pirate trousers. Jean Paul Gaultier did these really narrow, carroty-shaped jeans.” He’s on a roll now. “I had a couple of those in a few different colours. Burgundy. Blue. Maybe I had three pairs … And I had a pair of Jacquard denim Gaultier jeans that had all these faces over them …”More recently, according to Less, he owned American Apparel Y-fronts in 15 colours. “Oh, I did! Obviously I wasn’t sad about the demise of American Apparel when it became clearwhat was going on there. But those colourful Y-fronts were good quality,” he says. In fact, the Y-front is the only object for which Grant expresses a strong and unmet yearning. He tried to sell them at Community Clothing, but everyone bought the boxers instead. “I’d hoped the Y-fronts would be in the mix,” he says sadly. Why? “Well, because I like them personally.”That’s tough, I say. Because they would seem to be one item that’s never coming back. “No,” he says quickly. “They are the most comfortable thing to wear by absolutely miles. And I actually think they’re more flattering than boxers. They make your legs look longer, they make your tummy smaller. Sadly, the Y-front has been consigned to the substitutes benchfor now.” But at some point, he says, they will bring them back.Grant can wax lyrical about almost anything from a salt pot to a potato or the “lovely little snouty kiss marks”his pigs Hazel and Acornleave on his trousers; he acquired them to clear the brambles from the garden of his home near Settle, North Yorkshire, which he has been making over for the past eight years. The start of the book is basically a hymn to all the things that make him happy, a litany drawn from a miscellany, from the burgundy sweatshirt his gran found for him in a charity shop to the sign in the Cookson & Clegg kitchenette that says, “Please don’t put wet teaspoons in the coffee”.He is equally passionate about the things he hates. The big bete noires are online marketplaceTemuand ultra-fast fashion labelShein, with their hundreds of thousands of new products a year, “selling huge amounts of stuff but with almost no value at all going into the UK economy”. But he is very even-handed, and equally ready to take aim at the odd national treasure.Burberry has previouslycome under fire, and today Marks & Spencer, for instance, is “a great example of somebody who used to do clothes who now consider themselves a purveyor of fashion. And I think they’ve got it wrong … They’ve decided that the way to compete is to out-advertise and out-market people. They’ve given up on the thing we [at Community Clothing] do, which is: make good product, try to sell it at a price people can afford.” Community Clothing currently has about 100,000 customers but “I would be quite keen that everyone was able to buy a few pairs of pants and socks from us”, Grant says, which makes it sound a bit like out-Marks-&-Spencering M&S.He can get worked up about anything, all with a sort of deadly serious but cheerfully good-natured disapproval. Sports brands? “We’re using recycled polyester! Whoop-de-doo!” Clothes moths. Kettles – always breaking. Tesco baking trays. The rabbits who last year ate everything he grew apart from the potatoes, triggering his “Mr McGregor side”. The full Windsor – “an ugly tie knot, the wrong shape for the way a shirt is cut.” Nutribullets: “just really shit-quality blenders”.View image in fullscreenHistoric … the entrance door of Norton & Sons in Savile Row.Photograph: Horst Friedrichs/AlamyThen there’s the Cotswold village ofGreat Tew, where he shared a second home with ex-girlfriend Katie Hillier before the Soho Farmhouse members’ club “somewhat changed the dynamic of the neighbourhood” and the “white Range Rovers came flying down the road at 90mph”. He says all this, managing to look lordly while eating an eccles cake. (He’s also gossipy. “The Beckhams bought a really shit plot of land on the corner of a main road,” he says, chuckling. “Nicholas Johnston [who owns the estate] absolutely pulled their pants down.”)He comes across as both homespun and high-end. He darns his own jumpers, and happily pushes up his T-shirt sleeves to reveal his “farmer’s tan” and forearms “like blocks of wood” from all the pickaxe work he’s been doing in his garden – where he’s hoping to lay, of all things, a croquet lawn. “I do love a bit of sport,” he says. He’s a sort of Renaissance man. The martial arts segment of his sporting CV alone includes taekwondo, kung fu, karate and judo, until he tore cartilage in his knee “sparring with a very large Ukrainian man”. His sentences often feel like the start of very long stories. His interests are so diverse. Is he bad atanything?There’s a long silence. “Probably. I don’t know. I mean, I’m quite a practical person. I’m quite good with my hands. I work quite hard.” He has a think. “I’m less good at nurturing my relationships. I’m quite work-focused. I think my girlfriend would agree with that.”For someone who doesn’t go in for shopping, Grant has made a couple of whopping impulse purchases. He bought the ailing Cookson & Clegg because “I’d worked with these people [when he owned Norton & Sons], and I didn’t want to see them chucked on the scrapheap.” He had never considered a career in the fashion industry back when he saw the ad for Norton & Sons in the FT. His first degree was in engineering, and he’d considered retraining as an architect, and a landscape gardener, before doing an MBA at Oxford in his early 30s. (He must have been the only student to have an allotment.)Money is not a huge motivator for me. I could have worked for a hedge fund or a private equity companySo, is he impulsive? “I’m decisive,” he says carefully. “I’m definitely decisive. I don’t know. Where’s the boundary? I tend to decide quickly. And I tend not to worry about decisions too much once I’ve made them. What really was there to lose?”Well, money. “It’s not a huge motivator for me,” he says. “I could have worked for a hedge fund or a private equity company or a management consultant and earned a lot of money.”How to buy secondhand clothes online that you’ll actually wear – and the best sites to trawlRead moreBut it is much easier to advocate for less from a position of plenty. Grant and his sister both attended private schools. He owned a house in Liverpool and another in Oxford, which he leveraged to buy Norton & Sons. His book describes a comfortable childhood and isn’t always alert to the sound of privilege.“We obviously had enough to pay [school] fees, but we also forewent everything else,” he says. “We didn’t have foreign holidays or much new stuff. I am conscious that I’ve always been privileged.” Clearly, though, he doesn’t shop with the same financial imperative as lots of people do. He is a wealthy man. “Yes, I probably am. No, I am,” he says, then adds, “I have no liquid wealth.”His businesses were reported in 2018 to be valued at £75m; the line that Norton & Co made for Debenhams was “turning over nearly £30m a year”. But when Debenhams went bust, “it went to nowt overnight. They owed us a lot of money.” What was left “went into here [Cookson & Clegg]. I didn’t take anything from that. I own two-thirds of it and I own about 50% of Community Clothing. And I own a house that is slowly being rebuilt.“We have to try to find a way to reverse the enormous wealth inequality we’ve created. I’m trying to deploy whatsoever of my means I can, to do something that feels purposeful,” he says. “There could be a simple and more comfortable life.

You see, I’ve stopped streaming music, which, in this modern day and age, seems frankly weird. But hear me out. I’ve gone back to buying CDs, and it’s made me fall in love with music all over again.I listen to music all day, every day. I can’t work without music in the background, or consider doing the washing up without some tunes to groove to. Traditionally, I’d buy albums on CDs or vinyl, and listen to them over and over until I was bored to death with them, by which time I’d hopefully have bought another album. It’s apparently a very annoying habit: as a student (way before the days of Spotify), one housemate was so utterly exasperated with me blasting Urban Hymns bythe Vervearound the house that they barged into my room, ejected the CD and flung it out the window.When Napster, and filesharing, and eventually Spotify emerged, I couldn’t believe my luck. I instantly abandoned my archaic – and expensive – CD habit in favour of a digital jukebox that could play every song in the world. I’d cue up new albums by artists I liked or people I’d heard of and embraced a world of infinite listening. But then, predictably, I got lazy. As Spotify started getting to know me, its recommendations became more and more obscure. Before I knew it, Spotify would have moved from the new Gorillaz album that I’d asked it to play to some weird jazz folk nonsense that I hadn’t, and, crucially, didn’t like. Invariably, I’d be too lazy to turn it off. Listening to Spotify was like talking to a music snob who thinks they know more about music than you, and not in a good way.View image in fullscreenRecapturing his youth … Rich Pelley at home.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThe cost of my Spotify subscription recently went up, so I cancelled it and went back to my old CD-buying ways. I now read reviews in NME and the Guardian, and use Shazam to identify things I like the sound of on telly, as I did with Silk byWolf Aliceafter hearing it on the T2 Trainspotting soundtrack. Instead of listening to random Spotify suggestions, I’m back to my own musical free will. Sure, it involves lining Jeff Bezos’s pockets and playing: “what time will the Amazon delivery man turn up?” But you can’t beat the feeling of holding something physical in your hand. It’s worth every penny to marvel over the album artwork and scrutinise the inner sleeve.Plus, I can listen to the same album over and over as I no longer live with my picky university flatmates. I’ve certainly listened to my current favourite,Drive to Goldenhammer by Divorce, a window-flinging number of times. And, in preparation for their live shows, I’m having a highly enjoyable resurgence of Oasis. I couldn’t be happier, although my shelves, which are desperately reaching their CD weight limit, may disagree.Explore more on these topicsMusic streamingThe one change that workedVinylDigital music and audioSpotifyOasisThe VerveWolf AlicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m something of an expert in this field: for close to a decade now, I’ve written and talked about my love life on public platforms. The reactions have always been mixed: friends roll their eyes, family members express quiet concern, and the men I date are either afraid of being written about or desperate to make it into my copy – one proudly tells people at parties that an article I wrote was about him (it wasn’t).The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It was familiar territory, yes, but one I hoped might also drive me out of my Hinge-shaped comfort zone and force me to try something different. Maybe I’d discover a new favourite app. Or become overwhelmed by attractive, kind and emotionally available men capable of ameliorating my raging hetero-pessimism. At the very least, I’d get some entertaining anecdotes.I didn’t think I’d actually meet someone. Not because I didn’t want to. It’s just that I’ve always believed dating apps weren’t designed to help us find love; they simply keep us addicted to looking for it. If you happen to find someone decent, that’s down to luck more than anything else.Using six apps at once did little to assuage my theory. Frankly, it was exhausting keeping up with the admin of it all: swipe, tap, chat … think of something funny to say. I had to keep reminding myself that I was talking to real people and not bots, even though it frequently felt that way – I’m certain some of my matches used ChatGPT to craft their messages to me. Still, there were fun, flirty conversations, and even a few interesting dates: snogging at the back of cinemas, canoodling at climbing walls, and even a few mini breaks with someone I wound up dating for several weeks.View image in fullscreenNo likes! In the early days of the experiment.Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The GuardianI suppose the difficulty was that I knew I’d be writing about them all, which dissociated me even further from the reality of what I was doing.After a while, I found myself narrativising everything and everyone, reducing the men I met to caricatures, avatars I could easily minimise and mock: the former chef who took four hours to cook pasta. The graphic designer who described himself as a “trauma-free” artist. The failed spy whose opening conversation was about how he recently drank a shot of breast milk.My therapist would call this a defence mechanism: the more you detach, the less likely you’ll get hurt. But I think all of us do this to an extent, writers or not, especially when we’re using dating apps. The experience serves up a dehumanising aftertaste we have to consciously rally against if we want any hope of finding something meaningful that will satiate us.I plan to bear this in mind moving forward, using one app at a time (Hinge, because I rated it the most highly, and I’m a creature of habit) with the hope of finding a great person instead of yet another great story – frankly, I have enough of those already.This week’s picksOnline dating advice: five ways to stay safe, according to the expertsThe best hot brushes for a salon finish at home, tried and tested by our expertIkea Valevåg mattress review: a brilliant budget buy or too cheap for comfort?The best men’s walking boots for every type of hiking adventure, testedWarm weather essentials: 42 ways to make the most of the sunshineThe best suitcases for your next holiday: eight expert picks, rigorously tested‘The flavour, the texture, everything is perfect’: José Pizarro tests supermarket tinned sardinesEditor’s pickView image in fullscreen‘Tis the season to start making the most of our outdoor spaces.Photograph: Anna Stowe Botanica/AlamyAfter years living in a flat, this summer I will finally have a garden to enjoy.

Within half an hour, queues for the sandwiches at Crunch, the sandwich shop he co-founded earlier this year, will be snaking out of its doors. Its secret? Fresh brioche, which comes toasted and filled with ingredients that give the place its name, including southern-fried chicken, baby pickles and lettuce. “We love a sourdough,” says Joni Francisco, Crunch’s head of food. “But if you’re talking about sandwiches, then you need something with an easier mouthfeel.”Could brioche be the new sourdough? Insofar as anything can be, sourdough being to bread what black is to fashion. In 2023, the humblewhite sliced loaf was hailed as a better sandwich bread than sourdough, thesourfaux scandalcontinues to rumble and, while we’re not baking sourdough at home with quite the same zeal as we were during lockdown, our lust for the real deal is still very much around.What’s new is the popularity of brioche beyond burger buns, fuelled by bakers who have come to appreciate its versatility. “People in the UK understand brioche to mean any sweet, buttery white bread,” says baker James Morton, author ofThe Big Book of Bread: Recipes and Stories From Around the Globe. “But proper brioche has a long fermentation time, and a lot of good French butter whipped into the dough after it’s kneaded. It shouldn’t have lots of sugar; the sweetness should come from the butter and that long, slow fermentation, which gives it a more complex taste.”View image in fullscreenButtery and springy … game liver parfait with brioche toast at The Shed, Swansea.Photograph: Courtesy of The ShedToday, you’re as likely to find it in at lauded restaurants like London’s Sabor and The Shed in Swansea – plus cult bakeries like Edinburgh’s Krema and London’s Le Spot, a brioche-centric spot serving pulled oxtail brioche buns and brioche octopus hotdogs – as you are at Gail’s (where it’s blueberry-flavoured) or your average burger bar. “It’s buttery and springy and when you toast it you get those seared edges and slight bitterness from the toasting, which offsets heavier flavours,” says chef Jonathan Woolway of The Shed, of brioche’s appeal in more rarefied settings. He serves his with game liver parfait.Inevitably, supermarkets have seen rising sales, too, though their brioches have none of the fine butter or long fermentation time that Morton mentions. Emilie Wolfman, trends manager at Waitrose, describes brioche as this summer’s “go to bread”, and the store sells own-brand burger and hotdog buns, and a brioche loaf.View image in fullscreenSpheres of influence … brioche rolls made by Benoit Blin.Photograph: Sam FolanAs with many foods, its origin story is steeped in mystery. The Oxford Companion to Food says the word has been in use since the 15th century and derives from the verb “broyer” –to break up – which refers to the prolonged kneading process. It is an enriched bread, which means it contains fat (in this case butter and eggs) as well as bread’s standard trinity of flour, yeast and water. These luxury additions, along with the involved kneading process, meant that for centuries, brioche was a way flaunting wealth. “In the 17th and 18th centuries, these ingredients were expensive. Butter was more expensive than beef,” says Dr Neil Buttery, aptly named food historian and author ofKnead to Know: A History of Baking. Brioche moved around the upper classes and royal courts of Europe, becoming “butterier, richer and eggier over the years”, he continues.It’s what Marie Antoinette was supposedly referring to when she suggested the starving poor eat cake in place of bread: “Qu’ils mangent de la brioche.” Except Antoinette never actually said that. “The phrase derives from German folklore, long before the French Revolution,” Buttery says. Still, the Antoinette fable is a useful indication of brioche’s status. As with many things connected to class, “aspiration has since brought brioche down”, he says – but unlike chandeliers or designer handbags, connotations of luxury still linger. “You feel a bit richer when you eat a brioche,” says Benoit Blin, chef patissier at Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons in Oxfordshire and a judge on Bake Off: The Professionals, who serves his with poached lobster.In part this is because it’s French, and “we revere French food, and their attitudes toward it”, says Morton. Blin, who is French, puts this down to it seeming more artisanal than your average bun. “[One] associates burger buns with mass produced, highly processed food,” he says, so brioche buns became a way for classier burger joints to distinguish themselves. “It’s relatable, homely and reminds you of being a child,” says Crunch’s Yonan – almost irrespective of where you grew up.Thanks to colonialism, globalisation and the agricultural revolution, which spread wheat to every corner of the globe, iterations of white enriched breads exist the world over. “Bakers are for the most part working with the same ingredients,” says Morton, whose Big Book ofBreadboasts numerous variations. “So many breads are only mildly different – though with fierce defensiveness over them!” There is challah of the Jewish diaspora, babka of eastern Europe, concha of Mexico, pão doce of Portugal and milk breads of Britain and Japan. All are popular with everyone, but particularly children, being white, soft and slightly sweet thanks to that ‘enrichment’ of milk or butter. Brioche might feel like one of the most French foods imaginable, but you don’t have to be French for it to make you feel at home.View image in fullscreenGlobal appeal … a plaited challah bread from Gail’s.Photograph: Gail’sLike thecrumpets of 2019, which appeared adorned with everything from braised mutton to lobster, it also taps intonewstalgia: the neologism for our growing need, in unstable times, to experience the familiar bound up with the fresh. “Everyone knows they are supposed to be eating real, healthy, wholegrain sourdough,” says Jonny Lake, chef and co-owner of Trivet in Bermondsey, which serves a brioche bun with pickles and beef tongue. “But sometimes what you are looking for is toasted white bread.”In short, post-pandemic, sourdough has become too ubiquitous to impress diners. “Everyone was baking sourdough when we were coming up with Crunch in 2021. We wanted to offer something different,” says Francisco. After months of experimentation, they developed a brioche made with a sourdough culture, to create a more structured bread that could hold sauce, and which people notice. “When people think of [us], they think of the bread first,” he says.Brioche is not the new sourdough – and that’s a good thing, says Morton. Neither our environment nor our health can sustain eschewing regeneratively farmed wholegrain loaves in favour of refined white bread enriched with butter – not on a daily basis. But as a luxurious addition to our glorious gastronomic scene, it is as welcome as its warm, yielding dough is. “You don’t have to fight it,” Yonan says triumphantly. “For indulgence, brioche is king.”Explore more on these topicsBreadFoodBakingFrench food and drinkBurgersSandwichesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Inspired by this, I made a lemon-spiked green chilli and artichoke tapenade for hot focaccia, topped with the same excellent olives and the best anchovies.Gildas in carriagesI don’t usually specify brands in my recipes, but when there are so few ingredients, it really is worth getting the ones recommended below as a treat.

Once cool enough to handle, cut the focaccia into 3cm-wide x 7cm-long x 1½cm-deep pieces (essentially long and wide enough to hold two slices of olive, as pictured). Put the focaccia pieces on a baking tray and bake for 15-20 minutes, until crisp.Meanwhile, roughly blitz the artichokes, olive oil from the jar, salt, lemon juice and chillies in a high-speed blender or food processor to make a rough paste, rather than a smooth puree.Drain and cut the olives in half and open the tins of anchovies. Once the croutons are ready, spread them immediately with the artichoke tapenade, then arrange two olive halves and half a piece of anchovy on top. Leave to cool for five minutes, then serve warm with drinks.Explore more on these topicsSnacksQuick and easyFoodVegetablesStarterFishSeafoodBreadrecipesShareReuse this content"

It has predicted that the cap will fall to £1,720 a year for a typical dual-fuel household this summer, from £1,849 under the current limits.The modest drop would return the energy price cap to its levels at the beginning of the year – but this is still about 60% higher than where the cap was set in the summer before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused a global energy market surge.Energy bill defaults hit record high, says ONSRead moreBritain’s gas and electricity prices have remained some of the highest in the world, in large part due to reliance on gas for generating electricity and in home heating, which has led to record high levels of household energy debt and a sharp slump in industrial activity.The output from Britain’s energy intensive industries has fallen by a third since 2021, according to official government figures published on Monday, and is now at its lowest level since 1990.Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) have revealed that the average electricity price for companies and manufacturers rose by 90% at the peak of the global energy crisis in 2023, and were still 75% higher at end of 2024 compared with costs in 2021.Gas prices have taken an even greater toll on non-domestic energy users. Costs surged by 187% at the peak of the crisis, according to the ONS, but remained 120% higher than pre-crisis levels at the end of last year.“These figures are a wake-up call,” according to Sam Richards, the chief executive of Britain Remade, a pro-growth lobby group. “Sky-high energy costs have gutted Britain’s industrial base, with output in sectors like steel and chemicals collapsing to record lows. If we’re serious about protecting jobs and rebuilding our manufacturing strength, we need to cut industrial electricity costs, and fast.”Figures published last week by the ONS warned that households are struggling with energy costs too. A record proportion of households were unable to pay their energy bills by direct debit last month because there was not enough money in their bank accounts.The watchdog for Great Britain, Ofgem, is expected to set out the next cap, which reflects the average annual dual-fuel bill for about 29 million households, on Friday before it takes effect from July until the end of September.The latest estimate from Cornwall marksa small rise from its previous forecast of £1,683 a year, which the analyst said was partly due to increases in energy wholesale markets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is not the moment for complacency.”Jess Ralston, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “Predicted falls in energy bills simply cancel out recent rises, meaning the crisis is not over for bill payers who are still struggling with gas prices significantly above pre-crisis levels.“Costs of oil and gas will always be volatile and can be manipulated by foreign actors like Putin, but every home that is insulated and has a heat pump installed reduces our gas demand and so exposure to these geopolitically vulnerable markets.”Cornwall expects that the price cap will fall again in October, followed by another drop in January, although this is subject to several varying factors, including weather patterns, the impact of the war in Ukraine and EU gas storage rules.Explore more on these topicsEnergy billsConsumer affairsHousehold billsEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

That’s about 250,000 tonnes in total, so it is important to plan what you are going to buy to avoid waste and save money.Work out how many meals you will cook during the week, and how much meat is needed for each person.The NHS recommends that the amount of red meat – be it beef, lamb, mutton, pork, veal, venison or goat –should be limited to 70g(cooked weight) each day, or no more than 500g (1.1 lbs) every week.How to save on food shopping: from discount apps and cashback to free stuffRead moreFor example, a cooked breakfast of two pieces of bacon and two sausages has about 130g of meat, while a portion of Sunday roast is about 90g, it says.The size of a portion of chicken is about90g of cooked meat (120g raw), according to the British Dietetic Association (BDA), a trade union for dietitians.Know your butcherView image in fullscreenIdeally, Jamie Oliver says, sausages should be made within the previous 24 hours, have a high meat content and use natural casings.Photograph: Andy Hunting/AlamyBuying from a local butcher will mean you do not have to buy pre-packed blocks of meat, all of which you may not need – so you can buy as much mince as you need rather than in a 500g pack.You can also discuss different cuts, and where the meat you are buying comes from.Jamie Oliver says there is a list of features you should look out for to spot a good butcher. First, their display of meat should be kept refreshed and not in pools of blood. They should also know where the meat comes from, the breeds and what standards the livestock were raised in.Meat should also hail from the country in which you are in, and preferably from the local area, Oliver saysHow to stop wasting food and save moneyRead more, adding that a good butcher should be happy to make mince fresh – this way, you will be able to order the exact amount you want and you will know what is in it.A gauge of a good butcher is to ask about their sausages, says Oliver. They should be made within the previous 24 hours, have a high meat content and use natural casings.Eleanor O’Brien, the managing director of the trade association National Craft Butchers, says: “For those who want to make educated decisions while still thinking about environmental and welfare aspects of their meats, where the meat is from and how it has been farmed is knowledge your high street butcher should be happy to discuss with you.”Know what good looks likeView image in fullscreenWhen buying meat in a supermarket, ‘look for bright, fresh colours, a firm texture and a clean, pleasant smell’.Photograph: Ed Brown/AlamyButchers should be able to tell you what meat is the most fresh and in season.If you are shopping at a supermarket, there are a number of important rules to follow, says Facundo Rodulfo, an Argentinian chef who is the co-author of a new cookbook,Tango.“Look for bright, fresh colours, a firm texture and a clean, pleasant smell. Avoid packages that have been sitting around too long as they can start to lose freshness,” he says.“Red meat should have a deep red hue, while poultry should be pale but firm to the touch. Avoid meat that looks dull or has a greyish tint – this could indicate that it’s been sitting around too long. Smell is another important factor. Fresh meat should have a clean, neutral smell. If it has any sour or unpleasant odour, it’s a sign that it may be past its prime.”He adds: “If you’re shopping online, it’s still essential to check reviews or choose reputable sources for consistent quality.”Buy biggerBuying large amounts of meat – sometimes a whole animal – for economies of scale has become more common in recent years, but it will be impossible for many people, as they do not have the freezer space to store it.However, the same principle can be applied on a much smaller scale and results in savings.Buying a whole chicken and jointing it yourself can work out cheaper than buying the constituent parts. For example, when we looked, a Waitrose “slower reared” chicken weighing 1.75kg cost £5.50, while buying two breasts and legs cost £6. By buying the whole bird and cutting it up in a few minutes, you also get the carcass for stocks, and more meat through the wings. Simple explanations of how to joint a chickenare widely available online.View image in fullscreenPork offers very good value at present, says John Mettrick from Mettrick’s Butchers in Glossop, Derbyshire.Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian“Easy butchery at home is not as difficult as it sounds,” says Rodulfo. “A sharp knife and a bit of time are all you need. For instance, when cutting a whole chicken, you can break it down into breasts, thighs and wings, or even use the bones for stock. When cutting larger cuts like beef, learn how to separate the muscle groups, and use the tougher pieces for stews or slow-cooked dishes.”If you do want to buy a whole animal and have space to store it in a chest freezer or freezers (possibly with others), you will make savings, says John Mettrick from Mettrick’s Butchers in Glossop, Derbyshire. Buying half a lamb, which weighs about 12kg, will cost about £150. “It’s cheaper than buying individual cuts [and] practical to fit in a domestic freezer. A half a pig is 35kg – [you will] need to get your neighbours involved. Pork offers the best value at the moment, as long as you can cope with the quantities.”Alternative cutsLess well-known cuts of meat have become popular in recent years, meaning the savings you could once get are less than they were.“The traditional cheaper cuts [such as] ox cheeks and oxtail are in high demand and make up such a small part of the carcass,” says Mettrick. “TV chefs and restaurants have been pushing these cuts. Even the humble tasty belly pork is now more expensive to buy than the boneless pork loin on the wholesale market.”There are still savings to be made, however.View image in fullscreenChicken thighs are a tasty and cheap option.Photograph: myViewPoint/Alamy“A common misconception is that the more expensive the meat, the better the flavour. Many of the cheaper cuts can provide just as much flavour – if not more,” says Rodulfo. “We use cuts like pork shoulder, brisket, chicken thighs and beef shin regularly. These may not be the most expensive options, but when cooked properly, they yield incredible flavours.“A cut like [beef] brisket, often seen as a cheaper option, works beautifully when slow-cooked or smoked. Beef shin is another great cut for stews or braises, and chicken thighs have more flavour and juiciness than chicken breasts. They’re perfect for roasting, grilling, or making a quick stir-fry.”Lamb neck, he adds, is good for making broths and stews. It is available in the meat section of many supermarkets.In Waitrose, the supermarket’s own-brand bavette steaks sell for £20 a kg, while sirloin is £35 a kg. And chicken thighs start at £3.80 a kg, while breast is from £7.09.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsMoney hacksMeatFood (global)Meat industryFarmingFood (Environment)Food & drink industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Several years ago I had the same pair and loved them.Unfortunately, a few weeks after I started wearing them, I noticed the leather was peeling, and I contacted StockX to seewhetherit could help. I foundits response unsatisfactory.It told me I was not eligible for a refund because the trainers were released in 2020. Five-year-old shoes “may experience structural and material damage or signs of durability”, it said, adding that another reason I was being turned down was because the shoes were now “used”.It offered me a $40 (£30) voucher or $30 cash refund.Taking into account the price and description of the shoes on the website, I think a reasonable person would expect to be able to wear trainers for longer than thisand be covered under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 if they are faulty.This risk to the buyer doesn’t seem to be mentioned on the site and leaves no recourse for customers with quality issues.I assumed StockX would want to examine the shoe, contact the seller and explore the cause.HS,NewcastleSole traders: why there’s a whiff of money in old trainersRead moreFor the uninitiated, StockX is a stock exchange-styletrading platform where “sneakerheads”can buy and sell limited-edition trainers. The shoes are new but can be several years old, as those “in the know” buy coveted styles in the hope of reselling at a profit.You have to look for it, but the StockX “help” section carries the disclaimer that shoes five years or more old “may experience structural weakness and a lack of durability”.“If you choose to wear a pair of older shoes purchased on StockX, we cannot guarantee the shoes’ long-term integrity,” it adds.Given we are told some trainers in landfill,last 1,000 years, it seems surprising that a pair from 2020 should fall apart. But if you are buying from an individual seller, which you do on a marketplace such as StockX, you have fewer rights than when buying directly from a retailer.The Which? consumer law expert Lisa Webb says: “Provided you receive the goods in the same condition as they were described to you, you’ll probably find it quite difficult to get your money back. We’d always advise checking if the site offers any buyer protection … in case something goes wrong.”Our involvement persuaded StockX to accept a return for a full refund as a “one-time exception”. This is a good outcome. Those with trainer collections tell me there is a debate about whether the expensive trainers being traded are “collectible”, as opposed to “wearable”. If you want the surety of a rock-solid high street-style footwear returns policy, it’s best to stick to the high street.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

We’ve come to Praia de Monte Clérigo to watch the sun sink into the sea, and stumble upon a bay ripe for play with a babbling brook, rock pools, gentle swell, towering cliffs and rolling dunes. As I gaze across to colourful fishers’ cottages circling a simple beach bar, I can’t help but agree; this could indeed be the world’s best beach.“Why’s it so empty?” my son asks. It’s a good question, given the beauty of our surroundings, but we soon realise that having the place to ourselves is a common occurance on our slow adventure exploring Portugal’s least-populated coastline.View image in fullscreenBetween the busy resorts of the Algarve and Alentejo’s stark Atlantic coast, Portugal’s south-west corner offers a happy medium that’s ideal for families. The jagged coastline creates sheltered bays between long sweeping sands, and the81-mile(130km) Vicentine Coast natural park keeps development in check. Villages and towns cling to the most hospitable coves, or line rivers as they meander through cork forests and wetlands down to the sea. Long-distance hiking routes, such as the Fisherman’s Trail and the Historical Way, provide plenty of opportunities to explore on bike or foot and help to keep a good food and drink scene afloat. Even in the Easter holidays, we often have beaches, footpaths and roads to ourselves.Rather than stay in an apartment on the coast, we opt for a family-run B&B called Muxima, a few miles inland from Praia de Monte Clérigo. Our hope is that our boys, aged nine and 11, will roam free on the large plot while we read and sip local wine in the sun. It’s clear we’re on to a winner within minutes of our arrival. “Would you like to see my katana?” Jackson, the 12-year-old son of owners Paula and Jelle, asks as we carry our bags to our room.View image in fullscreenPraia de Monte Clérigo was one of the closest beaches to the family’s B&B.Photograph: Ian Canham/Alamy“What, a real one?” our oldest pipes up, as both boys follow Jackson off into the long grass. Before I can ask what a katana is (it’s a samurai sword), the kids are off. Thankfully, it isn’t a real one.It doesn’t take long to settle in while the boys play. Our family suite sits at the end of one of two farmhouses restored in the style of traditionaltaipabuildings(made from a mixture of compacted soil and straw),with natural pigment plaster. With a double bedroom, huge shower, living area with bunk beds, a dining table and a compact kitchen, it has everything we need for lazy evenings and long lie-ins. Muxima’s seven rooms are similar in feel but vary in size. Deep red and ochre walls, straw light fittings and ceramic lamps make the dark interior feel more like north Africa than Portugal – perhaps a nod to the region’s history and our proximity to the continent. In the local town, Aljezur, surviving castle ramparts date back to Arab rule in the 10th century – the whole area was under Moorish rule until the mid-13th century.After a bracing dip in Muxima’s natural pool, we laze on the pool deck and watch swifts dance above eucalyptus trees“Let’s go and swim with the frogs,” the oldest bellows, racing back towards our room. “I counted 18, but there are probably more!”It’s not the most enticing invite, but Muxima’s natural swimming pool beckons, frogs and all. After a bracing dip, we laze about on the pool deck and watch swifts dance above eucalyptus trees. The boys enthusiastically show us the chickens, rope swing and the start of a two-mile forest trail where they spotted a grass snake earlier. Little gaggles of children are everywhere, all mucking in together.We chat with other guests in the communal living room, home to games and an honesty bar (filled with local, natural wines). A couple of families are regulars and use Muxima as a base to explore hiking trails and surf when the conditions are right. They tip us off about the mosquitoes, which are particularly bad this year due to a damp spring. But before we start to worry, Paula hands us some handmade natural citronella oil. Even the insect repellent is kind to the land here. Muxima’s eco ethos permeates everything from the homemade ginger cake, muesli and freshly laid eggs at its daily vegetarian breakfast buffets (the only meal on offer) to handmade soaps and nice little touches such as keyrings made by local artists. Converted by a Portuguese couple in 2011, Muxima has been run by Paula and Jelle (both Dutch) since 2019 to share their love of the wild with guests.View image in fullscreenThe writer and her family took surfing lessons at Praia da Bordeira.Photograph: Holly TuppenDays drift by with a pleasingly repetitive pattern, and between unrushed moments we find plenty to explore nearby. Itching to get in the waves, we spend the first morning at Praia da Arrifana, a popular bodyboarding and surfing spot. We hire bodyboards for €10 a day, and exhaust ourselves in time for a big lunch ofcataplana de marisco(seafood stew) and burgers at clifftop restaurant O Paulo. On our second day, the sky turns grey, so we try a local hike. The four-mile circular Praia da Amoreira trail has butterflies, kingfishers and a river beach. Back in Aljezur, Arte Bianca’s loaded pizzas reward our hiking efforts. Blue skies and high winds beckon us to Europe’s most south-westerly tip the next day. So, we drive 40 minutes south to shout into the wild Atlantic at Farol do Cabo de São Vicente and potter around the sleepy surf town of Sagres.By day four, we’re itching to try some “proper surfing”, as the boys refer to it, and wake early to head out on our first of two lessons with Soul & Surf. Based near Lagos, on the southern coast (in a beautifully restored farmhouse where it’s possible to stay for a full surfing retreat), they have plenty of options to choose from.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Loaded with surfboards, we meander down a boardwalk and cross a stream on to the wild expanse of Bordeira. Locals catch green waves to one side while we kickstart our session in a calmer spot in the middle of the beach.Soul & Surf’s responsible ethos dictates that we begin each surf lesson with a beach clean, before warm-up exercises and mindful breathwork. “Surfing is about the mind and the body, and we cannot do it well unless we’re relaxed,” Bruno says, perhaps clocking the boys’ impatience to get in the water. They needn’t have worried. Thanks to our expert tutor, we’ve all managed to stand up on our boards, albeit for mere moments, within the first hour. By the end of our second lesson, we’re just about pumping (to make the board move faster) and steering.“When are we going on our next surfing holiday?” the boys ask as we debrief over homemade energy bars and say goodbye to Bruno in the car park.Back at Muxima, the boys recount our surfing adventures to anyone who will listen. Alongside discovering a less-explored corner of a much-visited country, it’s been a week of making new friends and learning new skills. We leave the next day pondering whether that’s the recipe for family holiday happiness.Muxima’sfamily suites for four from£202 a night B&B.Soul & Surf’sprivate surf lessons from£60ppfor two hoursExplore more on these topicsAlgarvePortugal holidaysFamily holidaysEurope holidaysSurfing holidaysBeach holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s about women in the workplace.Them, I do like.Well, maybe that’s part of the issue.Oh. How so?There’s a report …Thought there would be… calledShapeshifters: What We Do at Work to Be Liked, which, after surveying more than 1,000 people, discovered that women feel greater pressure to be liked at work and in life.‘I feel like I’m on holiday!’ Inside our week-long mental load marriage swapRead moreWhy?The pressure for women to be likable is “a culturally entrenched demand that transcends industries and job titles,” saysAmy Kean, a sociologist and author of the report, published by training company Good Shout. “Women are expected to balance competence with warmth, assertiveness with agreeability, and combine authority with overt humility.”Got some numbers for us?Of course: 56% of women feel pressure to be likable, compared with 36% of men.So how does this manifest itself – what do women do?Kean says: “They’re supposed to be the office mum, taking notes in meetings while softly whipping everybody into shape and baking cakes on Fridays in order to be as palatable as possible.”The cakes?No! The female employees. And it’s not just about what they do, it’s about what they say as well.Go on.Women are often twice as likely as men to use phrases such as, “I might be wrong, but …” and, “Does that make sense?”Does it? Make sense?Yes, and they know it does! But 33% of women worry about coming across as too confident (compared to 16% of men), and 50% say they hold back their true opinions in order to be liked (compared to 35% of men). More than a third of women try to “smile more”.And I’m thinking this likability labour doesn’t pay, does it?Not only does it not pay, the report says it is “draining creative energy, muffling innovation and punishing authenticity”.Otherwise it’s pretty much a level playing field, right?Ha! Yes, of course. Unless you take into account the glass ceiling, the gender pay gap, the patriarchy andemotional labour(the effort required to keep everything running smoothly). Not to mention mental load (also known ascognitive household labour), and other unpaid labour that women take on at home …Do say:(Without looking up, certainly without smiling) “Just leave it there, on my desk, thanks.”Don’t say:“Sorry to ask but could you possibly do that thing that is literally your job to do …”Explore more on these topicsWomenPass notesWork & careersGenderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And I don’t just mean the Sycamore Gap treeTalking therapies save lives, keep people out of hospital, help them back into work. So why is NHS England cutting them in its ‘financial reset’?Moya SarnerMon 19 May 2025 06.00 EDTShareIwas moved to read of the grief expressed by so many at the brutal felling of the Sycamore Gap tree. I found it surprising. Not the crime itself: I know well the unconscious drive we all have within us to destroy good things – the most valuable, the most beautiful, the most life-affirming things. What took me by surprise was the capacity that so many people found within themselves to express their devastation and anger at this painful loss, not only to us as individuals, but as a nation.On the day the perpetrators were found guilty, I was reeling in my own private grief. I’d just read a different news story that told of another brutal cutting-down: again the destruction of something beautiful and valuable with deep roots, that stood for growth and possibility and life. The article, on this website, told how among other “savings”, talking therapies services are to be cut “as part of efforts by England’s 215 NHS trusts to comply witha ‘financial reset’”.As a patient in psychoanalysis that I pay for privately because I am privileged enough to be able to afford it; as a psychodynamic psychotherapist working in theNHSbecause I passionately believe that people should have access to good, sustained mental health treatment regardless of their means; and as your columnist writing about how to build a better life – I find this to be morally wrong.Just as I was not surprised by the felling of the Sycamore Gap tree, I am not surprised by these further cuts to talking therapy on the NHS. The flesh is so thin on the bone already, there is precious little now to cut, with patients facing the (bad) luck of the draw of patchy, postcode lottery-style provision. Many of us as individuals have a tendency to diminish our own mental anguish – to feel that physical pain is somehow more worthy. This is why it is unsurprising that we tolerate such meagre offerings of sustained psychotherapy on the NHS. It is why we have to have a law that mental health and physical health should be treated with parity of esteem – because deep down, we do not do this within ourselves.That law, incidentally, is theHealth and Social Care Act 2012, which states it is theSecretary of State for Health’s duty to “continue the promotion of a comprehensive health service designed to secure improvement […] in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of physical and mental illness”. How can he possibly fulfil this duty if the already limited offer of psychotherapy is reduced even further?Therapy allows people to stand tall when they have previously had to drag themselves along the groundWhether talking therapy services are scrapped altogether, or treatments are shortened and cheapened and replaced with “interventions”, it seems important to see the truth of what is happening here. There will be cuts to psychotherapy. Psychotherapy in its different modalities is a potent treatment that has been proven again and again, in study after study and in patient after patient, to be effective for many people suffering with mental illness – and, in the case of sustained psychodynamic psychotherapy, to grow more effective over time after treatment ends. Patients can use it and get better. Do we understand this? That psychotherapy works? Of course it doesn’t always work, and it is not always indicated for everyone – like any other treatment. But for many, it works. It saves lives. It keeps people out of hospital. It enables people to get back into work. It can repair relationships. It can restore self-respect. It can allow people to stand tall when they have previously had to drag themselves along the ground. It is a treatment that works, and it is being cut, so people will have even less chance of being offered it than they do now.We need to find within ourselves the kind of anger and sadness at cutting down our mental health services that some have found within themselves at the cutting down of the Sycamore Gap tree. This tree found its home in an empty hollow and grew strong and true and beautiful. Psychotherapy can help people do that too. And what will fill the gap left when psychotherapy is cut down? The usual things people turn to when they are struggling and they feel hopeless, uncared-for and forgotten – none of them good. Suicidality; addiction; relationship and family breakdown.If we want to build a better life, for ourselves and our families and our fellow citizens, we need to do something about this. We need to fight for our cause; we need to protest in the streets and bring legal challenges and write (politely and firmly) to our MPs. We need to demand theHealthSecretary fulfil his responsibilities outlined by the Health and Social Care Act 2012. We need to stand up and make it politically impossible for this government that talking therapies provision be further diminished; the NHS must offer psychotherapy treatment for anyone who needs it and who can use it.Receiving and offering psychotherapy has taught me that we all have it in us to cut down and destroy beautiful things – but we also have it in us to come together in our grief, to repair, to help each other, to do good things, to stand up when we see that something is deeply morally wrong. That is how we build a better life not only for ourselves but also for each other.Moya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and the author ofWhen I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of AdulthoodDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes that code our genetic makeup, with one pair determining sex. Males are born with an X chromosome, with genes inherited from their mother, and a Y chromosome, from their father.Sokratous says some studies have shown a strong link between the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome (passed down from the mother) and male pattern hair loss, with some suggesting this gene may account for up to 70% of its likelihood. “But male pattern baldness is more complex than that,” he says. “It’s the combination of genes from your mum and your dad alongside other factors.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He adds that your body’s hormonal processes can also cause hair loss. This is because it’s a process that happens in the scalp when the skin converts testosterone to active testosterone. Factors such as anabolic steroid use can raise testosterone levels and worsen this process. Other hormone imbalances, such as those caused by thyroid dysfunction or chronic stress, can contribute to different types of hair loss as well.If you’re worried about hair loss, there are blood tests you can take to see if it’s genetic or hormonal. “It could be due to a disease that can be managed. And, if not, it will help you gain an understanding of what you can expect over the next five, 10, 15 years.”Environmental factors can also speed up or slow down the process, says Sokratous. “Are you eating a diet rich in nutrients like zinc, vitamin D, iron and B vitamins? Is your body absorbing them properly? Adjusting your diet can slow things down.”This article was amended on 19 May 2025. An earlier version said people have “two chromosomes”, when the intended reference was to a pair of sex chromosomes.Explore more on these topicsHair lossIs it true that …Men's hairMenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Starting the day in pouring rain, and getting stuck behind slow walkers.I’ve always had a fast stride. I cut the estimated walk-time on Google Maps by at least a third. I was nicknamed “spidergirl” in my netball team because I had long arms and long legs. A friend once piped up to say she had broken into a light jog just to keep up with me. I don’t even realise I’m doing it.Dawdlers are like cars that refuse to pull into the slow lane.

To top it off, they like to give me some side-eye as I pass. But Miranda Priestly rings in my ears: “By all means, move at a glacial place, you know how that thrills me.”The slow walker reaches peak obstruction on approach to public transport, where getting stuck behind one can actually stop me getting the next train, bus or metro. If you are in Grand Central station or Gare de Lyon, by all means stop to marvel, but everyone else should move through subway gates and underground tunnels at pace.They are also rife in the supermarket, ambling, turning this way and that, on the phone, with their trolleys, listless.“Can’t you just relax?” you may be thinking.

In 2024, the two richest UK billionaires held more wealth between them than all the billionaires in the 1990 rich list combined.“Our analysis also shows the vampiric nature of extreme wealth, which is completely incompatible with the health and wellbeing of the nation,” said Priya Sahni-Nicholas, co-executive director of the Equality Trust. “Property, inheritance and finance account for over half of total billionaire current wealth: sources of wealth creation that are responsible for large-scale planetary and community destruction.“The obscene growth in wealth of the UK’s richest is due to them profiting from society’s struggles while causing them additional harm and undermining successive governments’ goals of decarbonisation, spreading more wealth and growth out of London, ending the housing crisis, encouraging the growth of new – and frequently greener – industries, and encouraging stronger communities.“The issue of extreme wealth really is existential; for our very survival we need to get serious about changing economic structures and design policies that end the existence of billionaires.”Julia Davies, a member of Patriotic Millionaires UK, said that inclusion in the rich list should be a mark of shame. “This process of hoovering up wealth into the hands of ever fewer people is directly harming everyone. These people don’t deserve that level of wealth, it just so happens that some people gather an incredible amount of money around them while other people don’t, despite educating our kids and keeping our health service going.”Davies said it was wrong to call the wealthy “job creators”. “I call them job eradicators because when you consolidate businesses into the hands of ever fewer people, you’re wiping out smaller and medium-sized businesses because they cannot compete with chains that undercut them.“These people also employ such effective tax-management measures that they’re paying far lower rates of tax to the local and national economy than working people or small to medium-sized businesses.”It did not have to be this way, she said. “You can use wealth to accumulate ever more wealth or you can use it to address many of the multiple issues that society is struggling with.“It’s not intrinsic in being wealthy to want to continue to attract ever more wealth to yourself at the expense of society,” she said. “That’s not something that just happens to you when you become wealthy and we shouldn’t just accept it. It’s a choice.”Fernanda Balata, a political economist at the New Economics Foundation and author ofExploring An Extreme Wealth Line, said that the UK had gone down a route of economic instability while the government had put the super-wealthy above everyone else. That, she said, “is not by accident.”“There are so many connections now between the wealthy and the powerful, that it spills over into public institutions,” she said. “This means politicians today are having to rely increasingly on lies and flawed narratives to keep the system going.”But Balata said there was hope. “There is broad consensus now that extreme levels of wealth inequalities are causing multiple harms to society.”Balata said that politicians need to start looking at extreme wealth as an issue in itself. “We need an Extreme Wealth Line: the point at which excessive wealth causes unjustifiable harm,” she said.Dr Benjamin Tippet, a lecturer in economics and wealth inequality at King’s College London, has modelled what a 2% tax on those on the rich list would have raised, if the policy had been in place since the mid-90s.“I discovered that a 2% wealth tax on the tax residents on the rich list would have raised about the equivalent of £6bn per year: £155bn,” he said. “Invested, that would have been worth about £325bn in today’s money – well over £11,000 per household. That’s a significant national wealth fund. And even with this tax, the share of wealth of people on the rich list – the top 0.001% – would still have increased.”Explore more on these topicsThe super-richRich listsSunday TimesInequalitynewsShareReuse this content"

They convinced themselves there was a lot of opportunity, that Sky would be the international launch pad. There was initially a lot of optimism there, but it hasn’t been that beachhead.”Sky’s most recent financial results underscore the tough market conditions it continues to navigate, re-engineering a business built on high-priced pay-TV packages as the streaming revolution reshapes broadcasting economics and viewer behaviour.In 2023,operating losses doubledas Sky recorded a pre-tax loss of £773m, fuelled by a £1.2bn writedown in loans to its German and Italian operations, and a £327m impairment charge at the loss-making streaming service SkyShowtime, a joint venture with US media behemoth and Channel 5 owner Paramount.A three-year, $1bn (£754m) cost-saving programme led to the loss of1,000 jobs last year, mainly engineering roles as 90% of new TV customers choose satellite dish-free products such the Sky Stream “puck” or Sky Glass smart televisions. And in March,2,000 customer service roles were cutin acknowledgment of the shift to digital communication and artificial intelligence solutions.Since being acquired, Sky has changed tack from battling US streaming services tobecoming a one-stop content aggregatorby striking deals to bundle services such as Netflix on its platform.While this has largely proved successful, it has taken its toll on the amount of exclusive, premium US content it offers – companies such as Disney have aimed tokeep control of premium contentthrough their own streaming services – and raised pressure on its own studios to create homegrown hits.View image in fullscreenWarner Bros Discovery, the owner of the studio behind HBO hit The Last of Us, struck a deal in December that will bundle its HBO Max service for Sky customers.Photograph: HBOIn December, Warner Bros Discovery (WBD), the owner of the film studio behind Barbie and HBO hits includingThe Last of UsandThe White Lotus, struck anew content deal with Skyaimed at boosting its own streaming service HBO Max when it launches in the UK next year. From next April, the ad-supported versions of HBO Max and Discovery+ will be bundled for Sky customers.“HBO content is probably still the best in the world, certainly it is the crown jewel programming for Sky’s entertainment offering,” said a top executive at one of the UK’s biggest production companies. “Sky customers are going to say: ‘I don’t want aBrassic, I want the kind of hits HBO churns out, like a Last of Us orSuccession.’”Under the deal, Sky will lose the right to air newly created WBD and HBO shows such as theforthcoming Harry Potter TV seriesand their Hollywood films on its own channels and services directly to customers.This raises questions about the viability of Sky Atlantic, which has been built off the back of alongstanding collaboration with HBO, and whether Comcast is prepared to invest heavily enough in upping Sky’s content pipeline.“In a subscription business you have to be able to provide access to content that people can’t get elsewhere,” said the production executive. “Exclusivity has tremendous power and value, where does it leave Sky long term? Sky has had hits likeDay of the Jackal, but there is definitely talk in the industry about Sky needing a hit factory now.”Sky’s commercial relations with partners Paramount and WBD, for which it has deals to sell advertising on its own channels and those of third parties in the UK, have also been rocked by an advertising scandal.Sky uncoveredmiscalculations by its ad sales operation, Sky Media, spanning many years which resulted in partners not receiving the correct revenue from their deals, a problem industry sources say amounted to £280m to £320m that needed to be reimbursed.“Heads rolled internally for that,” said one senior media industry executive. Sky says that it conducted a review and acted “decisively” to notify partners and is in the process of fully reimbursing them. “We have made the necessary internal changes to prevent this recurring,” said a spokesperson.While the broadcaster seeks to repair the damaged reputation of Sky Media, which brings in more than £1bn in ad revenues annually, there is growing concern over the future of Sky News.View image in fullscreenSophie Chandauka, the chair of the Sentebale board, appearing on Sky News’ Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips. The news channel has faced spiralling losses.Photograph: Tim Anderson/PAWhen Comcast acquired Sky it promised to maintain the service’s budget of about £100m for at least a decade, and increase it annually in relation to inflation.Sky has never officially revealed the level of losses the news operation makes, but it had long been estimated at around £30m annually. However, multiple sources say that a combination of factors including rising costs means that it is now making losses of as much as £70m to £80m.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is in the process ofspinning off US cable networksincluding MSNBC, E! And SYFY into a new publicly traded company, Versant, as traditional TV audiences continue to dwindle.The move hasrenewed some speculationabout the long-term plans for Sky, as Comcast has previously seriously explored a sale of the German operation.Craig Moffett, the co-founder of the respected US equity research company MoffettNathanson, has previously published research notes criticising Comcast’s move to buy a “declining asset”. Asked if that view had changed, he said: “What I think is clear from that writing is that they never should have bought it in the first place. I’ll let what I’ve written speak for itself.”However, Sky is not facing the same precipitous “cable meltdown” conditions seen in the US market and remains a must-have for many households, especially sports fans.In the last Premier League TV rights auction deep-pocketed Skypaid a record £5.2bn, winning four out of the five available “packages” of games through to the end of the 2028-29 season. The deal, which included an unprecedented number of matches, at least 215 a season, has helped Sky to break viewing records.View image in fullscreenLiverpool play West Ham United on Sunday 13 April. The combination of the Premier League and Masters golf coverage brought Sky Sports its most-watched day of sports ever.Photograph: Ian Hodgson/APIn April, a combination of Premier League and Rory McIlroy’s historic Masters golf win helped Sky Sports to achieve its most-watched day of sports ever.Sky’s canny move toget into broadband in 2006has also seen it build a customer base estimated at 6.6 million by Enders Analysis, second only to BT.And Sky Mobile, launched in 2017, has an estimated 3.7 million subscribers and continues to grow at an estimated 5% to 10% annually, making it the fastest-growing mobile service in the UK.“Is Sky facing a slow death? No,” says Claire Enders, the founder of Enders Analysis. “They havesurvived 13 yearsagainst the likes of Neftlix spending enormous amounts of money and it is not like their model has been unseated, it has just had to change.“It has been an incredibly tough market, and there are more TV options than ever before, and Sky is investing very heavily in a number of strategies to reduce dependency on content now on streaming services.“You can say they have been through the worst already and come out the other side, the business has stabilised and is being set up for the very long term.”Explore more on these topicsSkyComcastTelevision industryTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Shortly after reading his article, I began to read a Norwegian novel, Out Stealing Horses by Per Petterson, translated by Anne Born. It includes the telling comment: “The good thing about the BBC’s World Service … is that I can get updated on the position of countries like Jamaica, Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka in a sport such as cricket; a game I have never seen played and never will see … But what I have noticed is that ‘The Motherland’, England, is constantly being beaten. That’s always something.’Clare AddisonMarston, OxfordThe cuts proposed for theBBC World Servicecome on top of plans to deny BBC radio programmes to anyone living outside the UK by limiting access to BBC Sounds. Yet I can listen to French, Polish and other overseas radio here in the UK with no restrictions. Why shouldn’t we share our news, music and culture with the rest of the world?Eddie TulasiewiczLondonThe BBC’s Russian language service and its World Service (Ministers demand BBC World Service plan for cuts as aid budget slashed, 11 May) were major sources of reliable and objective news for thesamizdat(self-published) material that was printed and distributedsub rosain the Soviet Union.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s “bias” is in favour of rigorously tested and reviewed scientific evidence built up over decades. That evidence shows that we must reach net zero by 2050 to keep warming to less than 2C, a target accepted as necessary to avoid dangerous impacts of warming.Nearly 80%percent of the public are concerned about climate change in the UK and more thatsix in 10support the government’s commitment to net zero by 2050. The UK’s commitment to net zero offers huge opportunities for growth and will increase national security and resilience. Science has much to offer in support of achieving net zero, and the UK must find fair ways to deliver that change. Giving up is not an option.Sheila RowanVice-president, Royal SocietyFollowingTony Blair, Andrew Bowie is the latest politician to complain about the cost of reaching net zero, claiming that it is “not conducive to the overall economic wellbeing of this country”. This fails to recognise that a green transition will create jobs and lead to growth.However, estimating the cost of reaching net zero is looking at the issue the wrong way. The important question is: what is the cost ofnotreaching net zero by 2050? There is an increasing amount of data on climate-change events already taking place, and even moderate extrapolations are alarming.

Plus other readers express their fears over the billMon 19 May 2025 12.44 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 13.24 EDTShareRegarding Polly Toynbee’s article (MPs are voting on the next stage of the assisted dying bill. This is their chance to create a legacy. 15 May), in June 2018, I received a bone marrow transplant for myelofibrosis – a condition that, only a few years earlier, would have led to a fairly uncomfortable and painful death. My consultant at the time, whom I liked and respected greatly, was not hopeful the transplant would succeed. My quality of life had been steadily deteriorating, and the two years that followed the transplant were extremely difficult. I remain immunocompromised and live with chronic health conditions that require monitoring, and yet, despite everything, I have had a number of years of life well lived.Had you asked my opinion of assisted dying eight, five or three years ago, I might have responded very differently. My views then would have been shaped by pain, the mental toll of illness, the isolation it brings and the deep sense of guilt over the burden I felt I placed on those close to me, and over the NHS resources I consume.Medical opinions often differ, and I’ve witnessed how care can shift depending on how a patient presents – mood, appearance and speech all have an effect on our treatment. In an unequal society, how can we ensure that a decision as final as assisted dying is truly free from undue influence or even prejudice?The risk is that the bill could unintentionally set us on a path where choosing to die becomes seen as a selfless or responsible act, disproportionately affecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society, and safeguards will be eroded as society becomes “trained” to see assisted dying as just another life option. Current societal norms of compassion for the weakest and the poorest in society will become eroded as assisted dying replaces improved funding for compassionate and comprehensive palliative care.David GibbonCardiffThe Royal College of Psychiatrists’ position risks underestimating both the safeguards in the assisted dying bill and the capacity of terminally ill people to make autonomous, informed decisions about their lives (Royal College of Psychiatrists says it cannot yet support assisted dying bill, 14 May). Kim Leadbeater’s bill applies only to mentally competent adults with a terminal diagnosis and a prognosis of six months or less. It includes clear protections to ensure that choices are freely made and not influenced by untreated mental illness. Suggesting that psychiatrists are unable to assess this not only undermines our expertise but risks denying dying individuals the right to make decisions about their own bodies in their final days.Autonomy in healthcare is a fundamental principle. Every day, patients make complex, life-altering choices about surgery, treatment refusal, even palliative sedation. That the same liberty should be withheld at the end of life is not only inconsistent but deeply unjust.With more than 25 years’ experience of supporting families in their most challenging and vulnerable moments, I know that compassion and clinical rigour can and must coexist. Other countries have shown that it is possible to create safe, ethical systems of care for terminally ill patients who may be considering assisted dying. In this country, only those with the means to travel to Dignitas can exercise this choice. We have, in effect, a two-tier system: access to assisted dying is available, but only to the wealthy. That is not a safeguard, it is an elitist injustice.Dr Sabina DosaniChild and adolescent psychiatrist; visiting researcher and ambassador for medical and health humanities, University of East AngliaWe should not be surprised that MPs are changing their minds on the assisted dying bill (At least five more MPs decide to vote against England and Wales assisted dying bill, 14 May). In the House of Commons, assisted dying may present as a “for or against” voting issue, but the reality of decision-making is far less straightforward. Besides aye and nay, other valid positions can easily be overlooked – for example, “yes if”, “no unless”, “not yet”, “don’t know”.Dividing lines run through the cabinet, parliament, the medical profession, the charitable sector, communities and families. They also run through individuals, not least those who are or may become terminally ill. The lines move as circumstances change; people change their minds – often.The legislative process has catalysed debate around assisted dying. Regrettably, the debate has been unduly affected by the process, especially since a private member’s bill is being considered. More time for wider deliberation and discussion, without the pressure of parliamentary timetables, would have been welcome. Given the subject, any legislation would always be controversial – some would say rightly so – but legislation should follow a broader, more deliberate national discussion. Here, the horse appears to have found itself behind the cart.Full disclosure: I am living with an incurable illness. Before and since diagnosis, I have been firmly against assisted dying, in principle and in practice. If media coverage is anything to go by, stark realities surrounding end-of-life issues seem to be overshadowed by exchanges of sincerely held but stridently expressed views. It feels as if people are in danger of losing out to process; we must do better.Name and address suppliedThank you for Lucy Webster’s measured piece on assisted dying (The assisted dying lobby isn’t being honest with you – disabled people are at risk from this bill, 14 May). As a person with complex health problems, including multiple sclerosis and brain haemorrhage, I believe that the passing of this bill will be the very thin edge of a terrifying wedge.With disabled people’s rights under attack by successive governments, who is to say that in 10 or 20 years’ time, the supposedly “economically inactive” will not be encouraged to cease being a burden on their families and society. I am not economically inactive – I receive personal independence payment, and I spend it; I enjoy my life immensely, despite its limitations. I never, ever thought that a Labour government would decide to consign people unable to work to the scrapheap or, potentially, open the door to an even worse outcome.Harriet ConnidesEast Finchley, LondonExplore more on these topicsAssisted dyingDeath and dyingHouse of CommonsPsychiatryDoctorsInequalityHealth policylettersShareReuse this content"

As they reach north-western Europe, the winds will break down areas of high pressure and plunge much of the region into more unsettled weather, with frontal rainfall likely into next week – a welcome event at a time of year that is crucial for the development of crops.In the run-up to these Atlantic lows, warm and unstable air could trigger showers and thunderstorms in southern France and the Alps, followed by drop in temperature that could bring snow to high altitudes on Friday.It will also become very unsettled across parts of southern and eastern Africa over the next few days, notablySouth Africa, southern Mozambique and Madagascar.Deep areas of low pressure passing eastwards off the southern tip of the continent will generate cold southerly winds and a chance of snowfall over the mountains in SouthAfrica.Daytime temperatures are likely to be 10-12C below the seasonal norm, such as in Bloemfontein, where it will struggle to top 10C on Wednesday, far below the 21C average in late May.Gale-force winds exceeding 50mph are expected to trigger dangerous sea conditions along the south-eastern coast of South Africa, whipping waves above 7 metres. Strong winds and high waves will also bombard the southern Mozambique channel between Madagascar and the African mainland, posing a threat to mariners.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWeather trackerSpringEuropeSouth AfricaAfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Cecot prison is known for its harsh conditions, and lawyers for Venezuelan deporteeshave allegedthat the migrants being held there are victims of physical and emotional “torture”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To date, the Trump administration has not released complete records for the more than 200 Venezuelans transferred to El Salvador. Cato’s review includes information for 174 men whose cases have some degree of public documentation.The Trump administration has accused many of the deported Venezuelan men of gang involvement, but in many cases, those claims appear to hinge largely on their tattoos.Many of the tattoos cited as evidence have no connection to gang activity. The markings reflect, in many cases, personal or cultural references.Cato uses the example of Andry José Hernández Romero,a makeup artist, who has crown tattoos on his arms that reference the Three Kings Day celebrations in his Venezuelan hometown.The report comes amid a sprawling crackdown on immigrants in the US. On Monday,the supreme court ruledthat the Trump administration could proceed with efforts to revoke temporary protected status (TPS) for Venezuelans. Ending TPS, which protects foreign citizens who cannot return home because of war, natural disaster or other extraordinary circumstances, could open up approximately 350,000 people for potential deportation.Agencies contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationVenezuelaTrump administrationUS politicsAmericasEl SalvadornewsShareReuse this content"

According to the police, the suspect arrived at her house disguised as a delivery man and shot Estupiñán in the face when she opened the door. Surveillance camera footage showed the suspect fleeing shortly afterwards.“She was a young, enterprising woman with a whole life ahead of her, but those dreams are cut short like the dreams of many women in this country,” said Magda Victoria Acosta, the president of the national gender commission of the Colombian Judiciary.‘Nowhere is safe’: Colombia confronts alarming surge in femicidesRead moreAuthorities later confirmed that Estupiñán had previously been a victim of domestic violence, and that preliminary investigations point to a possible femicide, the intentional killing of women and girls because of their gender.“It could be a case of femicide, since she filed several complaints for domestic violence in previous years, but that is a matter of investigation,” said Col Leonardo Capacho of the Cúcuta police.Estupiñán had previously reported her ex-partner for domestic violence, according to women’s rights lawyers. The day before her death, a judge reportedlyruled in Estupiñán’s favour,ordering the abuser to compensate Estupiñán with 30m pesos, approximately $1,554.Activists say the Colombian state is implicated in the crime. Alejandra Vera, the director of Cúcuta-based feminist collective Woman, Speak Out and Move It, said the murder was “preventable” but that the “state fails to act”.“The brutal murder of María José is the result of a system that normalises violence against women,” said Vera. “Colombia is facing a pandemic of femicides – every 28 hours, a woman is a victim. Each crime reflects a systematic pattern of impunity and state negligence.“María José, like thousands, did what the system demands: she reported the crime, presented evidence, and asked for help. But the state let her die,” said Vera. “There are no effective protection orders, no follow-up care for abusers, and no shelters with the capacity.Womenare left completely unprotected, and the perpetrators know it.”Femicide does not refer to any homicide of a woman, but rather to the murder of women for their gender.According to the Colombian Observatory of Femicides, femicides in the South American nation reached a seven-year high in 2024, with886 recorded. The NGO said that up untilMarch 2025, 207 femicides had been reported. Figures vary, however, with theattorney generalacknowledging 640 cases by November 2024.Human Rights Watchhas previously warned that gender-based violence in Colombia “is widespread” and that perpetrators are “rarely held accountable”.Mexican beauty influencer shot dead during TikTok live streamRead moreVera said that laws exist to protect women in Colombia, “but they are dead letters”. According to Woman, Speak Out and Move It, the police lack staff and resources, prosecutors are not trained to investigate gender-based violence, and repeat offenders are not monitored. Meanwhile, the National Women’s Network NGO said that 73% of femicides in Colombia between 2021 and 2023 went unsolved.Estupiñán’s killing as been compared to the 13 May shooting of 23-year-old influencer Valeria Márquez in Mexico,who was killed when livestreaming at a salon. The Mexican state prosecutor’s office has said it was investigating the crime as femicide.Women’s rights activists are now calling for marches in Cúcuta and Bogotá to demand justice for Estupiñán.At her funeral this weekend, a family member said: “María José, life for you was a wonderful journey, but very short.

The prison would be built in Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, a town bordering Suriname that once received prisoners shipped by Napoleon III in the 1800s, some of whom were sent to the notoriousDevil’s Islandoff the coast of French Guiana.The French justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, announced plans to build the high-security wing during an official visit to French Guiana on Saturday. He said in a Facebook post that 15 of the wing’s 60 spaces would be reserved for Islamic militants.Darmanin was quoted by Le Journal du Dimanche, a French weekly newspaper, as saying that the prison also aims to keep suspected drug traffickers from having any contact with their criminal networks.“We are seeing more and more drug trafficking networks,” he told reporters in French Guiana. “We must react.”French media, quoting the justice ministry, reported that people from French Guiana and French Caribbean territories would be sent in priority to the new prison.The announcement angered many across French Guiana, an overseas French department located in South America. It was once an infamous colony known for holding French political prisoners, including army Capt Alfred Dreyfus, who was accused of being a spy.Dreyfus was incarcerated on Devil’s Island, a penal colony that operated for a century and was featured in the bestselling French novel Papillon, which later was made into two movies.Jean-Paul Fereira, the acting president of French Guiana’s territorial collective, an assembly of 51 lawmakers that oversees local government affairs, said it was taken aback by the announcement since the plan to build a high-security wing was never discussed ahead of time.“It is therefore with astonishment and indignation that the elected members of the Collectivity discovered, with the entire population of Guiana, the information detailed in Le Journal Du Dimanche,” he wrote in a statement posted on social media.Fereira said the move was disrespectful and insulting, noting that the agreement French Guiana signed in 2017 was for the construction of a new prison meant to alleviate overpopulation at the main prison.“While all local elected officials have long been calling for strong measures to curb the rise of organised crime in our territory, Guiana is not meant to welcome criminals and radicalised people from (mainland France),” he wrote.Also decrying the plan was Jean-Victor Castor, a member of parliament in French Guiana. He said he wrote directly to France’s prime minister to express his concerns, noting that the decision was taken without consulting local officials.“It’s an insult to our history, a political provocation and a colonial regression,” Castor wrote in a statement issued on Sunday as he called on France to withdraw the project.A spokesperson for France’s justice minister did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, haspersecutedlawyers and journalists while millions of citizens suffering hardship have sought refuge elsewhere.Biden extended TPS for another 18 months just days before Trump, who pledged to deport record numbers of undocumented immigrants, returned to the White House in January.In March a federal judge in California put a temporary stay onTrump administrationplans to end TPS for the Venezuelan nationals. The San Francisco-based district judge Edward Chen said the plan to end TPS “smacks of racism” and mischaracterises Venezuelans as criminals.“Acting on the basis of a negative group stereotype and generalizing such stereotype to the entire group is the classic example of racism,” Chen wrote, adding that Venezuelan TPS holders were more likely to hold bachelor’s degrees than US citizens and less likely to commit crimes than the general US population.The San Francisco-based ninth US circuit court of appeals on 18 April declined the administration’s request to pause the judge’s order.The Trump administration thenasked the supreme court to intervene. Justice department lawyers said in their filing that Chen had “wrested control of the nation’s immigration policy” away from the government’s executive branch, headed by Trump.“The court’s order contravenes fundamental executive branch prerogatives and indefinitely delays sensitive policy decisions in an area of immigration policy that Congress recognized must be flexible, fast-paced, and discretionary,” they wrote.The plaintiffs, including some of the TPS recipients and theNational TPS Allianceadvocacy group, said Venezuela remains an unsafe country.They told the supreme court that granting the administration’s request “would strip work authorization from nearly 350,000 people living in the US, expose them to deportation to an unsafe country and cost billions in economic losses nationwide”.But the supreme court granted the justice department’s request. Its brief order was unsigned, as is typical when the justices act on an emergency application. The liberal justiceKetanji Brown Jacksonwas the sole member of the court to publicly dissent.Democrats in the House of Representatives condemned the decision.Pramila Jayapal, ranking member of the immigration integrity, security and enforcement subcommittee, said in a statement: “It is shameful that the Trump administration would pull the rug out from so many Venezuelans who came into the country lawfully, fleeing untold violence and devastation in their home country.”Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultzposted on social media: “Venezuelan TPS holders fled the Maduro regime and built lives in America. This atrocious decision allows Trump to deport non-criminals back to a murderous dictator. This fight is NOT over. We must pass my Venezuela TPS Act to keep our community safe.”The state department currentlywarns against travelto Venezuela “due to the high risk of wrongful detentions, terrorism, kidnapping, the arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime, civil unrest, poor health infrastructure”. The department withdrew all diplomatic personnel in 2019.Trump campaigned for president promising to deport millions of undocumented migrants and a number of his executive orders around immigration have encountered pushback from judges across the country – including the supreme court.Trump lashed out at the court last week after itblocked his effortto resume deportations of alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua using an obscure wartime law, the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.In a 7-2 decision the court, which includes three justices nominated by Trump, said the alleged Tren de Aragua members were not being given enough time to legally contest their removal.Trump responded: “The Supreme Court of the United States is not allowing me to do what I was elected to do. This is a bad and dangerous day for America!”The Trump administration in April also terminated TPS for thousands of Afghans and Cameroonians in the US. Those actions are not part of the current case. Pre-emptive arrests of many people still under the shelter of TPS have been carried out despite the lawsayingsuch people “shall not be detained” based on their immigration status.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationVenezuelaAmericasUS foreign policyTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2023, El Faro moved its business and legal operations to Costa Rica.Last week, after protesters gathered outside Bukele’s house, he accused NGOs of “manipulating” them and proposed a bill to tax 30% of all contributions to NGOs, echoing a law passed by Nicaragua’s autocratic government to silence its critics.Shortly after López’s arrest, Andrés Guzmán, Bukele’s presidential commissioner for human rights and freedom of expression,announced his resignation, without giving a reason.In astatement, international organisations said they were “deeply concerned at the increasingly pervasive environment of fear that threatens freedoms in the country” and called on “US policymakers and the diplomatic community at large to urge President Bukele to cease all attacks against human rights defenders”.Explore more on these topicsEl SalvadorAmericasUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Significant losses in the upper house will only add to calls from opponents inside the party for him to go.Almost three-quarters of respondents said the tax, which is levied on a wide range of goods and services, should be cut “only for food items”, “for all products” or be abolished altogether, the poll found.More worrying for Ishiba, just over 87% of respondents said government efforts to rein in the price ofricehad been “insufficient”, while more than 74% said they did not expect ongoing US-Japan tariff talks – including negotiations on American imports of rice and other foodstuffs – to end favourably to Japan.Earlier this year Ishiba’s government took the unusual step ofdipping into its vast rice reserves. In March it began releasing stockpiled rice in an attempt to arrest price rises that have been blamed on a combination of factors, including higher demand fuelled in part by the tourism boom, distribution bottlenecks, and suspected hoarding by wholesalers and distributors in anticipation of further shortages.But the move, which is usually reserved for shortages caused by natural disasters and crop failures, did not have the desired effect, with prices of domestic rice falling only marginally.The price of rice sold in supermarkets averaged ¥4,214 ($29) for 5kg during the week to 4 May, according to the agriculture ministry. That is ¥18 cheaper than the all-time high recorded a week earlier, but still around double the price at the same time last year.In response, the government said last week it would double the supply of stockpiled rice, with an additional 300,000 tons due for release in the three months to July, media reports said. That is on top of 300,000 tons that has already been released from emergency stockpiles since March. In addition, some of the rice will bypass wholesalers so it can reach shops more quickly.The mounting rice crisis has forced more Japanese restaurants and consumers to turn to cheaper imports. In April, Japanimported South Korean ricefor the first time in a quarter of a century.Last week, the supermarket chain Aeon said it would start selling US-produced Calrose rice from early next month. A 4kg bag will cost about 10% less than Japanese rice.Explore more on these topicsJapanRiceFoodAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

That has sent China’s $11.1bn (£8.4bn) e-cigarette export industry, already scarred by stringent domestic restrictions in 2022, back to the drawing board.It comes as the UK’s forthcoming ban on disposable vapes, which aims to reduce the number of devices that are thrown away – about 8m a week – and stop young people from taking up the habit, has brought new models of e-cigarette into the market.Deborah Arnott, an honorary associate professor at University College London and the former chief executive of Action onSmokingand Health, said China’s natural response would be to target the UK. “With reduced access to the US, there will be growing competition to sell to the UK market, as it’s the main alternative,” she said.Factory owners have already felt the pinch over the past few weeks of global uncertainty, according to Dr Steve Shaowei Xu, a research scientist at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, and an expert on the Chinese e-cigarette industry.“Already there are reports [that] shipments have been blocked and US orders cut in half,” Xu said, adding that the “very sophisticated” industry would find ways to circumnavigate the current “disaster”.Gone in 40 days: how Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariff assault unraveledRead moreBritain, where more than 90% of e-cigarettes are imports from China, has its own internal problems with vaping. Ministers are preparing for a domestic ban on disposable vapes from 1 June, with the aim of curbing youth vaping and reducing plastic waste.Experts are concerned that the industry has already come up with a workaround that will stymie the efforts of the UK government, while cheaper Chinese imports diverted from the US could put downward pressure on prices.Manufacturers have been rapidly developing new models that comply with the ban, with variations of popular brands now widely available.These vapes are rechargeable, and have a replaceable pod and a changeable coil, which means they qualify as a “vape kit” and not a disposable. But experts say these often look “very similar” to disposable versions, raising fears they will be treated as such.There are also concerns over the availability of refillable pods. The Guardian went to 30 stores in London and Manchester, looking for refills of the Elf Bar 600 prefilled-pod kit. Only two shops stocked them.Arnott said: “All the main manufacturers produce these products now and they look the same and are very similar prices to the disposables they are replacing.“My concern is that because they don’t look any different and are still very cheap, people may carry on treating them like disposables and throwing them away rather than buying refills.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To give an accurate and balanced picture of the current market landscape, it is important that all major brands are included.”Explore more on these topicsVapingChinaTrump tariffsChinese economyAsia PacificTariffsSmokingnewsShareReuse this content"

Putin also suggested his country’s maximalist objectives in the war with Ukraine were unchanged.In contrast, Trump offered a far more positive spin, saying in a post on his Truth Social network that the talks went “very well”.“The tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent … Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War,” he wrote, suggesting that the Vatican should host future Russia-Ukraine negotiations.Trump’s statement after the call with Putin also suggested the US would be stepping back from the negotiations. He said the conditions for a deal could only be negotiated by the “warring parties”, despite his earlier claim that he could end the war in a single day.Trump later said it would be “great” to hold peace talks at the Vatican, but again suggested the US could abandon its involvement, telling reporters that if there is no progress: “I’m just going to back away.”Beyond Trump’s occasionally optimistic rhetoric, no breakthrough appears in sight. Despite previouslydemanding an immediate ceasefireand backing Europe’s ultimatum for Russia to halt hostilities, he now appears to be once again easing off pressure on Moscow. He made no mention of his previous threats to impose sanctions on Russia if it did not agree to halt the fighting.Moscow has consistently rejected extended ceasefire proposals, arguing they would give Ukraine time to rearm and regroup at a time Russian forces are making battlefield advances.On Monday, Putin claimed Russia supported a halt to hostilities, but said it was necessary to “identify the most effective paths toward peace”.Crucially, Putin repeated his longstanding refrain that the “root causes” of the war must be addressed: a reference to Russia’s far-reaching demands that would severely undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty.These demands include forcing Ukraine to “denazify” and demilitarise, cutting back its armed forces, barring it from receiving western military support, and imposing sweeping limits on its sovereignty.Since Trump’s re-election, Putin has been engaged in a delicate balancing act with the US president, appearing to support peace talks to stay in Trump’s favour, while pushing for terms that in effect amount to Ukraine’s capitulation.In an apparent show of confidence and nonchalance, Putin took the call with Trump on Monday while touring a music school in Sochi. His bravado is fuelled by Russia’s slow but steady battlefield gains, Europe’s disjointed response, and a domestic economy increasingly adapted for a prolonged war.Trump said he spoke with Zelenskyy and several European leaders after his call with Putin.In a statement late on Monday, Zelenskyy insisted Ukraine was ready for a full ceasefire and direct negotiations with Moscow, but said: “If the Russians are not ready to stop the killings, there must be stronger sanctions. Pressure on Russia will push it toward real peace.”He added: “If Putin puts forward unrealistic demands, this will mean that Russia continues to drag out the war, and deserves that Europe, America, and the world act accordingly, including with further sanctions. Russia must end the war it started, and it can begin doing so any day.”Zelenskyy also rejected Russia’s demands for Ukraine to withdraw its troops from the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, which Russia claims to have annexed but does not fully control. “No one will withdraw our troops from our territories,” he told reporters.The Ukrainian leader also urged the US not to “distance itself from the talks and the pursuit of peace”.“The only one who benefits from that is Putin,” he said.The flurry of diplomatic activity on Monday came days afterthe first meeting between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in three years, held in Istanbul. Those talks broke down after Russia demanded more territory as a condition for halting the fighting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The US leader proclaimed “nothing will happen” on the peace talks until he met Putin.But Putin and Trump remained silent on the prospect of a meeting on Monday.Despite Putin’s continued refusal to agree to a temporary ceasefire, Trump has stopped short of directly criticising him – even asa growing consensus in Washingtonsees the Russian president as the main obstacle to progress in the peace talks.As in previous calls, Putin appeared to cultivate a personal rapport with Trump, congratulating him on the birth of his 11th grandson, according to Putin’s top foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov.Putin has publicly praised Trump on several occasions, flattering him as “courageous” after the 2024 assassination attempt at a campaign rally. He also claimed to have prayed for “his friend” after Trump was grazed by a bullet.According to Ushakov, Trump told Putin during the call: “Vladimir, you can pick up the phone anytime. I’ll be happy to answer and happy to talk with you.”Speaking before the call between the two leaders, the US vice-president, JD Vance, said Trump would press Putin on whether he was “serious” about ending the war.“We realise there’s a bit of an impasse here. And I think the president’s going to say to President Putin: ‘Look, are you serious? Are you real about this?’” Vance said as he prepared to depart from Italy.“I think honestly that President Putin, he doesn’t quite know how to get out of the war,” Vance said, adding that he had just spoken to Trump.He said Trump may offer Putin economic incentives to accept some concessions on Ukraine in return for peace.But the vice-president also raised the prospect of the US walking away from the talks – a scenario that will unsettle European allies and raise doubts about America’s willingness to keep providing military and economic aid to Ukraine.Vance said that it “takes two to tango. I know the president’s willing to do that, but if Russia is not willing to do that, then we’re eventually just going to say, this is not our war.Fearing that Trump might strike a deal with the Kremlin at Ukraine’s expense, European leaders rushed on Sunday to sway his thinking before the talks.The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, said he held talks with the leaders of the US, Italy, France and Germany on Sunday evening to coordinate efforts to pressure Russia into accepting an unconditional ceasefire, warning that new sanctions could be imposed if Moscow refuses to engage seriously.The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said in a statement: “Putin must show he wants peace by accepting the 30-day unconditional ceasefire.”Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropeVladimir PutinDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response,” the three allied governments said in a statement on Monday.Netanyahu responded to the message, saying Israel will continue to defend itself until total victory was achieved. “The leaders in London, Ottawa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7 while inviting more such atrocities,” Netanyahu said.International pressure over a looming famine forced the Israeli prime minister to announce on Sunday night that he would ease the 11-week siege ofGazato prevent a “starvation crisis”.‘Our hearts ache’: the fight for survival in Gaza amid Israel’s new offensive and no aidRead moreNearly 24 hours later the UN said nine trucks of aid had been cleared to enter. This is less than 2% of daily shipments before the war, when Palestinians in Gaza were well fed and the strip had its own agricultural sector, and will make no meaningful difference to the crisis now gripping most of its 2.3 million population.Britain,Franceand Canada described Israeli measures as “wholly inadequate”, warned it risked breaching international law and called for “a return to delivery of aid in line with humanitarian principles”.Netanyahu’s decision to allow even a trickle of food in to Gaza had been attacked by far-right critics including members of his own cabinet. On Monday he shared a video on social media explaining his hand had been forced by close allies.For weeks, Israeli officials insisted that there were “no shortages” in Gaza. But “senators” who are Israel’s “greatest friends in the world” had warned they would drop support for the country over images of starving Palestinians, Netanyahu said.“[They told me]: ‘We cannot accept images of hunger, mass hunger. We cannot stand that. We will not be able to support you,’” Netanyahu said. He added that deepening desperation inside Gaza was taking Israel towards a “red line, to a point where we might lose control”,without clarifying what he was referring to.He did not name his critical “friends”, but last week at the end of trip around the region – which did not include a stop in Israel – Donald Trump said“a lot of people are starving” in the strip, and claimed he would “take care” of the situation.After he secured the release of a dual US-Israeli national hostage from Hamas last week, there had been hopes the US president would broker a lasting ceasefire for the entire strip. Instead, Israellaunched a new ground offensive inside Gazaalmost immediately after he left the region.Heavy bombardments killed hundreds of Palestinians over the weekend. Strikes also targeted the strip’s battered hospitals, bringing the total toll from the war inside Gaza to 53,486, most of them civilians.“The fighting is intense and we are making progress. We will take control of all the territory of the Strip,” Netanyahu said in a video posted on Telegram on Monday.The Israeli military declared all of central Khan Younis city a “combat zone”, ordering civilians to leave. Most have been displaced repeatedly, are weakened by hunger and with much of the strip in ruins have nowhere to go.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its director, Jake Woods, a former US marine, said the GHF would be “up and running before the end of the month”, but it is not clear who will pay for the aid.The UN and international humanitarian groups who have brought food into Gaza since the war began have said they will not work with GHF, because its armed contractors and links to the Israeli military compromise key principles including neutrality and put staffers at risk.Israeli foreign ministry officials declined to comment on funding.Israel launched the war after cross-border attacks by Hamas killed 1,200 people, the majority civilians. Another 250 were taken hostage, with 58 still in Gaza – but nearly two-thirds of them are thought to be dead.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelGazaHamasFranceCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

And so I’m confident that these deals will lead to investment coming to Britain,” Reeves said.Labourhopes that will help to underpin the growth it sorely needs to fulfil its promises to voters.Three aspects of the EU agreement have been particularly welcomed by business, and form the core of the economic package – although many details remain to be negotiated.The first is the long-hoped-for agreement to create a common sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) area, under whichcumbersome checks on food and agricultural productswill be lifted in return for the UK aligning with EU standards in these areas.UK and EU reach deal over Brexit reset after fishing rights breakthroughRead moreBoris Johnson, presentinghis trade and cooperation agreement with the EUon Christmas Eve 2020, wrongly claimed there would be “no non-tariff barriers to trade”.In practice, these barriers – including veterinary checks – have been hugely damaging, and a SPS deal is aimed at dismantling some of them, for this key sector.The British Chambers of Commerce, which has long drawn attention to the frustrations suffered by UK exporters, called the prospect of an SPS agreement “a huge boost” that would “cut costs, reduce waste and increase sales”.Reeves, whenasked whether the UK could take a similar approach to other sectors – aligning on rules in exchange for more frictionless market access – said: “Potentially,” pointing to the fact that the two sides had now agreed to meet annually.The second aspect of the deal that carries economic weight is an agreement to cooperate more closely on energy policy, including aligning the EU and UK emissions trading schemes.That should, the government says, “create the conditions for goods originating in our jurisdictions to benefit from mutual exemptions from the respective EU and UK carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAM)”.In practice, the UK government claims that will mean the steel industry escapes £25m a year in levies that the EU would otherwise have imposed, via the CBAM – a policy aimed at ensuring heavily polluting products cannot enter the EU and undercut domestically produced equivalents that have paid to offset their emissions.Government modelling suggests membership of the emissions trading scheme accounts for 0.1% of the 0.3% boost to GDP from the reset, with SPS contributing the other 0.2%.Third, the UK hopes the agreement to negotiate over the possibility of defence industry cooperation will mean UK firms being able to bid for projects procured via the planned EU Security Action ForEurope(SAFE) fund, which will allow member states to borrow to pay for weapons.The language on thisin the EU-UK agreement is scant: the two sides agree to cooperate on “security and defence initiatives, including on defence industry”, and they commit to “swiftly explore any possibilities for mutually beneficial enhanced cooperation created by the SAFE instrument”.But ministers clearly believe this could open the way for UK defence companies such asBAE Systemsto profit, as defence spending ramps up on both sides of the Channel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(It may also have the positive political side-effect of preventing regular rows about fish from spilling out into the headlines.)Economists say the limited size of the direct GDP boost from the deal results from the government’s clear determination not to rejoin the single market or customs union, in order to avoid having to sign up to the free movement of people.John Springford of the Centre for European Reform, whose analysis suggests the UK economy is approximately 5% smaller than it would otherwise have been as a result of Brexit, suggests that the government’s 0.3% estimate still looks relatively generous.Herecently forecastthat an SPS agreement would add less than 0.1%, for example, against the 0.2% upside modelled by the government.However, as Reeves made clear, Labour hopes the economy will gain something more nebulous, which it is harder to plug into a model: a growing acknowledgment from the business sector that the UK is an appealing investment proposition.Before coming to power, Reeves and Keir Starmer hoped the credibility of a steadier hand on the tiller than the Tories’ would win over investors, whose confidence they see as key to the UK’s recovery.Instead, Labour swept into power on a wave of dire warnings about the state of the economy, blindsided businesses with tax rises, and saw GDP continue to flatline.Now, they hope the triumvirate of theIndia-UK trade deal, theUS tariff agreement with Donald Trumpand the EU reset will burnish their reputation as calm and competent stewards of the economy, helping to generate a glimmer of optimism, in a highly uncertain world.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsEconomic growth (GDP)BrexitEuropean UnionEuropeInternational tradeFood & drink industryanalysisShareReuse this content"

But attacks came immediately from rightwing parties, which said the deal would make the UK a “rule taker” from Brussels.From fishing to Erasmus: what the UK’s deal with the EU will meanRead moreStarmer emphasised the tangible benefits the deal would do for Britons, including cheaper food in supermarkets and an end to passport queues at European airports witha deal for travellers to use European e-gates. No 10 hopes both can be clinched within a year.The deal also paves the way for the UK’s return to the Erasmus university exchange programme, and the creation of a youth mobility scheme that would allow young people access to the EU through work, study, au pair or travel.1:37Starmer denies claim ‘win-win’ UK-EU deal has sold out fishing sector – videoUK ministers have insisted the scheme will be capped and time-limited, similar to those deals struck with Australia and New Zealand. But officials said there were hard negotiations yet to be done on whether the capped numbers would be from individual member states or EU-wide.Acknowledgingfor the first time the damage done byBrexitto Britain’s trade, Starmer said the deal to remove restrictions from agrifood trade would give a boost of £9bn to the UK economy. In a government briefing, No 10 said it would redress the 21% drop in exports and 7% drop in imports seen since Brexit.It is the third deal Britain has struck this month, after agreements withIndiaandthe US.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, one of the biggest Europhiles in the cabinet, said Monday’s agreement was “the best deal with the EU for any country” and would show “Britain now is the place to put investment and do business, because we’ve got preferential deals with the biggest economies”.But the price for the trade boost was controversial. The UK will grant EU fishers access to British waters for an additional 12 years, an eleventh-hour concession from the UK three times as long as it had originally offered, which led to cries of betrayal from the Conservatives and industry figures. Boris Johnson, the former prime minister who signed the Brexit deal, said Starmer was “turning this country once again into the orange ball-chewing, leather-trussed gimp”.The National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations said it was “very disappointed” with the deal and that it “surrenders the best prospect that the fishing industry and coastal communities had for growth over the coming decade”.No 10 said the industry would benefit many times over from the export deal which would allow some foods including shellfish to be exported to the EU for the first time since Brexit.The wide-ranging deal struck at the Lancaster House summit on Monday includes:A defence pact as the first step towards securing British access to a new €150bn (£126bn) EU rearmament fund, though the UK will pay into the fund.Faster access for travellers who will be able to use e-gates at airports on the continent, although the timeline is unclear.A landmark emissions-trading deal, meaning UK exporters will avoid £800m of carbon border taxes.Closer cooperation on crime and migration, including access to the EU facial recognition data, a key request from Starmer.UK officials said they had agreed the long-term fishing settlement to give the industry certainty – and that the EU had originally demanded a permanent fishing deal or to time-limit the agrifood deal, which British negotiators refused to accept.Negotiations went late into Sunday night. The final details were offered by UK negotiators at about 10.30pm and negotiations on the language continued until 3am. EU ambassadors met in the early morning to rubber-stamp the three agreed texts.The fraught final hours came after tempers flared in Brussels, particularly when Downing Streetbriefed on Saturday night that the deal was done– but the 12-year fishing deal was not agreed till the following day. Sources suggested that Starmer’s apparent acceptance of a youth mobility deal in an interview on Friday gave EU negotiators an opening to push for further concessions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It crosses one of the totemic red lines of the Brexit negotiations under the Conservatives, accepting dynamic alignment with EU standards and a role for the European court of justice.The change, once formally agreed, will need primary legislation in parliament, though unlike under the Conservatives there is no prospect of Labour MPs holding up the change, though some are uneasy about the deal.Addressing Labour MPs after the summit, Starmer said he would face the political threat from Reform head on, making the case that trade deals would save jobs and put money in people’s pockets.“Reform are our main rivals for power,” he added. “We have a moral responsibility to make sure [Nigel] Farage never wins. We have to be clear that every opportunity he has had in this parliament to back working people he’s voted against. We will take the fight to him. We will fight as Labour.”The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, claimed it would make it “much harder” to get a free trade agreement with the US, where chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef, banned in the EU, are allowed.There is no legal agreement on any of the deals announced and negotiations will now begin on the fine print. But von der Leyen said she hoped that the UK would be able to join the defence agreement “within weeks”.Starmer said he wanted UK holidaymakers to be able to use e-gates in EU countries “as soon as possible”, but the final move will be up to individual states. “There’s no inhibition on this, so I want to see it done quickly,” he said. “For holidaymakers wanting to get out this summer they will want to know that they can do so easily and without delay and chaos.”Badenoch said: “This deal is taking us to the past and that is why we call it surrender.” She stopped short of saying she would rip up the terms of the deal, saying only that she would seek to renegotiate should the Tories return to power.Major supermarkets and food and drink companies hailed the agrifood deal as a gamechanger, though it is expected to make relatively little impact on GDP. The Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that Brexit reduced the UK economy’s long-term productivity by 4%.Salmon Scotland said it was a “breakthrough that eases the burden on our farmers, processors and the communities they support, and we welcome efforts to implement it at pace”.The NFU, an employers’ association representing British farmers, said the benefits would ultimately depend on how much say the UK had over standards it had to adhere to. “This deal will deliver many benefits for agrifood exports to the EU,” the NFU said. “However, there remain important questions about what is within the scope of this agreement and, where current rules and regulations do differ, if there will be any exclusions.”Explore more on these topicsBrexitEuropean UnionEuropeForeign policyKeir StarmerUrsula von der LeyennewsShareReuse this content"

It was not on agrifoods, nor youth mobility, defence or fishing.WhenKeir Starmersaid the UK had changed, the most symbolic evidence of that came in a press release from No 10 that set out the terms of the agreement brokered at Lancaster House.It acknowledged, for the first time, what successive British governments have spent years denying – thatBrexithas damaged Britain. It laid out the figures: the UK has suffered a “21% drop in exports and 7% drop in imports”. Finally, the charade was over.Ghosts of Brexit past haunt new UK-EU deal – Politics Weekly WestminsterRead moreAnd the British public know that. Half of Britons now say the decision to leave the EU was the wrong one and significant numbers of those who did not vote or were too young to vote think Brexit was the wrong decision. Poll after poll suggests the British public believe the UK is now worse off – although often that stops short of a demand that the UK rejoin.Second, and equally symbolic, was the acknowledgment that the changes proposed would require a vote in parliament. That confirmation came from No 10 almost as an afterthought.But there was a time not so long ago when the prospect of a vote in parliament on a deal like this would have been the top line of every news story. Gone are the days when Steve Baker or Bill Cash would be on the bulletins crying foul at every line of compromise.1:37Starmer denies claim ‘win-win’ UK-EU deal has sold out fishing sector – videoStarmer is the first prime minister in more than a decade who doesn’t have to worry about that vote at all, despite some Labour MPs who, in “red wall” seats facing Reform, feel nervous. But most of Starmer’s parliamentary party would probably prefer to see a deal that went even further.There will be no anguished briefings from rebel Conservative Eurosceptics who once in effective held Downing Street hostage and brought down two prime ministers. Kemi Badenoch’s vow to oppose all the changes was irrelevant.It is that radically changed approach and circumstance – referred to time and again by Ursula von der Leyen as she praised “dear Keir” at Monday’s press conference – which has seen this EU reset over the line less than six months after Starmer set the date.But that stability in parliament certainly does not mean that there is no political risk to this deal. There will be a battle on the front pages and the airwaves to set the narrative. Starmer’s main political rival now is not a wounded Tory party but the far more dangerous godfather of Brexit, Nigel Farage.On Monday night, Starmer finally made that case to Labour MPs, vowing that he would fight Farage “as Labour” – a tacit acknowledgment that he has perhaps aped his opponent’s language too much on issue like migration.But he said he would make the case that Reform UK’s plans for Britain would make people poorer, dismissing the Conservatives as no longer Labour’s principle rival.Farage, he said, was “a state-slashing, NHS-privatising Putin apologist. Without a single patriotic bone in his body. We will take the fight to him. We will fight as Labour.“We must repair the social contract. We must unite the country against Reform. We must tackle the cost-of-living crisis. And we must show that we are the party – the only party – that can deliver change for working people,” he added.For Starmer, it will be a race to sell the benefits of his agrifoods and energy deals – cheaper food and cheaper energy bills – combined with quicker queues at the airport for frustrated Britons trying to placate their children as they land from their holidays. Practical delivery versus ideology.From Farage and Badenoch, there are cries of betrayal on two fronts. The first is fishing: a 12-year deal to keep the status quo when the industry had hoped for better terms from 2026. That was the price of a permanent agrifoods deal, worth so much more to the economy but potentially at the expense of such a symbolically important British industry.And the second is the sense that Britain has crossed the Rubicon that makes it a rule-taker, agreeing dynamic alignment on standards and a role for the European court of justice.No 10 is gambling that the public has lost interest in much of the technical aspects of the trade talks, as long as Brexit negotiations do not dominate the media discourse or are not seen to be distracting senior politicians from domestic matters.But there is also a risk of a distracted public – that voters already inclined to feel angry towards the government will see headlines about a “Brexit betrayal” and assume the worst, without reading the details. It is this arena where Farage has always had his greatest success.Explore more on these topicsTrade policyBrexitEuropean UnionKeir StarmerEuropeForeign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

National security council spokesperson James Hewitt told the Guardian in an email: “Hamas has rejected repeated ceasefire proposals, and therefore bears sole responsibility for this conflict,” maintaining the policy stance inherited from the previous Biden administration despite mounting evidence of humanitarian catastrophe.The Israeli military on Monday instructed residents of southern Gaza’s Khan Younis to “evacuate immediately” as it prepares to “destroy the capabilities of terrorist organizations” – signalling plans for intensified bombardment in a war that has already claimed more than 53,000 Palestinian lives, according to Gaza’s health ministry.Despite Israeli promises to “flatten” Gaza, opposition from Congress – and mainstream Democrats more broadly – has been largely muted. While the besieged territory faces what the World Health Organization (Who)calls“one of the world’s worst hunger crises”, more than three dozen members of Congress from both parties recently appeared in an American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac)videoin celebration of Israel’s 77th birthday. In New York, leading mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo held up an Israeli flag in the city’s annual Israel Day Parade on Sunday.This political genuflection comes as a MarchGallup pollshows American support for Israel has dropped to 46% – its lowest point in 25 years – while sympathy for Palestinians has risen to a record 33%. Democrats reported sympathizing with Palestinians over Israelis by a three-to-one ratio.On a recentepisodeof The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Senator Bernie Sanders blamed Washington’s reluctance to change course on the financial muscle of lobbying groups. “If you speak up on that issue, you’ll have super Pacs like Aipac going after you,” Sanders said, noting Aipac’s record$14.5m campaignto unseat Democratic representative Jamaal Bowman after he accused Israel of genocide.Israel’s ‘no hunger in Gaza’ narrative flies in face of obvious evidenceRead moreA small contingent of progressive lawmakers continue to voice opposition despite being largely iced out from public discourse in Washington. Representative Delia Ramirez of Illinois condemned the “lethal, unaccountable, extremist duo” of Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Donald Trump. “Americans have said they do not want to be complicit in their barbaric campaigns. It is time for us in Congress to exercise our power and take action. Not one more cent, not one more bomb, not one more excuse,” she told the Guardian.Representative Ilhan Omar similarly decried the latest chapter of the lopsided war onGaza, calling it “another unconscionable moral stain”.“Despite the fanfare of Donald Trump’s trip [to the Middle East last weak], they’re not closer to a ceasefire,” Omar said. “It is deeply shameful that innocent civilians are continuing to pay the price.”Vermont senator Peter Welch recently led 29 Senate colleagues in introducing a resolution calling on theTrump administrationto end the blockade of humanitarian aid. “It’s been over two months since the Israeli government has been using its power to withhold food, medicine, lifesaving cancer treatments, dialysis systems, formula, and more from starving and suffering families across Gaza,” he said.Resolutions, however, are symbolic gestures meant to publicize opinions and do not have the force of law.While the lawmakers voice their concerns, their impact on policy remains limited, representing the growing disconnect between Washington policymakers and public sentiment. That the grassroots movement for Palestinian rights in the US has grown more subdued – in large part due to an aggressive crackdown by the Trump administration against the universities that were host to last year’s protests – may take some of the pressure off for them to act.One insider familiar with discussions between the US and Israel toldthe Washington Postthat the Americans have been hitting Israel with a tougher stance over the last few weeks. Haaretz has alsoreportedgrowing pressure by the US on Israel to agree to a framework for a temporary ceasefire.“Trump’s people are letting Israel know: ‘We will abandon you if you do not end this war,’” the insider said. Trump and JD Vance both skipped over Israel on recent trips abroad, widely interpreted as a snub of Netanyahu.Netanyahu has announced the resumption of “minimal” humanitarian aid into Gaza, and the UN said on Monday that nine aid trucks were authorised to enter Gaza, a “drop in the ocean” given the scale of desperation.Whether US voices calling for change in US policy and a wind-down of the catastrophic war are just shouting in the void, may become clearer in the coming days.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warTrump administrationGazaBiden administrationIsraelUS politicsMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

On Saturday, the pair addressed the Co-operative Group’s annual general meeting in Manchester.Before the meeting, Salaime told the Guardian of the threat posed by a billbeing debatedin Israel’s Knesset. If it became law, it would decimate the finances of NGOs in Israel that receive funding from foreign states.“All support from foreign countries for the peacemakers of the left, the liberal and the democratic; humanitarian aid or legal aid for the Palestinians, will be taxed 80% from foreign countries,” she said.“Thebiggest supportersfor Wahat Salam come from the UK, from the Co-op, our friends in Switzerland, in Sweden, in the US. We don’t have any local Israeli support for our project … financially and ideologically, they are against us.”Sharon added: “We faced financial problems and challenges in the past, but if this law passes, we will be in severe problems, most of our education projects will just shut down.”View image in fullscreenChildren in a classroom in the village of Wahat Salam - Neve Shalom.Conceived by Bruno Hussar, a Jewish Catholic priest,the villagestarted with a handful of residents in 1978, in “no man’s land” between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.It now has 300 residents, half Israeli Palestinians and half Israeli Jews, including academics and tech professionals, with a waiting list of about 200 families. There is no synagogue or mosque: instead, residents pray or meditate in a dome called the Court of Silence.Surrounded by olive trees, communal life in the village revolves around committee meetings where the co-operative’s decisions are voted on, shared meals, the swimming pool and the Garden of Rescuers, which commemorates heroes of global catastrophes. There is a guesthouse in the village, and children from surrounding areas are bussed in to attend the school.Salaime said: “We were attacked by settlers three times. We had two arson attacks in 2021. They set fire to our peace school, and we rebuilt it and the peace library. They attacked the primary school, destroying 16 vehicles … we have all kinds of unfortunate incidents, and we survive.”Salaime, a social worker and feminist of the “third generation of the Nakba”, moved to the village from East Jerusalem in 2000, five days before the second intifada, looking for a “decent school”. Her three sons have grown up with Jewish friends, facing the “complexity” of a “soulmate” agreeing to serve in the Israel Defense Forces. When her home came within a range of rockets from Gaza, Salaime reassured her mother that she could use her Jewish neighbour’s shelter.“We break the rules, we break the stereotype, the brainwashing of the Israeli mainstream that peace isn’t possible,” Salaime said. “We have to win this and offer a different agenda.”Sharon was 14 when his parents moved to the village 23 years ago and said it gives “isolated lefties, Jewish peacemakers and activists” a place to “coexist”.“We are not some kind of utopia, where everything is perfect and there is no debate,” he said. “When there is October 7 and the war, we have to talk about it.”Leading theCo-op’s peace-building campaign,Paul Gerrard, Co-op Group’s policy director, said the village was a “breathtaking example of where people come together around a goal, in that cooperative way, they can survive and they can thrive”.Explore more on these topicsIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Deaths among women that age rose by 46% and among men by 31%, between 1990 and 2023.In contrast, mortality has fallen in 19 of the 21 other countries studied, with only the US and Canada showing the same rise as the UK. Britain now has the fourth highest overall female mortality and sixth highest overall male mortality rate among the 22 nations. The US topped both league tables.Jennifer Dixon, the Health Foundation’s chief executive, said: “This report is a health check we can’t afford to ignore – and the diagnosis is grim.“The UK is becoming the sick person of the wealthy world, especially for people of working age. While other nations moved forward, we stalled – and in some areas slipped badly behind.”Dixon pointed out the improvement in UK death rates since 1990 slowed significantly during the 2010s, with the austerity policies pursued by the coalition government after 2010 a significant factor. Smoking, alcohol misuse and bad diet also help explain Britain’s increasingly sick population.By 2023, women in the UK had a 14% higher death rate than the median in the other countries, while among men of all ages it was 9%.Prof David Leon, who led the research at LSHTM, said: “What is particularly disturbing about our findings is that the risk of dying among adults in the prime of life – those who have not yet got to the age of 50 – has been increasing in the UK for over a decade, while in most other countries it has declined.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The rate of such deaths in 2023 – 93 per million population – was double the 43.5 per 100,000 that occurred as recently as 2012, which underlines the sharp increase in drug mortality.Mortality due to suicide has also risen but alcohol-related deaths plateaued for women and fell for men between 2009 and 2019, the thinktank found.The Local Government Association and WithYou, a drugs charity, called for the government to make it easier for drug users, people close to them and health professionals to access and use naloxone, an emergency antidote to overdoses involving heroin, methadone and other drugs.Robin Pollard, WithYou’s head of policy and influencing, said: “We also know getting people into structured treatment is critical to reduce the numbers of drug deaths, and so we continue to call for easier access to higher-quality opiate substitution treatment.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Every death from the misuse of drugs is a tragedy.

A sense of feeling safe falls from 7.2 in year 7 to 5.9 in year 9 among female pupils, compared with a decline from 7.4 to 6.6 for male pupils.Almost every country with available data sees a decline in engagement as children advance through school, but the report says it is more pronounced in England, “suggesting that disengagement is not just a symptom of age, but something atypical happening in our context”.The findings come from the Research Commission on Engagement and Lead Indicators (RCELI), led by theImpactEdgroup in partnership with the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), the Confederation of School Trusts (CST), and other education organisations.The commission chair, Sue John, said: “It is crucial that we identify the points at which pupils are starting to disengage with school, so that we can intervene to stop a disconnection leading to non-attendance and poorer outcomes.“This research provides rich and nuanced insights into pupil engagement at a school and classroom level, which will enable leaders to act fast and understand more complex dynamics in their schools, such as what is happening at age 11 for different pupil groups.”Margaret Mulholland, Special educational needs and disabilities (Send) and inclusion specialist at the ASCL, said: “The transition between primary and secondary school is a hugely important stage of a child’s education.“It can also be an unsettling time where issues with anxiety and behaviour can arise. As this study shows, a drop in engagement during this period can be hugely detrimental to a pupil’s wellbeing and attainment.”Leora Cruddas, chief executive of the CST, added: “There are many factors beyond schools which may be contributing to this picture. We need to delve deeper into what the factors are that are driving this disengagement and how we might reconnect these pupils with schooling.”Explore more on these topicsEducationPrimary schoolsSecondary schoolsSchoolsChildrenTeachingMental healthnewsShareReuse this content"

This includes the war inUkraine, which has forced countries to grow fewer crop types, leaving pollinators without diverse food throughout the season.The researchers found microplastic particles were contaminating beehives across Europe, with testing from 315 honey bee colonies revealing synthetic materials such as PET plastic in most hives. Artificial light from street lamps has been found to reduce flower visits by nocturnal pollinators by 62%, and air pollution has been found to affect their survival, reproduction and growth.Antibiotics, used in agriculture, have made their way into beehives and honey. They have also been found to affect the behaviour of pollinators including reducing their foraging and visits to flowers. Pesticide “cocktails” also play a significant and emerging role; although some pesticides are now regulated to be kept below “safe” limits for bees and other wildlife, research has found they can interact with other chemicals and cause dangerous effects.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This is not just a conservation issue. Pollinators are central to our food systems, climate resilience and economic security. Protecting pollinators means protecting ourselves.”The authors have called for a number of measures to protect bees, including stronger laws limiting antibiotic pollution that harms bee health, transitioning to electric vehicles to reduce air pollution affecting pollinators, creating flower-rich habitats within solar parks, and breeding crops with enhanced pollen and nectar for better pollinator nutrition.The report’s co-author Dr Deepa Senapathi, also from the University of Reading, added: “It will take effort from everyone to address these threats. We need to maintain, manage and improve our natural habitats to create safe spaces for pollinators. Individual actions like providing food and nesting areas in our own back gardens can help in a big way. But policy changes and individual actions must work together so everything from gardens and farms to public spaces and wider landscapes can all become pollinator-friendly habitats.”Explore more on these topicsBeesInsectsWildlifeUkrainePollutionPlasticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Specially trained officers are continuing to support Kayden’s family.“We believe this was a targeted attack and there is no risk to the wider public.“We have a dedicated team of officers working on this investigation and I am again asking anyone who may have information which could help us and who has not yet come forward to please contact us.“No matter how small it may seem, it may be the key piece we need. I would like to thank the community in both Irvine and East Kilbride for their support so far.”Supt Jim McMillan added: “This was a shocking and deeply upsetting incident for not just those at Irvine beach on Saturday, but for Kayden’s family, friends and the wider communities affected. We are engaging with the communities in both Irvine and East Kilbride.“There continues to be a police presence in the area and additional patrols will be carried out where required. I would urge anyone with question or concern to approach a local officer – they are there to help.”Kayden was a pupil at Duncanrig secondary school in East Kilbride.On behalf of the school, its headteacher, Annette Alexander, paid tribute to the teenager.She said: “We are deeply shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of our former pupil, Kayden Moy.“Kayden was a kind and caring young man and full of character. He touched the lives of many within our school community.”The 16-year-old was a former youth player for Busby AFC where those involved in the club have been left “devastated” by his death.In a statement posted on social media, the club said: “Kayden played in our youth set-up for several years and it has hit everyone hard.”The club has set up a GoFundMe appeal in memory of the teenager, which has already raised more than £9,200.A South Lanarkshire council spokesperson said: “This has been a tragic event and our profound sympathies go out to Kayden’s loved ones.“We are very much aware that it will have a wider impact on many people, including a number of our pupils.”Police said several people were believed to have been filming on their phones around the time of the incident and have urged anyone with information or footage to come forward as investigations continue.Detectives haveset up a websitewhere people can access a form to send information directly to the major investigation team, and anonymity can be maintained.Police Scotland can also be contacted on 101 quoting incident number 3106 of Saturday May 17 2025 while Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.Explore more on these topicsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The talks lasted until about 2am on Monday morning, when the prime minister finally signed off on a deal that included 12-year-long quotas instead.“There was a last-minute wrangle over fish which went right up to the wire on Sunday night,” said one British government source. A European official added: “The UK’s final offer had been four years, but even by Sunday night we were yet to square the circle.”Anand Menon, the director of the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank, said: “The EU has used the fact that we were thedemandeurto leverage what they have long wanted. The French will be absolutely chuffed – there is no doubt that we had to concede on that.”It was a big last-minute concession by Starmer, but one that allowed him to stand up about 12 hours later and declare: “Britain is back on the world stage.”Despite his best efforts to restore order to Britain’s international relations, the final 48 hours of the prime minister’s first big negotiation with Brussels ended in much the same way those of his predecessors did – with frantic phone calls and late-night concessions.Both sides, however, say the trouble was worth it, bringing certainty to businesses on both sides of the Channel and reinforcing the UK’s position as a trusted external partner to the EU.Starmer’s aim from the beginning had been to show that EU negotiations could be done differently – quietly and without what he calls “megaphone diplomacy”.It was an approach that infuriated some. Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, accused the prime minister on Monday of conducting “secret negotiations away from parliament, the media and the public”.But British officials say that this veil of secrecy was essential to agreeing such a complex deal, which could have tripped on any one detail, and nearly did so at the 11th hour.But if Starmer’s public position was emollient, behind the scenes negotiators say the UK was demanding a lot from its European partners.“Britain came to these talks with 50 different demands,” said one European source. “This deal benefits everybody, but it would be wrong to suggest the UK did not get a lot of what it wanted.”For months the detailed negotiations have been led by Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister who is close to Starmer and whose office is linked to Downing Street by a corridor at the back of Whitehall.Others in the cabinet have taken the lead on different aspects of the deal, however, such as the foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the defence secretary, John Healey, on the defence and security pact.Healey said: “Back in July, you didn’t have the UK leading the coalition of the willing [in support of Ukraine]. You didn’t have the Trinity House agreement [between Britain and Germany]. You didn’t have the prospect of an EU-UK defence agreement. All things are part of strengthening British security.”The harder elements to agree were on a future youth mobility scheme and how long the agricultural trade pact and the fishing deal should last.The UK ideally wanted a one-year fishing agreement and an indefinite agricultural one. Officials thought they could secure such a deal by offering up a youth mobility scheme, which is badly wanted in many European capitals.But when Starmer appeared to give way on the mobility scheme, it allowed the French to make a new demand: if the agricultural trade deal was to be indefinite, then the fishing quotas should be too. If one was to be time-limited, both should be.With the two sides at a standoff, EU ambassadors met three time within five days in an effort to avert diplomatic disaster. When they met at 2.30pm on Sunday, the text was still not agreed.Over a long and exhausting day of negotiations, officials worked until the early hours trying to untangle the last-minute disagreement. In the Cabinet Office, Thomas-Symonds and his team ordered a Nando’s takeaway while they made repeated calls to European capitals and back to Downing Street.The cross-continental phone calls irritated some in Brussels, who felt that Britain was trying to play “divide and conquer” with European capitals, much as they felt Boris Johnson had done in the past.Also causing irritation was a press release Downing Street issued on Saturday stating baldly: “This week, the prime minister will strike yet another deal that will deliver in the national interest of this country.”Even as the negotiations continued, European leaders began landing in London on Sunday evening.Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, arrived at about 7.30 – her flight having been tracked minute-by-minute by some junior British officials. Kaja Kallas, the high representative for foreign affairs, landed two hours later.At 10.30pm, the British sent their final substantive proposals, including, crucially, the concession on fishing quotas. Even then, talks went on for another four hours as officials argued, in the words of one, “over commas”.None of the last-minute tensions were apparent on Monday lunchtime, however, as Starmer and several of his cabinet presented the deal at a chummy press conference in central London.The delegations had originally sat separately but at the suggestion of Maroš Šefčovič, the EU trade commissioner, they all swapped places so they could sit among each other.“That’s what this deal is all about,” Starmer told the press conference. “Building the relationships we choose, with the partners we choose and closing deals in the national interest.”Speaking on BBC Radio 4 on Monday morning, Kallas had a slightly different take: “Any deal means making compromises on both sides. If both parties are not entirely happy, that means it’s a good deal.”Explore more on these topicsBrexitEuropean UnionLabourKeir StarmerForeign policyFishing industryUrsula von der LeyennewsShareReuse this content"

He was charged with grand theft by embezzlement and later released after posting bail.Officials said Friday that Sanzone has since repaid the $3,500 and surrendered his peace officer certification, effectively barring him from law enforcement inCalifornia.In exchange, felony charges against him were dismissed. People on social media did not take the news lightly.“So a cop steals 3500 and gets let off with no charges lol wow only in glenn county,” one Facebook user commented.“Just shows the actual level of corruption in this county when a cop steals from a homeless man and walks free,” another wrote.The Glenn county sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Sanzone was previously named in a lawsuit against the Oroville police department alleging racial discrimination within the department, according toABC7.The suit claims that another officer witnessed citizens make complaints about Sanzone, mentioning other four incidents in which Sanzone stole money from citizens he had arrested.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaUS policingWest CoastUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Even if I think it’s crazy, I don’t want to be associated with violence of any kind,” he said.To “86”is common slangfor stopping or getting rid of something, while “47” could be seen as a reference to Trump, the 47th president.Comey said he was hoping for a buzz around his forthcoming legal thriller FDR Drive: A Crime Novel. Instead he got a call from the Secret Service, who had opened an investigation into the post.Comey, who was fired by Trump in his first term, appeared voluntarily at the Washington field office for an interview, after the president insisted there was no innocent reading of the message. “He knew exactly what that meant. A child knows what that meant,” Trump said. “If you’re the FBI director and you don’t know what that meant, that meant assassination. And it says it loud and clear.”Comey, who ultimately took down the post, appeared nonplussed by the investigation. “It’s not my first rodeo,” he said, noting his tempestuous relationship with Trump which Comey said deteriorated after he rebuffed Trump’s early attempts to secure a pledge of loyalty from the then FBI director. The agency is now led by Kash Patel, whose abiding loyalty has raised urgent questions about the FBI’s independence.But Comey warned that the episode pointed to a more worrying trend by this administration: “The use of power to aim at individuals, eroding the rule of law.”His advice to others who may find themselves on the receiving end of Trump’s retribution?“The rule of law is still our saving grace,” Comey said. “We have a judiciary in this country that will support the truth. Take solace in that. Take prudent steps, but don’t freak out. These people are not good enough for you to be freaked out about. Protect yourself, be measured about the effect the threat has on you, and know that you’re going to be OK.”Explore more on these topicsJames ComeyFBIUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

You all think they can manage all this. I don’t think [they can],” he said.Dimon said he saw an “extraordinary amount of complacency” and added that he believes the possibility of stagflation – a recession with rising prices – was far higher than investors believe.Moody’s downgrade came asDonald Trumpstruggles to pushhis “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill through Congress, Moody’s said it expected the US budget deficit to keep rising.“Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” Moody’s said, announcing its downgrade. “We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration.”Trump administration officials sought to play down the significance of the setback. “Moody’s is a lagging indicator,” Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, told Meet the Press on NBC on Sunday.The US president has himself remained silent on the downgrade. On Monday morning, he used posts on his Truth Social platform tocriticize celebritiesincluding Beyoncé and Bruce Springsteen, whocastigated Trump on stagein Manchester last week, for supporting his political rivals.During a rare Sunday night vote, House RepublicansadvancedTrump’s tax cut and spending package out of a key committee.

Yields rise as bond prices drop; an increase signals that investors are seeking a higher return for holding US debt. The dollar weakened against a basket of currencies.“Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat,” said Moody’s. “In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government’s debt and interest burden higher. The US’s fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared with other highly rated sovereigns.”Explore more on these topicsJamie DimonStock marketsRating agenciesUS politicsTrump administrationJP MorganDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

But in return, the agreement on easier checks for food, animal and other agricultural products, known as sanitary and phytosanitary goods (SPS), will be indefinite.The length of the fishing rights deal brought criticism from the Conservatives and Reform UK. However, Downing Street pushed back against EU demands for a time-limited SPS deal and a permanent arrangement on fishing, and will argue UK aims have been achieved.One UK official said the deal would bring no change to current UK access to fish, or changes to British or EU quotas, and thus protected fishing communities.Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, said the 12-year span of the deal showed the UK was “a rule-taker from Brussels once again”.A UK government official said the deal for the UK fishing industry was about “protecting their rights and long-term security instead of the merry-go-round of yearly renegotiations that would never plausibly see EU boats leave UK waters”.The summit, during whichKeir Starmer will host the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, at Lancaster House in central London, it also expected to set out closer defence cooperation, including potentially better access to EU defence funding for UK companies, and ways to allow UK travellers entering the EUquicker access via e-passport gates.A series of other issues have not been finalised, including the shape of any mutual youth mobility scheme, with arguments continuing about the UK’s insistence that the numbers coming in should be capped, which the EU opposes.Another complication with the youth mobility scheme is understood to be linked to a EU demand that the UK returns to the Erasmus+ university and vocational training exchange scheme.UK officials are concerned that an automatic return to the programme would mean EU citizens could be eligible to pay lower domestic fees at UK universities, rather than the high rat echarged to overseas students, which could cost the sector.EU sources said they were “optimistic” an arrangement could nonetheless be struck, possibly in the next few months.How has Britain’s economy fared since Brexit? The five charts underpinning the UK-EU summitRead moreIn her initial reaction to reported details of the deal, Badenoch tweeted: “12 years access to British waters is three times longer than the govt wanted. We’re becoming a rule-taker from Brussels once again. And with no details on any cap or time limits on youth mobility, fears of free movement returning will only increase. This is very concerning.”Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said Britain should not get embroiled in “theBrexitwars of the past”, comparing Badenoch and Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, to “dinosaurs fighting old battles”.While Downing Street has said the meeting in London is part of a process, not a single event, with talks able to continue on any subject that is not agreed, the overnight negotiations have resembled the sometimes chaotic talks on the original Brexit departure.As well as fishing and simpler processes for food exports to and from the EU, talks have focused on better access to EU defence funding for UK companies, theyouth mobility scheme, and waysto allow UK travellersentering the EU quicker access via e-passport gates.Fishing was a totemic part of much of the original Brexit talks, despite the industry’s relatively low contribution to UK GDP, and the Conservatives and Reform UK have warned against any deal which, in their view, would sell out the UK fishing fleet.Mike Cohen, the chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations, said on Monday morning that reaction in the industry would depend on what had been secured in return for any longer-term access to UK waters.“If a deal has been done for a longer term, for me the question is: what have we achieved in return for that?” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “If we’ve gained some benefit for the fishing industry, for fishing communities, then that could be a deal worth doing. It’s all going to be about the details.“If we’ve got nothing in return for that, for the fishermen and their businesses, the communities that depend on them, then that would have been a very poor deal from our point of view.”Explore more on these topicsBrexitKeir StarmerEuropean UnionEuropeForeign policyTrade policyUrsula von der LeyennewsShareReuse this content"

Aren’t they?Read more“It’s time for me to move on and for this organization to move forward with new leadership,” McMahonwrotein the memo.In November, Trumpfiled a $20bnlawsuit against 60 Minutes, CBS News’s flagship program, over an election season interview with his 2024 Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, which he claimed was deceptively edited. Legal experts have called the lawsuit baseless and argued that CBS would almost certainly prevail. But Paramount is reportedly in talks to settle with Trump, as it pursues a merger with Skydance Media, a deal that would require federal approval.In April, Bill Owens, the longtime executive producer of 60 Minutes,announced his resignation, saying he felt the newsmagazine had lost its journalistic independence.McMahon reportedly stood by Owens, who said in the departing memo shared widely on social media: “Having defended this show – and what we stand for – from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward.”Underscoring the building tensions in the newsroom, the 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley addressed Owens’s departure and delivered an extraordinary on-air rebuke of Paramount.“Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways,” he told viewers. “None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.”The network has maintained Trump’s lawsuitis without meritbut is nevertheless seeking to settle as Paramount pursues the merger with Skydance. If it goes through, the Skydance deal would include a$2.4bn payoutfor the family holding of Paramount Global’s chair, Shari Redstone, Bloomberg News reported.Trump v 60 Minutes is a stunning battle for the soul of US mediaRead moreMany are worriedthat Paramount’s settling Trump’s lawsuit would continue a trend since the beginning of his second presidency in which companies and auniversityhave surrendered to his demands to avoid punishments such as losing federal funding or access to federal buildings.Notably, law firms agreed to perform $940m in pro bono work for the Trump administration and to not consider race in hiring,among other concessions.ABC News and anchor George Stephanopoulosseparately agreedto give $15m to a foundation and museum to be established by Trump to settle a lawsuit over an interview in which the host said a jury had found the president “liable for rape”, when in fact Trump had been found liable of sexual assault.Explore more on these topicsUS newsCBSDonald TrumpLaw (US)US television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The world has already woken up to our complicity and is turning against us. The boycotts will increase and our image will continue to spiral into disrepair.”Organizers with a worker-led group called No Azure for Apartheid (Noaa) also organized a protest to coincide with the developer conference. The group has been protesting against Microsoft’s AI and cloud-computing contracts with the Israeli military for over a year. The company’s Azure cloud software has been found to have enabledIsraeli surveillanceof Palestinians and been used by the Israeli air force’sOfek Unit, the unit which manages databases of potential targets for lethal airstrikes. Leaked documents also show that Microsoft has a “footprint in all major military infrastructures” in Israel, according to +972 Magazine.“One year ago, workers launched theNo Azure for Apartheid campaign and petitionin a state of urgency after 7 months of genocide,” wrote Anna Hattle, a Microsoft worker and organizer with Noaa, in an email to company leadership on 15 May. “We are currently witnessing the samecrimes committed 77 years agowith one key difference: now, the Israeli Occupation Forces are carrying out this genocide at a much greater scale thanks to Microsoft cloud and AI technology.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It came alongside a pledge to cut costs by about $500m over the next three years, as part of a wider programme designed to improve its efficiency.US treasury secretary says Walmart will ‘eat some of the tariffs’ after Trump demandRead moreIn February the company estimated that new trade restrictions could lead to a$200m reduction in operating profitover the last four months of its financial year to the end of June.But plans to cut costs raises the prospect for job cuts at the business, which operates in 180 countries and employs more than 30,000 people around the world.Aarin Chiekrie, an equity analyst at the broker Hargreaves Lansdown, said Diageo could also lean on price rises to help offset the impact of tariffs. “But this will take a bit of time to enact,” he added. “Zooming out, the picture is starting to look a touch better than it has for some time.“Sales to China are largely unaffected by tariffs, Latin America and the Caribbean are lapping some weak comparable figures, and there are early signs that the industry is recovering from its cyclical hangover.”Diageo, which also owns Smirnoff vodka and Tanqueray gin, reported sales growth of 5.9% in its third quarter of the year ending in March, better than forecast, as wholesalers in the US stocked up before anticipated tariffs.Debra Crew, the chief executive of Diageo, said that the company viewed recent pressure on the drinks industry as “largely macroeconomic driven, with continued uncertainty impacting both the timing and pace of recovery”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ripped-off Americans will have “nowhere to turn” if it succeeds, staff told the Guardian.“The agency that Congress created after the last financial crisis to help prevent another financial crisis is currently completely handcuffed from working,” said one attorney at the CFPB, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “And we are on the verge of another major financial crisis, so it’s terrifying.“The one thing we were created to do we can’t do – at a time when we’re most needed.”Trump officialstried to axe about 1,500of the CFPB’s 1,700 workers last month, only for his plan to beblockedby a federal judge.“This whirlwind has been hard on everyone, but everyone comes back with more fight to keep the bureau going, because we know the harms that will be visited on people if it goes under,” said a software engineer at the agency. “When it comes to loans, mortgages, car loans, credit card debt, bank accounts, we’re out there protecting everyone.“We have helped millions of people. We have returned billions of dollars. It isn’t the way it has to be that there is nowhere to turn to when a bank or credit card rips you off. That is something everyone is exposed to. That’s what’s heartbreaking to me about the possibility of my job disappearing.”Jonathan McKernan, the Trump administration’snomineeto head the bureau since February, was lined up this month to be undersecretary of domestic finance at the US treasury – and the White House said it intends to rescind his nomination to lead the CFPB. No alternative nominee has been announced, fueling suspicions inside the agency that the administration never intended to move forward with McKernan’s nomination in the first place.“I don’t think they ever intended to confirm him,” said the CFPB attorney, who noted McKernan had been nominated right before a high-stakes court hearing on the administration’s actions inside the agency. “They used that in the hearing as a way to argue they weren’t trying to close the bureau.”McKernan’s nomination was moved forward in a Senate banking committee hearing in early March, along withthree other Trump nominees. While all three wereapprovedby the US Senate within two weeks of the hearing, McKernan was not.Since February, the CFPB’s interim director has been Russ Vought, the White House budget office director and the architect of the rightwingProject 2025manifesto. His term in the acting role has acap of 210 days.“I think the goal is to try and close the agency before Vought’s time is up as acting director, which is why they keep pressing so hard to try to be allowed to [terminate] everybody immediately,” the attorney said.Workers also criticized the actions of the so-called “department of government efficiency” at the agency, noting the CFPB is funded by the Federal Reserve, and has returned over $21bn directly to Americans.“They are not interested in efficiency,” said another employee. “There was no plan on how to keep congressionally mandated programs like our military veterans office running. They shot first and didn’t even bother to ask questions later. Russell Vought and this Trump administration are reckless and needlessly cruel.”Earlier this month, the CFPBissueda list of nearly 70 policy and regulatory guidance documents it plans to rescind – including exempting medical debt from credit reports, and banning lenders from considering borrowers’ medical information during credit assessments – andfiredthree commissioners at the consumer product safety commission within the agency.“To some extent, I think it’s a show to say they’re doing something,” said the attorney, who claimed many of the policy moves had been taken without explanation. “All it does is create confusion. They think they are being super business-friendly, but everything they’ve done so far is actually not at all helpful to most of the businesses we regulate.“We’re not doing enforcement, and we’re not doing any examination against some of the worst of the worst. We want to stop the harm before it happens, because that’s better for everyone. The kinds of questions that get asked, it’s clear they don’t know what we do and they don’t care.”The White House and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpConsumer rightsUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

Obtained from a source in southern France and traditionally served on ice with a slice of lemon, Perrier has long been long known as the “champagne of table waters”.But the report said the Swiss food giantNestlé, which acquired the brand in the early 1990s, had used purification filtering treatments that were not authorised for products labelled as “natural mineral water”.The senators said the “highest levels” of the French government had been alerted to the filtering treatments by Nestlé itself, but had failed to act quickly or to alert legal authorities.The senate report said that President Emmanuel Macron’s office at the Élysée “had known, at least since 2022, that Nestlé had been cheating for years”.Senators stressed there had been “no proven health risk to consumers”. But they said that consumers and local authorities had been misled.The report said: “In addition to Nestlé Waters’ lack of transparency, it is important to highlight the state’s lack of transparency, both towards local and European authorities and towards the French people.”The report found that government advisers handled the issue, but Élisabeth Borne, the then prime minister, appeared “not to have been informed”.EU regulations strictly limit what treatments are allowed for any product marketed as “natural mineral water”. Tap water is filtered and treated. But natural mineral water – which sells for 100–400 times the price of tap water – must be processed naturally and cannot be disinfected or treated in any way that alters its characteristics.France is one of the world leaders in natural mineral water production, with 104 natural sites across the country, a market worth €2.7bn (£2.3bn) and more than 41,000 direct and indirect jobs.But the industry was shaken in 2019 when a whistleblower raised an alert about one producer, Sources Alma – whose brands include Cristaline and Vichy Célestins –allegedly using non-authorised treatments to microfilter the water. A representative of Sources Alma later told the senate committee it had not used illegal treatments and its water was safe.The senate report said that, after the whistleblower’s warning, Nestlé Waters, whose brands include Vittel and Perrier, had voluntarily contacted the French government in 2021 – and later the president’s office – to say it had used filtering treatments. It submitted a plan to tackle the issue, which was later approved by the authorities.Alexis Kohler, then secretary general of Macron’s office at the Élysée, had met Nestlé executives, according to senators. But he declined to give evidence to the senate committee. In February, Macron denied any knowledge of the case.The senate said the relationship between Nestlé and the government became so close that the wording of a state report on water had been altered to fit with Nestlé’s requests. The Socialist senator Alexandre Ouizille, who led the six-month senate committee on mineral water said this was “inexplainable, inexcusable, incomprehensible”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It said it had always defended the safety of its products and had been transparent to authorities. It denied having put pressure on government.The company paid a €2m fine to avoid legal action over the use of illegal water sources and filtering. It said at the time that that the replacement filters were approved by the government and that its water was “pure”.Foodwatch, an independent food monitoring NGO, has filed a complaint against Nestlé Waters, accusing it of deceiving consumers. An investigation has been launched by a judge in Paris.Nestlé Waters’ chief executive, Muriel Lienau, stated during her hearing before the senate committee in March, that all of the group’s waters were “pure at the source”.In a statement to Agence France-Presse, Lienau said she acknowledged the senate report, which “recognises the importance of sectoral issues requiring regulatory clarification and a stable framework applicable to all”.Nestlé Waters also insisted that it had “never contested” the legitimacy of the senate’s work.Explore more on these topicsFranceFood & drink industryWaterEuropeEmmanuel MacronNestlénewsShareReuse this content"

But against a Brighton team still desperate to qualify for Europe next season, the Dutchman and his side were brought back down to earth as Jack Hinshelwood’s late winner with his first touch off the bench sealed a memorable comeback for Fabian Hürzeler’s side.It was no more than the hosts deserved after twice falling behind to goals from Harvey Elliott and Dominik Szoboszlai, with Yasin Ayari and then another substitute – Kaoru Mitoma – equalising acrobatically to spark a frantic finale. Slot had no complaints as Mohamed Salah endured a night to forget in front of goal and Trent Alexander-Arnold looked relieved that he didn’t even get on the pitch after beingbooed by his own fanslast week. Brighton can now travel to Tottenham on the final day knowing that their fate is in their own hands having edged ahead of Brentford in the race for eighth spot.Brighton 3-2 Liverpool: Premier League – live reactionRead moreQualifying for the Conference League still relies on results elsewhere but this was a stirring response as Liverpool were beaten having led a match at half-time for the first time since December 2016, a run of 156 games. “I was pleased with the togetherness we showed,” a delighted Hürzeler said.Slot’s players would probably rather have still been on the beach in Dubai after their exertions this season. Federico Chiesa looked rusty as he was finally handed his first league start of the season after joining last summer, although Liverpool could have been out of sight had Salah taken a golden opportunity at the start of the second half.“We saw how close the margins can be if we are missing two or three per cent,” Slot, whose side have now scored in every away game for the first time ever in a league campaign, said. “We’ve been very close with every team we have played and that’s why it is such a big compliment that we have won the league so early.”View image in fullscreenDominik Szoboszlai celebrates after his cross-cum-shot flew over Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen to restore Liverpool’s lead.Photograph: Ian Walton/APThe Liverpool supporters did not seem too concerned about the result as they greeted the final whistle with jubilant scenes despite suffering a fourth league defeat of the campaign. They barely noticed Alexander-Arnold making a brief appearance on the pitch at the end before going down the tunnel ahead of his impending departure to Real Madrid.It had taken only nine minutes for his replacement’s name to be sung by the away end after a blistering start by the visitors. Conor Bradley was given acres of space after being picked out by Salah and driving into the area, with Elliott on hand to tap home.Having spent the weekend watching bitter rivals Crystal Palace win their first piece of major silverware, the Brighton supporters hadn’t been thrilled to see their players giving Liverpool their latest guard of honour. But Hürzeler’s side played their part in a high-tempo first half, even if Bradley should have doubled Liverpool’s lead when he was set up by Chiesa’s quick feet but the Northern Irishman dragged his shot wide.Kostas Tsimikas was fortunate to escape when Danny Welbeck’s header appeared to strike his hand as it was deflected just off target but there was no sign of any intervention from the video assistant referee.Brighton didn’t have to wait long for their equaliser as a lovely combination between Brajan Gruda and Ayari allowed the Sweden midfielder to deceive Alisson with a clever finish. Yet a lapse of concentration cost them on the stroke of half-time when no one picked up Szoboszlai from a quick free-kick and his cross-cum-shot flew into the top corner.Hürzeler looked less than happy as he disappeared down the tunnel and his side came out with renewed purpose after the break. Alisson produced a full-stretch save to tip away Welbeck’s free-kick before holding on to a stinging drive from Gruda as Yankuba Minteh waited to pounce.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The good thing for us is this hardly ever happens and, if it happens, you can be sure that he will score in the third game of the fourth game.”Welbeck had almost as good an opportunity at the other end following a sumptuous backheel from Gruda inside the area but his shot was straight at Alisson. That was the prompt for Slot to ring the changes just as Alexander-Arnold emerged to warm up for the first time before promptly taking his seat again. Darwin Núñez almost had an instant impact when he and Bradley set up Salah again but Bart Verbruggen made a sharp save.View image in fullscreenKaoru Mitoma fires in Brighton’s equaliser for 2-2.Photograph: Ian Walton/APInstead, it was a Brighton substitute who had the crucial impact as Mitoma lashed home after Alisson parried Welbeck’s drive into his path. The equaliser seemed to breathe new life into Hürzeler’s players.The hosts thought they had a penalty when Mats Wieffer went down in the box, before the goal by Hinshelwood – whose 17-year-old cousin Harry Howell was also brought on for his debut late on – was confirmed after an agonising wait for VAR to show Matt O’Riley was onside before he crossed the ball.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrighton & Hove AlbionLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Maybe that’s enough when the highlights were so goodAaron TimmsMon 19 May 2025 07.58 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 07.59 EDTShareIs it really the end this time? For Russell Westbook, Sunday’s Game 7 decider between the Thunder and the Nuggets was a homecoming in more senses than one: not only was he returning to the city to which he’d given his best years, a court on which he’d embodied more than any other player in the franchise’s brief history the thunder of Oklahoma City’s name, he was also a man in search of a place to call his own – a role, an identity – after years of peripatetic wandering across the NBA in which teams have often seemed unsure how best to exploitthe 2017 MVP’s prodigious, if fading, gifts.After near-misses with Oklahoma City in the 2012, 2014 and 2016 playoffs, the litany of injuries that followed, and the long search for a basketball home in the years since – which have seen him play both an ill-fitting support position in the LeBron James-Anthony Davis Los Angeles Lakers and a starring hand for the cross-town Clippers that did little to hide metastasizing deficiencies in his game – the move to Denver last summer seemed to offer hope for a reset: occupying a clear sixth man role, Westbrook was brought in to supply experience and energy off the bench for those crucial minutes when Nikola Jokić and Jamal Murray needed a rest.The experience and the energy were all there on Sunday, as they have been throughout the postseason: even at 36, with a right knee that’s seen more cuts than a federal government agency under Elon Musk, Westbrook remains improbably quick, and he still jets through the lane with that curiously upright sense of majesty that makes him seem far taller than his 6ft 4in. But all the other parts of the Westbrook package were on display too: the missed shots, the poor passes and turnovers, the hastiness of thought and action. These playoffs have been brutal for the nine-time All-Star, andDenver’s Game 7 annihilationat the hands of the team that shaped him offered a neat summary of his recent struggles: over a 13-minute first half-stretch in which Westbrook took over as chief on-court orchestrator, the Nuggets endured a 23-point swing against them. From there, the Thunder’s ultimate victory never really seemed in doubt; with Jokić chained to the lash of Alex Caruso and Aaron Gordon visibly hindered, the game was dead as a contest by half-time.The Knicks’ transition from laughing stock to title contenders is completeRead moreWestbrook’s lust for on-court glory remains undiminished, but increasingly it’s confronted by the evidence that he’s no longer the player he once was – and no longer able to mask his flaws as he once could through simple accumulation of minutes. Denver’s decision to sign Westbrook was a calculated gamble on the kind of talent the team needs to support Jokić and push on for a second ring. Reportssuggestthat Westbrook has disturbed the balance of the locker room and “changed the entire vibe and spirit of the team”, as one player put it, and the on-court performances have been underwhelming. The gamble, plainly, has not worked, and it’s fair to ask whether it ever could have: Westbrook, after all, is the polar opposite of Denver’s generational star, a player as demonstrative and ripped as Jokić is unassuming andgloriously doughy.At this point Westbrook’s drift into a kind of late-career entropy seems unarguable. Those piston arms are still pumping, and the square-jawed stare is undefeated, but the magic is gone. A career that once promised so much – coming close to the pinnacle first with the 2012 Thunder, whose trio of Westwood, Kevin Durant, and James Harden were a kind of younger mirror of the Miami Big Three that eventually orchestrated their finals downfall, and then with the 2016 vintage,famously collapsing from 3-1 upto gift the Western Conference finals to Golden State – and has since had to negotiate a sequence of career-threatening injuries seems to have little room left to run. And if there’s one thing Westbrook needs to sustain himself as a basketballing force, it’s room to run. This may not be quite The End, not yet at least: but the signs are there that the curtain is descending. Even the intensity on which Westbrook built his name is no longer quite so volcanic, though there’s still the occasional putdown to savor. Asked by reporter Vinny Benedetto in the locker room after Sunday’s loss whether he will exercise his option to stay with the Nuggets for another season, Westbrook looked at his watch and asked Benedetto what he would be wearing the next day. Benedetto replied that he did not know. “Exactly”, Westbrookreplied, and walked off.The high-flown arrogance on display in that response is part of what has made Westbrook a curious figure of hate among a great number ofNBAfans – but it’s also part of his aura, what makes him so unique. In a league increasingly built on ensemble talents, role players, mild-mannered Europeans, and honest grafters, Westbrook is a mouth, a showman, a god. At his peak he expressed a steaming individuality of the type that’s increasingly hard to find in today’s NBA, where system and structure and saying the right thing reign supreme. Westbook is the rare player whose flaws and strengths are essentially synonymous. All the things that pundits and fans regularly criticize him for are part of what makes Russ Russ: the preening, the sense of entitlement, the invincible self-belief. The faults are forgivable because for many years – and especially when he was in his prime – Westbrook’s zany on-court experiments came off just as frequently as they flamed out. The volatility that makes Westbrook so challenging to build a team around is also what makes him so magnetically watchable. Even now, amid all the missed shots and flubbed passes and sad indecision of his basketballing dotage, it’s hard not to look at him go through the gears and wonder: could it still work? Stranger things have happened on a basketball court, and Westbrook has frequently been their author.View image in fullscreenRussell Westbrook came up against his former team in the Western Conference semi-finals.Photograph: Gerald Leong/EPAThis sense of evidence-proof wonder is key to the Westbrook mythos, the reason he will still be remembered fondly once the technocrats and percentage-players of this generation are forgotten. In a culture awash with nostalgia, Westbrook is maybe the ultimate basketballing fetish object: a richly gifted player whose appeal is rooted not only in his own unrealized promise but in the abiding sense that he belongs to a different era. Westbrook was drafted as the fourth overall pick by the Seattle SuperSonics in 2008 and the team immediately moved to a different city and changed its name – marking him, perhaps, as a man perpetually out of sync with the times. Even the number 0 he took while playing for his first team, the rebrandedOklahoma City Thunder, seemed to appeal to something nonexistent, making him the basketball equivalent of an empty set.The modern NBA – the game reshaped and dominated by Steph Curry, Jokić, and the Boston Celtics’ nerveless micro-managers – is built on accuracy from the perimeter, transition defense, and lightning ball movement. Westbrook represents none of these things: he’s not a great shooter, is a decent half-court defender but is not set up to commit defensively in the split-second following a possession change, and though extreme speed is a key part of his identity he rarely employs it in the service of distribution. He’s happiest with a big runway and ball in hand, calling the shots, going for glory.In some senses he’s more like a player from the 1980s or 1990s – a 21st-century Dominique Wilkins, all strength and fizz and spin. His play has always been characterized by an invincible belief in the possibilities of the improbable: the crazy drives, the never-on threes, the “surely he won’t, actually he will” fadeaway jumpers. And for much of his career, if you ignore the glaring lack of a championship ring, you’d have to say it has worked. This is a man who emerged in an era of “bigs” and despite a comparatively slight frame now owns therecord for the most triple doublesin NBA history. Though Jokić will probably pass his record soon and the usefulness of triple doubles as a marker of on-court excellence may have faded in recent decades, this still says something about Westbrook’s commitment and all-action style, his inability to ball at anything other than maximum volume.But the signature Westbrook style only works as long as he’s the main man, and he’s clearly had trouble adapting to a lesser role. For periods throughout these playoffs Westbrook has appeared to want to reinvent himself as a master assister, moving the ball to his teammates and fanatically refusing to shoot himself. It hasn’t worked. What else could? Nabbing an MVP crown while never winning a title is probably not the distinction Westbrook would have wanted for his career when he was drafted. But with the prospect of a ring slipping away, that is the group of which Westbrook now looks set to become a permanent member, joining Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Steve Nash, and – for now – his contemporary Harden in the ranks of the brilliant and trophyless. That seems like fitting company, the mavericks all raging unfulfilled together. Whether Westbrook can stick around for another season or two and find a franchise willing to offer him the kind of support role in which he so clearly failed for the Nuggets remains to be seen; the question now may not be whether he can be a useful sixth man but a productive eight or ninth or 10th. All that will be left now, whatever happens, are glimmers of the old glamor.In the modern game it seems increasingly clear that this is the type of player around which you can build a highlights reel, but not a championship roster. And maybe that’s enough, when the highlights arethis good. Unpredictable, sometimes messy, frequently celestial, and always entertaining, Westbrook will be remembered as perhaps the last of the NBA’s great virtuosos, his talent as large as it was strangely unharnessable.Explore more on these topicsDenver NuggetsOklahoma City ThunderNBABasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the conversation distracts from other players, and brings in unwelcome uglinessStephanie KaloiMon 19 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 07.37 EDTShareAt first, it seemed that theIndiana Fever’s home win over Chicago Skyon Saturday would be just another spicy chapter in the rivalry between Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark. Both players were typically excellent: Clark spurred the Fever to victory with a triple-double, while Reese grabbed 17 rebounds to go with her 12 points.But it was a moment in the third quarter that WNBA fans will be talking about for weeks to come. Some of them may even do so without resorting to cheap bigotry. With 4:38 remaining, Clark reached for the ball over Reese’s head, made what appeared to be deliberate contact with her arm, and sent her opponent spiraling to the floor. There was a brief confrontation, Clark was hit with a flagrant foul and Reese received a technical. After the game, Clark said she didn’t have cynical intent leading up to the foul, andReese agreedcalling it “a basketball play.”Depending on who you ask, the moment was either enthralling or disappointing. Fans may recall conversations about the physicality of theWNBAlast season, as Clark was knocked around the court by veterans. It showed that women’s basketball is every bit as tough as the men’s game, and sometimes a foul is just a foul.A moment like this isn’t always bad for anyone involved, including the players. Many say that these types of exchange drive up engagement, whether online or by attracting fans to WNBA arenas, which haveenjoyed record attendancesince Reese and Clark entered the league last season.But there are, of course, different types of engagement. The increase in attention, scrutiny, and discourse can quickly take a downward turn, especially when women are involved. As much as there was plenty of genuine discussion and analysis of Saturday’s game, a lot of the online rhetoric quickly turned racist and sexist, a carryover from last season that fans and players had hoped to leave behind. And the abuse wasn’t just online either.On Sunday the WNBA announced the league is investigating “alleged hateful fan comments” that occurred at the game. “The WNBA strongly condemns racism, hate and discrimination in all forms – they have no place in our league or in society. We are aware of the allegations and are looking into the matter,” the leaguewrote in a statement. The league did not mention any specific player in its statement,but the Indianapolis Star reportedthat Reese, who was loudly booed throughout the game, was subjected to racial abuse from the crowd.The WNBA is attempting to address racism with its “No Space for Hate” campaign, which looks to combat prejudice, online and inside arenas. The players are not sold just yet. “It’s nice in words, but we got to see actions,” three-time league MVP A’ja Wilson said on Friday. “Hopefully people can take actions and understand this is bigger than basketball. We’re true people behind it. Any shoe that we wear, any jersey we have on, we’re human. People have to respect that. I hope they pay attention and listen to the words.”Clark, who is white, has attempted to push back against the racism, homophobia and misogyny that some of those claiming to be her fans have used against players in a league where most of the players are Black and many are gay.“It’s definitely upsetting. Nobody in our league should be facing any sort of racism – hurtful, disrespectful, hateful comments and threats. Those aren’t fans, those are trolls, and it’s a real disservice to the people in our league, the organization, the WNBA,” Clark saidlast September.And it’s not just something fans and players have noticed. AMarch 2025 study by Rice Universityand the University of Illinois Chicago suggested racial bias is present – on the part of fans and the media – in the Reese-Clark debate. Researchers looked back to the players’ college days, andthe infamous “you can’t see me” exchangebetween the pair during the 2023 NCAA Tournament. Both players made the same mocking gesture to opponents during the tournament but Reese, who is Black, received much more pushback online and in the media.“This wasn’t just social media chatter – this was a real-time reflection of how race and gender shape public perception,” Rice University sociology doctoral candidate Shahill Parsons wrote in the study. “Reese and Clark [both made the same gesture], but the responses weren’t just different, they were completely opposite. That contrast tells us a lot about how bias still operates today.”A lot of the same discourse is still present today, Parsons said by phone on Sunday, and it hurts both players. The fact that Clark is “an amazing player” is what makes the conversation difficult to this day, he said. “On some level, if the framing of this is Angel Reese is some kind of behemoth, Black, big, disastrous, monstrosity, gorilla, what you have is steeped in sexism and racism, which isn’t going to be beneficial for Clark overall as an athlete.”Instead, the discourse could end up polarizing one demographic or another, he said. Though the Clark-Reese relationshiphas been comparedto that of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, public interest in that rivalry was rooted in competitiveness on the court more than race. “If the WNBA can avoid falling into this trapping of pushing a white-Black agenda, the league will be more popular, and it will be more beneficial for the league as a whole,” Parsons added.Apart from concerns about racism and sexism, the focus on interactions between Reese and Clark threatens to take away from the accomplishments of the rest of the league. The two other WNBA games on Saturday were just as enthralling as Fever v Sky. The Las Vegas Aces, who boast Wilson, played the defending champions, New York Liberty, and Seattle Storm travelled to Phoenix Mercury, who are testing out their new positionless basketball scheme. But stories are overwhelmingly focused on Reese and Clark.Parsons agrees. If the season becomes “mired and bogged down by this racial component – if that is the driving primary force behind the whole WNBA season, I wholeheartedly believe we’re not going to be seeing [much of] A’ja Wilson on SportsCenter,” he said.And that would be a true loss for WNBA fans everywhere.Explore more on these topicsWNBACaitlin ClarkIndiana FeverBasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why would anyone be OK with it? How is this logical?Crystal Palaceare now good enough to have Eberechi Eze in the team. Eberechi Eze is also too good to stay at Crystal Palace. Both of these things seem to be true. Oliver Glasner-era Palace are a seriously potent, organised and attractive team. But Eze’s progress is something else. At times during his early Palace career there was a sense of a slightly loose late developer. His skill level was always exceptional. His use of it now is next-level, his finishing cold and his physique buffed up. Eze does notreallyhave a ceiling. He could play for any team in Europe. But he is also 26 with two years left on his contract, and Palace have a model based on development with the likes of Romain Esse ready for a shot. There does not always have to be downside. Selling the man who made the thing happen can still be best for everyone.Barney RonayFA Cup final report:Crystal Palace 1-0 Manchester City2City and Silva prepare for war footingAfterManchester Cityended the domestic season potless for the first time since 2016-17, a disgruntled Bernardo Silva said he has discovered who the team “can go to war with”, while offering a firm opinion regarding what is required to ensure it competes again. “Something has to change next year,” he said after defeat at Wembley. “I have my opinion, I’m not going to give it to you. In the bad moments [though] you learn new things. Who you can go to war with, first of all. Because it’s in the bad moments that you see who the real ones are. And a lot of things that were good for us to not take things for granted: our fans, the club. I have my opinion, but definitely something needs to change when you don’t perform at the level.”Jamie JacksonView image in fullscreenPep Guardiola comforts a dejected Bernardo Silva after City end the season trophyless.Photograph: David Klein/Reuters3Rice ends Magpies’ dream of secondSo Newcastle’s distant dream of finishing second was finally dashed. It is a testament to their incredible commitment and consistency in the past few months, while Arsenal faltered after falling away from a title challenge, that it was ever a possibility in the first place. Ultimately, the absence of Alexander Isak at the Emirates Stadium – where Declan Rice’s fizzing strike was the difference – proved costly for Eddie Howe’s men. Yet defeat in north London gives Newcastle a pressured job to see through on the final day. Any dropped points at home toEvertonnext week will leave their fate in the hands of others, with one point now separating the teams placed third to seventh, though Manchester City could jump to third if they beat Bournemouth on Tuesday. At St James’ Park next Sunday, where the Magpies have won their past five successive games, confidence should remain high.Dominic BoothMatch report:Arsenal 1-0 Newcastle4Young gets his Goodison goodbyeThe summer will see an overhaul at Everton as David Moyes and the new owner, The Friedkin Group, seek to make their mark on the next chapter of the club. One of those departing is the 39-year-old Ashley Young, who has not had his contract renewed. He will be left to decide if he has another year left in the legs after 18 seasons of professional football, but put in a fine final home performance at right-back. Young has not always been the most popular player at Everton but has always shown full commitment, playing in numerous positions, and his fitness belies his age. David Moyes offered him a final outing in front of the home fans againstSouthamptonand he was offered a warm reception, something that has not been the norm, after replacing the club captain, Séamus Coleman, in the first half. Young was given a new deal by Sean Dyche a year ago, as he needed to pad out the squad and wanted as much experience as possible but his exit is symbolic that the club are finally plotting a different path.Will UnwinMatch report:Everton 2-0 Southampton5Gibbs-White pushing for call upMorgan Gibbs-White was disappointed not to make the cut when Thomas Tuchel named his first England squad two months ago. Subsequent withdrawals then led to Gibbs-White being drafted in but it seems that he still has much to prove. Tuchel did not use Gibbs-White in either of England’s World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia, so there can be no guarantees that he will call the 25-year-old up this week. After all, the German is not exactly short of options in attacking midfield. Gibbs-White, though, is doing everything in his power to catch Tuchel’s eye. He played well in Nottingham Forest’s win at West Ham and his alertness earned him his seventh goal of an impressive campaign. Gibbs-White punished a slack pass from West Ham’s goalkeeper, Alphonse Areola, and set Forest on their way to a victory that maintains their push for Champions League qualification. Will it be enough to convince Tuchel to give him another go?Jacob SteinbergMatch report:West Ham 1-2 Nottingham ForestView image in fullscreenMorgan Gibbs-White scored his seventh Premier League goal of the season and is pushing for a spot in Thomas Tuchel’s England team.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters6Local lad gives Leicester hopeKasey McAteer scored his first-everPremier Leaguegoal for Leicester. The academy graduate, who joined the club at eight years old, has had to wait his time for consistent minutes under Ruud van Nistelrooy. The 23-year-old scored a crucial goal to ensure back-to-back home wins for Leicester in Jamie Vardy’s final farewell. His ruthless goal was a smart finish that beat Alex Palmer for pace and glanced a post on its way in, after a flowing move between Wilfred Ndidi and Bilal El Khannouss. In a season infiltrated with negativity, the brilliance of the local boy will give Leicester fans some much-needed optimism for the Championship season to follow.Peter LansleyMatch report:Leicester 2-0 Ipswich7Cairney receives cult hero sendoffTom Cairney has often felt like a throwback of sorts. The kind of streets-won’t-forget Barclaysman era player that would have been beloved in the late noughties. Perhaps history will look back fondly on the Fulham stalwart, who is out of contract and set to conclude a distinguished decade at the club this week. If his emphatic header againstBrentford– part of a stirring comeback from Marco Silva’s side in a topsy-turvy west London derby – proves to be a parting shot from Fulham, it will have been a fitting finale. Cairney ended the day on the shoulders of teammates saluting the travelling Cottagers’ faithful. For them, there have never been any doubts about Cairney’s talent. Even if, as rumoured, Cairney completes a lucrative move to the Championship new boys Wrexham in the summer, the 34-year-old’s place as a Craven Cottage cult hero seems secure.DBMatch report:Brentford 2-3 Fulham8George falls short up front for ChelseaIt was only thanks to a moment of brilliance between their two full-backs that Chelsea edged pastManchester Unitedto keep their Champions League aspirations in their own hands. But an attacking dilemma awaits for the final-day showdown with Nottingham Forest. Without the suspended Nicolas Jackson, the 19-year-old Tyrique George was asked to lead the line against United on his first Premier League start. More comfortable on the wing and up against a seasoned defence, it was a seriously tough task for the teenager, who was peripheral – aside from winning a penalty decision that was overturned on review. George managed only 14 touches all game, including a solitary one in the United box. “Very good, very good, brave,” said Enzo Maresca when asked about George’s performance. “He was a threat in behind. It was not easy for him.” Of whether George had done enough to start again at Forest, Maresca insisted: “Absolutely, yes, 100%.” Whether that is simply shrewd man-management remains to be seen, but options are in short supply. Will Maresca give the experiment another outing or try Pedro Neto or Cole Palmer as a false 9? The decision could have huge consequences.Ben BloomMatch report:Chelsea 1-0 Manchester United9Spurs hope leader Son steps upIf there were any positives for Spurs to take from the defeat atAston Villa, it was the return to the starting lineup of their fit-again captain, Son Heung-min. The South Korean, who played 74 minutes before being replaced by Dominic Solanke, made a couple of menacing runs down the left flank and how Tottenham would benefit from a similar performance from the South Korean in the Europa League final at San Mamés on Wednesday. Spurs are short on experience, with injuries to Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison, but they have a leader in Son. “He opened up a couple of times and I think Sonny is getting back into a rhythm,” said Ange Postecoglou. “There were moments where he showed that.” The Spurs head coach will need the same again in Spain.Ben FisherMatch report:Aston Villa 2-0 TottenhamView image in fullscreenCan Son Heung-min captain Spurs to their first trophy since 2008?Photograph: Manjit Narotra/ProSports/Shutterstock10Is 2025 really year of the underdog?As Alan Shearer excitedly proclaimed after Crystal Palace’s FA Cup victory on Saturday: “2025 is the year of the underdog.” Certainly, the Eagles breaking their trophy duck amid jubilant scenes at Wembley and the rise of Nottingham Forest towards the Champions League spots show there is joy to be found by the Premier League’s middle classes. See also: the free-flowing football Brighton, Brentford and Bournemouth have showcased this season. Yet Forest could end up in seventh if results go against them next weekend, the three promoted teams all went straight back down, and Manchester City’sannus horribiliswill probably see the serial title winners finish way down in … third.

But the centre-half, who was signed by Ange Postecogloufrom Wolfsburg in the summer of 2023, says the collective determination within the club to break the silverware curse will fuel them in Wednesday’s Europa League final against Manchester United in Bilbao. Spurs have won nothing since the 2008 League Cup.“It will be a big thing, of course, because everybody knows that when you join Tottenham, you get the words through of: ‘Ah, you’re not going to win a trophy, you will be trophyless for the rest of your career,’” Van de Ven said. “All the guys that came up here were like: ‘We’re going to change something about this club.’“It was the gaffer and it was the whole squad who said: ‘We’re going to come here and change something.’ For us, it’s the job now to make this happen in Bilbao.”The bin fire strikes back: United and Spurs’ song for Europe is a bit of tasteless fun | Jonathan WilsonRead moreVan de Ven was asked who had told him he would never win anything after going to Spurs. “It’s these people on social media, you know?” the 24-year-old replied. “These banter people that you don’t take really serious. It did not play on my mind, not even a little bit.”The Dutch defender is among the many players who continue to fight for Postecoglou, who ison the brink of losing his jobafter 21 league defeats this season – the most in club history over a 38-game campaign.“We have all been standing behind the gaffer since day one, since he joined here,” Van de Ven said. “He showed his quality, he brought us to a European final. Of course, he’s getting a lot of doubt from the media and we see these things. But I think he proved all you guys wrong and we’re standing in a European final, so hopefully we can lift the trophy. Not only for us but also for him.“We all know we play for a big club. This club deserves trophies. That’s the truth. If you look at the quality in the squad, we deserve a trophy. It has been a tough season but we can end this perfectly by winning a prize.”View image in fullscreenMicky van de Ven says he has a ‘strong connection’ with Cristian Romero in the Spurs backline.Photograph: Dalton Bowden/ShutterstockPostecoglou’s hopes have been fired since Van de Ven and his other first-choice defensive selections returned from injury.

On the other side it’s the same – when I have the ball, he knows how to cover me.“From the beginning I felt a strong connection with him but the more games you play together the more you start feeling each other and knowing each other’s qualities.

The England international, signed for £100m four years ago, has fallen down the pecking order at the Etihad Stadium since his starring role in the 2023 treble-winning campaign.The 29-year-old has made just seven Premier League starts this term and was not summoned from the bench during Saturday’sFA Cup final defeatby Crystal Palace. That has fuelled speculation he could move on this summer, but Guardiola insists nothing has yet been determined and discussions will take place between outgoing director of football Txiki Begiristain, his successor Hugo Viana and the player’s representatives.Guardiola said: “We didn’t talk, I didn’t talk with him. People don’t believe me, but these things belong to the agents and the club and Txiki, and in this case Hugo as well. Both will decide. What is going to happen will happen, but he has to come back to start to play minutes again.”Premier League and FA Cup final: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreGuardiola accepts Grealish, who has two years remaining on his contract, will not be happy about his lack of action. He said: “It’s not [only] Jack. There is not one player in my locker room, and I think all the locker rooms around the world, that is happy [when they] do not play. When the team is winning and winning they have to figure out how everything happens – but they are not happy. They are here to play and, when they don’t play, they are not satisfied. That is the normal position in all the clubs.”Meanwhile, Guardiola has offered no guarantee that Kevin De Bruyne will starthis final home game for City. De Bruyne, who is leaving when his contract expires this summer, is set to play at the Etihad for one last time in a City shirt against Bournemouth on Tuesday. Yet with the clubstill to secure Champions League qualification, Guardiola will not be guided by sentiment in his selection, even though De Bruyne will receive a send-off after the game. The manager said: “What Kevin wants is that we win the game to qualify for the Champions League next season. That is what Kevin wants. It cannot be otherwise. I’m going to decide the best so that we can have the best chance to win the game against Bournemouth.”View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola has offered no guarantee that Kevin De Bruyne will start against Bournemouth.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PADe Bruyne is to be given a guard of honour by teammates at full time before he gives a speech on the pitch. He will then be presented with gifts by the wife and son of the late City legend Colin Bell.Victory in what is a game in hand would lift City to third heading into their final league game at Fulham on Sunday. Defeat would leave them sixth and mean one point would separate the teams from third to seventh in the battle for top-five places. City have played in the Champions League every season since they qualified for the 2011-12 campaign.“Of course it’s important,” Guardiola said. “We have been in for the last 14 or 15 years and it is where we want to be, but if we are not there it is because we don’t deserve it, and we will play the Europa League. But I’m thinking we’re going to qualify. I control my mind and I think that. The first step is to finish in third position in the Premier League and that is the main target.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It had been 10 long, hard months of “solidarity and commitment … methodology, work, honesty and dedication”, their manager said, yet this was no late lament, all that for nothing; instead, this was reward and release, “time to enjoy it”, to let go, so they did. Outside at Montjuïc, Barcelona had begun their party, even 2025’s first league defeat and killjoy keeper Wojciech Szczesny saving anoutrageous overhead kickfrom his own son not spoiling the fun; inside the dressing room, the club from the small town 200 miles south had begun theirs too, and nothing could ruin this either. Someone putLa Morochaon and the players were bouncing about, drumming the rhythm on the ceiling when, in another triumph for cheap construction, the first beam came down. Captain Juan Foyth, looking like a kid who’d put a football through the neighbour’s window, raised his arm to protect his teammates, quietly laid it to one side,and they carried on.The track was changed, Handel now, and they lined up. Some tipped their heads back, gazing at the ceiling they had broken. Others put hands on hearts. Most laughed. All of them scatted and sang, at least the word they knew: maybe notdie meister, maybe notdie bestenorles grandes équipes, and definitely noteine grosse sportliche veranstaltung, but certainlythe champions. The flag they carried read “the village wants the Champions League” and now they had it. Villarreal, the team from the place whose population could fit into Montjuïc, had come to Catalonia, handed thenewly crowned championsa guard of honour and then beaten them 3-2, helped byBarça’s hangovers, to secure fifth and a return to Europe’s biggest competition with a week to spare. The season, Santi Comesaña said, had been “almost perfect”.“Back on 10 July, few people thought we would finish in the Champions League,” the manager, Marcelino García Toral, said. That wasn’t actually true; plenty predicted this, or even better. Comesaña’s “almost”said as much: it was a pity, he admitted, thatVillarrealcan’t finish fourth, which would have also given them access to the Super Cup. Instead, Athletic Club will. Only Madrid, Barcelona and Atlético have bigger budgets than Villarreal. They finished last season with two defeats in 18, then signed 10 players. No one outside the Big Two has a footballer better than Álex Baena. They had no European competition to distract them, playing a dozen games fewer than Athletic and Betis. And this isn’t the first time they’ve qualified for the Champions League; it’s the fifth.View image in fullscreenMarcelino García Toral barks instructions from the sidelines at Monjuïc.Photograph: Toni Albir/EPAIt wasn’t the first time that Marcelino had, either. It’s not even the first time he has with Villarreal. Maybe this time, he had joked to friends after they beat Leganés 3-0 last week, he’ll actually be allowed to experience it. And that was the point. Both points, in fact. The fact that it was Marcelino was a reason to trust in Villarreal being the best of Spain’sotherteams. This is the man who brought Real Zaragoza from the second divisionto the first, took Recreativo de Huelva up andinto eighth, their best-ever finish, and qualified Racing Santander for Europe the only timein their history. He turned Valencia around,finishing fourthtwo years runningand wonthecup. Then he went to two Copa del Rey finals with Athletic Club (albeit the firstbelonged to Gaizka Garitano,really) andwon the Super Cup. And the last time he was at Villarreal, he took them from the second division to a Europa League semi-final and back intothe Champions League, pride and place restored in only three years.And then they sacked him,a week before the season began.It took six years and a lot of soul searching, a lot of bridges rebuilt for Marcelino to return. It took a crisis at the club too, for them to need him and him to want to help. And that’s the other point: why this felt special to him, something deeper there, why he could talk tales of the unexpected, of achievement; why Champions League qualification is healing: not just a hope for the future but a fixing of the past, all well with the world. When Villarreal sacked Marcelino in August 2016, the club’s owner Fernando Roig had described it as a painful decision but one that had to be made. When they called Fran Escriba to take over, he was on his way downto get an ice-cream. He hadn’t been expecting to receive a call and Villarreal hadn’t expected to make one.There had been a storm after Villarreal were defeated by struggling Sporting Gijon – Marcelino’s local club, the one he supports, played for, coached and is most associated with – and his wife had posted a message on social media saying “our work here is done, we leave you in the first division”. That had hurt Roig, damaging manager and club. A divide had opened up and the relationship was tense with Roig’s son, the club’s CEO. In the dressing room there were difficulties too, particularly with Mateo Musacchio, Marcelino later admitting: “There was one player with who I couldn’t coexist.” When he effectively gave an ultimatum, the club chose the players over the coach.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Yeremy Pino, Ayoze Pérez and Álex Baena have been cooking up a storm at Villarreal.Photograph: Maria Jose Segovia/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockFor a while, Escribá’s arrival had a liberating effect: Marcelino can be demanding, overwhelming. For a time, the tension eased, the atmosphere too. He lasted a year. Javier Calleja came,was sacked, and came back again sixweeks later. Unai Emery arrived as an upgrade, won the Europa League and departed for Aston Villa. Quique Setiénfinished fifthand then was sacked just four weeks into the following season, his lament a familiar one: the club, he felt, had chosen the dressing room. When José Rojo Martín, “Pacheta”, took over, he could hardly believe his luck but soon saw how superficial that was: there was so much talent, it wouldn’t take much to be a decent team. He was gone in two months, defeated. He had won one of eight league games.It was November 2023. Over time, José Manuel Llaneza, the man who hadbuilt the club with Roig, had intervened to mend the relationship, seek some rapprochement between Marcelino and the Roigs. Slowly, they had started talking again, a little affection allowed, excuses found to contact each other. When Marcelino had a serious car crash at Christmas in 2017, that brought perspective; when Llaneza passed away in 2022, there was warmth, wounds healing through mutual support. When Villarreal contacted Marcelino now – professionally this time, although this was an opportunity to make amends personally – he had escaped the crisis at Marseille and turned down Sevilla. His condition for returning was simple: we’re not going to argue.“Some people call me Marcelino,” Marcelino said at his presentation. “Some call me Marcelino García Toral. Those who know me well tend to call me Marce. My name is not Saviour. And my surname is nor Miracles.” And, yes, Saviour Miracles – Salvador Milagros – could be a real name in Spanish. And, no, he was not. But nor was he so far off.View image in fullscreenThe Barcelona players pose with the league trophy despite their defeat.Photograph: Toni Albir/EPAVillarreal were 13th, they had 12 points from 12 games. Defensively they were struggling badly. There were injuries, European games adding to the strain. They were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by third-tier Unionistas in January, which was embarrassing but probably helped; there was time to train, focus turned to stopping the bleeding. At the other end, no one provided more assists than Baena. Asked what Marcelino demands of him, Baena replied simply: “That I don’t walk.” Alexander Sørloth scored nine in the last eight weeks,15 in the last 16. Villarrealbeat Barcelona, drew with Real Madrid and lost twice in the last 18, finishing just short of a European place.Then this summer, 16 players went including Sørloth, a shift in group dynamics as well as style. Once that might have been a source of tension, disagreements. But lessons have been learned and this was going to be more like a Marcelino team, more his. There was a move towards athleticism, even height: direct, counterattacking, set up in 4-4-2, with one winger coming in, the other going out. Thierno Barry came for €13.5m, Logan Costa for €17m. Nicolas Pépé and Pape Gueye were free. So too Sergi Cardona; no full-back has more assists. Tea-loving Ayoze Pérez was the signing of the summer at €4m,Marcelino making him more of a centre-forward, from where he has 19 league goals. Baena, who spent 11 hours agonising over a Saudi Arabian offer in January, decided to stay: no one has created more chances. “He is very, very,verygood” Pérez says. “The ability he has to find you is incredible; as soon as he gets the ball I just have to move and he reaches me.”Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowAtlético Madrid 4-1 Real Betis, Barcelona 2-3 Villarreal, Celta Vigo 1-2 Rayo Vallecano, Las Palmas 0-1 Leganés, Mallorca 1-2 Getafe, Osasuna 2-0 Espanyol, Real Sociedad 3-2 Girona, Sevilla  0-2 Real Madrid, Valencia 0-1 Athletic Bilbao, Real Valladolid 0-1 Alavés.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Together, they were bouncing about Montjuïc on Sunday night while Villarreal put up a tweet of their manager, standing there all AI, decked in gold holding the Champions League ball.

A year ago, we were scared the team was going down but this is a good club, very well managed. The second half of last season our numbers were practically Champions League numbers.

The cost of flights and hotels is fairly astronomical. People are not going to be able to get anywhere near the stadium and without that ability to stay places, people really need to think about it. They’re probably better off staying at home and watching it at one of the big venues in Manchester and London.”Roberts said predictions of a possible 80,000 English fans being in the city were “not unreasonable” and that the 53,000-capacity ground would be full of Tottenham and United fans despite allocations being capped at 14,700. “There will be plenty of people out to get there and British people tend to be very good at mopping up tickets for any sporting event,” he said.“So I can imagine that it’s going to be a real high contingent of United and Spurs fans in there. There’s a real desire on behalf of everyone, and particularly Uefa, to have a very successful final.“There is recognition of the issues that everyone had in Paris, with the way the Liverpool fans were treated. Then you move on to Istanbul, which was really secure but where the logistics made it a very challenging event for the City fans. The transport to and from the venue was not acceptable for a major tournament. So everyone wants this to be a successful one. There’s no lack of will on that part; everything is teed up.”View image in fullscreenThe chief constable warned people would not be able to get near the stadium and the surrounding area lacked the places to stay.Photograph: Guillermo Martinez/ReutersUefa issued a warning that tickets bought through secondary markets would not be accepted at the ground. Ticket resale sites are offering tickets to the final from about £400 but Uefa will only accept tickets bought directly through its “mobile tickets app”, though purchasers are allowed to transfer ownership of a ticket within the app.Uefa also warned ticketless fans not to travel to the ground, and said tickets had been cancelled, with “further cancellations … likely to follow”.Roberts says relations between English officers and those in Bilbao are strong, with a shared approach to policing that focuses on fan engagement and the de-escalation of tension. He said a visit from Basque officers to Wembley had led to extra safety measures being introduced at the perimeter of San Mamés stadium.“We want everyone to go to Bilbao and have a great time first and foremost – it’s a big event people should enjoy it,” Roberts said, arguing that English fans are beginning to shed the reputation as troublemakers that has preceded them for a generation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Glasner revealed he had left the post-match celebrations at Wembley before the club chair, Steve Parish, was captured on video performing karaoke at a local bar and that he had missedAustria’s Eurovision song contest victoryon the same evening because he was with family. “It must be a great song,” he said.Crystal Palace’s FA Cup triumph left their fans in tears – I was among them | Ed AaronsRead moreIt is understood that Palace have held discussions with local stakeholders about ending their victory parade inCrystal Palacepark next week, with an announcement expected in the coming days. Glasner’s side will be without Adam Wharton and the captain, Marc Guéhi, against Wolves on Tuesday night, with Wharton also ruled out of their final match against Liverpool after sustaining a concussion that forced him to miss the celebrations. From their final two games Palace need a draw to surpass their record points tally in the Premier League.Parish said after the Cup win on Saturday thathe wanted to extend the manager’s contractbeyond next summer and acknowledged playing in Europe would be “a challenge” for a club of Palace’s resources. Glasner insisted he was “100% here” and had started planning for next season, although he warned it was important not to get carried away by the success.“This club has always progressed – not huge steps,” he said. “You can be a one-hit wonder. But then you’re back, then you’re gone. It just makes no sense. That’s why we said our planning shouldn’t be: ‘Now we play in Europe.’ We do crazy things and everything collapses. How is the pathway? And we follow the pathway.“Now it’s going step by step. Maybe getting a player we couldn’t get if we didn’t play international football; – this can help us make the next step. But not being a top-four club in England.“For me the next step is to play between [positions] eight and 12 [in the league]. Very stable. Because you can see in the Premier League there are a few top teams, huge clubs. Because quickly you can be at the bottom of the league table. This is why I think it’s very good.“One of the guarantees is the chairman here. He’s very stable.

The camera roamed the stands, capturing the images of Palace fans in disbelief after winning their first ever major trophy. Some were hugging those next to them, some waved their arms incoherently and others just stared, overcome. But a significant proportion were sobbing. Soccer can often seem an angry game, with crowds fuelled by rage; this was something very different, very hard to explain.Palace’s pre-match tifo had shown an image of a father hugging his two sons in the stand at Old Trafford after Darren Ambrose had scored a 35-yard drive there for Palace in a League Cup quarter-final in 2011-12. It turned out the two lads were among the Palace fans at Wembley and that their father had passed away in the intervening 13 years. They were, needless to say, also in tears.Premier League and FA Cup final: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead morePalace manager Oliver Glasner grasped the moment and its importance. After the win, there was no nonsense about kicking on and making this the first trophy of many. No talk of consolidation and growth and the bottom line. “The biggest achievement we can have,” he had told his players, “the biggest success we can have is not winning the trophy; it’s that we could give thousands of our supporters a moment for their lives. We can give them great times. Maybe they have problems at home, we give them hours and days they can forget all of this, and just be happy.”There were lots of people weeping at Goodison Park on Sunday as well, as Evertonbade farewellto the ground that has been their home since 1892. One fan there, Tommy Griffin, had been to his first game at Goodison in 1945 when he was three. The former Everton striker Duncan Ferguson spoke movingly on the pitch before the game of how many fans would be remembering those who weren’t there, the parents and grandparents they used to go to games with.It seemed an extremely apt point, for soccer grounds have taken on a perhaps underappreciated importance in a world of increasing alienation. They are receptacles for the memories of a community, fulfilling the role that churches perhaps once performed. Soccer clubs have a vitally important social function, one that has belatedly been recognised in the discussion around theUK government’s new soccer regulator. They are not normal businesses, and it’s baffling that they are treated as such. And of course it’s enormously concerning that it’s been possible for these vital institutions to be sold off to such a dispiriting collection of states, oligarchs and private equity funds, none of whom will necessarily have the interests of that local community, the people who have built the club. At heart, modern soccer is the commodification of human emotion.Perhaps it’s worth, at this point, a personal interjection. I try to remain objective but I am, unavoidably, from Sunderland. I watched the second leg of their play-off semi-final against Coventry at home, by myself. When Dan Ballardscored the 122nd-minute winner, I sobbed for about an hour. I’m not really sure I can articulate why. There’s every chance Sunderland will lose to Sheffield United in the play-off final next Saturday and whichever of those sides does go up will be overwhelming favourites to be relegated. I’m not sure it’s necessarily memories of my dad, who died in 2010 (although he did really dislike Coventry – see On This Day below); it’s something vaguer, an inchoate sense of fellowship with home, of shared experience of moments past. In that sense it’s just about lost time.Crystal Palace’s FA Cup triumph left their fans in tears – I was among them | Ed AaronsRead moreThere’s been a lot of that about this season. For all that the end of the league campaign hasfelt anticlimactic, this has been a season that has provided a lot of joy to people unfamiliar with it. For Liverpool, the league title was only their second in 35 years, for Palace the FA Cup was the first major trophy in their history and for Newcastle the League Cup was theirfirst trophy in 56 years. On Wednesday, in the Europa League final, Tottenham may lift their first trophy in 17 years.Silverware doesn’t guarantee happiness – as demonstrated by the case of Tottenham’s opponents in Bilbao, Manchester United, who have won trophies in each of the last two seasons and remain thoroughly disillusioned – but for those who accept silverware as a once-in-a-generation, perhaps once-in-a-lifetime occurrence, it provides memories that last forever, generates the legends that bind communities together.And that, frankly, seems a lot more valuable and a lot more interesting than a handful of super clubs grimly scrapping for trophies that soon become routine. The economics of soccer mean such seasons are rare and getting rarer, as power and resources become increasingly centred on a tiny handful of big sides.We should cherish them while we still can – and perhaps remember why soccer matters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As their manager Bob Stokoe succumbed to ill health, though, they began their top-flight season appallingly. Stokoe was replaced by Jimmy Adamson but by the end of January, Sunderland were bottom of the table and seven points from safety (in the days when teams got two points for a win instead of three). Having little to lose, Adamson started picking youth, notably the forward Gary Rowell, the midfielder Kevin Arnott and the defender Shaun Elliott. Sunderland’s form improved dramatically. In successive home games they put four past Middlesbrough and six past both West Brom and West Ham.A draw atEvertonin their final game, played on 19 May 1977, would have seen them survive. They would have stayed up with defeat too, so long as the game between Coventry and Bristol City didn’t end in a draw. Kick-off at Coventry was mysteriously delayed by almost quarter of an hour. Sunderland lost 2-0 and, after the Coventry chair Jimmy Hill had the score announced, Coventry and Bristol City played out a 2-2 draw, saving both and dooming a beautiful young Sunderland team. Sunderland have hated Coventry ever since.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

She had lost against Kasatkina, who recently changed her allegiance to Australia, in each of their three previous meetings.Raducanu made a searing start by breaking her opponent in the opening game of the match. Despite being broken straight back, the 22-year-old proceeded to reel off the next five games to take the first set 6-1.The second set started in the same vein for Raducanu, who held serve and then broke to lead 2-0 and take her run of games to seven. Kasatkina quickly broke back, but five more breaks of serve in a row presented a chance for the Briton to serve for the match at 5-3.Raducanu found it anything but straightforward so close to the winning line, spurning her first two match points due to a crisp Kasatkina return, and then a backhand slice hit into the net. Kasatkina once again stepped up to save a third match point before Raducanu finally managed to get over the line at the fourth time of trying.“To bring that level here, I’m really proud,” Raducanu said in her on-court interview after the match. “I think as I spend more time on clay I’m starting to get to like it a little bit more, and I’m kind of building my relationship with the surface.”Having taken a late wildcard for the tournament, Raducanu will next face the American Danielle Collins, who defeated her compatriot Sofia Kenin in three sets.View image in fullscreenHarriet Dart was well beaten by Ukraine’s Anastasiia Sobolieva in French Open qualifying.Photograph: David Winter/ShutterstockHarriet Dartwas knocked out in the first round of French Open qualifying after being defeated 6-1, 6-2 by Anastasiia Sobolieva.

He will now in effect end his 30-year relationship with the BBC after fronting his lastMatch of the Daythis weekend. It is understood his departure does not include a financial settlement.The decision to allow him to present the finalMatch of the Dayof the season has also led to criticism, with some industry figures accusing the BBC of allowing him to leave on his own terms, despite admitting a serious error of judgment.Reports of Lineker’s early departure emerged on Sunday night, a day after he presented the BBC’s FA Cup final coverage. It was confirmed on Monday byTim Davie, the BBC’s director general. “Gary has acknowledged the mistake he made,” he said. “Accordingly, we have agreed he will step back from further presenting after this season.“Gary has been a defining voice in football coverage for the BBC for over two decades. His passion and knowledge have shaped our sports journalism and earned him the respect of sports fans across the UK and beyond. We want to thank him for the contribution he has made.”It brings to an end a decades-long relationship with the BBC, in which the corporation developed the former England striker into its leading sports presenter. His final Match of the Day will come 26 years after he took over from Des Lynam.Last week, the 64-year-oldapologisedafter it emerged he had reposted a pro-Palestine video on Instagram that criticised Zionism and included an illustration of a rat. Lineker has 1.2m followers on the platform.A rat is an antisemitic trope that was used in Nazi Germany to characterise Jews as vermin. Lineker said in a statement that he would “never knowingly share anything antisemitic” and had deleted the post “as soon as I became aware of the issue”.Yesterday, Lineker acknowledged that the post had “awful connotations”, but said he had not seen the emoji. “I would never consciously repost anything antisemitic – it goes against everything I stand for,” he said. “I recognise the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am. Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.”Davie had been facing calls to sack Lineker, who was paid £1.35m by the BBC last year. The BBC will now begin a new era of coverage without Lineker. He will be replaced on Match of the Dayby Gabby Logan, Kelly Cates and Mark Chapman.It comes after a tumultuous few years in the relationship between Lineker and the BBC. In March 2023, hewas temporarily suspendedover comments he made criticising the Conservative government’s asylum policy.In February this year, he was also among 500 high-profile cultural figures who called on the BBC to rebroadcast a documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, calling it an “essential piece of journalism”.The broadcasterremoved the documentaryfrom BBC iPlayer after it emerged that the film’s 14-year-old narrator was the son of a deputy agriculture minister in the territory’s Hamas-run government.Danny Cohen, the BBC’s former director of television who has been a leading critic of the broadcaster’s handling of the issue, said that it was right that he is leaving. However, he questioned why he was allowed to front one last show.“He should not be allowed a final swan song this weekend,” he said. “And why the BBC’s statement does not even mention antisemitism is hard to understand.“If the racist content had been directed at another community I do not believe a presenter would be allowed to carry on for another week. The BBC has a serious and wide-ranging problem with antisemitism. Only much stronger executive leadership can change that.”Another BBC staffer said: “It seems like BBC bosses have done the bare minimum of damage limitation. As a Jewish member of staff, that feels like a betrayal.”The producer Leo Pearlman, chief executive of Fulwell Entertainment, also accused the BBC of “weak and ineffectual leadership” and said there was no victory in Lineker leaving “seemingly on his own terms”.The BBC declined to comment on the criticisms. However, a source said the decision to allow Lineker to present the season’s final Match of the Day recognised the presenter’s long relationship with the corporation. They did not accept that the BBC had a wider problem with antisemitism.Explore more on these topicsGary LinekerBBCMatch of the DaynewsShareReuse this content"

On Sunday, Messi felt that a pass from an Orlando City defender that was gathered by goalkeeper Pedro Gallese should have been ruled an intentional backpass, only for it to go uncalled. Orlando ended up scoring seconds later, with Gallese firing a long kick to striker Luis Muriel, who scored Orlando’s first goal of the game.Calling the incident a “strange play,” Messi told Apple TV that referee Guido Gonzales Jr told him “he didn’t know the rule and didn’t see it that way.”“From there came their long pass and the goal,” Messi said. “Sometimes there are errors in critical moments. It happened in the last game, too. Those aren’t excuses, but there are always issues with referees and I think MLS has to look at some of the officiating.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Players with their hands over their mouths at the end of matches, masking even the most banal of pleasantries from prying eyes. Not wanting to say anything that could be reported. Not wanting to let anyone in.A generation or two ago, writers such as Gay Talese would hang out with global stars such as Floyd Patterson and hear the former heavyweight champion call himself a coward, describe how it felt to be knocked out, and even accompany him to his daughter’s school to see him confront the bullies who kept lifting up her skirt. And thatall happened on the same day.Can watching sport really improve your wellbeing? The science suggests it can | Sean IngleRead moreIn the modern era, though, few dare risk saying anything, let alone to bare their souls. You can understand their thinking: in a world where abuse on social media has become normalised, why open yourself up further?Even so, it felt refreshing recently to see one of the NBA’s biggest stars, Tyrese Haliburton, lift the lid on how it feels when your form deserts you and life turns angsty and dark. “I was struggling to look at myself in the mirror,” Haliburton told the Athletic. “I’m struggling to show up to work and get to the gym. I’m trying to avoid coming to work.”It wasn’t just that Haliburton had been one of the 12 NBA stars picked for the US Olympic team in Paris last summer, only to barely play after aggravating a hamstring injury. He then also started the NBA season averaging fewer than 15 points in his first nine games. “I was really trying to run away from what was going on and I think that point was for me to be like: ‘Yo, I don’t feel like myself. I don’t feel all right,’” he said. “‘This shit, it’s bad.’”Reading abusive messages on social media, which in the past had fired Haliburton up, only made his anxiety levels worse. “I think that I just got consumed with the negativity of people talking shit,” he revealed.Haliburton is not everyone’s favourite player. But his confessional not only made him more relatable, it also shone a rare light on what may lie behind the ups and downs players go through over a season. Further insights also came this month with a study that investigated “the frequencies, trajectories and stability of depressive and anxiety symptoms over the course of a competitive season”at the Bundesliga club Hoffenheim.That involved researchers speaking to 204 players, ranging from men’s and women’s first-team players to the boy’s under-12 squad, multiple times during the 2022-23 season to get deeper insights into how symptoms can change over time. The first finding? During the 10 months of the season, several players reported experiencing depressive (12.7%) and anxiety symptoms (15.6%), exceeding clinical thresholds at least once. That, in other words, could be two or three players on average in a squad.The research team, led by the former player Lina Burger, who is now a psychologist at the club, also found that levels of depression – characterised by a persistently low mood and the loss of pleasure and interest for a period of at least 14 days – were lowest in preseason “after which symptoms increased and remained relatively stable at a higher level throughout the season. Overall, the linear increase in depressive symptoms suggests a draining effect of a soccer season on the psychological health of players.” Again, that is not a huge surprise. But, as the researchers point out, it is something that clubs can do better to understand and prepare for.What about anxiety levels among players? Well, they tended to be stable until the winter break but then went up. That, researchers speculated, was probably due to matches mattering more towards the end of the season as well as players fearing they might be transferred out or let go.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Female players reported higher depression scores than male participants. Part of that might be because female football in Germany generally has lower levels of professionalism, with many players also having to work during the week to make ends meet while getting less psychological support.However, the researchers also note other studies have found that women in elite sport do suffer more from depression and anxiety.One large studyamong high-level French athletes in 2011, for instance, found 20.2% of women had at least one psychopathology, against 15.1% in men.Ultimately, the study found that footballers experience mental health disorders at rates comparable with the rest of the population. However, the researchers also note: “The common external observation that they appear ‘mentally strong’, for example, when calmly scoring a penalty-kick goal, should not be equated with psychological health.”The researchers noted, too, that playing in team sports seems to have a preventive effect. Intriguingly, professional athletes in team ball sports have a significantly lower prevalence (8.1%) of depressive disorders compared with those in aesthetic and target sports (16% of athletes). Yet the lowest levels, intriguingly, are among athletes doing high-risk sports (about 3%).As for Haliburton? Well since struggling earlier in the season, he has turned things around. And on Thursday his Indiana Pacers team open their Eastern Conference final against the New York Knicks with a legitimate shot of making the NBA finals. Perhaps there is a message in there somewhere. Opening up is not necessarily a bad thing.Explore more on these topicsSportNBAUS sportsBasketballcommentShareReuse this content"

The American’sfive-shot winmeans he is halfway to a clean sweep of majors, with the US Open and Open Championship left. Rory McIlroy became just the sixth man to win the grand slam last month at Augusta National.Scheffler, though, is anxious to stay in the present. “I don’t focus on that kind of stuff,” Scheffler insisted on the making of history. “I love coming out here and trying to compete and win golf tournaments. That is what I’m focused on.Scottie Scheffler runs away with US PGA title after challengers fade awayRead more“After this week, I’m going to go home and get ready for next week’s tournament and the show goes on. If I show up and miss the cut next week, I’m going to have to answer questions of what went wrong and just start over again. That’s one of the things that can be frustrating about our game and it’s also what’s great about our game. If I had a tough day today and came in with a loss, I could step back up on the tee Thursday next week and have another chance to win a tournament. It’s an endless pursuit and it’s a lot of fun. It’s definitely one of the great joys of my life to be able to compete out here.”Scheffler admitted he had to change his driver head on Tuesday after it failed a compliance test relating to the depth of the face, carried by the United StatesGolfAssociation. Heavy attention had surrounded the fact McIlroy had to do precisely the same thing. “The driver testing is something that regularly happens on tour,” Scheffler said. “My driver did fail this week. We had a feeling that it was going to be coming because I’ve used that driver for over a year. I was kind of fortunate for it to last that long, I felt like. I would argue that if we’re going to test the drivers, we need to be even more robust in the way we test them.”View image in fullscreenScheffler celebrates on the 18th green at Quail Hollow.Photograph: Alex Slitz/Getty ImagesScheffler, who was pushed strongly by Jon Rahm for a spell during round four, lifted the Wanamaker Trophy 12 months on from being arrested for an alleged traffic offence at the gates of Valhalla. All charges were quickly dropped but Scheffler spent the lead up to his second round in 2024 in a police cell.“It’s definitely very sweet sitting here with the trophy,” Scheffler added. “I definitely have a few jokes that I want to say that I’m probably going to keep to myself. Last year sometimes, it still doesn’t almost feel real. It really doesn’t. It’s just one of those deals that I really don’t know how to describe it.

He added that such influence was hard to trace, even harder to regulate and nearly impossible to debunk in real time.“I would be surprised if malicious actors hadn’t already started to use these tools to their advantage to spread misinformation and unfair propaganda,” Salvi said.But he noted there were also potential benefits from persuasive AI, from reducing conspiracy beliefs and political polarisation to helping people adopt healthier lifestyles.Writing in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, Salvi and colleagues reported how they carried out online experiments in which they matched 300 participants with 300 human opponents, while a further 300 participants were matched with Chat GPT-4 – a type of AI known as a large language model (LLM).Each pair was assigned a proposition to debate. These ranged in controversy from “should students have to wear school uniforms”?” to “should abortion be legal?” Each participant was randomly assigned a position to argue.Both before and after the debate participants rated how much they agreed with the proposition.In half of the pairs, opponents – whether human or machine – were given extra information about the other participant such as their age, gender, ethnicity and political affiliation.The results from 600 debates revealed Chat GPT-4 performed similarly to human opponents when it came to persuading others of their argument – at least when personal information was not provided.The AI Con by Emily M Bender and Alex Hanna review – debunking myths of the AI revolutionRead moreHowever, access to such information made AI – but not humans – more persuasive:where the two types of opponent were not equally persuasive, AI shifted participants’ views to a greater degree than a human opponent 64% of the time.Digging deeper, the team found persuasiveness of AI was only clear in the case of topics that did not elicit strong views.The researchers added that the human participants correctly guessed their opponent’s identity in about three out of four cases when paired with AI. They also found that AI used a more analytical and structured style than human participants, while not everyone would be arguing the viewpoint they agree with. But the team cautioned that these factors did not explain the persuasiveness of AI.Instead, the effect seemed to come from AI’s ability to adapt its arguments to individuals.“It’s like debating someone who doesn’t just make good points: they make yourkind of good points by knowing exactly how to push your buttons,” said Salvi, noting the strength of the effect could be even greater if more detailed personal information was available – such as that inferred from someone’s social media activity.Prof Sander van der Linden, a social psychologist at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, said the research reopened “the discussion of potential mass manipulation of public opinion using personalised LLM conversations”.He noted some research – including his own – had suggested the persuasiveness of LLMs was down to their use of analytical reasoning and evidence, whileone studydid not find personal information increased Chat-GPT’s persuasiveness.Prof Michael Wooldridge, an AI researcher at the University of Oxford, said while there could be positive applications of such systems – for example, as a health chatbot – there were many more disturbing ones, includingradicalisation of teenagers by terrorist groups, with such applications already possible.“As AI develops we’re going to see an ever larger range of possible abuses of the technology,” he added. “Lawmakers and regulators need to be pro-active to ensure they stay ahead of these abuses, and aren’t playing an endless game of catch-up.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

It involves you providing something that only you can access – for example, a code sent to you by text message. You should turn 2FA on for every service that offers it.Be very wary of unsolicited emails, phone calls or messagesIn particular, don’t click on a link or attachment in an email, text message or social media post unless you are absolutely sure it is legitimate. It could take you to a fake website or contain malware designed to steal your personal information.Phishing emails used by fraudsters will often reference a cyber-attack that has been in the news to try to hook those in who are customers or users of that company or organisation.Sometimes fraudsters will have personal information which they obtained via an incident or via other means, which can make them sound more authentic.If someone says they are from a company or organisation you use, and you cannot be 100% sure who you are dealing with, ignore the email or hang up and find the official contact details if you want to check with them.Keep an eye on your credit recordIf your personal data has been stolen it’s worth keeping tabs on your credit record in case fraudsters attempt to use it to take out loans or other products in your name. Credit reference agencies have the details, and you can access them in different ways – some free, some paid-for.It’s a good idea to regularly check your credit report data, which you can access in different ways – some free, some paid-for – via the credit reference agencies.Credit KarmaandClearScoreboth offer access to your credit report free for life.If you are turned down for a financial product such as a credit card or loan, despite having a good credit rating, or you stop receiving statements from your bank for no reason, these could be a sign that someone has been using your identity. Other more obvious ones are if you start to get letters relating to debts that aren’t yours, or your bank statement mentions an item you haven’t bought.Be particularly careful with social mediaMost financial and shopping scams start on social media and tech platforms, say banks. Again, be wary as fraudsters may have obtained details about you that they can use to convince you that you are having a conversation with someone you know.There has been a surge in recent years inso-called “Hi Mum” scams, where fraudsters pose as loved ones on services such as WhatsApp. Someone might get in touch pretending to be a family member and saying they need cash quickly to pay a bill because they have been locked out of their online banking after getting a new phone.Do not rush into transferring money, even if you are told it is urgent. Take time and check that you are really in touch with a relative or friend.Protect your deviceKeep your laptops and other kit up to date – for example, make sure you are still getting software and security updates.Only use the official app stores and software update services.Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeLegal aidInternetexplainersShareReuse this content"

The companies expect to close the deal in the third quarter.“RegeneronGeneticsCenter is committed to and has a proven track record of safeguarding the genetic data of people across the globe, and, with their consent, using this data to pursue discoveries that benefit science and society,” said Aris Baras, the senior vice-president and head of the Regeneron Genetics Center. “We assure 23andMe customers that we are committed to protecting the 23andMe dataset with our high standards of data privacy, security and ethical oversight and will advance its full potential to improve human health.”The bankruptcy proceedings, filed in March, had drawn scrutiny from lawmakers who warned that millions of customers’ genetic data could be sold to unscrupulous buyers. At least one group, called the Global BioData Trust, placed a formal bid to acquire 23andMe and pitched itself as a means to return control of the data to consumers who could choose to store their DNA information in the trust or share it with an affiliated public benefit corporation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The US does not currently have comprehensive privacy regulation that would establish enforceable guardrails around how Regeneron will store, use and share the genetic data it is acquiring from 23andMe. Companies, thus, are free to change their privacy policies on a whim – at times with little notice to users. Without a federal privacy regulation, there are few ways to hold entities, including non-profits, accountable to their promises on how they will manage consumer data.23andMe last month agreed to allow a court-appointed overseer for the company’s handling of customers’ genetic information and its security policies during the bankruptcy.As part of the agreement, Regeneron will acquire all units of 23andMe, except the telehealth service Lemonaid Health, which the genetic testing firm plans to wind down. After the transaction completes, 23andMe will continue to operate as a wholly owned direct or indirect unit of Regeneron, the companies said.The company has collected genetic data from 15 million customers who ordered its DNA testing kits online and provided saliva samples. It had been struggling with weak demand for its ancestry testing kits and the fallout from adata breachin 2023that exposed millions of customers’ genetic data.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyGeneticsPharmaceuticals industryBiologynewsShareReuse this content"

You see, I’ve stopped streaming music, which, in this modern day and age, seems frankly weird. But hear me out. I’ve gone back to buying CDs, and it’s made me fall in love with music all over again.I listen to music all day, every day. I can’t work without music in the background, or consider doing the washing up without some tunes to groove to. Traditionally, I’d buy albums on CDs or vinyl, and listen to them over and over until I was bored to death with them, by which time I’d hopefully have bought another album. It’s apparently a very annoying habit: as a student (way before the days of Spotify), one housemate was so utterly exasperated with me blasting Urban Hymns bythe Vervearound the house that they barged into my room, ejected the CD and flung it out the window.When Napster, and filesharing, and eventually Spotify emerged, I couldn’t believe my luck. I instantly abandoned my archaic – and expensive – CD habit in favour of a digital jukebox that could play every song in the world. I’d cue up new albums by artists I liked or people I’d heard of and embraced a world of infinite listening. But then, predictably, I got lazy. As Spotify started getting to know me, its recommendations became more and more obscure. Before I knew it, Spotify would have moved from the new Gorillaz album that I’d asked it to play to some weird jazz folk nonsense that I hadn’t, and, crucially, didn’t like. Invariably, I’d be too lazy to turn it off. Listening to Spotify was like talking to a music snob who thinks they know more about music than you, and not in a good way.View image in fullscreenRecapturing his youth … Rich Pelley at home.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThe cost of my Spotify subscription recently went up, so I cancelled it and went back to my old CD-buying ways. I now read reviews in NME and the Guardian, and use Shazam to identify things I like the sound of on telly, as I did with Silk byWolf Aliceafter hearing it on the T2 Trainspotting soundtrack. Instead of listening to random Spotify suggestions, I’m back to my own musical free will. Sure, it involves lining Jeff Bezos’s pockets and playing: “what time will the Amazon delivery man turn up?” But you can’t beat the feeling of holding something physical in your hand. It’s worth every penny to marvel over the album artwork and scrutinise the inner sleeve.Plus, I can listen to the same album over and over as I no longer live with my picky university flatmates. I’ve certainly listened to my current favourite,Drive to Goldenhammer by Divorce, a window-flinging number of times. And, in preparation for their live shows, I’m having a highly enjoyable resurgence of Oasis. I couldn’t be happier, although my shelves, which are desperately reaching their CD weight limit, may disagree.Explore more on these topicsMusic streamingThe one change that workedVinylDigital music and audioSpotifyOasisThe VerveWolf AlicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

For five hours a day she watched the antics of a couple, Harriet and Ozzie, who lived on Dunrovin ranch in Montana.The pair were nesting ospreys, being streamed live as they incubated their clutch of eggs. The eggs never hatched, but the ospreys sat on them for months before finally kicking them out of the nest.“I do think they experienced grief,” says Hoffman, now 81, who watched the birds from 2,000 miles (3,000km) away in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania.View image in fullscreenThe Dunrovin ranch web cam shows an intimate view of ospreys nesting and raising their chicks every summer.Photograph: Dunrovin ranchHoffman was processing her own grief after the loss of her husband, brother and father, and watching the live streams was how she “rejoined the world”.“It was a very black time,” she says. Although Ozzie died in 2014, she still watches the nest and its current occupants for an hour a day. “I can’t think of anything the internet has done better for me than these cams.”Nature-focused live streams, set up near nests, water holes, dens or landscapes to provide a live, constant feed of the natural world, have proliferated over the past two decades, helped by cheap cameras and remote internet connections. The drama of nature – or sometimes the lack of it – is what draws people in.View image in fullscreenIn Sweden, continuous live footage of the annual moose migration is broadcast each year.Photograph: SVT/APThe seventh season of theTV series The Great Moose Migrationfrom the Swedish broadcaster SVT involved 20 days of continuous live footage, drawing in millions of viewers.

A viralfish doorbellallows viewers to watch migrating fish in a lock in Utrecht.If you can imagine it, there is probably a live stream about itRebecca Mauldin, the University of Texas at ArlingtonIn an increasingly urbanised society, as people spend more time on screens they are less connected with nature. “While technology can draw us away from the natural world, we have also learned that technology can connect us with nature in unique ways,”researchers wrote in a paperpublished in March.It came afteranother studythat found nature live streams could “improve the lives of those who cannot leave their homes or live far from natural environments”.Researchers from the University of Montana first put up a camera focused on Harriet and Ozzie’s nest in 2012. At the end of the breeding season, the owner, SuzAnne Miller, turned it off but scores of people contacted her. “[They said] please don’t do that. We want to watch your ranch,” Miller says. As well as the birds, they could see what was going on behind the nest, she says, and wanted to keep watching.View image in fullscreenHoffman says the livestream helped her through a period of grief, and she still watches for an hour every day.Photograph: Rachel Wisniewski/The GuardianInitially, Miller did not understand why someone would livestream her doing mundane tasks such as scooping up horse dung. “I did at first find that very odd,” she says. But she added three more live streams of the river, paddock and a bird feeder. It was only when she became ill and was not able to leave the house for six months that she understood the value of it – she too got hooked on live streams of the farm.If someone leaves a gate open, within minutes a viewer will contact the ranch to warn them. Members watched a vet put down a horse after it slid on ice and broke its neck. The horse’s head lay in Miller’s lap as it died. “Many of these people are older and facing death themselves,” she says. “It got them talking about death.”Collapsing bird numbers in North America prompt fears of ecological crisis – researchRead moreThe stream has 275 paying subscribers, most of whom have never been to the farm. It cost $8 a month to be a member, and most are older people or those with reduced mobility. Several members have had their ashes scattered there despite never having set foot on the farm, because it became their favourite place in their final years.Many of these sites allow viewers to message one another or post messages on discussion boards.

A new study awaiting publication shows that playing nature-focused live streams increased the wellbeing of some of the older residents in a care home, improving their mood, levels of relaxation, and sleep. A previousstudyhas also found Dunrovin webcams have a “significant positive change” for care-home residents, and could be an “innovative and effective way” to improve wellbeing more broadly.“I’ve realised it is not just for older adults – there are all sorts of reasons why you might not have full access to nature,” says Mauldin.View image in fullscreenThe Africam live stream has cameras across the continent, capturing footage of animals such as this herd of giraffes in Namibia.Photograph: AfricamThere are hundreds of webcams across 35 of the US’s national parks.

It’s yearning for connection with the world around us,” she says.What to watchKeen to start watching nature online?

A livestream shows the nest currently playing host to four fledged offspring: Isla, Ivy, Issy and Ivan. At the time of writing they are tearing up a small dead rabbit.Love Island for osprey:This has been like a series of the hit reality show, with four osprey couples battling for space in one nest at the Loch of the Lowes wildlife reserve in Scotland. After weeks of grafting and being mugged off, two birds have claimed top spot and appear to be putting their eggs in one basket.Going for a drink:This live streamspies on a watering hole in Tembe elephant park at the border of South Africa and Mozambique, and you can watch a steady stream of elephants, lions, rhinos and buffalo stopping by for a sip. After dark, the cam’s night vision lights up a calming, spinning world of moths and fireflies.Live jelly cam:Monterey Bay Aquarium’s jellyfish cam offers a hypnotic experience, immersing you in the serene world of sea nettles, native to the eastern Pacific Ocean.

But elsewhere in Europe, the far right continues to flourishMon 19 May 2025 13.59 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 14.30 EDTShareAs Romanians voted on Sunday in arguably the most consequential election in the country’s post-communist history, Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, will have been preparing to welcome a fellow disruptor to the European stage. The first round of a controversiallyre-runpresidential contest had been handsomelywonby George Simion, a Eurosceptic ultranationalist who views Donald Trump as a “natural ally” and opposes military aid to Ukraine. On the back of a 20-point lead, Mr Simion, a 38-year-old former football ultra with a taste for violent rhetoric, was so confident of winning that he made aconfrontationalvisit to Brussels in the last days of his campaign.Those expectations were confounded in remarkable fashion at the weekend. In a dramatic reversal of fortunes, Nicușor Dan, the centrist mayor of Bucharest, benefited from the highest voter turnout in 30 years to triumph comfortably. One of the first foreign leaders tocongratulateMr Dan was a relieved Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who, in Hungary and Slovakia, already has to contend with two Putin-friendly governments on Ukraine’s western border.First and foremost, the stability promised by Mr Dan’s victory is good news forRomania, which has been in political turmoil since the original presidential election was cancelled amid allegations of Russian interference. Having made his name as a politically independent anti-corruption campaigner, he must now attempt to unite a deeply polarised country in which inequality, graft and poor public services have proved to be, as elsewhere, a launchpad for far-right populist insurgents.More broadly, the size of the second-round turnout – which included a huge diaspora vote – suggests that hitching a ride on the Trump bandwagon is as liable to motivate a mainstream backlash in Europe as generate Maga-style momentum. Given the global volatility unleashed by Mr Trump’s reckless, bullying style, and the dark shadow cast over eastern Europe by Vladimir Putin’s geopolitical ambitions, the strategic attractions of hugging the EU and Nato close are more readily apparent than they used to be. Handed the opportunity to turn east, a substantial majority of Romanian voters looked west.Elsewhere though, on a “super Sunday” of three European elections, outcomes were more ambivalent and less uplifting from a progressive perspective. The centre also held in Poland, where the liberal mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski,narrowlywon the first round of another crucial presidential election, ahead of the nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki. But the high combined vote for hard- and far-right candidates suggests that result may be reversed in two weeks’ time. One and a half years after Donald Tusk wasgivena prime ministerial mandate to bring Poland back into the European mainstream, Eurosceptic ultranationalism remains a force to be reckoned with.In Portugal, a snap election triggered by the centre-right governing party saw it retain power, but wasnotablemainly for the record number of votes cast for the far-right Chega party. Postal ballots could yet propel Chega to second place, ahead of the Socialist party, after a dismal night for the Portuguese left.Mr Dan’s famous victory was undoubtedly the story of the night, confounding a narrative of an inexorable rightwards shift in central and eastern Europe. But amid anongoingcost of living crisis, and as mainstream parties echo far-right agendas on migration, the politics of Europe continue to feel anxious, polarised and alarmingly unpredictable.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

How things have changedMohamad BazziThe country’s charm offensive and global mediator role – as well as a $400m plane – reveal a complicated relationshipMon 19 May 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 08.01 EDTShareOn histour of the Middle Eastlast week,Donald Trumpwastreated like royaltyby the leaders of the wealthiest countries in the Arab world. The US president was feted in gilded ballrooms, his motorcade was flanked by dozens of men riding white Arabian horses and he was awarded an elaborategold medal necklace. The leaders of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates went out of their way to show Trump that they respect him more than his predecessor, Joe Biden.While Trump frequently praised Saudi and UAE leaders during his first term, he was highly critical of Qatar, a small emirate that is rich in natural gas but usually overshadowed by its two larger and more powerful neighbors. In June 2017,Trump said Qatar“has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level” and hesupported a blockadeagainst the country, led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Qatar’s neighbors accused it of financing terrorism by supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, and being too cozy with Iran. Theblockade, whichdisrupted the livesof thousands of people across the Persian Gulf, stretched until early 2021.Today, Qatar has emerged as the unlikely success story of Trump’s first state visit of his second term. It was no accident that the Qatari royal family recently offered todonate a $400m luxury jet– a “palace in the sky” Boeing 747 – that the president could use as Air Force One for the rest of his term. The plane’s ownership would then be transferred to Trump’s presidential library, meaning he would be able to continue using the jet after he leaves office. Despite the administration’s convoluted effort to frame this as a donation from Qatar to the US government, it would in effect be a gift for Trump’s personal benefit.Trump’s Middle East tour tells us he has forgotten about Gaza, much to Netanyahu’s delight | Yossi MekelbergRead moreIt’s yet another way that Trump is using the presidency toenrich himself and his family business, which has ongoing deals for Trump-branded real estate projects and golf resorts worth billions of dollars in the three wealthy Gulf petrostates that Trump visited last week. So far, neither Congress nor US courts have tried to sanction Trump over the US constitution’sforeign emoluments clause, which forbids the president fromaccepting gifts or paymentsfrom a foreign government without congressional approval.Qatar seems to have won Trump’s respect with its lavish gift and a charm offensive built around its role as a global mediator that is able to bring enemies together. During the first Trump administration, Qatarbrokered a peace agreementbetween the US and Taliban leaders, which was supposed to lead to a phased withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. During the Biden administration, Qatar hosted indirect talks for aprisoner swapbetween Iran and the US, which included unblocking $6bn in frozen Iranian oil funds – an agreement that Washingtonlater rescinded.But Qatar’s most high-stakes mediation role has been to serve as the main conduit for negotiations between Israel and Hamas, after the October 2023 Hamas attack and Israel’s devastating war on Gaza. The Qataris helped broker a one-week ceasefire in November 2023, and a two-month truce thatstarted this past Januaryand collapsed in March.Yet since the emirate emerged as a primary mediator in Gaza, politicians in both the US and Israel ratcheted up their attacks on Qatar. They accused its leaders of supporting terrorism by hosting members of Hamas’s political leadership in Doha, the Qatari capital, where several settled after they were forced out of Damascusfor turning againstthe Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who was facing a popular uprising. Throughout the stalled Gaza negotiations, several members of Congress demanded that the Biden administrationpressure Qatarto close the Hamas offices and expel its leaders. The Qataris resisted those demands and consistently pointed out that Barack Obama’s administrationhad asked Qatarin 2012 to establish an indirect channel that would allow the US to communicate with Hamas.After news broke of Qatar’s plan to donate the luxury jet to Trump, some figures in the president’s Maga movement revived complaints about the emirate’s support for Hamas and other Islamist groups. “We cannot accept a $400 million ‘gift’ from jihadists in suits,”Laura Loomer, a far-right activist who last monthconvinced Trump to firesix White House national security staffers,wrote on X. She added: “I say that as someone who would take a bullet for Trump. I’m so disappointed.”But most of the Republicans in Congress who had urged Biden to punish Qatar for its support of Hamas have so farstayed quietabout Trump’s decision to accept the $400m plane and cozy up to Qatar’s rulers. That’s partly an indication of how Trump has successfully banished or ignored many hawkish Republicans and neoconservatives during his second term, preferring to negotiate with Iran and other US adversaries. Qatar’s role as a mediator that can resolve regional conflicts is particularly attractive to Trump, who sees himself as the ultimate dealmaker.In this term, Trump has surrounded himself with longtime friends as top advisers, including Steve Witkoff, a billionaire real estate developer who is serving as the president’s Middle East envoy and all-around troubleshooter. Witkoff has been publicly praising Qatar’s leaders for their mediation efforts with Hamas since he took office in January – and the envoy’s praise is clearly resonating with Trump, who has dramatically changed his approach toward Qatar. “They’re good, decent people,” Witkoff said of the Qatarisduring an interviewin March with Tucker Carlson, the rightwing media host and Maga figure. “What they want is a mediation that’s effective, that gets to a peace goal. And why? Because they’re a small nation and they want to be acknowledged as a peacemaker.”Witkoff’s comments echoed the strategy of Qatar’s ruler, the 44-year-old Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, who took power in 2013 when his father abdicated the throne. The emir has tried to position Qatar as a force in global geopolitics not just for prestige, but also as a way to ensure his ruling family’s survival amid sometimes aggressive neighbors. (Those neighbors, especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have tried to impose their own foreign policy directives on Qatar, as they did during the blockade that Trump supported in his first term.) Qatar still walks a tightrope of proving itself crucial to the US and western powers by being one of the world’s largest and most reliable suppliers of liquified natural gas, and also maintaining ties with non-state groups such asHamas, Hezbollah and the Taliban.Qatar has tried to hedge its bets by positioning itself to play an outsize role as a dealmaker, one that a country of its size would not normally take on. That policy began under the current emir’s father, who launched the state-owned Al Jazeera satellite network in 1996 as part of Qatar’ssoft-power campaignto increase its influence in the Middle East. And while Qatar directly funded Islamist groups soon after the 2011 Arab uprisings in Syria, Libya and Egypt, the emirate’s leaders became more cautious in recent years and shifted toward cementing their role as global negotiators.Trump’s Middle East trip isn’t just about diplomacy. It’s about the family business | Mohamad BazziRead moreFor decades, Qatari leaders have also worked to solidify a military alliance with the US. After the attacks of 11 September 2001, they allowed Washington to use Al-Udeid Air Base outside Doha to launch air strikes against Afghanistan. Qatar later invested $8bn to upgrade the base, which has become the largest US military installation in the Middle East, housingup to 10,000 troops. On Thursday, as Trump wrapped up his visit to Qatar, he delivered a meandering,campaign-style speechto US troops stationed at the base. He bragged about economic agreements he had signed with Qatari leaders the previous day, which the White House valuedat more than $243bn.Trump also expounded on the value of Qatar’s loyalty: “I don’t think our friendship has ever been stronger than it is right now.” Earlier on Thursday, he praised Qatar’s emir and told a meeting ofbusiness leaders: “We are going to protect you.”For Trump, who sees all diplomacy as transactional, that is the ultimate favor he can bestow: US protection for a foreign leader who is trying to resolve regional conflicts – and also happened to offer the president an extravagant gift.Mohamad Bazzi is the director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies and a journalism professor at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionQatarTrump administrationUS foreign policyGazaHamasIsrael-Gaza warcommentShareReuse this content"

On Thursday,Kennedy said funding for the programwould not be axed, but more cuts to childcare funding are likely coming: someRepublicans have pushedto repeal a five-decade-old tax credit for daycare. The White House is entertaining proposals on how to incentivize and structurally coerce American women intobearing more children, but it seems to be determined to make doing so as costly to those women’s careers as possible.That’s because theRepublicans’ childcare policy, like their pro-natalist policy, is based on one goal: undoing the historic gains in women’s rights and status, and pushing American women out of the workforce, out of public life, out of full participation in society – and into a narrow domestic role of confinement, dependence and isolation.Republicans say they want more American babies – but which kind?Read moreTheNew York Times reported this weekthat the White House is now not only looking for ways to make more women have children, but to encourage “parents” to stay home to raise them. “Parents” here is a euphemism. Roughly80%of stay-at-home parents are mothers: cultural traditions that encourage women, and not men, to sacrifice their careers for caregiving, along with persistent wage inequalities that make women, on the whole, lower earners than their male partners, both incentivize women, and not men, to drop out of the workforce and stay home when they have children.This state of affairs has been worsened by the dramatic rise in the cost of childcare, which is prohibitively expensive for many parents. The average cost of childcare per child per year in the US is now well north of $11,000, according to Child Care Aware of America, an industry advocacy group. In major citiessuch as New York, that price is significantly higher: from $16,000 to $19,000 per year. Existing tax credits need to be expanded, not eliminated, to reduce this burden on mothers and their families and to enable women to join the workforce at rates comparable to men and commensurate with their dignity and capacities. Currently,26% of mothers do not engage in paid work, a figure that has barely budged in 40 years. Largely because of the unequally distributed burdens of childcare, men participate in the paid labor force ata rate that is more than 10%higher than women.One might think that the solution would be to invest more in high-quality childcare, so that providers could open more slots, children could access more resources, and women could go to work and expend their talents in productive ways that earn them money, make use of their gifts and provide more dignity for women and more stability for families. This is not what the American right is proposing: Brad Wilcox, a sociologist who promotes traditional family and gender relations, has called such policy initiatives “work-ist”. Conservatives are proposing, instead, that women go back to the kitchen.What emerges from the right is an effort to force women out of education and paid work and into pregnancy and dependence on menThe Trump administration, and the American right more broadly, wants the rate of women’s employment to be even lower, because it is advancing a lie that women are naturally, inevitably, uniformly and innately inclined to caregiving, child rearing and homemaking – and not to the positions of intellectual achievement, responsibility, leadership, ingenuity or independence that women may aspire to in the public world. “We cannot get away from the fact that a child is hardwired to bond with Mom,”saysJanet Erickson, a fellow at the rightwing Institute for Family Studies, who once co-authored an op-ed with JD Vance calling on “parents” to drop out of the workforce to raise children. “I just think, why should we deny that?”This kind of vague, evidence-free gesturing toward evolutionary psychology – the notion that babies are “hardwired” to prefer mothers who are not employed – is a common conservative tick: a recourse to dishonest and debunked science to lend empiricism to bigotry. There is in fact no evolutionary reason, and no biological reason, for mothers, and not fathers, to abandon independence, ambition or life outside the home for the sake of a child. The only reason is a sexist one.Over the past decade, the left launched few vigorous defenses of a feminist politics that seeks to advance and secure women’s access to public life, paid work and fair remuneration. The American left has launched vigorous criticisms of the “girlboss”, a figure of malignant female ambition who seemed to make the exploitations of capitalism more offensive by virtue of her sex, and it has instead offered critiques of women’s ambition and romantic defenses of thelaborof “care” that just happens to overlap with women’s traditional – and traditionally unpaid – roles in the home. This leftwing rhetoric has at times mirrored the similar romanticization of the unpaid housewife of yesteryear from the right, which has embracedtradwives, homesteading fantasies and an aestheticized rustic simplicity that aims to contrast feminist gains in the workforce with a fantasy of women’s rest. Together, these strains of rhetorical opposition to women in the workforce have made anti-feminism into a new kind of “socialism of fools” – a misguided misdirection of anger and resentment at the rapaciousness of capitalism towards a social justice movement for the rights of an oppressed class.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is instead about a sex segregation of human experience, an effort to make much of public life inaccessible to women. Combined with the right wing’s successful attack on the right to abortion, the Trump administration’s dramaticcuts to Title Xprograms that provide contraceptive access, and the rescinding of federal grants aimed at helpingworking women, what emerges from the rightwing policy agenda is an effort to force women out of education, out of decently paid work and into pregnancy, unemployment and dependence on men.Theirs is an effort to shelter men from women’s economic competition, to revert to the regressive cultural modes of an imagined past, and to impose an artificially narrow vision of the capacities, aspirations, talents and desires of half of the American people.Murray Rothbard, the paleoconservative 20th-century economist whose ideas have had a profound influence on the Trumpist worldview, once vowed: “We shall repeal the 20th century.” As far as the Republican right is concerned, it seems to want to repeal the gains of 20th-century feminism first.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsWomenOpinionChildcareParents and parentingChildrenRepublicansGenderTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Both in terms of rebalancing the relationship between the US and the region, and in scrambling perceptions. In Riyadh, he told the Saudi royals there would be no more “lectures on how to live”. He lifted sanctions on Syria so that the country may have a “fresh start”, and hefawned over the camelsand lavish architecture (“as a construction guy,”he said at one Qatari palace, “this is perfect marble”). Never has Trump appeared more in his element, surrounded by the wealth of sovereigns, the marshalling power of absolute monarchies, and their calculated self-orientalisation and over-the-top flattery.The same man who enacted the Muslim ban in his first term wasstrolling around mosquesandshrugging off the radical path to powerof the Syrian president: “Handsome guy … Tough past, but are you gonna put a choir boy in that position?” His call for recognising the new role of Gulf states both as political and economic powerhouses, and matter-of-factly taking their lead on what Syria needs right now, whatever the history, is excruciating. Because it reveals how painfully sclerotic and inconsistent previous administrations were. Joe Biden promised to take a hard line with the Saudi government for its role in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and in the Yemen war, and then seemed toforget about it, or realised he couldn’t follow through. From Trump, there is no such mixed signalling: you are rich, we need you. You do you.The Democrats lectured while abjectly failing to enforce the standards of international law. Trump is dispensing with the pretence of international law altogether, and in doing so ending the theatre that the US was ever some virtuous protagonist in the region. The result is a transactionalism of equals, thebillion dollar dealsand quid pro quos cut in plain sight. For the three Gulf countries that Trump visited, Qatar, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, Trump’s recognition of their colossal national projects in economic transformation, and political positioning in terms of foreign policy, slaked an appetite to be seen. To be acknowledged not just as wealthy ignoramuses to be managed, but sophisticated power brokers in their own right.There is a particular brand, that is still being finessed, of shaping politics in the region and diversifying from natural resources. Take the UAE’s financing of adevastating war in Sudanin order to get a foothold on the African continent, and, at the other end of the spectrum, Qatar’s quiet emergence as thenegotiating capital of the world.What is clear is that the centre of gravity is shifting for the US away from European capitals and transatlantic alliances, towards a region that, as far as Trump is concerned, is not bothering him with any moral condemnations on Ukraine, doesn’t have the pesky matter of a voting public to worry about, and has spare billions to invest and flamboyantly flatter. Keir Starmer can have a good stab at getting Trump on side by offering a “historic” royal invitation for a state visit, but can heproject the stars and stripeson the world’s tallest building?But there is a fundamental disjuncture to Trump’s trip that was apparent in parts of Middle Eastern state media and political pronouncements last week. As Israel intensified its strikes in Gaza, signifying its lack of interest in negotiating any meaningful ceasefire, there was arising clamourin condemnation of the assault. As Trump was received with US flag waving, one stark issue could not be broached – that he leads the country that is supplying the weapons and political support for a military campaign that is destabilising the region.It was a disconnect that characterised the entire trip. Among all the emphatic language and imagery of a bloc of rising powers, the question remained of what exactly that power could be used for. Is it purely one that gives these states the right to supercharge their economies through more favourable trading relationships with the US? And gives them licence to pursue foreign policy escapades and projects on their own turf without fear of censure or “lecturing”? Or is it power that can be wielded to meaningfully influence political outcomes and persuade the US to change course on Israel-Palestine, an issue that now lies at the heart of not only Middle Eastern but Arab politics.The war has now extended to Lebanon and Syria, Jordan and Egypt are under extreme pressure, and even in ostensibly unchallenged monarchies, it is a public opinion and PR hot potato that needs to be handled very carefully. Trump is still shopping his ethnic cleansing plan that aims to “resettle” people from Gaza,this time to Libya, and the momentum of the early days of his administration to secure a ceasefire is now gone, as Israel intensifies its campaign tooccupy more parts of Gaza. As lavish scenes unfolded across the Gulf, and Trump commented on the quality of marble, there was one unavoidable thought – no food, water or medicinehas been allowed into Gaza for months.The question of the limits of this new US deference is crucial in correctly estimating what just happened. Because even though it looked as if something historic took place, that Trump had blown away the cobwebs of old foreign policy in the region, broken with orthodoxies, and made overtures that overturn decades-old tropes and perceptions, it may all still come to nothing where it matters most. If these forces still have no ability to dictate what happens in their own back yards, no ability to stabilise and determine the region’s political future, or indeed, assume the mantle of leadership in which they have the power and responsibility to save other Arabs from hunger, displacement and bullying, then it’s all elaborate theatre with a measure of economic windfall. No lecturing is nice, but being the master of your own fate is all that really matters.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Once nestled in the arms of Nato, now alarmingly alone, we have no choice but to embrace neighbours we shunned. Thanks to Vladimir Putin, (nearly) all Europeans now see clearly what was always the case. In danger we need each other, never mindfishor dynamic alignment.But talking about less important things was always the British way. So headlines and the Today programme bang on about the12-year continuanceof the fishing deal struck by Boris Johnson, allowing French boats into our waters. It’s hard on fishing communities, but not worse than before. The Brexiters used and cheated fishers. But a government has to weigh up winners and losers when fishing contributes just0.03% to UK GDPand10,000 jobs. Now set that against the 2.5% of GDP we spendon defencewith 164,000 jobs. As the pathway opens up for British defence industries to bid for contracts from the giant €150bn EU defence fund, that’s altogether another kettle of fish.But there we go again, at risk of making the same old remainer mistakes we made last time. Economics be damned when an implausible picture of Nigel Farage grinning at the cameras with abox of fishas he floated down the Thames tapped more deeply into mythic memories of ancient Britain ruling the waves and sou’wester-clad fishers than any spreadsheets of GDP figures. He is straight out there now claiming this deal “will be the end of the fishing industry”, alongside those shouts of “surrender” and “total capitulation”. Oh dear, out pops the Tory lord Stuart Rose, former Marks & Spencer head, calling that “nonsense”: he was the disastrous leader of theofficial remain campaign.This is the question: will this “reset” get the old war cries going, reopening the terrible times that split the country in half, broke families, turned friends into enemies? It still runs deep enough for pollsters to rely on leave/remain as a key voter identifier. Labour remainers were stricken by the allegation that they had lost any connection with working-class, non-graduate, left-behinders they thought they had championed all their lives, bringing grief to the very people bound to suffer most from Brexit’s damage. How could they? Labour has been paralysed by Brexit red lines, and so the Liberal Democrats, who never identified with the workers anyway, sweep up remainer votes with apledge to rejoin. (They are Labour’s danger now, of which more later.)Labour will carefully avoid popping remainer corks, though this deal is remarkably good for Britain, setting us on a path to repair colossal Brexit losses. Just hold on to this one figure: the Office for Budget Responsibility says that without Brexit Britain’s GDP would be4% higher. Imagine what we could do with that, when every percentage point isworth another £25.6bn.Yes, I know, those are more remainer numbers, but amid the direst squeeze on everything, with a horrendous spending round coming up shortly, most people know those numbers convert into real things – GP and dentist appointments, benefits for children and disabled people, reopening those hundreds ofclosed swimming pools, lost playing fields andshut libraries, and filling all the potholes. These losses, which I chronicle in the bookThe Only Way is Up, co-written with David Walker, are the baseline inheritance from which to judge Labour over the next few years. This EU deal is most likely to start yielding results first, while sustainable energy offers more hope; new towns or1.5m more homeswill take time. The very fact of easing cross-Channel trade should speed investment into Britain, brightening our prospects.Eurovision results suggest we are not loved: Erasmus and youth exchange will open doors and maybe hearts. But to make this an experience for all, the government must dash to set up exchange programmes not as class-bound opportunities for the university half, but as the chance for apprenticeships, BTec courses and craft-skill experiences around Europe. Labour is alert to making EU links relevant to every household: no queues atpassport e-gates; sharing data on crime, terror and traffickers; more jobs; cheaper food; pet passports and selling our sausages.From fishing to Erasmus: what the UK’s deal with the EU will meanRead moreBut there is more to be done. TheBrexitomertà has to end here. Labour cannot continue the Blair/Brown mistake of refusing to talk of European values. There were good signs today as Keir Starmer and Ursula von der Leyen spoke not just of policy but of common political and social values, with democracy everywhere under threat. The EU has its fifth column to fight off from within – as Romania just did, with Poland and Portugal at the polls – resisting the threat of the Hungarian/Slovakian pro-Russian right.That’s our fight, too. Starmer needs to take this beyond one day’s news and make bold speeches about this welcome EU friendship. He may find he gains respect for telling the truth about what Brexit has done to us, confronting head-on those who misled the country into Brexit calamity. The boot is on his foot, so kick hard, when only30% of voterssay Britain was right to leave, and just 11% that it has gone well. A good 64% are on his side, wanting closer EU relations: that casts the right wing on the wrong side. Here’s the best weapon against Farage, the man to blame for this fiasco, and it’s a death-dealer against the expiring Tories.This is about defence of the realm, real danger, for which Starmer should raise defence bonds. Patriotism demands closer alliances. Those who raised the Brexit spectre of a “European army” as the ultimate EU shocker are now stranded on the beaches and Starmer’s “Britain is back on the world stage” is a good rebuke to them.Labour’s political self-interest rests with stopping the exodus of support to the rejoining parties, the Lib Dems and the Greens. The psephologist and former YouGov president Peter Kellner shows Labour losingfar more to its leftthan its right, and next time the departed will be angry enough not to vote tactically.Block all ears to the absurdly anachronistic hullabaloo from the old Brexiters and their hysterical press. Stop the Farage-favouring policies and lean back to Labour’s own side before they vanish altogether, Kellner warns. This deal should mark that turning point, a reset forLabourtoo.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Britain is crying out for bold, transformative policy-makingMon 19 May 2025 12.10 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 12.21 EDTShareJust why has Keir Starmer’s government proved such a catastrophe? This is a question that must be posed to his cheerleaders, or at least those who were at one time cheerleaders: the road from the last general election is lined with silently discarded pompoms. The idea here is not to rub their faces in a political project that is now both electorally toxic and morally bankrupt, but to determine what happens next.First off, the failure should be considered absolute. It is projected that aLabour governmentwill drive more than a million Britons into – or more deeply into – poverty through an assault on disability benefits. The same government imposed hardship on many pensioners by stripping away thewinter fuel payment, and it refuses to reverse the Tories’ two-child benefit cap, the UK’sbiggest single generator of child poverty. Not content with waging war on the poor only at home, the government opened a new front abroad by slashing the international aid budget. It alsocan’t bring itself to condemn Israel for a single crime – including deliberate starvation – and continues to supply crucial components forF-35 jet fightersto rain more death on Gaza’s traumatised survivors. The government not only demonises immigration and promotes punitive crackdowns, but it also echoes therhetoric of Enoch Powell. It does all of this while its polling collapses to the low 20s, withNigel Farage’s Reform UKparty boasting a 10-point lead over it in one poll.Did Starmer’s supporters expect such an agenda – one as gruesomely reactionary as it is bereft of an obvious electoral base of support? Did they believe it would prove so devoid of principle as to allow Farage to dictate the national political conversation before they’d even completed one year in power? The real problem is clearly this: Starmer, an empty vessel who wanted to be prime minister for its own sake, made a pact with the most cartoonishly Blairite factionalists that Labour has to offer. They sought to apply the political formula of Tony Blair’s government when it was falling apart in the mid-2000s to a completely different context some 20 years later.One of the main problems is that the Blairism of the mid-2000s was more about vibes than substance. When New Labour first assumed office, its project of humanising Thatcherism at least meantsomething – and the minimum wage, tax credits and public sector investment clearly reduced hardship and improved lives. The party could even show moralleadership, equalising the age of consent andabolishing section 28despite polling at the time showing vast opposition to both – alas, trans people today enjoy no such political courage.But by New Labour’s third term, the government had become more about defining itself against progressives than anything else. Having already infuriated many naturalLabourvoters by helping George W Bush set Iraq on fire, Blairism became about relishing that it wasangering, say, trade unions by extending market dogma into public services, or defenders of civil liberties with authoritarian crackdowns. The more anyone deemed leftish squealed, New Labour advisers believed, the more they were on the right track.In truth, New Labour’s success at the time depended on a mirage. It could maintain social peace with rising living standards and improved public services thanks to an unsustainable dependence on big finance. As it was, that approach was already running out of road before Lehman Brothers went pop: four years before the big crash, theincomes of the bottom halfof the population began to stagnate, and for the bottom quintile actually started to fall. So began what became known as the cost of living crisis. This is what has driven our age of discontent – from Brexit to Scottish nationalism to Corbynism.After the crash, and out of power, New Labour’s acolytes had nothing to say. They became arsonists, defining themselves purely against the party’s new masters. Ed Miliband sought to grapple with the fact that the world was changing, but the ideas were lacking. In the 2015 leadership election, the Labour right’s barren political cupboard was devastatingly exposed. Jeremy Corbyn assumed the leadership by a landslide precisely because his opponents were bereft of ideas, whereas the left sought to abandon the stifling straitjacket of austerity. The Blairite candidate, Liz Kendall, offered a pitch that could hardly have been better designed to antagonise Labour supporters: combining cuts to the welfare state with more arms spending. Remind you of anybody?UK’s F-35 exports more important than stopping genocide, lawyers to argueRead moreKendall’s campaign manager, Morgan McSweeney, seemingly learned not to make that mistake again as he drove Starmer’s brazen conning of the Labour membership in 2020. The problem was this: the Labour right had half a decade in exile to produce a new prospectus. It came up with nothing. It dedicated all its energy to burning Corbynism to the ground regardless of the damage that would inflict on the party. (Recall Lord Mandelson, now ambassador to the US, saying in 2017 that he tried to undermine Corbyn’s leadership “every single day”.) Labour did not win in 2017, as we are constantly reminded, but a rational party would have understood that the surge from 30% to 40% of the vote share in just two years after a drubbing was driven above all else by a transformative policy offer.But the truth is, late-stage Blairism applied to the Britain of 2025 could never be anything other than a disaster. Labour’s ruling faction knows how to destroy but not how to build. Starmer’s original true believers seemed to believe that a general sense of competence was sufficient. But what was really needed wasn’t the “grownups back in the room” – it was a transformative policy agenda to replace a broken system that has stopped delivering social progress. And if that isn’t understood, then don’t be surprised when a Labour government defined by increasing poverty and immigrant-bashing comes crashing down in ignominy.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The climate crisis is hitting Australians hard.Right now, farmers in South Australia and Victoria are battling drought, while Queensland farmers pick up the pieces after heartbreaking floods. Globally, 2024 was the hottest year on record and the first time average temperatures surged 1.5C above preindustrial levels. We are living through longer, deadlier heatwaves, devastating bushfires, more frequent and intense floods, and rising sea levels that threaten coastal communities.This year, the economic impacts of the climate crisis have been severe as well, with Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfredadding a $1.2bn costto the federal budget.Australia has backed a rapid shift to renewable energy - and given Labor a chance on climate. How will it act? | Clear AirRead moreScientists have warned us for decades that slashing climate pollution is critical to protecting Australians. The last federal parliament started to turn around Australia’s highly polluting economy. We now have about 40% of the electricity in our main grid coming from renewables backed by storage, a vehicle efficiency scheme to cut transport pollution, and we have begun regulating big polluters.Despite the fossil fuel lobby bankrolling third-party groups to run campaigns against climate solutions, Australians have resoundingly endorsedLabor’s energy and climate policiesand given them a historic mandate to go further.One of the first tests for the new government will be setting a 2035 emissions reduction target, a line in the sand that will guide Australia’s climate action for the next decade. The government has tasked the Climate Change Authority (CCA), headed up by former NSW treasurer Matt Kean, to come up with a number that reflects both what is necessary and what is possible.Theworld’s best scientistshave told us that to protect Australians we must drive down climate pollution by at least 75% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2035.Most Australian state and territory governments have set commitments to cut climate pollution. ClimateWorks has found that together these targets would slash Australia’s pollution by an estimated66% to 71%.While it is well below what is necessary, the federal government can build on this subnational action to drive pollution down further and faster. A 71% target should be considered a floor upon which a larger federal target should be built.2:03Tracing the worst coral bleaching event in recorded history – videoClimate science can also show us the real-world implications of doing too little. Ouranalysis showsthat a 2035 target of 70% (essentially the current commitments of Australia’s states and territory governments) would align with global warming of well over 2C this century, if other countries made similar commitments. This would be catastrophic: communities exposed to flood and fire risk will certainly be forced to move, our coral reefs will be all but destroyed, and the costs to our economy and way of life would be severe.In response to Donald Trump’s shrill call to “drill, baby drill”, the rest of the world has an opportunity to step into the vacuum created by the absence of American leadership. Australia is the world’s14th largest polluterand one of the biggest fossil fuel exporters. If we set a strong 2035 target alongside other climate leaders, we will bring others with us to keep driving the clean energy revolution and strengthen our case as a host of the 2026 Conference of Parties.But, if significant countries such as Australia step backwards, it is highly likely we will leave the climate challenge far too late. We resign ourselves to catastrophic levels of global heating.Everything you need to know about Australia’s new home battery subsidyRead moreUnderstanding what is possible is a tricky process of balancing assumptions about the future. In doing so, what is possible tends to be underestimated. When I started working on climate change in 2006 there were a few thousand homes in Australia with solar panels. Today there are over 4m. No one expected it to happen so fast. The cost of solar, wind and batteries have fallen more quickly than expected, with our communities and business leaders embracing the change.Of course, targets are only as good as the action behind them and we need to go faster in all areas.Australia’s 2035 emissions reduction target must be a line of defence against the escalating dangers of climate change. The Australian people are expecting meaningful action on climate change, having just given a massive majority to a Labor government that promised to take the crisis seriously.The choices around how fast we cut climate pollution will define how safe or scary the world becomes as our children grow up. Doing what is necessary is hard, but failing now could very likely undermine other work of this government on setting out its legacy – and will make life extremely difficult for everyone that comes after us.Amanda McKenzie is the CEO of the Climate CouncilExplore more on these topicsEnergyOpinionClimate crisisFossil fuelsRenewable energycommentShareReuse this content"

If anyone can source jerk chicken in a tin, do let me knowMon 19 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 12.41 EDTShareIhave seen the future. It was one morning last week –at the Co-op. Shelves that once groaned now had nothing much on them. Sad signs where the baked beans and tinned tuna once lived reduced to a study in impotence. Following a cyber-attack more than two weeks ago that decimated its supply systems, the supermarket has struggled to recover. We would like to sell you stuff, but our cupboard is empty, the shelves say, as yours must now be.Surveying the emptiness, I turned to the stocky stranger beside me who was reaching into the pastry cupboard with the plastic tongs. “This is what it will be like when the bomb drops,” I said. He smiled, nodded, and grabbed another croissant. He’s smart. If this is what is coming, what a simple cyber-attack can wreak – nothing to do withEnola Gayorthe Peaky Blinders bloke as Oppenheimer– two croissants a day will seem an ambitious diet.Are you prepping yet? I haven’t been. Things are bleak and the world seems as tinderbox dangerous as it has been in my lifetime, but I have yet to fill the apocalypse preparatory bag,as so many have, and as an increasing number of governments say we should all be doing.TheSwedish government wrote to its people last year, warning “we live in uncertain times”, and advising them to keep a minimum of 3 litres of water per person, per day at hand for that break glass moment. (Here, I’d counsel customers of financially knackered Thames Water to do the same.)The Swedes have been pointed towards non-perishable foods, those that can be stored at room temperature and gorged using flints and fingers: dried meat, tinned fare, crispbreads, pesto, cheese in a tube. If there was ever a point to the rounds of Babybel cheese entrenched at the back of your fridge, this is it. They are like an aircraft’s black box: virtually indestructible, made for the apocalypse and prepping.View image in fullscreenIn November 2024 the Swedish government sent all households in Sweden the booklet If Crisis or War Comes.Photograph: Claudio Bresciani/EPAThe Swedes, like many European countries, have ample geographical motivation to prep. If you pulled back the curtains in the morning and saw Vladimir Putin peering through binoculars at your house from across the street, you’d pack a prep bag too.The Brits are less anxious, but then we are us. Our official “Get prepared for emergencies” advice is less a megaphone declaration, more a ministerial mumble on a website, that advocates the stashing of water, “ready-to-eat tinned meat, fruit or vegetables (and a tin opener)”. That’s the key wisdom, don’t forget the tin opener: apocalyptic fistfights will be fought over tin openers, even the basic ones that don’t work.Clearly the need to pack a bag grows urgent and daily their usefulness becomes apparent. Even now, residents traumatised by this year’s Los Angeles wildfirestestify to the valueof having a go bag ready. Popular Science magazineis clear. “Everyone should be a little bit of a prepper,” it said. “From gun-toting, cabin-living, former military members, to crunchy homesteaders in Vermont, to suburban parents ready to transform their minivans into go-vehicles at the drop of an apocalyptic hat.” And that was before my Co-op ran out of anchovies.Of course, what goes in the rucksack will vary. What’s a luxury: what’s essential? It’s arguable that for some it may, on some level, be cultural. I have not searched hard, but I have yet to stumble across jerk chicken in a tin, and I would need that to cope for even a moderate period of time. I have a humorously doom-laden friend who proclaims – in the style of a latter-day Moses – “One day, my people, the chicken will run out.” In apocalypse go bag terms, he’d struggle too.View image in fullscreenViggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee in the film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy’s The Road.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyThough water is a no brainer, how much room would I have for bottles ofSupermalt?

I don’t think so.All of this needs addressing by a prepping industry ready to serve diverse societies. Perhaps it will be: unless a go-ahead Reform government here decrees the only tinned meat should bethe squaddie’s wartime favourite, bully beef.As days pass, the beleaguered Co-op saysthings are getting better, but it takes a row of pockmarked shelves on a weekday morning to bring it all home: this is a troubled world, in which the clock can so easily stop onjust in time deliveries, where each dayCormac McCarthylooks like a visionary,The Roada documentary.I have seen the future.

This is about preserving embattled communitiesMon 19 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 10.56 EDTShareJust over two years ago,Walesgave councils the powers to massively increase council tax on second homes. If you were to read recent headlines, you would think this was a disaster.“Fury,” said the Express. A“botched” policythat is “in tatters” after “£30k off house prices” lamented the Telegraph. Indeed, these publications are correct: the changes have led to something of an exodus of some second-home owners. What the titles seem to have missed, however, was that this was the point.Due to the indisputable fact that our country is bloody fantastic, people love to visit and to buy second homes here. In some parts of Cymru, this has become a major problem. In the county of Gwynedd,the figures were astronomical. In 2021 of all the properties in Beddgelert, 23% were second homes. It was 25% in Aberdaron and up to 40% in Llanengan.This has several knock-on effects. House prices soar, so local young people can’t get on the ladder where they grew up. Many of them are first-language Welsh speakers, which means the language is under threat in these rural areas that have safeguarded Cymraeg – the Welsh language – for centuries.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: The TelegraphThe high rates of second-home ownership also mean that, unless the weather is forecast to be good (which in Wales is about as often as an eclipse), these towns and villages are half empty. This causes pubs to close. There are fewer children, so schools close. It erodes the heart of our communities.To try to tackle this, the Welsh Labour government, alongside Plaid Cymru, introduced measures to curb second-home ownership. This included giving councils the ability to push council tax on second homes to 300% the usual rate. They also closed a loophole whereby second-home owners could register as a business in order to pay the much lower business rates.Gwynedd council used these powers tohike council tax to 150%in April 2023. By the end of 2024, house prices hadfallen by 12.4%as second-home owners tried to sell up. In Pembrokeshire, house prices fell by 8.9% after the council increased thecouncil tax to 200% on second homes(though this was reduced to 150% recently).As is so often the case in the age of the culture war, some elements of the media lost their minds.The Mail reportedan “anti-English attack”, and the fall in house prices was widely reported as a negative.First things first: let’s put aside this “anti-English” rubbish.About two-thirds of those with holiday homesin Pembrokeshire live in Wales, predominantly South Wales. Being English isn’t the issue here. Second, just the summer before, the very same Daily Mail was reporting how tourists were “flocking in their drovesto top locations in Bannau Brycheiniog National Park”, so it can’t be hitting tourism that hard.Finally, it is hard to see the house-price drop as anything other than a positive. So often it feels like policy changes do little to directly help ordinary people and often do active harm (disability benefit changes, for example). What we have here is the pushing-through of a controversial policy because it will directly help communities negatively affected by the decisions of those who have more money.Not that the policy is perfect. The closing of the business-rates loophole means that to register as a business, a property has to be let for 50% of the year (182 days). Therefore even if your property is let for every weekend and all of July and August, you won’t qualify as a business. This has punished many perfectly legitimate businesses, and even Plaid Cymru has admitted it will need to lower that if it is in power after 2026.However, the impact of tourism isn’t just on second homes. It also causes problems for communities in terms of traffic, infrastructure and parking. To try to mitigate this, theWelsh governmentis introducing a tourist tax. This visitor levy is similar to the one you pay when you go to places like Barcelona on holiday.Anyone who reads this column regularly knows that I am deeply disdainful of how Wales has been governed since devolution and feel the Welsh government has shown an almost crass lack of ambition for the country. But when it comes to the tourist tax, I think they’ve got it right.The new law allows councils to charge a fixed fee of £1.25 per person per night for Airbnbs, hotels and self-catered lets and 75p per night for campsites (pitches) and stays in hostels. Children are exempt from being charged the visitor levy, meaning that if two parents took their kids away for a week it would add £17.50 to their stay.This money is kept by local authorities and must be used to maintain and promote the Welsh language or the sustainable economic growth of tourism, or improve infrastructure, facilities and services used by visitors.Frankly,an extra £1.25 to stay a night in Wales is the bargain of the century. In the same way that when you visit a free museum you chuck them a few quid in thanks, this is an investment in the place you are visiting.‘Weather-proofing’ fund to help Welsh tourism industry brave soggy summersRead moreIt is thoughtful policymaking.

Will England listen?Rhiannon Lucy CosslettOlder relatives might roll their eyes at this generation’s approach, but it is overdue in a country where smacking is still legalMon 19 May 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 12.25 EDTShareAnew trend is circulating on social media where adults ask their children to complete some of the toxic parenting phrases they remember from their own childhoods. Sayings such as “I’ll give you something to ... [cry about]”; “children are to be … [seen and not heard]”, and “I brought you into this world … [and I can take you out of it]” are reconfigured by a new generation of little kids who have been raised in more loving and respectful ways.“I’ll give you something to …” one parent asks, as their child replies “help you with”. “Children are to be … children” and “I brought you into this world and … made you happy”. It’s powerfully moving, seeing how this generation of parents are trying their best to break the cycle of abuse that has frequently masqueraded as discipline over previous decades.And for good reason. Being shouted atcan alter a child’s brain, and the mental health consequences of having hostile, demeaning or humiliating words used against you in childhood can be lifelong. “[Verbal abuse] can profoundly shape our sense of self and whether we feel lovable and confident in navigating an unpredictable world,” Prof Eamon McCrory, chief executive of the mental health charity Anna Freud, told MPs last month. “As a clinical psychologist, I see in my clients how childhood messages – both negative and positive – shape who they become.”Reading this makes me feel even worse about the few times I have raised my voice in frustration with my son, but parents have to wrestle with these debates all the time, not to mention reflect on their actions even years later. This month,Michelle Obama admitted that she used to smack her daughters. “It took a couple of spankings for me to be like, yeah, you know what, this is a little kid and the fact that I can’t think of any better way to get my point across than to smack somebody on the butt, I felt embarrassed,” she said.I admire her for speaking out, and for not using the sort of self-justifying language that many adults now do when reflecting on how they punished their children. I’ve heard many victims of such punishments minimise them, too. Whenever anyone says: “I was smacked, and it didn’t do me any harm,” I always think: “But it did, because you are standing there, saying those words, justifying what is ultimately a cruel and abusive act against a child.” The idea that people who love us and try to do their best by us can also sometimes hurt us is a very difficult thing to contend with.Older people sometimes roll their eyes at this generation’s gentle parenting methods – the phrase “you’re making a rod for your own back” is deployed to the point where it’s become a cliche – but like it or not, the shift to more child-centred methods is a backlash to the kind of stern parenting that came before. I wasn’t raised being shouted at, or hit – but lots of my peers were. That smacking continues to be legal in England and Northern Ireland (it is illegal in Scotland and Wales) never ceases to pain and surprise me. This is despite multiple calls from charities, children’s rights experts and,most recently, leading paediatriciansto make it unlawful.Smacking a child is just an act of violence. Why do England and Northern Ireland still allow it? | Frances RyanRead moreThere will no doubt be those who are reading this who feel uncomfortable with what I am saying about punishment. Some of you will feel guilty, and others perhaps, angry. I expect some of you may feel even more uncomfortable about what I am going to say next, which is that verbal and physical punishment are a children’s rights issue. “Smacking is one of the very few things in parenting where you can say absolutely 100% this is not good for children, either children in the future, or in terms of how it makes children feel now,” says Eloise Rickman, the author of It’s Not Fair, a manifesto for children’s rights. Children’s rights experts use the term adultism to describe the ways in which adults deploy power and rules against children. It’s a concept that many adults find highly challenging, but when you open your mind to it you realise how conditioned we are to treat children as “less than”, and how normal we feel it is for adults to have full control over children. Children hate to be shouted at and smacked. It upsets and frightens them. But how often in a discussion about it do we hear their voices? How often are their thoughts and opinions centred?Rickman believes thatEnglandis an especially inhospitable country when it comes to parents and children, and I agree with her. It isn’t just the pressures that parents are under – from housing to childcare – but the way our communities respond when parents and children are out in public. If you live in a place where, if your child starts crying, you receive sympathetic and supportive looks and comments, offers to help, and expressions of solidarity, you are much less likely to become stressed and raise your voice, or feel that you have to “perform discipline” than you will in a place where you’ll get tuts and judgmental comments. Parenting in the UK can often feel more like the latter than the former. I’m still not sure why: is it a legacy of Victorian values? A stiff upper lip thing?View image in fullscreenA family having fun drawing at home. Posed by models.Photograph: Santiago Nunez/StocksyWhatever it is, we need a fundamental shift, and that requires knotty conversations beyond just “we should ban smacking”, which of course should be illegal. There needs to be a debate about how we can best support parents, and what it means to live in a society that values children, as opposed to one where the idea of children’s rights is treated as a bit of a joke. Why is it assumed that our voices matter more than those of children, that we should be the ones in power? The UK has signed up to the UN convention on the rights of the child, but we haven’t embedded it into English law. We should examine why that is.As we speak, Rickman and I get talking about Italy, a famously child-friendly place where a crying child would be more likely to solicit the sort of solidarity I mentioned earlier, and how their child-centred Reggio Emilia educational approach arose as a direct response to fascism. In the context of the global rise of the far-right, perhaps it’s worth thinking about how anti-fascism begins at home, with the most vulnerable group of people of all, and how living anti-authoritarian values means not forcing children to be obedient, shouting at, or hitting them.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSocietyOpinionChildrenEnglandNorthern IrelandCorporal punishmentcommentShareReuse this content"

Your friends, your boss? Maybe your parents? How about your partner? According torecent research by the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, “nearly 1 in 5 young people believe it’s OK to track their partner whenever they want”.As a long-term and stubbornly-vocal privacy advocate, I find this alarming. It’s hard to imagine a bigger red flag than someone wanting to keep tabs on my daily movements. It’s not that I’m doing anything remotely secretive: my days are most often spent working from home, punctuated by trips to the bakery – scandalous! But it’s not about whether I have anything to hide from my partner. Everyone ought to have the right to keep things to themselves, and choose when they do or don’t share.After reading this study I became troubled by a niggling feeling that perhaps I’m standing alone in the corner of the party while all my friends share their locations with one another. So I conducted a highly unscientific survey of people in my life. As it turns out, aside from a small handful who share my resistance, lots of people are indeed keeping digital tabs on one another.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsMany constantly share their location with their partner, or use apps like Life360 or Find My Friends. Some groups of friends all do it together, and talk of it as a kind of digital closeness where physical distance and the busyness of life keeps them apart (I assure myself that I’m not invited to the tracking party for obvious reasons). Others use apps to keep familial watch over older relatives – especially when their health may be in decline. Obviously this is anecdotal, but it seems people are using all kinds of digital monitoring for all kinds of reasons, not all of them nefarious. Some research suggests the notion of “careful surveillance” canform intimacyin ways that complicates typical ideas of privacy.It’s hard to ignore the gendered nature of all this. The eSafety Commissioner’s research specifically highlights that men are significantly more likely to consider intimate partner monitoring as reasonable and a “sign of care”. Conversely, women tell me they digitally track one another as a safety mechanism while walking home at night, travelling alone or out on dates – specifically as a response to theterrifying state of men’s violence against women. Likewise, research shows how some womenperceive their phoneas a key tool to mitigate safety risk.'Nothing to hide; nothing to fear' is a frustratingly persistent fallacyPerhaps one of the most disturbing notions is that acceptance of digital monitoring is often presented as a way to create – rather than undermine – a sense of trust. When government officials or tech industry bigwigs proclaim that you should be OK with being spied on if you’re not doing anything wrong, they’re asking (well, demanding) that we trust them. But it’s not about trust, it’s about control and disciplining behaviour. “Nothing to hide; nothing to fear” is a frustratingly persistent fallacy, one in which we ought to be critical of when its underlying (lack of) logic creeps into how we think about interacting with one another.When it comes to interpersonal surveillance, blurring the boundary between care and control can be dangerous. The eSafety Commissioner is right toraise concernsthat many of these behaviours are characteristic of tech-based coercive control, and tocall outthat use of digital spying tools by parents on their children has “anaesthetised young people to the whole idea of being monitored”, teaching them that surveillance is a form of love. Just as normalising state and corporate surveillance can lead to further erosion of rights and freedoms over time, normalising interpersonal surveillance seems to be changing the landscape of what’s considered to be an expression of love – and not necessarily for the better.Many parents opt to use digital monitoring apps for fear for their children’s safety. But this troubled association between surveillance and safety doesn’t just come from protective parents: it’s a long-held position of police, intelligence agencies and even politicians. It can be found in the repeated attempts toundermine end-to-end encryption, despite secure communications being essential tomanypeople’sonline safety. It’s in the moves to putfacial recognition into CCTV cameras throughout Melbourne, despite it being well documented that such technologiesdemonstrate racial biasandexacerbate harmsagainstpeople of colour. It’s in assuring students that university wifi tracking and campus cameras are for safety, thenweaponising it against them for protesting. We ought to be very critical of claims that equate surveillance with safety.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Or is it all the time and for any reason?). As always, questions of who holds power and agency are crucial.Maybe these are markers of changing notions of love and care in a time of rampant surveillance, but, as always, we ought to be careful about what we usher in as the new normal.

But achieving sovereignty of memory is far harderMon 19 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 04.11 EDTShareWe often hear that it is Russia’s inability or unwillingness to deal with the crimes of its past that has led to the restoration of tyranny and the military aggression that we see now. Such a narrative usually focuses only on internal Soviet deeds: forced collectivisation, the Great Terror of the 1930s, the Gulag system and so on. Some of these things were nominally recognised as crimes, but no attempt was made to hold the perpetrators to account. Russia’s perestroika democrats were generally opposed to transitional justice.However, the most politically sensitive Soviet crime is nearly always left out of the discussion. And Russia’s failure to address this particular crime is far more dangerous and affects the fate of many nations.That crime is the Soviet occupation of central and easternEurope, which lasted for decades and resulted in many dead and arrested, the destruction of social and cultural life and the denial of freedom. The injustice was immense.Internal Soviet crimes, which went unpunished, were at least legally acknowledged and their victims commemorated. External aggression and occupation were not. Аnd even Russian dissidents and liberals never risked raising the issue.This is why, in relation to central and eastern Europe, there are two concepts of memory and history that normally cannot coexist, that clash with and contradict each other. They are totally opposed; they cannot be reconciled by diplomacy: Soviet liberationversus Soviet occupation.It was only when Soviet troops finally withdrew from eastern and central Europe 45 years after the end of the second world war that the true liberation came, when the Soviet Union collapsed and occupied nations found their way to independence. But it was easier to restore or establish statehood and independence than to achieve sovereignty of historical memory.The progressive image of theSoviet Union in its final days, the high hopes of the moment, shielded Moscow from serious criticism and accusations related to the occupation of eastern Europe. This restraint was the result of a surfeit of trust or, maybe, just cautionary pragmatism – the desire not to irritate Moscow and undermine its goodwill, not to burden the losers of the cold war too much. But the most important protection Moscow enjoyed was, of course, based on the status of having been victorious over nazism.Russia, as the self-proclaimed successor state to the USSR, has built its international political profile on the Soviet liberation myth, which provides moral capital and prescribes to the former occupied territories a debt of gratitude for their “liberation” from nazism.Yes, the Soviet losses were real. And yet it is truly tragic that these losses helped to subjugate nations longing for freedom, replacing one dictatorship with another. The Soviet soldier, memorialised in statues that still mark the landscape of Europe from Berlin to Sofia, was not a liberator. He was an enslaver. And no amount of bloodshed by the Soviets to defeat the Nazis can excuse the Soviets’ own role as occupiers.View image in fullscreenThe signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact in Moscow, 23 August 1939.Photograph: Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesIt is not accidental that the Soviets were reluctant to recognise even the existence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. In modern Russia, to make any equivalence between the roles of the USSR and the Nazis is criminalised. In 1939 and 1940, the Soviet Union occupiedLithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and parts of Poland, Finland and Romania. For 22 months it was a faithful ally of Nazi Germany. This first wave of Soviet occupations can in no way be disguised as a “struggle against nazism”: it revealed the real intention of the Soviets. What then followed, was, in fact, a geographically extended reoccupation. This was a separate aim of the war, not necessarily connected to the one to defeat the Nazis.Unfortunately, understanding the Soviet occupation as a crime has not become an essential part of modern European history. It is geographically limited to the east, blurred, insufficiently represented; it forms part of the histories of individual nations but it does not form a powerful international narrative shared across the continent. Yet this understanding has a profound bearing on modern European life and is key to European security. Only when you fully grasp the cruelty and consequences of the Soviet occupation can you comprehend the concerns of Russia’s closest neighbours, their historically grounded fears and their need for safety.Eastern regions of Ukraine are now occupied by Russian troops. For the first time since 1989, large areas of the European continent, home to millions of people, are under the control of an invading state. But it seems that too many Europeans have already forgotten what occupation means.Russian citizenship is being forcibly imposed. In fact, this is a mass expulsion programme, because those who do not agree will be treated as foreigners and forced to leave. Russia is pursuing the same path as the USSR did, for example, in relation to the Baltic states, aiming to Russifythe conquered region, rearrange its national composition and make it a part of its state.Property is being confiscated and redistributed. “Settlers” are brought in to form the backbone of the occupation regime. The politics of memory are reversed, monuments marking Soviet crimes disappear, streets are given back their Soviet names as a symbol of Russian domination. All this is part of an attack on national identity, an attempt to erase it.The Russian state security services use filtration techniques extensively, and anyone deemed politically unreliable can be imprisoned. Severe torture and sexualised violence are widespread. Ukrainian prisoners of war released from captivity report the sametorture, abuse and deliberate malnutritionaimed at breaking them physically and mentally.Anyone who knows the history behind the iron curtain immediately recognises the pattern. All this was a grim reality for Poland and Lithuania, East Germany and Romania and others. Mass deportations, the brutal rule of the secret police, deprivation of property and civil rights … but it never became a real stigma for the USSR or, later, Russia. It never became something of which a nation is ashamed, something that demands justice and punishment, acknowledgment and atonement.And this is where weare now: the occupier is back. And the occupier wages war exactly like the Soviets did.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin at a military parade on Victory Day in Moscow, 9 May 2025. The event is held annually to celebrate the Soviet Union’s defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.Photograph: Gavriil Grigorov/ReutersVladimir Putin’s army has a gruesome advantage over western armies, which have invested heavily in keeping their personnel out of harm’s way. It can sustain losses that would be absolutely unacceptable for any western country. But it is also technically advanced enough to counter western military technologies.Western science was the first to “dronise” warfare, to minimise the involvement of troops on the ground and use machines for new tasks. Putin’s army, while also using real drones, dronises human beings as well. It has turned soldiers into dispensable, single-use units.With Russia’s full-scale invasion we have entered the era of global moral climate change. Just as one earthquake can have repercussions all over the world, or a single volcanic eruption can pollute the skies above several continents, Russia’s aggression changes the political climate worldwide.This is another very real, but not yet fully recognised, outcome of the war. It is perhaps the most wide-ranging of all the outcomes. With thousands of troops sent into battle and killed by Ukrainians defending themselves, Putin doesn’t just get some pieces of Ukrainian territory – he erodes the political landscape worldwide, upsets alliances, exhausts the patience of voters in Nato countries and drags us down into the hell of moral relativism.What can be done about it?Western and south-western Europe, which never faced the reality of Soviet occupation, must now listen to the voices of those who experienced it first-hand.It is hard to say whether Russia will be held accountable for its crimes against Ukraine any time soon. But to build a future at all, a real future, it will be paramount to develop a cultural and historical concept countering Russia’s attempt to divide and rule.On the initiative of Václav Havel, Joachim Gauck and other prominent former dissidents, 23 August, the date of the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, is the EU’s Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism andNazism, or Black Ribbon Day. Understanding of the significance of this day could and should be deepened to include a broader perspective on Russian imperialism, which was part of Soviet communist policy but has outlived it.We need to make this day the focus of a long-term and coordinated politics of remembrance, to strengthen existing institutions such as ENRS – theEuropean Network Remembrance and Solidarity, which includes mostly eastern European countries. We must also build new ones, across continents, countering both leftwing and rightwing narratives that continue to make excuses for Russia.The USSR collapsed because its artificial unity was enforced by violence and oppression. The EU’s endurance depends on the persistence of its voluntary unity. But unity is not a given.

In several key areas, the agreement announced in London on Monday is really a commitment to have more meetings at which negotiators will try to make more agreements.On the issue ofvisas for young peopleand the UK’s mooted return to the Erasmus university-exchange scheme, there is little clarity beyond the rebranding of “youth mobility” as “experience”. A decision on the level of fees that European students must pay has also been booted forward. So have some details of how the UK will work with the bloc on policing and security, including the use of controversial facial-recognition technology in tackling drug and people smuggling across borders.Increased cooperation on defence is significant and timely, given the ramping up of geopolitical instability under Donald Trump – although British arms businesses will have to go on pushing for access to the EU’s £150bn fund. Onfood and fishing, terms have been decided. Fewer checks on exports, including meat, will benefit UK food producers, particularly the smaller ones that were worst affected by Brexit. For Europeans, mainly the French, the big win is a 12-year agreement on fishing in British waters.The 41% of UK goods exported to the EU, worth £358bn, aremore than is sent to the US and India combined– making this by far the most important of this month’s trade deals. Though the UK remains outside the customs union, and regulations governing other goods including medicines have not been relaxed, the new measures mark a significant easing of trade.By contrast, the new dispensation for UK travellers to join European passport queues, and looser rules about pets, are more about style than substance. But while conveniences like these will not bring theeconomic benefitsthat Sir Keir seeks, they do send a signal. For ministers, any hint of an interest in rejoining the EU remains taboo. Instead, this modest scaling back of Tory-erected barriers is designed to show voters that his is a rational and responsible government that puts the interests of British businesses and consumers first.It should not have taken nine years since the referendum to reach this point. A group of around 60 Labour MPs is rightly pushing for the government to be more ambitious, emboldened by polling showing thatmost voters now think Brexit was a mistake. Free movement, however, remains a red line, and one inked in all the more vividly after the strong showing of Reform UK in recent local elections and national polls. Given the weakness of the economy, Sir Keir may yet come to rue his decision to capitulate to anti-immigration sentiment, rather than counter it.Among disappointing omissions is the lack of a mechanism to maketouring by musiciansand other artists easier. But after the damaging rhetoric surrounding last week’s immigration announcement, Sir Keir’s upbeat tone was a step forward, even though he overstated the actual gains.Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, was more accurate when she spoke of this week’s deal as “framing” an improved future relationship. If Sir Keir wants to effectively unpick the damage done to the country since Brexit, he will have to paint a picture of why an outward-looking, interconnected UK is more likely to succeed.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now a gorgeous new book is celebrating these ‘museum-worthy’ imagesJim FarberMon 19 May 2025 10.32 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 12.45 EDTShareIn the late 1950s, when photography critic Vince Aletti was in his mid-teens, he stumbled upon a clutch of magazines at a local newsstand that seemed to speak directly to him. From their covers to the pages inside, the pocket-sized magazines were packed with strikingly composed images of nearly naked, finely muscled men, many of whom appeared to have a secret rapport with each other. “I remember getting really turned on by that,” Aletti recalls, sitting in his apartment in New York’s East Village. “I also remember being really worried that my mother might find those magazines in my room.”Physique magazines, as such publications were generically known, operated on a coded system, designed to function as smoke signals for gay men during an era of heightened repression and censorship that lasted from the 1930s until the early 70s. The magazines, which were pumped out in cities across the US, made sure to pass as health and fitness publications, but the style and content of their photos were clearly created for the tastes and desires of gay men. In the decades since, physique images have often been written off as campy relics of a sad past, but Aletti wants audiences to consider them anew.View image in fullscreenThe models’ poses were frequently architectural.Photograph: Courtesy of Don Whitman (Western Photography Guild), SPBH Editions, and MACK.In his gorgeous new book, titled Physique, Aletti makes the case for such images to be seen not as mere historical documents or what he calls “porn-adjacent” ephemera, but as museum-worthy art. “The pictures are beautifully made,” he says, “and the photographers clearly took pride in what they did. The poses are artfully handled and the lighting and setting they used referred back to classic ways of looking at the nude. If these pictures had been flimsy or ill-made, I never would have kept collecting them.”In fact, he has collected more than 10,000 such works over five decades. Throughout Aletti’s sprawling apartment, the photos are stacked up in towers that ascend like stalagmites from the furniture and floor. Lining the walls are photos by well-respected photographers such as Peter Hujar, Nan Goldin and Larry Clark. Aletti – who has served as a photography critic for the New Yorker, curated photo exhibits and published several other art books – wants readers to notice the care taken in works by physique image-makers such as Bruce Bellas, who worked under the pseudonym “Bruce of Los Angeles”, or Alonzo Hanagan, AKA “Lon of New York”.View image in fullscreenCollector … Vince Aletti.Photograph: Matt Borkowski/BFA.com/ShutterstockTo help evade the ever-probing attentions of the censors, these artists often modelled their work on well-established images from ancient Greece or Rome, replete with Doric columns, phallic swords and warrior poses, all of which only intensified their homoerotic allure. The models’ poses were frequently architectural, with arms outstretched like load-bearing beams and legs planted as sturdy as Parthenon pedestals. The compositions are finely balanced and well-framed, while the lighting in the earlier work echoes the voluptuous glamour of classic Hollywood portraits by George Hurrell or Clarence Sinclair Bull.Perhaps the earliest antecedent of the physique photographers wasWilhelm von Gloeden, whose sepia-toned images of young Sicilian men from Taormina date back to the 1870s. Born to an aristocratic family near Weimar Germany, Von Gloeden escaped to the Italian island to cure his tuberculosis but, once there, found a wealth of beautiful young men who agreed to display their physiques for his camera. Many of his photos place the men in the landscape so seamlessly they seem to have sprung primordially from the earth.One of the most prolific and successful of the later physique artists,Bob Mizer, ran the Athletic Model Guild (AMG) for more than four decades, starting in 1945. In his prime, Mizer worked out of four properties near downtown Los Angeles where he created hundreds of thousands of homoerotic images, films and videotapes while also publishing one of the form’s most popular titles, Physique Pictorial.“I used to swipe magazines from a newsstand in Hollywood,” says John Sonsini, who worked with Mizer at AMG. “God forbid I should ever be caught!” Sonsini, an artist and lecturer, takes me on a tour of the area where Mizer created his works. We stop by a former movie theatre that used to play his films for gay audiences. The complex includes a pool for faux athletic adventures.View image in fullscreenOther images were more focused on everyday scenarios.Photograph: Courtesy of Bruce Bellas (Bruce of Los Angeles), SPBH Editions, and MACK.As exciting as the images were to Sonsini, he was equally struck by the fact that names were assigned to the models: although many were likely pseudonyms, it still indicated that these were real people, a revelation in an age when closets were overwhelmingly shut tight. Readers could write to publications such as Physique Pictorial asking to buy individual images tailored to their taste. “The fact that those men were willing to put their names, addresses and phone numbers out there was incredible in the 1950s,” Sonsini says. “In that way, I believe these magazines played a role in advancing gay liberation. The magazines were a milestone that helped people out, in every sense.”By the time he reached college, Sonsini was painting male nudes, including men who had posed for AMG. That helped land him a job with AMG in 1986, painting backgrounds for the photos. “I was having the time of my life,” he says.Most of the models found their way to AMG by word of mouth among the hordes of aspiring actors and bodybuilders who have historically gravitated to Hollywood. Sonsini says the mood on the sets during the shoots was very professional – and not at all erotic. “When you work with these guys day in and day out,” he says, “that’s just not there.” The models, who were overwhelmingly straight, knew that the readers of the magazines were gay, and were, says Sonsini, largely cool with it. “A lot of these men were kind of bohemian people. Bodybuilders in those days were not part of the athletic mainstream. They were very marginalised. Many were very attuned to the theatrical world.”View image in fullscreenFull-frontal nudity was banned.Photograph: Courtesy of Chuck Renslow (Kris), SPBH Editions, and MACK.One of the best-known models to appear in physique publications was Joe Dallesandro, the Warhol superstar famously mentioned inLou Reed’s Walk on the Wild Side(“Little Joe never once gave it away”). Dallesandro was the subject of a film Mizer made in 1966, and Sonsini speculates that some of the models may have hustled gay men for sex on the side. He was warned by Mizer not to solicit them or to be alone with any of two of them in a room at the same time. As the 1980s wore on, drugs had a devastating effect on the scene, as did Aids.They had a clear impact on gay visual artists, from Francis Bacon to Robert MapplethorpeDuring shoots, the photographers had to be careful about which parts of the models they showed. “The penis is always a problem, at least in the modern world,” Aletti says. Even so, physique photographers were creating full-frontal nude portraits as far back as the 1930s at the request of individual clients. In print, meanwhile, the photographers had to get creative about hiding “the candy”, sometimes with objects such as a coiled snake, fishing nets or washing-up cloths.Banning full-frontal nudity also meant that the photographers sometimes concentrated more squarely on the butt, although at times, says Sonsini, the censors were less alarmed by which body part was shown than by the expression on a model’s face. “A smile,” he says, “would drive the censors crazy.”Many of the photographers faced harassment, fines or jail time. In 1947,according tothe Bob Mizer Foundation, Mizer spent a year at a work camp in California after being “wrongly accused of having sex with a model who was a minor, among other charges”. Although Sonsini says Mizer didn’t consider himself a political person, he believes his work had a hand in liberating the minds and bodies of gay people, aided by editorials he wrote in his magazine damning the forces that tried to shut him down. “Mizer was very courageous in a lot of ways,” Aletti says.Beefcakes and monkeys: Bob Mizer’s muscle men – in picturesRead moreBy the start of the mass gay movement at the dawn of the 1970s, hardcore gay porn began to proliferate, making the old physique portraits seem coy and dated. But at the same time, the early physique works had a clear impact on gay visual artists, evident in the work of Francis Bacon in the 1950s and 60s, as well as photographers of the 70s and 80s from Robert Mapplethorpe to Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Weber’s photos most brazenly mimicked the faux battle poses and homoerotic camaraderie that defined so many classic physique layouts.Over the years, there have been many books and collections devoted to vintage physique photos, but Aletti’s book stands out by pushing the formal composition of the works over their more basic function. “It’s clear when you look at the way the works are lit and designed that the photographers weren’t just making pictures to turn people on,” he says. “They were making something beautiful.”Physique by Vince Alettiis published by SPBH EditionsExplore more on these topicsPhotographyMagazinesLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We came from an art school background and we were thinking visually. Even at that stage, there were two film-makers waiting to come out.We made a short video to promote our single An Englishman in New York, and thought the medium was brilliant. After we made theFade to Greyvideo for Steve Strange’s Visage, people like Duran Duran and Herbie Hancock asked us to make videos for them.We were in New York editing a Police concert film when we met Trevor Horn in the hotel bar, and we decided to make some music together. We had this idea for a song called Hit the Box based on channel-hopping in the US but realised it wouldn’t work in the UK because there were only three channels. Then we remembered a song we’d started to write 15 years previously. All we had was the first verse – “You don’t know how to ease my pain” – but Trevor liked it.We had always produced ourselves, but Trevor and his crack team were revolutionising the way records were being made. We laid down a 20-second backing track and a guide vocal and were told to go and play table tennis while their machinery ingested it. When we came back they’d created this lovely bed of sound. Lol added some delicious chords and I was told to “Just sing something” to fill four minutes. The lyrics were stream of consciousness, but we knew we had something special.We wanted Torvill and Dean to skate in the video! But their diaries didn’t match. So we picked loads of faces from a casting book and filmed them all singing Cry. Some said they could lip-sync but couldn’t, but it all looked great in 35mm black and white. This was before morphing, so we used these things called “wipes” which meant one face could dissolve into another. A man might turn into a woman or a punk into an old person, creating an entity that didn’t exist before. It felt magical. Of course, Lol and my faces are in it. Our “plan B” ended up becoming one of the most talked about videos of the 1980s. Years later Elbow asked me to recreate the Cry video for their songGentle Storm. Guy Garvey said that when he was a kid it had been a “seismic event”.Trevor Horn, producerI was in New York trying to produce Foreigner when Thereza Bazar from Dollar rang to tell me she was hanging out with Godley & Creme in the bar at the Meridien, and asked if I’d like to come over. Someone in the Foreigner crew had been trying to turn me on to ZZ Top by making me smoke this really strong weed called “Thunderfuck”, so I was pretty spaced out. Kevin and Lol said: “Don’t worry, so are we.”We started hanging out and one night I started to manipulate the dial on the hotel room TV rhythmically, like scratching, which was the beginnings of Hit the Box. I had the studio set up for Foreigner so that weekend we used it to record that Godley & Creme track. But on the Monday morning Foreigner said: “We heard you came in at the weekend and we heard what you did. It’s fucking awful.” They were so angry with me that I suggested to Kevin and Lol that we put the project to one side and reconvene in England.By then I’d done loads of 12-inch singles and was getting sick of abstract electronic stuff so I asked them: “Haven’t you just got a nice song?” They found this very funny – “A ‘nice song’?!” Kevin and Lol were like a comedy duo in those days, but they got a guitar and played me Cry.We were in Surrey Sound Studios with Nigel Gray, a brilliant engineer/producer who made Andy Summers’s guitar sound so good on the Police records. Nigel got Lol a great guitar sound. Kevin always had a beautiful voice. JJ Jeczalik from the Art of Noise did the rhythm track and Steve Lipson engineered it. We used Fairlight and Synclavier synths.It was all done very quickly and I thought it came out well. Once you saw the video you couldn’t hear the song without imagining it.In 2017 my band played Cry live at Fairport’s Cropredy festival, with a guy called Jamie Squire singing. I just thought: “God, this track sounds really great.” It’s been in our setlist ever since.The 11CD box set Parts of the Process – The Complete Godley & Creme is out now on Demon/Edsel.

We are in a kind of alternative present or recent past; some of the film appears to take place before France adopted the euro in 2002, or perhaps in this imagined world, the euro didn’t happen.Thirteen-year-old Alpha (Boros), from a Moroccan-French family, royally freaks out her mother (Golshifteh Farahani) one evening by coming back from a party with the letter A tattooed on her arm. (This incidentally indicates a kind of badass rebellious attitude that she never really displays again.) With a dirty needle? A shared needle?Her mother, a doctor, is beside herself because her hospital is now overwhelmed with infection cases of a bizarre new disease, which turns the sufferer into a marble-white statue. However, despite the near-riot developing outside the hospital, Ducournau doesn’t show any restrictive hygiene practices and appears to suggest that society ultimately pretty much copes with the white-marble disease, with unstressed doctors and nurses in the same hospital smilingly dealing with a row of patients.This fictional situation could therefore be said to gesture at Aids or Covid, although it is not particularly compelling or scary either on its own literal terms or as metaphor. It could relate to respectable society’s horror of drug addicts – who include Alpha’s emaciated smackhead brother Amin (Tahar Ramin) whom Alpha’s mom once very rashly allowed to babysit the five-year-old Alpha in some scuzzy rented room while patently out of it – he is evidently intended to be some sort of magically sacrificial figure.As for Alpha, her tattoo, and her leaking bandage, earn her some bullying ostracism from the class, who are themselves angrily preoccupied with the disease, and the various infections of misogyny and homophobia are arguably also being satirised.But the madly, bafflingly overwrought and humourless storytelling can’t overcome the fact that everything here is frankly unpersuasive and tedious. Every line, every scene, has the emoting dial turned up to 11 and yet feels redundant. Ducournau surely has to find her way back to the cool precision and certainty of Raw.Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalFestivalsHorror filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is a remake (or maybe cover version) ofAkira Kurosawa’s classic downbeat noir High and Lowfrom 1963, transplanting the action from Yokohama to New York – or rather returning it there, because the original source material, Ed McBain’s novel King’s Ransom, is set in a fictional city based on the Big Apple.It’s got a terrific throb of energy and life, moving across the screen with the rangy grace of its superstarDenzel Washington– though a little of the minor-key sombreness and complex pessimism and cynicism of the first film has been lost and the modern technology of GPS (unknown in Kurosawa’s day) has indirectly left it with a very small plausibility issue.In Kurosawa’s movie, the incomparably leonine Toshiro Mifune played Gondo, the prosperous salaryman working for a shoe manufacturer who rashly mortgages the luxurious penthouse-style family apartment with its spectacular views of the city (encouraging hubris, of course) so he can he buy out a controlling interest in the firm. But just as he is about to pull off the deal of a lifetime, a kidnapper takes a boy he wrongly thinks is Gondo’s son, but is in fact the son of Gondo’s heartbreakingly loyal and submissive chauffeur Aoki played by Yutaka Sada. Does Gondo now have to use the money he’s borrowed as ransom cash to save the son of a servant?In Lee’s film the shoe executive is now gigantic music-producer legend David King, played with grinning monarchical assurance by Washington. King beamingly surveys hisNew Yorkrealm from his near-super-rich balcony as the sun rises, and Lee shows this with the inspired musical accompaniment of Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin’ from Oklahoma. His wife Pam (Ilfenesh Hadera) is a philanthropist supporting black causes, and his teen son Trey (older and cooler than Gondo’s kid) is a talented basketball player. Every square millimetre of the wall-space is covered by high-end sports-related artworks or ultra rare memorabilia (reportedly from Lee’s own collection), as well as magazine covers of David’s face, unironically pointing up his massive wealth, prestige and impeccable taste.The awful news about the reported abduction of Trey turns out of course to be a bungling mistaken-identity: the culprit has accidentally taken Trey’s best friend and David’s godson Kyle (Elijah Wright) son of David’s driver and family friend Paul (Jeffrey Wright, Elijah’s dad in real life), an ex-con who is now a Muslim convert.In the original, there was a distinct class or caste distinction between Gondo and Aoki, however well-meaning and conflicted Gondo was. This isn’t the case here: King is no snob and has a real love for Paul – but the basic dilemma is still there. Should David throw away his business plan and risk penury to save someone who isn’t family? (This great music producer rages to his imaginary heroes in his private study: “What would you do Stevie?” etc. He amusingly addresses that hypothetical question to James Brown – and perhaps James Brown’s advice on this point might not exactly provide a Hollywood ending.) Lee shrewdly injects a new note of worldliness with the police’s suspicion about the obvious possibility that Paul might himself have staged the abduction – though it is the racist white cop Detective Higgins (Dean Winters, Tina Fey’s boyfriend in TV’s 30 Rock) who has to say this out loud.In Kurosawa’s film, the paying of the ransom on the train is a classic suspense sequence; Lee for his part makes great use of a New York subway train heading out to Yankee Stadium, crammed with baseball fans chanting “Let’s go Yankees” just as they did in Lee’s 25th Hour. (I’d love to see Lee restage the baseball scene from Kurosawa’s Stray Dog.) The police have put a GPS tracker in the bag with the cash, so the kidnapper and his team of stunt-riding accomplices on motor scooters (where did he get all these people?) must have somehow switched the money out of the trackable bag and it’s not immediately clear how they did that. But who is the bad guy? Suspicion falls on the greedy, sexist (but undoubtedly kind of cool) young rapper played by A$AP Rocky. And Lee contrives a great rap-battle-style face off between him and David.This is a big, muscular picture which aspires to the crowd-pleasing athleticism of Spike Lee’s sports icons; it’s very enjoyable and there’s a great turn from Washington.Highest 2 Lowest screened at theCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmCannes film festivalSpike LeeDenzel WashingtonAkira KurosawaThrillersCrime filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

He remembers their last days together – and what truths he learned from the darkly moving filmMon 19 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 08.10 EDTShareTim Roth reclines in his chair and exudes an unexpected lightness, as if the Atlantic Ocean is casting a summer spray over this corner of Galway. He is upbeat about life, film and even acting, which he once called anightmare professionhe would not recommend to anyone.“Oh, did I say that?” he asks, surprised. “I don’t feel that way at all, actually. I must have been having a bad one, but that’s OK.” He shrugs and smiles. “I actually love it more and more at the moment.”It’s a cheering sentiment, and incongruous. As an actor and director Roth is known for plumbing human darkness, a “swallowed pain”. And we are here on a damp morning at afilm festivalon Ireland’s west coast to talk about grief, a fictional grief depicted in his latest film Poison and an all too real, brutal grief that ambushed his family soon after the cameras stopped rolling.“The film was actually dealing with something which now is very, very poignant as far as our family is concerned,” he says quietly, the accent pure London, even after decades in Hollywood. “There is no one way of grieving. People react differently – everyone does – otherwise there would be a cure for it.”View image in fullscreen‘He was unfazed’ … with son Cormac in Cannes in 2021.Photograph: Sébastien Nogier/EPAPoison, a directorial debut by Désirée Nosbusch, casts Roth andTrine Dyrholmas an estranged couple who reunite a decade after the death of their son, who must be exhumed because toxins are leaking into the cemetery. Based on aplayby the Dutch writer Lot Vekemans, it is a raw emotional duel shot almost entirely at a real Luxembourg cemetery.In October 2022, a few months after filming wrapped, Roth’s son Cormacdied at the age of 25. The guitarist and composer had been diagnosed with stage 3 germ cell cancer a year earlier. Roth had considered dropping out of the pending shoot, which was a long flight from the family home in Los Angeles, but Cormac urged him to do it. “He was unfazed by me doing the film. He thought it was a good thing. He was probably wanting to get me out of the house as well,” says Roth, with a wry smile. “It had his seal of approval, otherwise I wouldn’t have done it. If he needed me to stay close, I would have been staying close.”I don’t look right for action films – they never really crop upShooting required Roth and Dyrholm to spend extended periods in the cemetery – filming paused during funerals – but the actor remained hopeful about Cormac. “At that point we were trying to remain positive because he was still with us,” Roth recalls. The tone is matter-of-fact, the pain shielded.Poison depicts a couple torn apart by bereavement, a forensic dissection of an inability to share loss. “The film has such a truth to it because it shows that how you grieve is as individual as a fingerprint,” says Roth. “Now with my friends and family I see that everyone is doing and handling that differently and need to be respected for it.”Before filming Roth told Nosbusch his son was ill. The director had had a scare with her own son years earlier when he was diagnosed with diabetes – an experience that drew her to Vekemans’ play. She says she gave the actor time and space: “I did not go up to him every day to ask, ‘How is it?’ It was all with looks. Sometimes he needed a break and I go, ‘Sure.’”View image in fullscreenIn a Luxembourg cemetery … Roth on location with Nosbusch (left) and Dyrholm.Photograph: Hyde Park Entertainment/©Mark-de-BlokNosbusch was devastated when she learned Cormac had died. “I was heartbroken because I honestly for a moment felt like, ‘Was my movie bad luck? Did my movie become a reality?’” Roth told her he had no regrets about making the film and that in a way it helped him to face what was to come.In a statement after Cormac’s death Roth, his wife Nikki Butler and their other son Hunter said the grief “came in waves” and that they had lost a “wild and electric ball of energy”. They quoted one of Cormac’s mottoes: “Make sure you do the things you love.”Perhaps it is a comfort to Roth senior that in pursuing acting, which he fell in love with as a teenager, he has heeded the injunction. The result is a long, varied career ranging from obscure art house to blockbuster, with Roth’s passion for his craft always evident on screen.The genesis was a school musical of Dracula. “I did a bad knockoff of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. But I was hooked.” He briefly did other jobs, packing shelves at Tesco, sorting Christmas mail, phone hustles. “I was one of those guys that would ring you up and try and sell you advertising. I was awful at it.”His first break was the 1982 television playMade in Britain, which cast Roth as a racist skinhead and brought leading roles in Tom Stoppard’s 1990 Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead, Robert Altman’s 1990 biopic Vincent & Theo and as Mr Orange inQuentin Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs. The New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael described Roth’s acting as “a form of kinetic discharge”.An eclectic, non-stop career followed. “I made a conscious decision very early on … that I wanted to be an actor and not a movie person,” says the 64-year-old. Asked if he would consider a Liam Neeson-style swerve to action flicks, he almost laughs. “I don’t look right. It’s never really cropped up. I just don’t fit.” Actually he might: he is lean, with a trimmed beard, jeans and boots.View image in fullscreenFirst break … in 1982’s Made in Britain.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockRoth divides jobs into two categories. “There are the ones to pay the rent. Your agent will call and go, ‘Money job if you need one.’ And there are the ones you do for yourself.” The former has bequeathed some cringes, he concedes. “I’ve done some atrocious work.” Roth declines to supply a list of shame – “No! You all know it” – but No 1, surely, was playing Sepp Blatter inUnited Passions, Fifa’s 2015 derided love-letter to itself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You have to do your best even if your heart is not in it. Sometimes, when you’re doing a bad film, those are the best experiences.”Some big budget fare he recalls with affection. He says he played Abomination in The Incredible Hulk – a villain he reprised in Disney’s TV series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law – to embarrass his children, who were then at school. Other lavish productions included Tim Burton’s Planet of the Apes and Sky Atlantic’s crime dramaTin Star.To not taint the memory of a shoot Roth does not watch his own films or read reviews. “Youkeep them in your head and the battering they take down the line is a separate issue. Maybe it’s just protection.” That applies even to films that are well received, though he made exceptions to watch Tarantino’sThe Hateful Eightand Michel Franco’s dramaChronicabout an end-of-life care nurse.Having directed The War Zone – a harrowing drama of incest and sexual violence that drew on hisown abuse as a boy– Roth is sympathetic to first-time directors. “I love watching them figure it out on set as they’re going along. It takes a long time to get to that position, quite often, and hard graft. Then they get their day.”Poison fits that profile. Nosbusch, an actor and former Eurovision presenter, spent a decade wrangling funding and talent. “It’s two people talking in a cemetery. It took a lot of convincing,” she says.View image in fullscreenMr Orange … Roth, third from right, in Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs.Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/Rank Film/AllstarThe next time I speak to Roth is over Zoom from New York, where he is making a “comedyish” film set on Staten Island in the run-up to theJanuary 6 Capitol attack. I wonder what he thinks of the growing anxiety over far-right populism.“Trump? I think he’s doing incredibly well,” says Roth. There is a pause, then he cracks a wry smile. “It’s thoroughly depressing and heartbreaking. It feels like he is the guy that opens the door for the real dangers … so even when he’s gone, I worry about what will be left behind. It is quite scary.” Roth has had no problem entering or leaving the US, where he lives, but he worries about friends. “I’m in pretty good shape, I’m a white Londoner. That’s just the fact of it.” But he has friends “who are in danger”, he says, without elaborating.He is puzzled by Trump’s announcement oftariffs on foreign films, ostensibly to boost production in Hollywood. “None of us quite understand it. I don’t think he does. Until something actually happens we don’t know how to react.”Roth is delighted the Tories no longer rule his homeland – “a very good thing for humanity” – but sounds underwhelmed at the Labour government’s record so far. He worries thatNigel Faragewill gain momentum. “I like calling him Farridge,” says Roth, rhyming the name with cabbage. “I don’t like calling him anything, actually.”Roth’s home in Pasadena, north-east of LA, narrowly escaped thewildfires. “They were up in the mountain just above us. Trees were flying; we were very lucky that they didn’t fly into the house.”Despite the perils of politics and nature, and the occasional fantasy of moving to Europe, Roth has no plans to leave. “We went there because the schools were good. That was it. That’s the only reason we moved out there and I love it. It’s where my kids grew up. It has incredible history for me.” Left unsaid, in the silence that follows, is the grief etched in that history.Poison is on Sky Cinema on 18 MayExplore more on these topicsTim RothfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Please do not read unless you have seen episodes one to six.Back in early 2023 The Last of Us launched toadmiring reviewsand millions of viewers around the world. When it wasquickly renewed for a second seasonthere was speculation about how showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann would approach the task. Would they skip straight to adaptingthe second (and so far final) video game, which picks up the action five years after the original? Or would they take a more scenic route, inventing new post-apocalyptic adventures for surrogate father-daughter duo Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) to have during that considerable time gap? It would certainly be an easy way to eke another lucrative season or three out of the source material.View image in fullscreenMore time together … Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and Joel (Pedro Pascal) in The Last of Us.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved.In the end, Mazin and Druckmann chose to remain faithful to the video game byjumping five years aheadandbrutally killing off Joelin the early running. But tonight’s extended flashback episode shaded in some details of what happened in the interim. Like a stone skipping over a gorgeous Wyoming lake, it jumped ahead a year at a time (rather like the recent final season ofAndor) to track the ebb and flow of Joel and Ellie’s relationship as she matured from rebellious young teen to even more rebellious older teen.For those who had been keenly feeling the absence of Joel, an hour in the company of Pascal as he tried to whittle down some of his character’s more anguished edges felt like a thoughtful, handcrafted gift. There was also an all-too-brief but memorable appearance from Joe Pantoliano. But first there was the surprise of seeing Joel himself as a scowling, defiant teen.Meet Mr MillerAn opening flashback to Austin, Texas, in 1983 sees young Joel and Tommy stressing about their father coming home. It’s obvious that Tommy has done something very naughty but Joel is determined to take the blame so that his younger brother avoids a beating. The first surprise is that Mr Miller (played by Tony Dalton) is a cop. The second is that his approach to disciplining Joel – whom he instinctively knows is covering for his sibling – involves offering him a can of beer. As they sip their Buds, Miller Sr tells a story from his own childhood about being caught shoplifting. His vengeful father broke his jaw with one punch. He is clearly aware that raising his hands to his own sons is perpetuating a cycle of violence. But by not sending them to the hospital he thinks he is at least managing to do things “a little better than my father did”.Happy birthday(s) to EllieView image in fullscreenA Repair Shop-style miracle … Joel whittles Ellie a guitar.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved.After the credits, we are still in flashback mode but it is now two months since Joel and Ellie got back to Jackson Hole at the end of season one. Joel is preparing a surprise for Ellie’s 15th birthday, trading salvaged Legos with gruff bartender Seth (Robert John Burke) to secure a cake and some materials he needs to restore an acoustic guitar. But his Repair Shop-style woodworking reverie is interrupted by Tommy (Gabriel Luna) rushing an injured Ellie back to the house.While working in the settlement’s kitchen she badly burned her forearm on a cooking pot. It’s obvious Ellie did this deliberately to obscure the suspicious bite mark on her arm. The injury does not put a dampener on her birthday celebration the next morning, but it does mean she cannot actually strum the acoustic guitar that Joel has given her. He allows himself to be cajoled into performing a rough cover of Pearl Jam’sFuture Days. It earns him some uncharacteristically high praise from Ellie: “Well … that didn’t suck.”Space explorationView image in fullscreenSuch joy … Joel takes Ellie on a space mission for her 16th birthday.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved.One year later, Joel and Ellie are on a ramble to mark her 16th birthday. Perhaps inspired by being out in nature, Joel attempts to broach the subject of the birds and the bees, which goes about as well as you might imagine. (“You mean dicks and vaginas?” is the response.) But while Ellie has had to grow up fast, Joel seems obsessed with carving out space for some happy childhood experiences. He has planned this trip to a ruined Wyoming museum so Ellie can see an actual Apollo space capsule and, at least for a moment, imagine what it might be like to leave their compromised world behind. Her joy is palpable.Another year later, things aren’t going quite as smoothly. Joel’s attempt to surprise Ellie with a 17th birthday cake sees him awkwardly gatecrashing a date that ticks off every fear in an overprotective parent’s nightmare: sexual experimentation, drug use and getting a tattoo. Joel even finds himself reaching for a hoary old mantra that will probably outlast any apocalypse: “This is my house, and when you’re under my roof …” But after a quick consultation with town shrink Gail (Catherine O’Hara) Joel seems to see the sense in giving Ellie her own space by letting her move into the garage. He even has some complimentary words about her new moth tattoo.A tough break for EugeneView image in fullscreenMoth arm … Joel compliments Ellie’s new tattoo.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved.This time the jump ahead is two years, to Ellie’s 19th birthday, and by now she and her Nirvana posters are fully installed in the garage. We eavesdrop as she rehearses asking Joel some awkward questions about what really happened in Salt Lake City. Five years on, she has begun to realise his story about how they escaped does not stand up to scrutiny. She is interrupted by Joel, who is belatedly granting her desperate wish to go out on patrol. It will turn out to be a baptism of fire.An emergency call over the radio sends Joel and Ellie racing to protect another patrol from an infected attack. It is too late for poor Adam but they see a confused Eugene (Joe Pantoliano), who reveals that he has been bitten. All he wants to do is get back to the outskirts of Jackson before he turns so he can say goodbye to his wife, Gail. Under pressure from Ellie, Joel agrees to help. But after he sends Ellie to retrieve their horses it seems that his plan all along was to escort the doomed Eugene to the shore of a peaceful lake and shoot him there.As the pair ride back to the settlement, dragging Eugene’s body, Joel impresses on Ellie that he intends to tell Gail “what she needs to know and nothing more”. She now has stomach-churning confirmation that Joel will flat-out lie if he thinks it serves a greater good. But when faced with Gail’s grief Ellie refuses to let Joel sugarcoat what happened and tells everyone the truth: Joel shot him in the head.‘I’ll pay the price …’There is one final time jump, to nine months later and the New Year’s Eve shindig fromthe opening episode. We see the dancefloor confrontation between homophobic Seth and the canoodling Ellie and Dina from Joel’s point of view as he unwisely wades in. But we also see more of the aftermath, as he and Ellie have a bruising heart-to-heart on their porch. She gives him “one last chance” to tell the truth about what happened in Salt Lake City, but it is so traumamatic that Joel cannot even speak. All he can do is shake his head or nod as Ellie works through her questions and finally gets truthful answers. This is the point where their relationship could shatter for ever. But there is still room to end on an unlikely glimmer of hope. “I don’t think I can forgive you for this,” says Ellie. “But I would like to try.” Is it uplifting to know that our heroes could have rebuilt their relationship? Or is it even more heartbreaking to hear with the foreknowledge that Joel is fated to die the very next day?Notes and observationsIf Dalton and his moustache looked familiar, he has appeared in Disney+ Marvel showsHawkeyeandDaredevil: Born Againas New York socialite Jack Duquesne, AKA dashing vigilante Swordsman. Dalton will also star in forthcoming PlayStation 5 gameIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophetfrom The Last of Us creators Naughty Dog.Yes, Pearl Jam didn’t release the songFuture Daysuntil 2013, which makes it a little weird to hear Joel covering it when the world-wrecking outbreak took place back a decade earlier. Maybe 2003 megahitBring Me to Life by Evanescencewould have been more fitting?The actualApollo 15command module is on display at theNational Museum of the United States Air Forcein Dayton, Ohio rather than an overgrown museum in Wyoming.Next week: it’s back to Seattle forthe season finale, which seems to have come up very fast.

Photograph: Derek ShaptonAhead of the author’s much anticipated memoir, we count down the best of her books – from climate dystopias to her world-conquering handmaidsByLisa AllardiceMon 19 May 2025 07.01 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 10.50 EDTShareView image in fullscreen10The Testaments(2019)After more than 30 years, Atwood caved to pleas to write a sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale. Not since Harry Potter had a publication caused such asensation: computers were hacked in search of the manuscript and advance copies were kept under lock and key. With classic Atwood timing, the novel coincided with the phenomenal success of theTV adaptationof the original – not to mention the arrival of Trump at the White House. The Testaments won Atwood her second Booker prize, shared (controversially) with Bernardine Evaristo’sGirl, Woman, Other.View image in fullscreen9Oryx and Crake(2003)A world ravaged by a deadly global pandemic? Atwood got there first in her dystopian MaddAddam trilogy, which also includes The Year of the Flood (2009) andMaddAddam(2013). We meet Snowman, apparently the lone human survivor, along with genetically engineered smart pigs (pigoons) and the humanoid Crakers (untroubled by sexual desire and sunburn). Globalisation, rogue science and big tech are all targets for Atwood’s satire.ReviewingThe Year of the Flood in 2009, the late Ursula K Le Guin took her friend to task for resisting the label of science fiction. Atwood’s many sci-fi fans may be cross it’s not higher on this list. Atwood herself described it as “a fun-filled, joke-packed, adventure story on the end of the human race”.View image in fullscreen8Hag-Seed(2016)Afteragreeingto rewrite The Tempest for Shakespeare’s 400th anniversary, Atwood reread the original three times and then again, backwards. Betrayal, revenge, grief, freedom and creativity: you can see why this is the play she picked. Prospero’s island becomes a prison in Canada in 2013, with Felix, the wronged artistic director of a theatre festival, mourning his daughter Miranda. “So many contradictions to Prospero! Entitled aristocrat, modest hermit? Wise old mage, revengeful old poop?” Felix reflects.Atwood puts her own inimitable spin on the play.7The Edible Woman(1969)Atwood’s first published novel, a satire on consumerism and misogyny, was written when she was 24, the dark result of “speculating for some time about symbolic cannibalism”, as you do. Atwood later insisted the novel was “proto-feminist”, because “there was no women’s movement in sight” when she wrote it in 1965. Thus began her unofficial role as feminist figurehead and soothsayer. Here we see her sharpening her teeth.View image in fullscreen6The Blind Assassin(2000)“Ten days after the war ended, my sister Laura drove a car off a bridge.” So opens Atwood’s epic novel, told by 82-year-old Iris Chase. The book’s key object is a steamer trunk, a fitting metaphor as Atwood throws everything into this story-within-a-story-within-a-story: the social and political upheavals of 20th -century Canadian history; a host of narrative tricks (flashbacks, multiple time schemes); and a mix of genres including sci-fi, whodunnit and romance. According to the New Yorker’s Michiko Kakutani, of all Atwood’s novels, The Blind Assassin“is most purely a work of entertainment”. It won her the Booker prize for the first time.View image in fullscreen5Paper Boat: New and Selected Poems 1961-2023Atwood became a writer when a poem suddenly came to her on a school football pitch when she was 16.Paper Boatbrings together 60 years’ worth of poems from her first collection, Double Persephone (1961), to her last,Dearly, published in 2020, the year after the death of her partner of 48 years,Graeme Gibson. As the years pass, youthful questioning gives way to grief and wisdom. Atwood has called poetry “the most joyful” of literary forms, and it is here, perhaps, that you see the writer at her most gentle and unguarded. “How to keep track of the days? / Each one shining, each one alone? Each one then gone. / I’ve kept some of them in a drawer on paper, / those days fading now.”View image in fullscreen4Burning Questions: Essays 2004-2021(2022)The environment, democracy, women’s rights – these are just some of the urgent issues addressed in this collection of Atwood’s essays written this century (at one point she was averaging 40 pieces a year). Here you will find tips on how to be a writer (look after your back) and how to escape a crocodile (zigzag), alongside celebrations of authors and the musicianLaurie Anderson. Atwood is interested in everything: from the sex lives of snails to the future of the planet, nothing is too small or vast. Many of these essays were lectures, but you never feel you are being lectured. No one combines intellect, straight-talking and silliness like Atwood – sometimes all in the same sentence. Her motto: “Tell. The. Truth.”View image in fullscreen3Alias Grace(1996)In 1843 Toronto, Grace Marks, an Irish Canadian scullery maid, was convicted for the double murders of her employer and his mistress. This notorious case was the inspiration for the Booker-shortlisted Alias Grace. Temptress or victim? Power, truth and the slipperiness of history, some of Atwood’s favourite themes are here. The question of believing a woman’s story assumed a heightened resonance with the2017 TV adaptation, which landed in the midst of the #MeToo revelations. Hilary ManteldescribedAlias Grace as “impressive at a horribly deep level” – you can’t argue with that.View image in fullscreen2Cat’s Eye(1988)“Little girls are not made of sugar and spice and everything nice,” Atwood said ofCat’s Eye. She is the least autobiographical of novelists, but Cat’s Eye draws on her shock at leaving the Canadian outback, where she roamed wild with her elder brother, to attend school for the first time in Toronto. The narrator Elaine is thrown into “a whole world of girls and their doings”, with schoolmate Cordelia the original mean girl. Cat’s Eye captures the byzantine hierarchies and covert cruelties of schoolgirl politics, usually overlooked by literature. Wolf Hall for prepubescent girls. Heartbreaking and terrifying.View image in fullscreen1The Handmaid’s Tale(1985)Atwood’s feminist dystopia has entered the popular imagination as well as the canon. Even if you’ve never read the novel or seen the TV series, you will know that it imagines America in the grip of a theocracy where women are enslaved for their fertility. Atwood wrote the novel in Berlin in 1984 – of course she did – in response to the regressive US Reagan government, but not even she could have predicted its second life post-Trump. Famously, she didn’t include anything that hadn’t happened somewhere in the world already. “If I was to create an imaginary garden, I wanted the toads in it to be real,” shewrote. Today, the pond is even murkier and the toads are bigger and uglier. All together now: “Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.”To explore any of the books featured, visitguardianbookshop.com.

This, we’re told, is it. This is the last time thatTom Cruisewill leap out of various modes of high-speed transport in pursuit of some nebulously defined MacGuffin. The last time he’ll grit his teeth and run across a major global landmark. The last time he’ll give Simon Pegg work. This is it.Except, not to spoil anything, but it probably isn’t. After years of avoiding the press and letting his work do the talking, Tom Cruise is actively promoting Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning. He’s doing junkets. He’s giving red-carpet interviews. He’s giving talks at the BFI. For those of us who enjoy Tom Cruise, this is a rare gift. But over the course of these appearances, a message has started to form. That message is: Tom Cruise is never, ever going to stop.At the#MissionImpossible—The Final Reckoning premiere, Tom Cruise reveals he will keep making movies into his 100spic.twitter.com/dZdzfEKnAf— The Hollywood Reporter (@THR)May 18, 2025A case in point. At the New York premiere on Sunday night, Cruise repeated something he’s mentioned over and over during the course of the film’s promotion. A Hollywood Reporter interviewer mentioned that, just two years ago, Cruise had said that he wanted to make Mission: Impossible films when he was in his 80s. Cruise then corrected the interviewer. “I actually said I’m going to make movies into my 80s; actually, I’m going to make them into my 100s,” he said. “I will never stop. I will never stop doing action, I will never stop doing drama, comedy films – I’m excited.”For reference, Tom Cruise will turn 63 in six weeks. This means that he won’t turn 100 until the summer of 2062. If he sticks to his plan – and he seems very much like someone who sticks to his plans – then we have another 37 years of Tom Cruise films ahead of us. In other words, we exist at a point in time that is closer to the theatrical release of Born on the Fourth of July than it is to the end of his career.What glories must await us before then. First, Cruise will make a renewed bid for the world to see him as an actor and not just a crash-test dummy bystarring in the new Alejandro G Iñárritu film. Then there are all the sequels he wants to make: another Top Gun, another Days of Thunder, with any luck anotherEdge of Tomorrow. He’s talked about doing musicals. At one point he was literally going to film in space, and you have to imagine that this wouldn’t be a project he’d be keen to drop. In all honesty there will probably be another Mission: Impossible before then. His dance card is full for the foreseeable.Show me the tummy! Tom Cruise doesn’t need sleep, help or clothes in Mission: ImpossibleRead moreHowever, it should be noted that several obstacles stand in his way. Notably, there is the death of cinema to navigate. Revenues are down, seats are going unfilled and nobody can predict what will or won’t be a hit any more. It’s a downward spiral that Cruise has beaten once, with Top Gun: Maverick, but it should equally be noted that the Mission: Impossible film before this one was the lowest-grossing instalment in the series since 2006’s Mission: Impossible III. The Final Reckoning is said to have a whopping production budget of $400,000,000, which means it will need to make close to a billion dollars to just break even. That wouldn’t be sustainable at any point, much less when a vast chunk of the audience will just wait for it to stream.What else could stop him? Well, there’s the looming threat of the third world war, environmental collapse, the rise of AI as an industry-ending threat. The world has changed beyond belief in the last 37 years, and it is likely to have changed even more 37 years from now. But Tom Cruise isn’t someone who will give up in the face of something as trivial as existential threat. If he has to make his own movies on a phone and hand deliver them to whatever cinemas haven’t been repurposed into nuclear fallout shelters, then that is what he’ll do.Because he is Tom Cruise. If he wants to keep making films when he’s 100, he will keep making films when he’s 100. The bigger question is what he’ll do for the thousands of years after that, because let’s not kid ourselves that the man is mortal.Explore more on these topicsTom CruisecommentShareReuse this content"

They had argued the events were “damaging Brockwell Park’s ecology” – including the park’s grass as a result of large crowds and heavy equipment – as well as its “heritage and community value”.The campaign reached the high court, which examined whether Lambeth council was right to assert that the planned use of the land was lawful, given that the 37-day duration of the festivals exceeded the 28 days allowed for a temporary change of use. A judge found in favour of PBP, saying the council’s decision was “irrational”.Solicitors for the group subsequently called on Lambeth council to cancel the events, saying: “As there is no planning permission for the Brockwell Live event, the event has to be cancelled. The site now has to be made immediately available to the public and cleared of the fencing and infrastructure.”But Brockwell Live has said all the events will go ahead. “Friday’s high court ruling dealt with a particular point of law and whether an administrative process had been carried out correctly,” the company said in statement. “We wish to make it clear that no event will be cancelled as a result of the high court’s decision. We take our stewardship of Brockwell Park seriously. As we prepare to deliver these much-loved, culturally significant events, we remain fully committed to its care, upkeep, and long-term wellbeing. With setup nearly complete, we look forward to opening the gates and welcoming festival goers later this week.”Lambeth council also said the events would go ahead, stating that Summer Events Limited, the company behind Brockwell Live, “has applied to Lambeth council for a new certificate of lawfulness, for 24 days, following the high court ruling last week on the previous certificate. The council is urgently considering that application. That consideration does not stop the events proceeding.”The PBP campaign, which was supported by cultural figures such as Mark Rylance, led to considerable debate acrossLondonand the live music industry.Some sided with PBP, arguing that it was an example of the private sector being allowed to encroach on a public asset. Others argued that the festivals enriched the culture of the area as well as local businesses.After the high court judgment, Night Time Industries Association chief Michael Kill said: “The supply chain, from staging and lighting companies to local food and drink vendors, would suffer heavy financial losses,” and added that “these events are not just concerts – they are vital social experiences that form part of the cultural fabric of people’s lives”.The dispute sets up a potential battle over any events planned for 2026. Rebekah Shaman, who led the PBP campaign, has previously said: “We are hoping to come to an agreement where events can still continue, but on a much lower level and also much more connected to the community,” while a PBP statement said the group were “not anti-events” and looked forward to constructive discussion with Lambeth council in future.Though it can now go ahead, Field Day festival is facing a separate crisis, with numerous artists pulling out of the lineup.The festival’s promoter Superstruct is owned by parent company KKR, an investment firm with holdings in Israel. Campaigners wrote an open letter stating that “the festival is now implicated in the crimes against humanity of apartheid and genocide”, and called on Field Day to “publicly distance itself from KKR”. Artists and organisers such as Midland and Sisu Crew subsequently pulled out of the festival after Field Day did not make a statement to that effect.Field Day has responded, saying: “As a high-profile event operating in a global context, our team, of course, recognises the strength of feeling of the artists involved and the fans who attend. The open letter itself says that this situation is ‘not the choice of Field Day’ and we are sorry that some artists have chosen not to perform at this year’s festival.”Mighty Hoopla, which is also run by Superstruct, has put out its own statement reading: “Information has come to light about KKR’s unethical investments, particularly in complicit Israeli corporations, which directly counter what we stand for as a festival … we wish to state our clear opposition to KKR’s unethical investments.”The Guardian has contacted representatives for KKR for comment.Explore more on these topicsMusic festivalsLondonFestivalsField DaynewsShareReuse this content"

And then what do we get?”The easily distracted US president has not elaborated further on his film tariff plans since the announcement on 5 May. Anopen lettersigned by major studios, film industry unions and Trump’s own “Hollywood ambassadors” Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone instead calls on the government to try to revive America’s film industry with tax incentives, specifically mentioning those in place in the United Kingdom and Australia.The Phoenician Scheme review - Mia Threapleton shines in Wes Anderson’s muted new confectionRead moreIn The Phoenician Scheme, Puerto Rican actor “““, a ruthless and egocentric industrialist who grows concerned about his fortune’s future after surviving an assassination attempt and begins to glimpse the error of his ways.Anderson described Korda as embodying “the darkness of a certain kind of capitalist”, and as “a character who is not really concerned with how the big decisions he has empowered himself to make for the world are affecting populations of workforces and landscapes”.View image in fullscreenMichael Cera, Benicio del Toro and Wes Anderson during the Phoenician Scheme press conference.Photograph: Monica Schipper/Getty ImagesThe Phoenician Scheme stars an array of Hollywood royalty, with major and minor appearances from Bill Murray, Tom Hanks, Benedict Cumberbatch, Scarlett Johansson and Michael Cera.

But after his death from cancer in 1990, the artist’s influence and the legacy of his abstract painting slowly faded from view in Britain.View image in fullscreenAubrey Williams in 1981.Photograph: © Val Wilmer, courtesy October Gallery“His work was very dramatic with the huge canvases, and the colour was intense always,” says Chili Hawes of October Gallery, the institution that represented Williams during his lifetime. “There was nothing pale about his work. He loved the drama; he loved the colour.”Williams spent most of his time in the UK after arriving in 1952 and also had studios in Miami and Jamaica. He mingled with art’s great and good, once meeting Picasso in Paris after being introduced by Albert Camus. “He said that I had a very fine African head and he would like me to pose for him … he did not think of me as another artist,” was how Williams recalled the meeting.Despite Picasso’s dismissal, Williams was a key player in the Caribbean Artists Movement (Cam), which emerged in the mid-1960s in Britain and was founded by West Indian artists, authors and playwrights. Cam had two main aims: forcing their work into the mainstream and debating what black art should be in the post-colonial 20th century.Alongside the likes of John La Rose, Althea McNish and Edward Kamau Brathwaite, Williams took part in small meetings that he called “warshis”, an Amerindian word he encountered inGuyana, which meant meetings where people “unburdened” themselves.“He was one of the ideas men in Cam,” says the academic Malachi McIntosh, who is currently writingA Revolutionary Consciousness: Black Britain, Black Power, and the Caribbean Artists Movement, a new history of Cam, for Faber.View image in fullscreenAubrey Williams: Maya Series Chac Mool II.Photograph: Jonathan Greet/© Estate of Aubrey Williams/ Jonathan Greet“The big schism that broke Cam apart was between people who were saying art needs to be engaged in the community. Others, including Williams, said artists need to have complete freedom,” McIntosh added.As with his fellow Guyanese artist Frank Bowling, who hadhis first major retrospective at Tate Modern in 2019, and McNish, who had herown major touring exhibition in 2022, Williams has undergone a resurgence in interest.In 2010, his work was included in a landmarkAfro Modern show at Tate Liverpool; and between 2022 and 2024 there was aroom dedicated to his work. At last year’s Frieze Masters, Williams was given a coveted place in the “Spotlight” section, with curators billing him as someone who had “taken painting into new territories”.Earlier this year Yale University Press released a book that was co-edited by his daughter Maridowa Williams and included critical responses to his work, diary entries and poetry.“There has been such a shift in the reception of those artists,” says Hawes. “But Aubrey needs to be paid particular attention to, because he was ahead of his time. He talked about ecological matters … I think now is his time, in a sense.”October Gallery’s artistic director, Elisabeth Lalouschek, points out that Williams’s work would also take all sorts of turns, such as his interest in the Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich. “When you look at the symphonies of Shostakovich he was trying to paint music in colour and in form, which is, of course, a very difficult task,” she says.View image in fullscreenAubrey Williams: Sun and Earth IV 1963.Photograph: © Estate of Aubrey Williams/ Jonathan GreetA new exhibition of Williams’s work is opening this week at October Gallery, which takes in several decades of his work and explains how he was hugely influenced by his time working as an agronomist in Guyana.He initially came to Britain to study agricultural engineering at Leicester University, and his interests in ecological matters and the ancient cultures of the Mayan, Aztec and Olmec cultures was a regular feature in his art.The author Anne Walmsley,wrote in her Guardian obituary of Williams, that his “enquiring mind is continually focused on the relationship between man and nature, and the mythological mysteries echoed in artefacts of past civilisations”.Aubrey Williams: Elemental Force is onat October Gallery, 22 May to 26 JulyExplore more on these topicsArtLondonBlack British cultureClimate crisisGuyanaColonialismnewsShareReuse this content"

Sorry to ORF, it’s going to be expensive.”Groiss-Horowitz later told Austrian media she was “incredibly happy” for the singer-songwriter and for ORF, “because it is of course a giant project”.Still, she said, “it won’t be easy. We’ll have to see how we can scrape everything we have together so we can make a success of it.”The estimated cost to ORF of Austria hostingcould exceed €30m (£25m). That compares with just under €700,000 for merely broadcasting the event. The 2026 contest comes amid a €325m cost-cutting drive, and a year in which the broadcaster will face big bills covering the men’s football World Cup in Canada, Mexico and the US, as well as the Winter Olympics in Italy.JJ’s success in Basel, Switzerland, with his searing operatic ballad Wasted Love, marked the third time Austria has won theEurovisionsong contest, following in the footsteps of Udo Jürgens in 1966 and Conchita Wurst in 2014.“What a success. What a voice. What a show”, said an euphoric Austrian president, Alexander Van der Bellen, in a short video congratulating JJ. “All of Austria is thrilled.”Seemingly less pleased was the finance minister, Markus Marterbauer, who tutted about the price tag. The Austrian government is facing a third year of recession while it implements budgetary cuts to bring its ballooning deficit in line with EU rules.In a laconic Instagram post, Marterbauer shared a satirical website’s headline that said he had voted for Sweden 3,000 times to duck the expense of hosting the next contest.His caption: “It wasn’t enough …”Even before JJ’s triumph, the news magazine Profil ran an article headlined:“Could Austria afford another ESC?”, noting that the potential host city Vienna was €11.9bn in debt.The Eurovision song contestsays it is mainly fundedby participating broadcasters’ fees, contributions by the host broadcaster and host city, and turnover from sponsorship deals, ticket sales and public voting for songs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Of that, 20m francs was borne by SRF, 35m by Basel and 5m by the organisers, the European Broadcasting Union.However, the hundreds of journalists and tens of thousands of fans also bring in significant revenues, along with a sizeable publicity boost for the host city that can have lasting effects, said Vienna city council’s finance chief, Christoph Maschek,.Vienna “cut a strong figure internationally” when it hosted after Conchita Wurst’s 2014 victory with the power ballad Rise Like a Phoenix, Maschek said. The city would need to examine the “financial context and the security aspects”, he added.The federal government’s tourism chief, Elisabeth Zehetner, said the 2015 event had brought €30m in revenues to Vienna, 100,000 visitors and “advertising value in the hundreds of millions of euros range”. “Those orders of magnitude would be possible again in 2026,” she said.Several of Austria’s smaller cities including Graz and Innsbruck, and even the town of Oberwart have also expressed interest in staging next year’s edition.ButSalzburg and Klagenfurt have already bowed out, citing insufficient infrastructure and cost concerns. ORF will make the final decision among possible venues and has promised a “transparent process”.Explore more on these topicsAustriaEurovision 2025EurovisionTelevision industryTelevisionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

SNEP, which monitors music sales in France, stated that Owana had the biggest-selling album in France in both 2023 and 2024.As well as collaborating with the cream of the Francophone rap scene, including Aya Nakamura, Damso and Hamza, he also collaborated with major names in the US, with Gunna and Lil Tjay appearing on Diamant Noir.He had been due to perform in Lyon on the night of his death. Earlier in the week, he had won album of the year for Pyramide 2 at Les Flammes, a French award ceremony honouring the best in rap and other music of Black origin.

All mainstream stands on the shoulders of arthouse, and if the arthouse dies completely, there will be no originality left in the mainstream.”El-Toukhy is joined in Dogma 25 (which embraces the original movement’s commonly used international spelling) by film-makers Milad Alami, Annika Berg and Isabella Eklöf, and visual artist Jesper Just, though the movement is open to allowing further members.Their manifesto has been endorsed by the two best-known directors to emerge fromthe original Dogme movement, Thomas Vinterberg and Lars von Trier, and established in collaboration with Zentropa, the film production company set up by Von Trier.View image in fullscreenLars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg in 2005.Photograph: Photos 12/AlamyThe low-budget ethos of Dogme 95 films such as Vinterberg’s Festen and Von Trier’s The Idiots went on to have a profound influence on contemporary cinema in Europe and beyond. Some 212 Danish and international films have been granted a Dogme certificate since its manifesto was launched in Paris in March 1995 – though many films associated with the movement, such as Von Trier’s Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark, didn’t qualify because they failed to meet its strict“vows of chastity”.Dogma 25 only retains one of the original manifesto’s self-imposed rules: that any film that is part of the movement must be “shot where the narrative takes place”.The new movement’s 10 rules commit its followers to working from a script that “must be original and handwritten by the director”, to only accept funding “with no content-altering conditions attached”, and to have “no more than 10 people behind the camera”.At least half of any Dogma 25 film must be without dialogue, “because we believe in visual storytelling and faith in the audience”. The use of makeup or any manipulation of faces and bodies is not allowed, and props used on set must be either “rented, borrowed, found or used”.Most challenging of all, Dogma 25 films must be made “in no more than a year”, and the use of the internet “is off limits in all creative processes”. At the launch event in Cannes, Just clarified that this rule meant they would only be allowed to use email for administrative purposes during the one-year film-making phase.“We’ve become so dependent on the internet that you think, ‘Wow, all my inspiration I draw from the internet,’” said Berg. “The point is to liberate ourselves from it because we are very vulnerable when we constantly are attached to big firms that can target us with algorithms.”Swedish filmmaker Eklöf, whose filmHolidaywon best Danish film at the country’s annual Bodil awards in 2018, said she had already decided on the plot of her first Dogma 25 feature. “I was in a sadomasochistic relationship and I’ve never seen a film about that from a sort of naturalistic point of view,” she said. “I would really like to make a romantic, down to earth film about that.”Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalFilm industryFestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Zak has lots of new projects in hand and I wish him the best.”Starkey, the Who’s drummer since 1996, later claimed his departure was not a mutual decision.“I was fired two weeks after reinstatement and asked to make a statement saying I had quit to follow my other musical endeavours,”Starkey wrote on social media, an hour after Townshend’s statement.“Not true. I love The Who and would never have quit and let down so many amazing people who stood up for me through all this madness.”He added there had been “weeks of mayhem of me going ‘in and out and in and out’ … like a bleeding squeezebox”.He said while he did have other projects on the go, he often did and “none of this has ever interfered with the Who and was never a problem for them. The lie is or would have been that I quit the Who – I didn’t. I love the Who and everyone in it.”In April,Starkey was fired from the bandover a disagreement about his performance at their Royal Albert Hall gig earlier this year.‘Only three more songs till I kick your ass!’ Rock’n’roll’s biggest onstage bust-upsRead moreAreview of the band’s March gig in the Metrosuggested the Who frontman Roger Daltrey complained onstage about Starkey’s performance, reportedly pausing during their final song, The Song Is Over, to tell the audience: “To sing that song I do need to hear the key, and I can’t. All I’ve got is drums going boom, boom, boom. I can’t sing to that. I’m sorry guys.”The incident caused an immediate rupture: Starkey labelled his bandmate “Toger Daktrey” and complained he was “bringing formal charges of overplaying” against him.Three days later, Starkey was reinstated, with Townshend saying: “There have been some communication issues, personal and private on all sides, that needed to be dealt with, and these have been aired happily.” Starkey later thanked Townshend and Daltrey.Starkey, the son of Ringo Starr, first joined the Who full time during their 1996 Quadrophenia tour. He was introduced to drumming by the band’s former drummer Keith Moon, a family friend who gifted Starkey a drum kit for his eighth birthday.This is the second high-profile firing of a drummer in just days: the Foo Fighters drummer Josh Freese was let go from the band last week, after filling in for the late Taylor Hawkins for the last two years.“I enjoyed the past two years with them, both on and off stage, and I support whatever they feel is best for the band,”Freese wrote. “In my 40 years of drumming professionally, I’ve never been let go from a band, so while I’m not angry – just a bit shocked and disappointed.”Explore more on these topicsThe WhoRoger DaltreyPete TownshendPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

Their songs of the 1970s and 80s are pure pleasure; sun-kissed, smooth and mellow. It is a music of high noon, no shadows.But what happens when twilight comes? Daryl Hall is 78. The partnership with John Oates, 77, has reacheda messy end, with lawyers involved. Now he is on the road, under his own name, playing the songs of his gilded youth in a more tarnished age.He strolls on to the Glasgow stage in a broad-brimmed hat and spends much of the set seated at a grand piano. His voice is not what it was in the same way as the Colosseum is not what it was: what remains is an interesting ruin. Where once his singing was a wonder of clarity, stamina and control, he now struggles. Sometimes, trying for high notes, he places a hand at the top of his chest, as if the effort is a strain. His slick six-piece band do a lot of heavy lifting on backing vocals. He has made an addition to the lyrics of Sara Smile that feels telling: “After all these years … time is talking to me.”Yet there is beauty in this brokenness. Everytime You Go Away is a highlight because the feeling of bruised experience in his voice suits the subject of the song – a sad letting-go.Daryl Hall & John Oates: ‘We had a lethal ability to experiment’Read moreThe big feelgood moments come from his sidemen. Shane Theriot’s guitar solos on Private Eyes and Rich Girl are undeniably cool, though not as cool as Charlie DeChant, a glitzy wizard with long white hair and a gold-sequined jacket who started playing with Hall & Oates in 1976. To see him shuffle forward and perform the insouciant sax break on Maneater is to witness a little moment of pop magic.Such virtuosity magnifies rather than hides the diminishment in Hall’s voice. It feels at times like he is the weak link in his own great music. Perhaps he should do a Dylan: rework the songs radically so that he can do them justice. But would his fans go for that?Daryl Hall plays Royal Albert Hall, London, 19 May. Then tours the UKuntil 25 MayExplore more on these topicsPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

It would be perfect television … if only the script weren’t so laughably repetitiousLucy ManganMon 19 May 2025 09.45 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 May 2025 12.45 EDTShareIn my next life I am definitely coming back asStanley Tucci. Or Francesco da Mosto (that Venetian count with the exuberant hair who was all over the schedules a few years ago, do you remember?), or Steve Coogan or Rob Brydon or any celebrity, really, who is sent off to foreign parts on jollies disguised as work.I am never going to be a world traveller. But if I were, I would, like most of the above, stop at Italy. Why, honestly, would you go further? Why would you not stay in the place that breaks your heart with its beauty everywhere you look? That is suffused with the confidence and style that screams “We owned the Renaissance! We proved ourselves once and for all. No need to sweat the small stuff now! Sit down, chill, and eat penne al’arrabiata until it’s time to prostrate yourself in awe before some ancient frescoes. And btw, the spirit of Michelangelo wants you to eat your body weight in gelato before bed. That’s why he released David from his marble. So you know you can never compete.”I don’t know if you’ve heard, but Stanley Tucci is Italian. The clue is in the name and in the previous travelogueStanley Tucci: Searching for Italy, a number of autobiographical cookbooks about pasta ’n’ that, and now Tucci in Italy, which is very like Searching for Italy, except, obviously, he’s found it.Each of the five episodes purportedly set out to explore the connections between a region – Tuscany, Lombardy, Trentino-Alto Aldige, Abruzzo, Lazio – and its food. In effect, however, it is simply a love fest between Tucci and everyone he meets, Tucci and everything he eats and, just possibly, for those of us who have started to feel that a little bit of Tucci goes a long way, between Tucci and Tucci.Look, it’s not a grift, obviously. Making telly is not like going down t’pit but it’s hard work of a kind. That said, the absolutely minimal effort put into scripting the narration (Lombardy, for example, is “innovative”, “forward-thinking” and “industrialised” to an almost risibly repetitive degree) and the level of analysis by Tucci of the food disappearing down his gullet (“So fresh!” “This is the greatest day of my life”) feels borderline contemptuous of his audience.But perhaps I am asking too much. We do, after all, get to gaze upon beautiful culinary creations and imagine what it would be like to taste them in ceaselessly inviting restaurants and against endlessly gorgeous backdrops (from every inch of Florence, to cooking fish on the banks of the Sarca River). Miniature amberjack taco with balsamic herbs picked on the kitchen premises, anyone? Or perhaps you’d prefer to keep it simple with a steak that could make the gods weep, from Maremmana cattle raised in northern Lazio by some of the last butteri (specialist cowboys), or with sturgeon caviar atop a simple shrimp and spaghetti dish? Remember – if it’s truly fresh, the caviar should have no smell! What about a revitalised vitello tonnato with an aerated tuna sauce? “I make the other dishes ugly deliberately,” says the chef as he finesses the plate. “So that customers don’t become intimidated.” You wouldn’t believe me if I told you what the Lombardians can do with tripe or the Florentines can do with tongue (make you want to eat it, basically), so I won’t try.But it is by their service stations that you shall truly know them. Italians rejoice in the presence of hundreds of branches of Autogrill, a phenomenon that could exist only in a country that privileges la dolce vita beyond all things. What can I tell you? It’s a chain of motorway service stations that doesn’t think customers should be served fried rat. It serves meals you would be glad to have in any restaurant in England. In its test kitchen – test kitchen! – it is working on making a palatable vegan ragu for the masses. A customer explains how sometimes “you don’t want a full osso bucco” because you would need to pull over for a nap afterwards. Indeed. Indeed.So Tucci and his Tucciness work their magic yet again, even if it is mainly by pointing a camera at Italy, letting Italians speak for themselves and their priorities shine through.

It was an adventure playground in Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island and a rowdy neighbour in Daphne du Maurier’s Jamaica Inn. It played the wine-dark seducer in Homer’s Odyssey and the snot-green tormentor in Joyce’s Ulysses. But while its colour can change and its humour may vary, its fictional properties remain reassuringly stable. The sea is our unconscious, a repository of memory, the beginning and end of all things. It’s what Jules Verne described as the “Living Infinite”.In Madeleine Thien’s rapturous fourth novel, The Book of Records, “the Sea” is the name given to a gargantuan migrant compound, sprawled on the shoreline a decade or two in the future. Lina and her ailing father, Wui Shin, occupy an apartment on the labyrinthine 12th floor, from where they can watch the refugee boats pull in and depart. The pair have fled the flooded Pearl River Delta, leaving behind Lina’s mother, brother and aunt but carrying three volumes from an epic biographical series entitled The Great Lives of Voyagers. These tattered instalments cover the respective histories of the German-Jewish philosopher Hannah Arendt, the Chinese poet Du Fu and the Portuguese-Jewish scholar Baruch Spinoza. They provide both a link to the past and a sextant to navigate by. The world exists in endless flux, Lina is told, and yet here in the Sea nothing ever goes missing. Its chambers fill and empty like locks on a canal. Different portions of the compound appear to correspond with different decades. “The buildings of the Sea are made of time,” Wui Shin explains.Naturally this near-future migrant fable is also by extension a novel of ideas. It’s about the ways in which experience and knowledge are handed down or slip free, to the point where we inherit and inhabit the lives of those who have gone before. Wui Shin once worked as a “cyberspace engineer” for a state-controlled tech firm, restricting access to the Chinese internet. His daughter’s story, though, plays out as an unfettered open inquiry, cross-referencing the laws of physics with the writings of Kafka, Proust and Italo Calvino. Thien – who was born in Canada to Chinese parents – is fascinated by the relationship of memory to history and by the cross-pollination of separate cultures and writers. Intriguingly, her 2016 Booker-shortlisted novelDo Not Say We Have Nothingcontains a close cousin of Lina’s Great Lives series: the fragment from a book of historical records which has been copied by hand and smuggled out of China. The Sea recycles its wares, just as novelists do. Each standalone story is like a beaker dipped and drawn from a wider body of work.Lina will go on to spend many years in the Sea, but as the book begins, the girl has no sooner settled into her apartment than the doors slide open to reveal her neighbours. The refugees gather around the new arrival like Dorothy’s companions in The Wizard of Oz. They breezily introduce themselves as Jupiter, Bento and Blucher, but they are also the avatars of Du Fu, Spinoza and Arendt. It is through their stories that we learn how Spinoza was labelled a heretic in 17th-century Amsterdam and Arendt went to ground in Nazi-occupied France. “You do know a lot about Du Fu,” Lina tells Jupiter at one point. “What am I,” Jupiter replies, “other than the things I know?”The 12th floor of the Sea is a rarefied realm. Conversations constantly circle back to the big subjects: history and language; freedom and identity. And yet The Book of Records offers more than an intellectual talking shop. Its cramped apartment is the springboard from which the story glides out through various vibrant subplots, each furnished with a cast of vivid bit-players, some of whom (the blond visa clerk with the runny nose; the apprentice lens grinder with the bandaged hand) are described and dispensed with in a deft line or two. Lina’s three migrants are essentially ghosts themselves, passing through history in the blink of an eye. But their respective quests are made to feel urgent and ongoing, and we thrill to their adventures as though they are happening in real time. Arendt and her husband eventually cross the Pyrenees on foot, stumbling on the narrow mountain path, watching out for border guards. They dream of a safe Atlantic passage and a fresh start in New York, “a place in the future where the past can meet”.The Book of Records is a rich and beautiful novel. It’s serious but playful; a study of limbo and stasis that nonetheless speaks of great movement and change. If this turbulent, mercurial tale has an anchor, it is its belief that “in order to extend life and preserve civilisation, we are obliged to rescue one another”. Thien explains in the acknowledgments that she has lifted this quote from The Book of Mountains and Rivers, a 2012 essay collection by the Chinese writer Yu Qiuyu. She hands it on from Arendt to Blucher to Lina in the Sea, as though it’s a baton or a lifeline that connects all the world’s great voyagers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We’ve come to Praia de Monte Clérigo to watch the sun sink into the sea, and stumble upon a bay ripe for play with a babbling brook, rock pools, gentle swell, towering cliffs and rolling dunes. As I gaze across to colourful fishers’ cottages circling a simple beach bar, I can’t help but agree; this could indeed be the world’s best beach.“Why’s it so empty?” my son asks. It’s a good question, given the beauty of our surroundings, but we soon realise that having the place to ourselves is a common occurance on our slow adventure exploring Portugal’s least-populated coastline.View image in fullscreenBetween the busy resorts of the Algarve and Alentejo’s stark Atlantic coast, Portugal’s south-west corner offers a happy medium that’s ideal for families. The jagged coastline creates sheltered bays between long sweeping sands, and the81-mile(130km) Vicentine Coast natural park keeps development in check. Villages and towns cling to the most hospitable coves, or line rivers as they meander through cork forests and wetlands down to the sea. Long-distance hiking routes, such as the Fisherman’s Trail and the Historical Way, provide plenty of opportunities to explore on bike or foot and help to keep a good food and drink scene afloat. Even in the Easter holidays, we often have beaches, footpaths and roads to ourselves.Rather than stay in an apartment on the coast, we opt for a family-run B&B called Muxima, a few miles inland from Praia de Monte Clérigo. Our hope is that our boys, aged nine and 11, will roam free on the large plot while we read and sip local wine in the sun. It’s clear we’re on to a winner within minutes of our arrival. “Would you like to see my katana?” Jackson, the 12-year-old son of owners Paula and Jelle, asks as we carry our bags to our room.View image in fullscreenPraia de Monte Clérigo was one of the closest beaches to the family’s B&B.Photograph: Ian Canham/Alamy“What, a real one?” our oldest pipes up, as both boys follow Jackson off into the long grass. Before I can ask what a katana is (it’s a samurai sword), the kids are off. Thankfully, it isn’t a real one.It doesn’t take long to settle in while the boys play. Our family suite sits at the end of one of two farmhouses restored in the style of traditionaltaipabuildings(made from a mixture of compacted soil and straw),with natural pigment plaster. With a double bedroom, huge shower, living area with bunk beds, a dining table and a compact kitchen, it has everything we need for lazy evenings and long lie-ins. Muxima’s seven rooms are similar in feel but vary in size. Deep red and ochre walls, straw light fittings and ceramic lamps make the dark interior feel more like north Africa than Portugal – perhaps a nod to the region’s history and our proximity to the continent. In the local town, Aljezur, surviving castle ramparts date back to Arab rule in the 10th century – the whole area was under Moorish rule until the mid-13th century.After a bracing dip in Muxima’s natural pool, we laze on the pool deck and watch swifts dance above eucalyptus trees“Let’s go and swim with the frogs,” the oldest bellows, racing back towards our room. “I counted 18, but there are probably more!”It’s not the most enticing invite, but Muxima’s natural swimming pool beckons, frogs and all. After a bracing dip, we laze about on the pool deck and watch swifts dance above eucalyptus trees. The boys enthusiastically show us the chickens, rope swing and the start of a two-mile forest trail where they spotted a grass snake earlier. Little gaggles of children are everywhere, all mucking in together.We chat with other guests in the communal living room, home to games and an honesty bar (filled with local, natural wines). A couple of families are regulars and use Muxima as a base to explore hiking trails and surf when the conditions are right. They tip us off about the mosquitoes, which are particularly bad this year due to a damp spring. But before we start to worry, Paula hands us some handmade natural citronella oil. Even the insect repellent is kind to the land here. Muxima’s eco ethos permeates everything from the homemade ginger cake, muesli and freshly laid eggs at its daily vegetarian breakfast buffets (the only meal on offer) to handmade soaps and nice little touches such as keyrings made by local artists. Converted by a Portuguese couple in 2011, Muxima has been run by Paula and Jelle (both Dutch) since 2019 to share their love of the wild with guests.View image in fullscreenThe writer and her family took surfing lessons at Praia da Bordeira.Photograph: Holly TuppenDays drift by with a pleasingly repetitive pattern, and between unrushed moments we find plenty to explore nearby. Itching to get in the waves, we spend the first morning at Praia da Arrifana, a popular bodyboarding and surfing spot. We hire bodyboards for €10 a day, and exhaust ourselves in time for a big lunch ofcataplana de marisco(seafood stew) and burgers at clifftop restaurant O Paulo. On our second day, the sky turns grey, so we try a local hike. The four-mile circular Praia da Amoreira trail has butterflies, kingfishers and a river beach. Back in Aljezur, Arte Bianca’s loaded pizzas reward our hiking efforts. Blue skies and high winds beckon us to Europe’s most south-westerly tip the next day. So, we drive 40 minutes south to shout into the wild Atlantic at Farol do Cabo de São Vicente and potter around the sleepy surf town of Sagres.By day four, we’re itching to try some “proper surfing”, as the boys refer to it, and wake early to head out on our first of two lessons with Soul & Surf. Based near Lagos, on the southern coast (in a beautifully restored farmhouse where it’s possible to stay for a full surfing retreat), they have plenty of options to choose from.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Loaded with surfboards, we meander down a boardwalk and cross a stream on to the wild expanse of Bordeira. Locals catch green waves to one side while we kickstart our session in a calmer spot in the middle of the beach.Soul & Surf’s responsible ethos dictates that we begin each surf lesson with a beach clean, before warm-up exercises and mindful breathwork. “Surfing is about the mind and the body, and we cannot do it well unless we’re relaxed,” Bruno says, perhaps clocking the boys’ impatience to get in the water. They needn’t have worried. Thanks to our expert tutor, we’ve all managed to stand up on our boards, albeit for mere moments, within the first hour. By the end of our second lesson, we’re just about pumping (to make the board move faster) and steering.“When are we going on our next surfing holiday?” the boys ask as we debrief over homemade energy bars and say goodbye to Bruno in the car park.Back at Muxima, the boys recount our surfing adventures to anyone who will listen. Alongside discovering a less-explored corner of a much-visited country, it’s been a week of making new friends and learning new skills. We leave the next day pondering whether that’s the recipe for family holiday happiness.Muxima’sfamily suites for four from£202 a night B&B.Soul & Surf’sprivate surf lessons from£60ppfor two hoursExplore more on these topicsAlgarvePortugal holidaysFamily holidaysEurope holidaysSurfing holidaysBeach holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Inspired by this, I made a lemon-spiked green chilli and artichoke tapenade for hot focaccia, topped with the same excellent olives and the best anchovies.Gildas in carriagesI don’t usually specify brands in my recipes, but when there are so few ingredients, it really is worth getting the ones recommended below as a treat. They’re very rich, too, so a few go a long way.Prep15 minCook20 minServes6 as a starteror pre-drink snack250g focaccia125g jarred artichokesin olive oil(drained weight), plus 25ml oil from the jar1tsp sea salt flakesJuice of ½ lemon1-2 large green chillies, depending on your tolerance to heat150g tinned green olives(drained weight; from a 350g tin) – I likePerelló1-2 47½g tinsanchovies in oil(27g drained weight) – I likeOrtizHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. If the focaccia is part-baked, cook it according to the packet instructions. Once cool enough to handle, cut the focaccia into 3cm-wide x 7cm-long x 1½cm-deep pieces (essentially long and wide enough to hold two slices of olive, as pictured). Put the focaccia pieces on a baking tray and bake for 15-20 minutes, until crisp.Meanwhile, roughly blitz the artichokes, olive oil from the jar, salt, lemon juice and chillies in a high-speed blender or food processor to make a rough paste, rather than a smooth puree.Drain and cut the olives in half and open the tins of anchovies. Once the croutons are ready, spread them immediately with the artichoke tapenade, then arrange two olive halves and half a piece of anchovy on top. Leave to cool for five minutes, then serve warm with drinks.Explore more on these topicsSnacksQuick and easyFoodVegetablesStarterFishSeafoodBreadrecipesShareReuse this content"

This simple, rather rustic tart is delicious and sings of warmer days. Tarragon is underrated, but this soft herb is a staple in my garden and eats especially well with crab. Then, all the love for these little sardine tins of happiness, taking the classic flavours of a margherita pizza, tucking them up with the fish and using the tin to the max.Sardine margherita (pictured top)This makes a super-easy starter or midweek lunch.Prep10 minCook15 minServes4460g tinnedsardines in escabeche(ie, 4 x 115g tins), or tinned sardines in olive oil (ideally in round tins to mimic the shape of a pizza)Black pepper150gpackmini mozzarella balls8 black olives, pitted and halvedTo serve50gunsalted butter1 sourdough loaf, slicedHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Remove the lids carefully from the tins of sardines and drain half the tomatoey oil from each tin into a jug. Put the tins with the sardines still in them on a baking sheet. Tear up the mozzarella balls and push them into the tins between the sardines, then season with a little black pepper. Do the same with the olives.Drizzle a little of the reserved oil over the top of the contents of each tin, then bake for about 10 minutes, until bubbling and slightly caramelised. Serve with slices of buttered sourdough.Crab and tarragon tartView image in fullscreenEmily Scott’s crab and tarragon tart.I like to use only white crab meat here, but if you like the brown meat, use half and half.Prep25 minChill1 hrCoo35 minServes6For the shortcrust pastry (or use ready-made)175gcold unsalted butter, cut into cubes200gplainflour, plus extra for dusting1 egg yolkA pinch of sea saltFor the crab custard3 eggs, separated300mldoublecream2tsp dijon mustard1tbsp chopped tarragon leavesJuice of 1 lemon500gwhite crab meatSea salt andblack pepper2tbsp grated parmesanLine the base of a 23–24cm fluted, loose-bottomed tart tin with baking paper. If you’re making your own pastry, rub the butter into the flour, either in a bowl with your fingertips or in a food processor. Add the egg yolk, two tablespoons of cold water and a good pinch of salt, and mix to combine well. Bring the pastry together into a ball, slightly flatten it, then wrap in clingfilm and put in the fridge to chill and rest for 30 minutes.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/gas 7. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured work surface, use it to line the prepared tart tin, then chill for another 30 minutes.Line the pastry with baking paper and baking beans, and blind bake for 15 minutes, until the edges are golden. Carefully lift out the paper and beans, bake for a further five to 10 minutes, until golden, then take out of the oven and set aside.Turn down the oven to 210C (190C fan)/415F/gas 6½. In a large bowl, mix the egg yolks, cream, mustard, tarragon, lemon juice and crab meat, then season with salt and pepper to taste.Whisk the egg whites in a clean, dry bowl until they just form stiff peaks, then gently fold through the crab mixture with a metal spoon, using a figure-of-eight movement. Spoon into the pastry case and top with the parmesan. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until just set with a slight wobble, then remove and leave to cool before cutting. This is delicious with a simple watercress and fennel salad and some good olive oil.Hot smoked trout, watercress and cheddar tartView image in fullscreenEmily Scott’s hot smoked trout, watercress and cheddar tart.The pastry can be made in advance and frozen (or swapped for shop-bought).

Line the pastry case with a sheet of greaseproof paper and fill with baking beans. Blind bake for 20–25 minutes, then trim off any excess pastry. If you want to get ahead, the pastry can be made up to this point in advance and frozen.For the custard, turn down the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat, then add the sliced spring onions, tarragon and watercress, and cook until softened and wilted. Transfer to the tart case and spread over the base.Whisk the creme fraiche, cream, eggs and egg yolk in a bowl, then season with salt and pepper. Pour this over the tart filling, then top with the smoked trout flakes and the grated parmesan. Bake for 30–35 minutes, until golden and firm in the centre, then remove and leave to rest and cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.These recipes are edited extracts from Home Shores: 100 Simple Fish Recipes to Cook at Home, by Emily Scott, published by Quadrille at £30.
