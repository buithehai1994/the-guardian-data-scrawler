Indeed, that it never really has been. Just a theatre showcase for some performance politics where few answers are ever extracted from the prime minister.To which you might now add that the Tories are not the real opposition. SoKemi Badenochis essentially an impostor. Sometime over the summer the mantle of official opposition passed to Reform UK. So it really should be Nigel Farage, not Kemi, asking the questions.No one is particularly interested in anything the Tories and Badenoch have to say. Certainly notLabour. All their attention is focused on fighting Farage now that Reform are 15 points ahead in the polls.Even Reform think Reform are the official opposition. They don’t give theConservativesa second thought. Nor does the rest of the country. No one is listening to Kemi. Not least because the main broadcasters no longer bother to screen her speeches. Her big number to the Scottish oil industry on Tuesday might as well not have happened because no one heard it.Even the more sensible Tories recognise they have become an irrelevance. Praying they somehow avoid total annihilation but knowing that as long as Kemi is their leader, they may as well not exist. Because she’s just not that good. A fatal combination of misplaced confidence and inflexibility. Put simply, she doesn’t listen to anyone.Wednesday’s PMQs should have been a gimme for Kemi. As close to an open goal as you can get. Just half an hour before the start, the Guardian hadbroken the storythat Angela Rayner had admitted she had underpaid the stamp duty owed on her Hove flat by up to £40,000.Now was the time for Kemi to rip up her prepared questions and go all out to embarrass Labour. Rayner herself looked as if she was prepared for a ritual humiliation. Not to mention the possibility of losing her job. She entered the Commons looking like death warmed up, flanked by a minder. A picture of misery. She could barely bring herself to raise her eyes.Keir Starmergave her a friendly tap on the shoulder. Not a flicker. No hint of acknowledgment. A private hell.Initially it seemed as though Badenoch had understood what was expected of her. Why was Rayner still in office, she asked. That would have done nicely for openers. Except she then got bored and retreated to her prepared script on government borrowing.Starmer couldn’t believe his luck. Neither could Rayner. Keir gave a brief defence of Angela. She had referred herself to the advisers on ministerial interests – more than many Tories had when they were found to have been in breach of the ministerial code – and we could all wait till he reported back. In the meantime, Angela was going nowhere.There were so many more questions Kemi could have asked. Like: what did Starmer know about Rayner’s tax arrangements and when did he know it? Did he think Rayner had acted within the spirit of the law? Was it her lawyer or her who had filed the wrong information?But Dr Kemi didn’t. What Keir didn’t know was that at the age of 14 she had been awarded the Nobel prize for economics. To go with hermedical scholarship to Stanford. And God knows what from Harvard. Call her Dr Dr Kemi.She didn’t seem to understand the laughter – some from her own benches – when Keir got sidetracked by her long and distinguished record of academic achievements. The most decorated woman alive. So we disappeared down the byways of who was to blame for the economic mess we were in, and the moment of danger for Labour had passed.Kemi’s final question was to wonder why the budget was taking place on26 November. Really? Was that really the key question of the day?The rest of the session just slipped by in a haze of inconsequentiality. Much as it had started. The Tory John Hayes ended the misery by launching into a paean to the British flag. Cue an outpouring of devotion.It can’t be long before any politician caught not wearing a union jack suit will be publicly shamed for not being patriotic. Don’t you love your country, for fuck’s sake? The smart money is on Chris Philp to be the first person to paint the front of his own house white with a red cross. It’s certainly the sort of idiotic thing he would do.Needless to say, we never got to hear what the real leader of the opposition had to say about Rayner. Or anything, for that matter. Because Nige, GB News badge on his lapel, was 3,000 miles away in Washington paying homage to the court of King Donald by giving evidence to a congressional hearing on free speech.Hard to escape the irony. The organisers of the Reform party conference this weekend have banned some journalists from attending. Clearly you can have too much of a good thing.The hearing started with the Republican Jim Jordan grandstanding that the UK’s Online Safety Act was the biggest threat to US democracy since the cold war. It had tried to stop people telling Americans that the Covid vaccine didn’t work. There’s nothing like a US committee hearing to make you feel affectionate towards the British system.Next up was the Democrat Jamie Raskin. He didn’t waste his words. Why wasn’t the hearing talking about the danger posed by Russia, China, North Korea and Saudi Arabia? Farage was nothing but a Putin apologist and Trump sycophant. It was America that was banning free speech by arresting students for anti-Trump speech and banning books.Nige didn’t miss a beat. He was there to show his devotion and he was determined to deliver. The UK was a terrible place. The worst. He was ashamed of what his country had become. It was outrageousLucy Connollyhad been locked up for inciting people to burn asylum seekers. Hell, they were only foreigners. Where was the British sense of fair play?“I’m definitely not suggesting that the US impose extra tariffs on the UK,” Farage said. Having allowed the Sun to make that inference the day before. It’s sometimes tough being Nige when you’re trying to impress The Donald and the tech bros. Because Farage would never talk down his own country. That would never do.Explore more on these topicsPMQsThe politics sketchKemi BadenochKeir StarmerAngela RaynerNigel FarageLabourConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

Oh please. Let’s get real; there is no reason why this particular brand of gibbering, wittering, blithering and surreally enjoyable nonsense shouldn’t go on for ever, like Frank Sinatra’s farewell tour or shortbread manufacture in the Scottish Highlands. Both of the previous Downton films had a sentimental last-hurrah message that didn’t preclude another one dropping off the production line. We could make the next film Downton Abbey: The Royal Finale and the one after that Downton Abbey: The Imperial Finale.Thelast but onefilm finished on a funereal drone shot of Downton Abbey at sunset and the one after that was subtitled“A New Era”– but this one, it seems, has taken us back to the very end of the old era, inviting us to swoon loyally at the passing of something special and yet also at the same time doff our caps at the bluebloods’ insouciant gift for survival. There is something entertainingly outrageous in the pure tongue-in-cheek craziness of this new film’s opening sequence; it could almost count as a dadaist dream sequence. I don’t think anything in the TV show or the movies had anything as mickey-takingly bizarre.The scene is London in 1930 and Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) is at a grand society occasion with her parents, the Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) and the Countess of Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern), when the rumour runs round the assembled company that – gasp! – Lady Mary is technically adivorced womanand so has to be expelled from the party before the royals turn up. The shock of Lady Mary being divorced is presented with impeccable seriousness, like news of a terrorist bomb. Julian Fellowes is, of course, sporting with us, and yet you can’t help smiling along. Fellowes also once again cheekily recycles an idea fromhis country-house screenplay Gosford Park from 2001, directed by Robert Altman; in that film he had Ivor Novello turning up as a guest, now it’s Noël Coward (Arty Froushan), whose celebrity presence at Downton convinces all the local nobility to accept Lady Mary’s status as a divorcee.‘I knew my job was to fulfil a man’s fantasy’: Elizabeth McGovern on Downton, early fame and co-starring with Brad PittRead moreLife at Downton is as eventful as ever, with Lord G brooding on whether to accept Lady Mary’s succession as the mistress of the house, and graciously retreat with his wife to the “Dower House” occupied by his late mother. A rather gruesome Hammer horror portrait of the late Maggie Smith now dominates the building. Lady Grantham’s sheepish American brother Harold (Paul Giamatti) comes to stay with his smoothie financial adviser Gus Sambrook (Alessandro Nivola); the latter gives Lady Mary the eye. And below stairs, housekeeper Elsie Hughes (Phyllis Logan) calms the premarital nerves of Mrs Patmore (Lesley Nicol), assuring her that conjugal responsibilities are in fact “terrific fun!” (The film should get an 18 certificate for this line alone.)The film is very silly and always watchable in its weird way, with those eccentrically emphasised shots of characters thanking each other for their thoughtfulness. The next Downton Abbey film will surely have to make these characters absorb the rise of fascism and the stormclouds of war. It promises to be a diverting spectacle.Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale is out on 11 September in Australia, and on 12 September in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmPeriod and historical filmsDrama filmsDownton Abbey (Film)Julian FellowesDownton Abbey (Television & radio)Michelle DockeryreviewsShareReuse this content"

Fair to say the opening line of Three Lions ’98 hits a little differently in 2025. The crosses of St George are being daubed on an Islamic centre in Basildon. The crosses of St George are being used to deface a Chinese takeaway in York. The crosses of St George are draped over men shouting at a three-star hotel from a mini-roundabout. The crosses of St George are retailing for about £2.36 on Temu, depending on whether you want them car-window sized, or big enough to write the words “GET OFF MY LAND” in the white spaces.Keir Starmer has declared that he is “a supporter of flags”. Alas, at the time of writing the prime minister’s position on other items of tactile fabric remains unclear. What does he think about blankets? Does he endorse or condemn the dishcloth? Not to be outdone, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, disclosed that she has St George’s bunting on display at home. “I would put them up anywhere,” she confirmed, which – anatomically speaking – is not an image any of us needed right now.Tantrum transfers, hysteria and endless cash – but who won the transfer window? | Barney RonayRead moreNaturally it barely requires saying at this point that the recent wave of flag onanism is a thinly disguised trap laid by the resurgent far-right, a way of sneaking its toxic politics into our shared public spaces under the guise of broad-church patriotism. It’s just a flag. How can you get triggered by a flag? How can any right-thinking citizen possibly object to this most simple expression of collective pride? Albeit an expression largely being expressed by a few lone individuals in the dead of night, which is when all great expressions of collective pride traditionally occur.Into this stinking cheese dream of contested symbolisms, amateur semiotics and flag enemas stepThomas Tuchel’s England: refreshed and rebooted after their summer slump, facing games against Andorra this Saturday and Serbia next Tuesday.There are, of course, more banal sporting issues under scrutiny here. Can Elliot Anderson stake a claim in midfield? Can Tuchel find a less soporific way of breaking down a low block? And yet, at the same time, this is simply a very interesting moment for anEnglandteam to be taking the field under the England flag, with all its attached mythologies and meanings.Football has always been a reluctant participant in these conversations, and in particular English football, with its proud anti‑intellectual streak and reverence of the bottom line. After all, there are vibes to be maintained, disposable barbecues to be sold, pub gardens to be filled, Club Wembley corporate packages to be shifted. Far better to retreat into the usual bromides: no greater honour, play for the shirt, honestly thought it was a wind-up when I saw the number on my phone, and so on.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel (left) has suggested he would like to depoliticise the England team.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesTuchel, for his part, has made no secret of the extent to which questions of identity and symbolism and nationalism concern him, which is to say not in the slightest. On his unveiling he affirmed that he was a “head coach, not a manager”, signalled his distaste for “sport-politics”, even admitting that he could use his foreignness as a kind of impregnability cloak on such matters.And, you know, fair enough. Seen through Tuchel’s eyes, football – even international football – probably does feel like an entirely neutral space, a hermetically sealed world where the borders are fluid and the dressing rooms are polyglot, where everyone is rich and talented, where all the football pitches are the same and all the football pitches are good.But at the same time it is important to be clear what Tuchel is really saying here. What he is saying is that his England team will stand for nothing outside itself. It will play football, and you will watch, and it will try to win, and you will be happy or sad, and these alone are the ceiling and four walls of its ambition. Whatever you think of that as an ambition it is also a desperately tricky line to maintain, and not simply because, in football, politics has a habit of finding a path through even the most impermeable cracks.View image in fullscreenEngland flags adorn lampposts in Sheerness, Kent.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesFor if Barthes – Roland, not Fabien – teaches us anything, it is that the very act of trying to mean nothing is in itself a form of meaning. Perhaps this is doubly true in a pursuit as mass-cultural as football, a sport utterly in thrall to its mythologies, its symbols, a phenomenon being constantly shattered and re‑shattered in the sheer heat of its collective gaze. However thoroughly you try to strip it of meaning – the pointless friendly, the infinite content scroll, games slopped upon games – meaning finds a way.

Who gets to caption an England flag? The fan painting it on her cheek? The players walking out underneath it? The neo-Nazi plastering it on a zebra crossing at 3am? Certainly not the tortured and grimacing Starmer, a man who has outsourced his dinner to a focus group and is now being forced to eat the results, mumbling “I get it, I really do” as he chews unhappily on his meal of roast chicken, custard and Haribo bhuna.However reticent they may be to admit it, the England team that take the field on Saturday are not simply athletes with a goal but bearers of an idea. The flag under which they play is freighted with connotations and mythologies they did not author and in which they probably have no interest. Perhaps this has always been England’s original sin: the absence of that idea, empty and unfocused fervour as a substitute for thought.But the more we recoil from defining these symbols, the more vulnerable we are to having them defined for us. As the Lionessesdemonstrated so stirringly over the summer, Englishness as a trait need not be expressed in photographic negative. Like the Palestinian or Ukrainian or Pride flag, the England flag can be a reclamation of agency, a reassertion of our unity, diversity and shared values, a champion of the vulnerable, a rejection rather than an embrace of intolerance.And yes: it is tiring to have to keep having these arguments. It should feel depressing to have to restate the basic principles of our humanity, to debate those with no intention of listening, to be reminded over and over that international football is political by its very nature.To an extent this is simply a measure of the moment in which we find ourselves: a society stripped to a husk, hollowed and directionless, reduced to howling at symbols. But when the symbols are all that remain, they matter a great deal.Explore more on these topicsEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

Do newer comics think they’re old farts? They tell allWed 3 Sep 2025 10.14 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 12.33 EDTShareDavid Mitchell and Robert Webb are back with their first new sketch show in 15 years. It’s a comedy smorgasbord that is as random as it is funny, and will feel like a glorious throwback for fans of their 00s series That Mitchell and Webb Look. And this time they have brought some friends, with guest appearances on Mitchell and Webb Are Not Helping including Ghosts’ Kiell Smith-Bynoe and podcaster and Taskmaster star Stevie Martin. We caught up with the pair to chat about Gogglebox, The Two Ronnies, Downton Abbey and snooker.A recurring joke in the show is that the younger comedians you featurethink you are a couple of old farts. Are sketch shows a young person’s game?Webb:Well, hopefully, we’re not about to prove that they are.Mitchell:The Two Ronnies were quite old. But people seemed to look older in the past than they do now, so it might turn out that in the last series of The Two Ronnies, Ronnie Barker was 36.Webb:With the greatest respect, David, you are finally dressing your age because you have been dressing like a 50-year-old man since you were a student.Why do you think sketch shows have been in short supply in recent years?Mitchell:They’ve always come and gone in TV fashion. Now a lot of sketches happen online, so the thirst for the genre is, to a certain extent, sated by random YouTube material. That might be part of the reason. People say it’s because they’re expensive. I don’t think they are, really. It’s definitely cheaper to make Gogglebox than a sketch show, but it’s probably cheaper to make a sketch show than Downton Abbey.View image in fullscreen‘You can only give them what you think is good’ … Stevie Martin and David Mitchell in Mitchell and Webb Are Not Helping.Photograph: Channel 4Webb:I’m marginally cheaper than Maggie Smith was, for a start.David and his wife,Victoria Coren Mitchell, have been on Celebrity Gogglebox. Were you disappointed, Robert, that David didn’t pick you as his partner?Webb:I was neither disappointed nor surprised as I don’t live with David. Actually, Mitchell and Webb Are Not Helping is on after Gogglebox, so maybe they’ll watch it on Gogglebox. I’m not expecting Mary and Giles to really go for it. But if the Siddiquis don’t like it, I’ll be quite upset.What’s the idea of getting other comedians involved this time?Mitchell:It’s important to have people who are under 50 represented in comedy. We were younger comedians who came through on Channel 4. So it felt like a good way of doing a show is to bring through some younger comedians.Do you realise when you have written a fan favourite sketch like “are we the baddies?” or Numberwang? Or does it surprise you?Webb:We are not Tony Blair. We don’t think in terms of legacy. Sometimes you get a feeling you’re on to something and have to write it down immediately. Other ideas, you go: we’ll just let that live in the notebook for a little while. But you can’t predict what the audience are going to go for. You can only give them what you think is good, then sit back and wait for hilarious results.View image in fullscreenIn the shed … Webb with Kiell Smith-Bynoe in the new show.Photograph: Channel 4So what’s it like working together again? If you can say that you loveeach other, that would be handy, so wehave a good quote.Webb:Well, we do, so go ahead.Mitchell:We were best men at each other’s weddings. Of course we love each other, but equally, that’s not what people tend to say to each other, being English.Webb:You knew that would make us squirm, but you’ve got it out of us.My best-manning was easier. It was harder for David because it was at the end of a very busy year. I genuinely wondered if he was going to be able to find anything nice to say about me at all. But he did.View image in fullscreenGhoulish … Webb, Mitchell and Krystal Evans in Mitchell and Webb Are Not Helping.Photograph: Channel 4How long did you spend arguing whether it was Webb and Mitchell or Mitchell and Webb?Webb:I was KO’d in the first round. I think David just muttered something about the alphabet and I kind of went along with it.Mitchell:I mean, I did deploy the alphabet as the reason.Webb:I could have deployed – if I’d had the wit, which I demonstrably didn’t – that one syllable comes before two syllables.If you hadn’t become a comedy double act,what elsemightyou like to have become?Mitchell:How about Mappin & Webb, the jewellers? I’m not interested in setting up a separate business where I get second billing. Not only do I have to stop being a comedian and become something I don’t want to do, like be a lawyer, an estate agent or a silversmith, but I also have to play second fiddle.Webb:And I have to carry on just being “and Webb”.

Voters have more enthusiasm for radical policies than we give them credit forWed 3 Sep 2025 12.05 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 12.09 EDTShareWhat risk could the election ofZack Polanskias leader pose for the Green party? That’s what journalists wondered aloud on one current affairs format after another, on Tuesday evening. Would he alienate the party’s new-found Tory switchers, conservationists who’d given the party a chance after a decade of disaffection with their tribe? Surely, by peeling off the leftwing elements of the Labour party, Polanski was simply strengthening Reform, whose path to victory through this division would be assured?Polanski is sometimes described, per his own self-fashioning, as an “eco-populist”, but more often called the “left” or “hard-left” candidate, which I don’t think anyone would quibble with, though the fact that hisvictory Instagram postlanded as soon as he won points to a new kind of hard-left, one that has its shit together. I use that, rather than a milder phrase, to echo Polanski himself – whether he’s talking about sewage in the waterways, the cost of living crisis that hasn’t gone away, or British arms sales to Israel, he doesn’t say “parlous”, he says this is “shit”. Sometimes the mystery of why party members vote for the values candidate over the putatively electable one is not that mysterious: maybe rightwingers aren’t the only people yearning for someone to stand up and talk normally.Straight talking is valorised on the right, and generally deplored on the left. A hardline anti-immigration candidate is “charismatic”, a hardline anti-corporate one is “divisive”. It makes no sense at the level of the vocabulary – very few of us feel an emotional allegiance to corporations. It would be extremely hard to divide a community by slagging off Thames Water. Of immigrants, the opposite is true. Communities, even individual families, are riven when human beings are spoken about with contempt, and yet somehow that’s charisma, fun, music-hall politics. Stick around, folks, and see what Richard Tice will say next: he might do it in song. The double standards in reporting on the left and right are so well-worn it’s a bit tedious to mention. It’s also deeply understandable. The foundational assumptions about the British electorate are so far off-base, the fallacies can only be upheld by language that says the opposite of what it means.TheGreen partydid not win those Tory defectors by feinting to the right. Its 2024 manifesto, complete with wealth taxes, rent controls and multiple, radical proposals about the decent treatment of refugees, was easily as leftwing as Jeremy Corbyn’s 2019 equivalent. And even if the Greens had been going for a coalition in the last election, between the humane, Caroline-Lucas left and the tribal but bee-loving right, four MPs is probably just about all such a fragile alliance would ever yield.Reform, meanwhile, does not draw its strength from infighting between the centre and the left; rather, it’s maximising the opportunities presented by a centre that promises a better, fairer Britain and then spends its entire first year drawing up austerity 3.0. This is unfolding before our eyes; all we talk about is how high Nigel Farage is riding, and this is after five years of the Labour party expelling its left wing members and the Greens keeping their heads down. Exactly how quiet does the left have to be before this infighting theory can be laid to rest?Even if that classicWest Wingargument – pipe down, idealists, in case the electorate hears you and the bad guys seize the advantage – still worked, having been superseded by 30 years of events and never having worked in the first place, I’d still be a bit hazy on its directives. I’ve never seen it on any political hero’s tombstone: “First you say nothing, then you compromise, then you continue to say nothing, then you win.”Responses to Polanski’s leadership campaign showed just how much even those on the left had internalised these impossibilist arguments. I heard disaffected Labour members wondering whether to join the Greens to get him over the line; post-match analysis about where he’d gone wrong before the match had even taken place; people bemoaning the timing, relative to Corbyn and Zarah Sultana’s launch of Your Party, fearing that the two projects would somehow suck the energy from one another, having duplicated their offer without thinking through the electoral consequences. It’s a sidebar to Polanski’s success, but relevant, that Your Party seems to be working on the basis that the groundswell of radical energy during Corbyn’s first tenure was an event so freakish that it could only be replicated by the same conditions: Corbyn, his exact same team and his magic beans.Even people who solidly shared Polanski’s politics were preemptively dismissing him because of his colourful past as a hypnotherapist – detailed ina story from the 2010sin which he was apparently touting hypnotherapy as a useful tool in breast enlargement. Even though I have heard first-hand how that story came about – a Sun journalist fishing for a silly season story, a possibly too polite and definitely too gullible Polanski going along with it – I accepted it as a block to his political ambition. All the talk – which was not off the record, exactly, except insofar as there is almost no mainstream record of where leftwing people talk to each other – was of how he might possibly edge a win over his more plausible opponents, as if Green members were broadly similar to BBC commentators, pragmatists with a sprinkling of extra climate anxiety.In the event, of course, he won the leadership by a landslide. What it means for the Greens, electorally, is probably not the doom-loop pollsters predict; and what it means for the left more broadly is that it might be time to have more confidence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The most recent, on 27 August, transported approximately 50 people.“We were shackled and handcuffed, then forced on to an Ice plane to Cairo,” said one asylum seeker deported last week, who, like others, asked to remain anonymous to speak freely.They said their documents were confiscated and that, after a two-hour stopover in Egypt, local authorities ordered them to board a flight to Moscow.On arrival in Moscow, passengers were subjected to “filtration”: interrogations by Russia’s federal security services. Those without criminal convictions were released.The exact number of Russians deported, and how many of them had applied for political asylum, remains unclear owing to the opaque and chaotic nature of US deportation practices.Among those deported on 27 August was Andrei Vovchenko, a 25-year-old former Russian serviceman who deserted his post in October 2022. He was wanted for desertion, according to an official defence ministry notice sent to his family.View image in fullscreenMoscow on Wednesday.Photograph: Olesya Kurpyayeva/AFP via Getty ImagesThe charges against him carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. The Guardian was unable to reach Vovchenko, but witnesses who were on the same flight said he was detained immediately on arrival in Moscow.“He begged not to be put on the plane to Moscow, but Egyptian police restrained him and tied him up,” said another person who was on the same deportation flight. “They tied him to his seat, and he cried the entire way from Egypt to Moscow.”The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not immediately respond to requests for comment and has not issued any official statement.Russia’s coordination with Egyptian security forces raises questions over whether US immigration authorities were aware that Russian citizens would ultimately be returned to Moscow.“Unfortunately, our worst fears are coming true,” said Vladimir Osechkin, a Russian human rights activist who operates the site Gulagu.net.View image in fullscreenRussian exiled dissident Vladimir Osechkin in Paris on 20 September 2022.Photograph: Joel Saget/AFP via Getty Images“People in need of protection, fleeing Putin’s war and dictatorship, FSB torture and repression, have ended up in US prisons, dressed in orange jumpsuits and shackled during transfers like criminals. Some of them have been handed over to the FSB and other security services. This is cruel and shameful,” Osechkin said.“We appeal to the US authorities to halt these deportations and conduct a thorough review,” he added.On Wednesday, the leading Russian opposition figures Yulia Navalnaya, Vladimir Kara-Murza and Ilya Yashin issued a joint statement calling on the Canadian prime minister,Mark Carney, to grant asylum to Russians facing deportation from the US.‘I escaped one gulag only to end up in another’: Russian asylum seekers face Ice detention in the USRead more“People who fled Kremlin repression and Putin’s prisons are ending up in American prisons. This appears profoundly unjust. Worse still, US courts are increasingly issuing denials of asylum claims and granting the executive branch the authority to deport our compatriots back to Russia – where, as a rule, this means immediate arrest by Putin’s security services,” they wrote in a letterpublishedby the Globe and Mail.“We ask that Canada adopt a decision to grant asylum to those Russian citizens whose opposition and anti-war activities are beyond doubt, and who are subject to deportation orders by the US authorities,” the letter added.Donald Trump campaigned on a platform of mass deportation and his administration has reshaped immigration enforcement across the country.At least 195,000 people have been deported by Ice under Trump so far,according to a tallyby the Guardian.Russia has seen a sharp rise in asylum applications to the US since its invasion of Ukraine, as many Russians seek to leave the country and avoid being drafted into the military.View image in fullscreenYulia Navalnaya speaks in Canberra, Australia, on Wednesday.Photograph: Lukas Coch/EPAMore than 8,300 Russian nationals have applied for asylum in the US since the start of the full-scale invasion, according to DHS data aggregated by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (Trac), a group that monitors immigration data. About 85% of Russians who applied for asylum were granted it in 2024, according to Trac.During much of Joe Biden’s term as US president, Russian dissidents and other asylum seekers were typically granted entry into the US on parole while their cases moved through the system. But starting in 2023,that practice shifted: many applicants instead ended up in long-term detention, in some cases for more than a year, for reasons that remain unclear. The practice intensified significantly under Trump.There have been widespreadreportsfrom asylum seekers of human rights abuses in US detention since Trump’s inauguration. Several Russian nationals who were later deported said they had endured repeated instances of inhumane treatment while in US custody.One man, who applied for asylum on political grounds in May 2024, said he was soon detained and sent to Adams County Detention Center in Natchez, Mississippi. He described overcrowded, unsanitary conditions and a rapid decline in his health.‘Trump’s private army’: inside the push to recruit 10,000 immigration officersRead more“I weighed 93kg before they placed me in a detention centre. A month and a half later, I weighed 69kg,” said the man, who was deported to Russia in June. “I called my relatives, telling them: I’m probably going to die.”He said he had entered the US legally through the Mexican border and had been invited to an interview by immigration officials, but was instead taken into custody and placed in detention. He said conditions had grown harsher in the days before deportation.“A group of Ice officials came in with guns. They shouted that anyone who resisted would face violence,” he said.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin speaks during a meeting of the Federal Security Service (FSB) board in Moscow on 27 February.Photograph: Alexander Kazakov/Sputnik via ReutersHe recalled being shackled for hours, denied consistent medical care and given no information about his legal status or when he might appear before a judge. “It felt like we were being treated as criminals, not as people asking for protection from Russia,” he added.Trump has vowed to step up deportations in the coming weeks and months, leaving many Russians still in the asylum process in the US living in fear.“My husband was supposed to be deported on the flight last week but his lawyer managed to prevent that from happening,” said the wife of one asylum seeker, who added that her husband faced extremism charges in Russia for taking part in anti-government protests.“I can’t even imagine what would have happened to him if he had been sent back,” she added.Explore more on these topicsIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)RussiaEuropeDonald TrumpMark CarneyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Government sources suggested the ethics inquiry could be completed within days.Thecontroversycomes as the prime minister faces a turbulent autumn, with tax rises expected to be announced in the 26 November budget, which will arrive against a difficult economic backdrop.Rayner, who is also the housing secretary, has faced charges of hypocrisy as tax rises could include those on property. She has alsopreviously called for wealth taxesto help ease the UK’s strained public finances, including targeting people who used companies to avoid stamp duty.After referring herself to the ethics adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, Rayner said she had received inaccurate legal advice that led her to underpay stamp duty. She confirmed she will have to pay more as a result of incorrectly paying the lower rate on the flat in Hove, East Sussex. Experts have said the bill could run to as much as an extra £40,000.In ahighly personal statementto the Guardian, she said she “deeply regretted” that the error had been made, after classifying the flat as her only property, despite spending much of her time with her children at the family house in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester.Rayner’s fate, as deputy prime minister and as a cabinet minister, could come down to whether she can prove that she was given the wrong advice by her lawyers, as she has claimed, when she bought the Hove flat in May.In an early sign of support for Rayner, Starmer told MPs he was “very proud to sit alongside” her in the Commons. The prime minister, who patted her shoulder when he arrived for PMQs, said referring herself was the “right thing to do”.“She has explained her personal circumstances in detail. She has gone over and above in setting out the details, including asking the court to lift a confidentiality order in relation to her own son,” he added.“I know from speaking at length to the deputy prime minister just how difficult that decision was for her and her family, but she did it. She did it to ensure that all information is in the public domain.”But his spokesperson refused to say when Rayner received new advice that she had underpaid. No 10 also declined to confirm when Starmer was told. As recently as Monday, he said she was the victim of “people briefing against her and talking her down over and over again”.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer told MPs he was ‘very proud to sit alongside’ Angela Rayner in the Commons.Photograph: PRU/AFP/Getty ImagesStarmer has a track record of ruthlessness when it comes to firing errant ministers, but while Rayner faces a moment of great uncertainty, shecould yet be protected by her relatively powerful positionwithin the Labour party, as a standard bearer of the left and working-class voice.Months before the purchase of her Hove flat, Rayner had put her stake in her constituency home in Ashton into a trust, which was originally set up in 2020 to manage a payment to one of her sons, who, after a “deeply personal and distressing incident” as a premature baby, had been left with lifelong disabilities.In May 2025, when she bought the south coast property, she said she was advised by lawyers over the level of stamp duty required. Subsequently, tax experts had told her that the flat could not be treated as her only residence because of the provisions of the trust.Tax experts saythat, even though she gave up her financial stake in the Ashton house after her divorce, Rayner would be regarded as still owning it if she or her children were a beneficiary under the trust and entitled to occupy the dwelling for life.As the flat was an additional dwelling, she would be expected to pay the higher stamp duty rate of £70,000, rather than the £30,000 she actually paid. She is now working with HM Revenue and Customs to establish exactly how much extra tax is owed.Regardless of ownership, the Ashton property remains her family home and where she is registered for most official and financial purposes, including council tax and the electoral roll. It is where her children live full-time, while she and her former husband take turns living at the house.In her statement, Rayner said: “When purchasing the property, my understanding, on advice from lawyers, was that my circumstances meant I was liable for the standard rate of stamp duty.“However, given the recent allegations in the press, I have subsequently sought further advice from a leading tax counsel to review that position and to ensure I am fully compliant with all tax provisions.“I have now been advised that although I did not own any other property at the time of the purchase, the application of complex deeming provisions which relate to my son’s trust gives rise to additional stamp duty liabilities.“I acknowledge that due to my reliance on advice from lawyers which did not properly take account of these provisions, I did not pay the appropriate stamp duty at the time of the purchase. I am working with expert lawyers and with HMRC to resolve the matter and pay what is due”.While Starmer awaits the ethics adviser’s conclusions, he will face pressure over Rayner’s position.Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative party leader, said: “If he had a backbone he would sack her.” The Tories published multiple old tweets from Rayner in opposition decrying “one rule for them, one rule for everybody else”.The Reform UK deputy leader, Richard Tice, said: “She was so vocal in attacking opposing politicians when she was in opposition that she can’t stand up and say: ‘I’m the biggest hypocrite in the land.’ She has to offer her resignation.”Angela Rayner is a picture of misery but Dr Kemi passes up open goal | John CraceRead moreHowever, Rayner received unexpected support fromEd Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, who refused to join the chorus of critics calling for her to go. “Obviously if the ethics adviser says Angela Rayner has broken the rules, her position may well become untenable,” he said.“But as a parent of a disabled child, I know the thing my wife and I worry most about is our son’s care after we have gone, so I can completely understand and trust that the deputy prime minister was thinking about the same thing here.”In her statement, Rayner added: “While I do not find it easy to publicly discuss personal and sometimes distressing family matters, I have always taken my responsibility as an MP and deputy prime minister seriously and tried to be as open as possible while protecting my family.“To address the allegations made against me, I have now taken the difficult decision to explain why my arrangements are as they are.”Downing Street hadrevealed on Mondaythat Rayner was prevented from publicising all of the details about her property ownership by a court order. In the interests of transparency, she applied to the court and was given permission to discuss them publicly on Tuesday night.Explore more on these topicsAngela RaynerLabourKeir StarmerKemi BadenochEd DaveyStamp dutyTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

We think that there’s a public mood out there for a grown up conversation about what that means. And the crucial thing is that those with the broader shoulders are asked to pay a fairer share.”Polling for the TUC found that a 2% annual wealth tax paid by individuals with assets worth more than £10m would be supported by 68% of people, with 22% against. This rose to 75% among 2024Labourvoters now leaning towards Reform.The poll also found that increasing capital gains tax to the same level as income tax was supported by 51% of people, with 34% against. This rose to 57% among Labour backers now tempted to vote for Farage’s party.There was even greater support for a package of tax rises including wealth taxes, higher taxes on gambling firms and a windfall tax on the profits of banks and other financial institutions, with 68% supporting the proposals as a whole, while just 23% opposed to them.TheTUCcalculated that the wealth taxes could raise an extra £36bn a year, while a gambling tax could bring in £3bn more and a bank surcharge could raise between £20bn and £50bn over the next four years depending on the level it was set at, between 16% and 35%.“The government’s got to stay the course. A little bit of economic left-wing populism would go a long way, because clearly that’s where the public mood is. On tax, on workers rights, people want to see change,” Nowak said.“For far too many people, ‘change’ still feels like a slogan and not actually their lived reality. They’re still in the midst of a cost of living crisis. They still haven’t seen the improvements come through in public services.“Every decision the government takes to demonstrate it’s on the side of working people is the right thing to do … No one thought the economy was going to be fixed overnight. But the worst thing the chancellor could do, having made that big upfront investment in the budget last year, is to pull back from that.“I don’t think the balance is right at the moment. I think we’ve got a tax system that’s very good at taxing work, less effective at taxing wealth. That’s really the big inequality that we’ve seen opening up.“That doesn’t take away from the fact we know we need to get growth into the economy, growth that makes a difference in people’s pockets. But this budget, if the choice is between fair taxes and cuts to the public services, we know whose side the chancellor should be on.”Nowak, who haspreviously called Farage a “political fraud and hypocrite”who was “cosplaying” as a working-class champion in order to win votes, doubled down on his view that the Reform UK leader was a political opportunist.“Nigel Farage is, as always, talking up whose side he is on. [But] he’s a political snake oil salesman. The gap between the rhetoric and what he’s actually prepared to deliver is massive. We have got a job to do, to show the gap between the rhetoric and reality,” he said.“The way that we challenge Reform, and the way that a Labour government challenges it, is by demonstrating that they genuinely are on the side of working people.”However, in a warning to the left, he said: “Frankly, I don’t think the alternative is Jeremy Corbyn in No 10. It’s Nigel Farage or Kemi Badenoch in No 10. And that should fill anybody who cares about the rights of working people, about our public services with absolute dread.”Explore more on these topicsTax and spendingTUCRachel ReevesLabourBudgetNigel FarageReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not what Reform have suggested, which is cabins with a fence around them.”He also attacked Reform for indicating that their measures would focus on deporting undocumented males rather than women and children. Farage rolled back on his initial pledge to deport “absolutely anyone” 24 hours afterhe unveiled his immigration measureslast week.Jenrick appeared to suggest the Conservative party should outflank Farage on immigration as he criticised the policy. “The people-smuggling gangs would exploit women and girls, and it would encourage even more young men to pose as 15-, 16-, 17-year-olds,” he said.Asked about a “moment of radicalisation”, he reflected on his visit to a protest outside the Bell hotel in Epping.“I met a single mum who had three teenage daughters,” he said. “The oldest daughter, who was about to go to university, had bought some workmen’s boots and put them outside because she wanted the illegal migrants to think there was a man in the house.”Jenrick said another turning point had been a visit to Dover with the former MP Natalie Elphicke, where he described migrants walking straight into residents’ gardens and kitchens to steal food, a moment he said convinced him Westminster was “totally out of touch”.“Damaging though illegal migration is, legal migration is even more harmful to the country because of the sheer eye-watering numbers of people who have been coming across in recent years perfectly legally – it’s putting immense pressure on public services,” he said.Jenrick added: “I think the country now needs breathing space after this period of mass migration. The age of being open to the world and his wife who are low-wage, low-skilled individuals and their dependents has come to an end.“Reversing recent low-skilled migration will likely mean a sustained period of net emigration. I would support that.”Justice secretary suggests Jenrick risked collapse of murder trial with tweetRead moreHe said Britain was a net emigration country in the 1960s to 1980s, and more than half a million people left the UK last year. The goal, he argued, was not to “close the border entirely” but to stay open to “coders, doctors and serial entrepreneurs”.Jenrick, still widely seen as promoting himself for a future leadership contest, denied trying to steal Kemi Badenoch’s thunder.“I fully support Kemi’s approach which is to develop serious policies with detailed substantive basis behind them. That’s the way we can begin to rebuild public trust,” he said.But his intervention comes before Tory party conference where Badenoch is expected to set out her own immigration plan.Jenrick did not shy away from criticising his shadow cabinet colleague Priti Patel. During the interview, he said the points-based system created by Conservative ministers “was the worst policy mistake in my lifetime”. The system came in when Patel was home secretary during Boris Johnson’s time as prime minister.Explore more on these topicsConservativesRobert JenrickImmigration and asylumNigel FarageKemi BadenochnewsShareReuse this content"

You might … think twice before you let Mr Farage make Britain great again.”The Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, wrote on X: “Farage has gone to the US to tell them Britain is ”awful” – If you don’t like it over here Nigel maybe don’t catch a return flight?”Some other Democrat members were equally scathing. Jerrold Nadler asked why the committee had sought evidence from “a fringe politician from the United Kingdom”, while another, Hank Johnson, asked Farage to confirm that Reform currently has four MPs.Johnson accused Farage of advocating for free speech so as to solicit donations from Elon Musk, the owner of X, saying: “You’re trying to ingratiate yourself with the tech bros.” He added: “You need money from Elon Musk in order to get elected prime minister of Great Britain. That’s the bottom line.”Farage responded by pointing out that Muskdid not support him: “Elon Musk is abusive about me virtually every single week, but it’s a free country.”Raskin asked the Reform leader why he had called for a ban on a pro-Gaza protest, with Farage saying this was because it would have happened close to Remembrance Sunday, calling this a “sensitive” time.Raskin replied: “I thought that’s what the freedom of speech was about. You have a right to engage in speech that other people consider offensive or insensitive.”Raskin also asked why Reform often prevented journalists from critical organisations from attending its events. Farage said this did not happen with his knowledge: “If I go back the last 25 years, I can’t think of banning anybody. But I mean, maybe somebody else did.”Under more sympathetic questioning from Republican members, Farage cited the cases of Lucy Connolly, whowas jailedfor sending a tweet urging people to “set fire” to hotels housing asylum seekers, andof Graham Linehan, as “a klaxon” over the threat to free speech.However, he denied calling for the US to place sanctions on Britain if it did not change its laws, saying that he only wanted American politicians and businesses to try to persuade the UK over this.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageCensorshipFreedom of speechUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It left much of the audience and many journalists sobbing as it was screened for the first time.The film reconstructs the final, frantic phone call of Hind Rajab, who in January 2024 was trapped in the wreckage of a car in northernGaza, surrounded by the bodies of her uncles and four young cousins.Hiding beneath a seat and the only one still alive, Hind managed to contact the Palestinian Red Crescent by phone. However, the child and the medics looking for her were killed by Israeli forces.The Israeli military has not announced a formal investigation into the case.Ben Hania said: “When I first heard the voice of Hind Rajab, there was something beyond her words. It was the voice of Gaza itself calling for help – and no one could reach her.”The film makes chilling use of the real phone recordings of Hind, but tells the story through a dramatised Red Crescent team which is trying to coordinate her rescue.In a statement on behalf of the entire film-making team, actor Saja Kilani said: “The voice of Hind Rajab does not need our defence. This film is not an opinion or a fantasy. It is anchored in truth.“Hind’s story carries the weight of an entire people, it is not hers alone. Her voice is one among 19,000 children who lost their lives in Gaza in the last two years alone.“It is the voice of every mother, father, doctor, teacher, artist, journalist, volunteer, paramedic, each with the right to live, to dream, to exist in dignity, yet all of it was stolen in front of unblinking eyes. And these are only the voices we know. Beyond every number is a story that never got to be told.”Motaz Malhees, a Palestinian actor from Jenin, said: “When I was 10 years old, I lived this life. Hearing Hind’s voice took me straight back to my childhood. I felt as if I had died a thousand times. This wasn’t acting. This was my life.”Hind’s mother, Wissam Hamada, said she hoped the film would help end the war.“The whole world has left us to die, to go hungry, to live in fear and to be forcibly displaced without doing anything,” Hamada told AFP by phone from Gaza City, where she lives with her five-year-old son.Brad Pitt, Jonathan Glazer, Joaquin Phoenix and Alfonso Cuarón serve as executive producers on the drama. Phoenix and Rooney Mara, who also joined the project as executive producer, were in Venice and hugged the cast after the premiere.AFP contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsVenice film festivalFestivalsGazaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

I would now like to live disassociated from those who wish me nothing but ill will and destruction, and this is the only resolution.The Smiths’ drummer Mike Joyce announces memoir The DrumsRead more“The songs are me – they are no one else – but they bring with them business communications that go to excessive lengths to create as much dread and spite year after year. I must now protect myself, especially my health.”Serious investors, Morrissey wrote, should email eaves7760@gmail.com to inquire.Morrissey shares 50% of the rights to the Smiths with Marr. Whether the brand retains its value to investors without Morrissey as an active participant to help market it remains to be seen.The Guardian has contacted representatives for Marr and Joyce for comment.It is unclear what annual business communications are being referred to by Morrissey. Joyce recently announced the publication of a“no-holds-barred” memoir, The Drums, this November.Johnny Marr has previously said that he declined an “eye-watering” offer for the Smiths to re-form. “It was a little bit about principles, but I’m not an idiot, I just think the vibe’s not right,” he said, referencing the evident political and personal differences between him and Morrissey.In 2024,Marr rubbished Morrissey’s claimthat he had acquired the rights to the Smiths’ trademark “without any consultation”. Morrissey said that Marr owned the copyright which would allow the group to tour with a new vocalist.Marr said this was incorrect. A spokesperson said on his behalf: “In 2018, following an attempt by a third party to use the Smiths’ name – and upon discovery that the trademark was not owned by the band – Marr reached out to Morrissey, via his representatives, to work together in protecting the Smiths’ name.Nick Cave says he declined Morrissey’s request to sing ‘silly anti-woke screed’ on new songRead more“A failure to respond led Marr to register the trademark himself. It was subsequently agreed with Morrissey’s lawyers that this trademark was held for the mutual benefit of Morrissey and Marr.“As a gesture of goodwill, in January 2024, Marr signed an assignment of joint ownership to Morrissey. Execution of this document still requires Morrissey to sign.­­­­­­­­”He denied that he was planning to tour under the Smiths name with a different singer, and had also turned down an offer from Warner Music Group to release a new Smiths compilation “given the number in existence”.Morrissey’s apparently dire situation may have been influenced by the evidently unsuccessful attempt to reform the Smiths, as well as the difficulties he has faced in releasing his 14th solo album, Bonfire of Teenagers, which remains on the backburner.He has previously said he was “gagged” owing to the subject of its title track,the 2017 terrorist attackon an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester that killed 22 people.He has been performing the song since 2022. It features lyrics about how “The silly people sing Don’t Look Back in Anger / And the morons swing and say Don’t Look Back in Anger / I can assure you I will look back in anger ’til the day I die,” a reference to the street singalongs of the Oasis track after the bombing. The song concludes with Morrissey singing “go easy on the killer”.He was dropped by his former label BMG in November 2020 and blamed the split on the label’s “new plans for ‘diversity’”. At the time, BMG declined to comment on whether the decision had anything to do with the musician’s contentious statements about race and sexual assault.Bonfire of Teenagers has been completed since May 2021. His new deal with Capitol should have seen the album released in February 2023. However, at the end of 2022, he said he had “voluntarily” split from Capitol and his management team, and claimed that the label was “holding on to” the record.In April 2024, he said he had bought back the rights to the record but alleged that “every major label in London” had refused it “while also admitting that it is a masterpiece”.He has called the record “the best album of my life” and said the “madly insane efforts to silence the album are somehow indications of its power.

Take a breather and come back.”Pasricha and her colleagues examined 125 people for haemorrhoids during colonoscopies for abowel cancerscreening programme. The same volunteers completed questionnaires on diet, exercise and bowel habits, including how long they spent on the toilet and whether they ever strained or experienced constipation.Further questions, according to the study inPlos One, delved into people’s mobile phone habits to find out whether they took their device to the toilet and what apps they used once there. All were aged 45 and over.Two-thirds of people admitted to taking a phone to the toilet, where most scrolled through news and social media. After accounting for common risk factors for haemorrhoids such as older age, physical inactivity and low dietary fibre, toilet scrollers were 46% more likely to have piles than those who left their phone behind. More than a third (37%) of toilet scrollers spent more than five minutes on the lavatory compared with only 7% of those without phones.Reading on the toilet is nothing new, but Pasricha believes that the newspapers, magazines and books that once kept people occupied are no match for the likes ofTikTokand Instagram. “The whole business model of these apps is to make you lose track of time,” she said. “Our pre-TikTok ancestors were just reading a newspaper or whatever they could find. It wasn’t distracting to the same level.”More work is needed on the health implications, but Pasricha suspects that smartphone apps prolong the time people spend on the toilet, which in turn increases the pressure on anal tissues, leading to haemorrhoids. “If you’re just hanging out there in the open, this passive pressure will eventually, over time, cause the connective tissue to weaken and cause those veins to engorge,” she said.One pressing question surrounds the habits of younger people. In a continuing study of college students, Pasricha said nearly all admitted to taking phones to the toilet, raising concerns that the teenagers of today might develop piles sooner than older generations.Haemorrhoids affect up to a quarter of all adults, and while most resolve on their own or with minimal treatment, more than 20,000 surgical procedures are performed on piles each year in the UK alone.For those who cannot contemplate being phoneless on the toilet, Pasricha suggests minimising the toilet scroll. “Set a two TikTok limit,” she said. “What you shouldn’t be doing is getting so trapped in this cycle of scrolling and watching TikTok that you lose track of why you came here in the first place.”Explore more on these topicsMedical researchSmartphonesBowel cancerHealthTikTokMobile phonesShareReuse this content"

While they made their way towards a raised platform in Tiananmen Square, Putin’s interpreter could be heard saying in Chinese: “Biotechnology is continuously developing.”After a brief inaudible passage, the interpreter added: “Human organs can be continuously transplanted. The longer you live, the younger you become, and [you can] even achieve immortality.”Xi, who was off camera, could be heard responding in Chinese: “Some predict that in this century humans may live to 150 years old.”Putin confirmed later to reporters he had discussed prospects for significantly increasing human life expectancy with Xi.Both leaders have shown little intention of relinquishing power in their lifetimes. In 2018, Xiabolished presidential term limits, paving the way for him to rule indefinitely. Putin has also changed Russian law to allow him to remain in high office.Military reveals and bold messaging: five key takeaways from China’s big paradeRead moreSections of Russia’s elite, including Putin, have long been fascinated with longevity and the science of extending life.In 2024, Putin instructed lawmakers to establish a research centre called New Health Preservation Technologies, dedicated to combating ageing. The project focuses on developing “technologies that prevent cellular aging, neurotechnologies, and other innovations aimed at ensuring longevity”.According to an earlierinvestigationby the independent Russian outlet Meduza, Mikhail Kovalchuk, a longtime family confidant of Vladimir Putin, is leading Russia’s research into immortality, a subject that he and other influential figures close to the Kremlin are reportedly “obsessed” with. Meduza reported that Kovalchuk has invested in organ-printing technology that uses lab-grown cells to produce replacement organs.Putin’s eldest daughter, the endocrinologist Maria Vorontsova, has received multimillion-dollar Russian government grants to study cell renewal and ways to extend human health and longevity and is involved in a genetic research programme linked to Kovalchuk. When sanctions were passed on her by the US in 2022, the State Department said she was leading Kremlin-funded genetics programmes worth billions.Putin and Xi walked alongside the North Korean dictator,Kim Jong-un, during their conversation, who was smiling and looking in the direction of Putin and Xi. It was not clear if their chat was being translated for him.Later footage showed the three leaders walking up the steps towards the viewing platform for the parade.The moment was carried on the livestream provided by the state broadcaster CCTV to other media, including the international newswires AP and Reuters.China’s largest-ever military parade included 50,000 spectators and a big display of military hardware, from tanks and drones to nuclear-capable missiles, fighter jets and stealth aircraft.The performance was seen as a show of defiance to the west. Other attenders included the president ofBelarus, Aleksander Lukashenko, the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, and Myanmar’s junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing.In his formal address, Xi told the crowd that the Chinese people stood firmly “on the right side of history”. He saidChinawas a great nation that was “never intimidated by any bullies” – in an apparent veiled reference to the US and its allies – and added that China was “unstoppable”.Explore more on these topicsChinaXi JinpingVladimir PutinAsia PacificRussiaNorth KoreaKim Jong-unnewsShareReuse this content"

It was my fifth pregnancy. After the final appointment, the one where the surgeon furrowed her brow as she looked at the ultrasound, I walked down First Avenue. It was winter. It was the year after the pandemic had begun. I was feral with grief. I snapped at strangers, cried in the bodega, etc. I’d spent a year getting pregnant, then unpregnant. I’d wake in the middle of the night and remember: heartbeat, heartbeat. At times, I felt absurd for my grief. I couldn’t ascertain what the metric of a mother was, what goalpost had to be met. Had I met it? Surely grief like this – love like this – had to be more deeply earned?Three years later, I went under anesthesia again for another egg retrieval. At this point, I had a baby, nearly 18 months old. The surgery was on 6 October. The fertility doctor was cheery at my bedside when I woke; I now had a new crew of eggs on ice. I took a Lyft home. That afternoon, dazed on the couch, I watched sitcoms. The next day, I watched the news break: one urgent report after the other, in English, in Arabic, repeating the same details in different order:surprise attack,dawn,rockets,metal fence bulldozed, hostages taken, raids, combatants, dozens killed, no, hundreds killed, 16-year siege. Then I watched a city go dark. I watched water get cut. I watched the first bombs fall. I watched the mothers.In late 2023, Palestinian childrenheld a press conferencein their second language, asking the world to stop killing them. Towards the end, a child says: “We invite you to protect us.” I was a relatively new mother, clunky and unsure, griefstruck at the rising death toll. The invitation was as generous as it was devastating.I see the nurturing principle as also one of the saviors of the human race, Audre Lorde once said,whether it occurs in women or whether it occurs in men.I think we are all mothers in that sense … that we do help each other, that we do respond in terms of survival and teaching. The invitation is a portal, a beckoning: to our mother selves.The measure of any society is how it handles its most vulnerable. Arguably, a child on a strip of land without electricity, water, aid, access to border crossings, is as vulnerable as they come. But rather than being shielded by power – or, at minimum, international law – the children of Gaza have been killed, burned alive and starved. They account for the highest number of pediatric amputees. They live in “the most dangerous to place to be a child” on this planet. We’ve seen X-rays of theirsniped brains. We’ve heard them plead for their lifeon emergency calls. We’ve watched them make their way through burning classrooms after a school-turned-shelter was bombed.A wasteland of rubble, dust and graves: how Gaza looks from the skyRead moreEven thousands of miles away: Palestinian children are the target. A woman in Texas waschargedwith trying to drown a three-year-old Palestinian American girl. A Texas landlordstabbedWadee Alfayoumi, a six-year-old Palestinian American boy, 26 times. In Brooklyn, a woman threw hot coffee at a man and his 18-month-old child, because the man was wearing a keffiyeh.The project of dehumanization is to make people unworthy of defense, so that when they suffer, onlookers are primed for disregard: they must have deserved it. They must have chosen it. Or, simply:they must not feel what I feel. Such acts are made possible only through decades-long propaganda and rhetoric about Palestinian children, media coverage thatages them up, policies that criminalize them, thatposition themas terrorists-in-the-making, inherently complicit. Embedded in the discourse against Palestinian children is that they are disposable to those who love them.View image in fullscreenA mother of a teenager who was killed in Israeli fire on Wednesday while seeking aid in northern Gaza, at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.Photograph: Mahmoud Issa/ReutersIn a 1969 press conference, Golda Meir memorably said: “[W]e will perhaps in time be able to forgive the Arabs for killing our sons, but it will be harder for us to forgive them for having forced us to kill their sons.” This rhetoric enacts two clever maneuvers: the racist trope of Palestinians as inhuman, and the release of accountability from the ones doing the actual murdering so that, even in their murdering, they are victimized. It is what enables, nearly two years into a genocide, as Gaza has entered a forced famine,for American commentatorsnot to “put too much stock in images coming out of Gaza” of starving children.In 2014, Israeli lawmaker Ayelet Shakedposteda quote from the journalist Uri Elitzur. It read: “They should go, as should the physical homes in which they raised the snakes. Otherwise, more little snakes will be raised there.”What should “go”? The mothers, the homes, the children.Years later, in response to a Palestinian Knesset member saying: “A child is a child is a child,” another, Meirav Ben-Ari,responded: “The children of Gaza have brought this upon themselves.”Here is the greatest fiction of all: of children over there and children over here. The fiction that there is a difference. The fiction of someone – anyone – else’s child when, as James Baldwin once wrote,The children are always ours.In the end, my daughter is carried in another body for the better part of a year. She is birthed by another body. The day she is born, I feel time stop. The sun streaming through the windows while I hold the surrogate’s hand, her knee, this woman who has given life for its own sake. When the doctor tells me to look, I look. There: my daughter. There: life. A decade in the making. Her skeptical gaze. The sweet protest of her first cry. Language fails me in the most glorious way. I hold her in the morning-lit room for hours, her mouth next to my cheek.She already knows how to breathe, I keep thinking. The miracle is everywhere.‘Very sick and very tired’: the reality of famine for Gaza’s most vulnerableRead moreShe is 18 months old on 7 October. I’d envisioned many things for my first years as a new mother: tantrums, the fear that accompanies love, helicoptering. What I didn’t envision was becoming acquainted with the horrific things that could be done to a child’s body. To watch a girl hang like meat from a building. To watch a child burn alive. To see a decapitated toddler. It goes without saying that witnessing isn’t the same as experiencing. No matter that some part of the nervous system doesn’t understand the difference. No matter that every time I wake to my daughter crying, I shoot through the apartment like the city is burning. No matter that when I wake one night soon after 7 October – alone in the apartment with my daughter – to the shouts of a random argument between two men, men screaming about Hamas and Israel, my first thought, simple and unscripted:they’ve come for us.Palestine is not a metaphor. And yet – every experience of mothering these last months has been superimposed on to Palestine. My daughter in the emergency room. My daughter’s bright, scraped knee in the backyard. My daughter’s antibiotics in the fridge. My daughter’s sunny classroom. My daughter’s favorite YouTube entertainer, singsonging:Good job, friends!View image in fullscreenMs Rachel, on 24 September 2024.Photograph: NBC/Nathan Congleton/Getty ImagesIn Gaza, a woman says:I tried to have her for a decade. She holds her dead baby in her arms. In Gaza,twins are bornafter 10 years of trying and three rounds of IVF treatments. They are killed during an airstrike on their home. They are five months old. In Gaza, a toddler eats sand, a boy is sniped getting flour, a baby diesweighing less thanshe did when she was born. In Gaza,a pediatricianleaves her 10 children at home to treat others’ injured children in the hospital. Hours later, the bodies of nine of them are brought in, charred and disfigured beyond recognition, lost in the span of a heartbeat. In Gaza, an Israeli shellhits the Al-Basma Center, the largest fertility clinic in Gaza. Four thousand embryos are destroyed, the only hope for hundreds of Palestinians yearning to parent, to mother. Think not only of the speculums, the shots, the blood draws, but the triumphant phone calls, the numbers, the cells dividing and dividing and dividing, all that life insisting upon itself.What claim do I have to their grief? Ask the nightmares. Ask the mirror I knock from the hinges after I read the news.They must not feel what I feel. One of the most foundational aspects of parenting is expanding a child’s theory of mind. Most of my days are spent explaining to my child that other creatures feel things too: the dog, the child at the playground, even me. Do you like that? No? Do you think they like that? This Socratic merry-go-round is maddening enough with a child. It is outrageous with nuke-strapped adults.Entities – like toddlers – will get away with what you permit them. Especially deeply militarized ones. Especially profoundly afraid ones.Gaza’s sick children wait in torturous limbo for medical evacuationsRead moreOne day, my daughter’s favorite YouTube entertainer posts about Gaza. Ms Rachel: a childhood development specialist, a musician, a woman whose vocal fry and tonal tilt I can mimic in my sleep. Ms Rachel sings about sleepy bunnies with a toddler amputee from Gaza. Ms Rachel lists numbers, names. Ms Rachel posts a video of herself crying as she says please, please, it must stop. “They’ve given me this career and I’m also willing to risk it for them,”she posts. Ms Rachel, mascot for ornery babies and delirious parents everywhere, says children should not starve. Children should not be murdered. Children should keep their limbs. Predictably,she is accusedof being on Hamas’s payroll, a proxy terrorist. She has done the unforgivable: calling a child a child.The world we sanction is the world we get. The world you make unsafe for other people’s children, ultimately, is the same one your own are living in. The most profound propaganda is that what happens to other children is different, removed, deserved. It is the convenient, short-lived fiction of the privileged.View image in fullscreenPalestinian children cool off with the water distributed by charitable organizations, escaping the stifling heat of the tents they live in in Gaza City on 1 September 2025.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesI will admit it: I don’t even want to mention my daughter among such horror. I don’t want her among such stories. I want to shield her eyes even in prose. But I have to remember: my daughter is no more my daughter than anyone else’s.Mothering hasn’t hardened me or turned me into an apex predator. It has broken me open. It makes me see children even where there were none: politicians, soldiers, armies. Sometimes, watching the jeering soldiers, thehearts signedon bombs, I think, with fury and sour pity:who taught you how to live? Where is your mother?There is nothing special about a Palestinian mother. She loves and fears and wants the same as any other. She is made extraordinary not by her possession of some magical endurance, but by the relentlessness of horrors inflicted upon her. She cares beyond what is bearable because that is the quintessential task of mothering: to attend beyond reason, to stretch, to become unrecognizable by what you can take.Everywhere I look, I see children.Everywhere I look, I see mothers. Professors protecting their students at encampments. Activists boarding flotillas with baby formula and medication. “I see my children and every child in the children of Gaza,”saysthe woman who teaches my daughter nursery rhymes.Later, sheposts: “No exceptions.”"

A dating show with contestants you don’t hateIn Davina McCall’s new show, singletons are ‘married’ then marooned at sea. It’s like Married at First Sight meets Love Island, except that you’ll genuinely root for them. How refreshingLucy ManganWed 3 Sep 2025 17.00 EDTShareAre there hundreds of contestants and are they virtually indistinguishable from each other at first sight? Yes! Is it noisy? Yes! Can you feel it encouraging appetites and urges – voyeurism, schadenfreude, extreme emotional investment in strangers – that a responsible citizen and society should strive neither to serve nor encourage? Oh yes! Is that done by forcing relationships then putting them under outre stressors, including unexpected toilet conditions, on an otherwise paradisiacal island? Yes! And is it at least nominally presented byDavina McCall, though actual sight of her is limited to a few opening minutes of the first episode and it is increasingly cheeky to bill her as a presence? Yes, yes to all of the above. Welcome to your next addictive reality show, 12 hour-long episodes designed to transition you comfortably into the autumn schedules – Stranded on Honeymoon Island.It is Love Island meets Married at First Sight, if – and you will have to strain your imaginations here – the contestants on Love Island weren’t often instantly awful. This lot are, in the main, rather gorgeously endearing. I hadn’t realised how ready I was for a show that didn’t require me to bring my best loathing game. I find I have so much energy for the rest of the day.Like all good reality TV shows (take note, Destination X), the setup is as stupid as it is simple and as simple as it is stupid. Eight kabillion single people who are ready to find lurve speed-date, fill in feedback forms, and from them a dozen are paired up by matchmakers. They then get hitched in the Philippines by celebrant Wenly (“Although this marriage is not legally binding, you are making a meaningful commitment to someone”, which is true as long as you realise that someone is the production company). The couples then get left on a nearby island for three weeks. There is a double bed, rudimentary shelter, a row of tinned foodstuffs and a loo that is maybe a notch and a half better than a bucket. We are promised that “mystery crates” containing items and challenges designed to test the honeymooners’ compatibility will arrive in later episodes. Good times!View image in fullscreen‘Little sister vibes’ … Mae (left) in Stranded on Honeymoon Island on BBC One.Photograph: BBC/CPL ProductionsYou find yourself rooting for an unusually high proportion of the couples. I wish for no one to dim the light of effervescent party girl Hannah and I very much feel that lovely suit designer Sam is the man to allow her to shine. When they hit the first bump in the road, I find myself pressing my fists to my face, begging her not to let her past bad experiences distort it into something it is not. “He is not your ex!” I plead to the screen. “Look at his eyes! Look at the way he recut your wedding dress into something playful yet provocative yet island-chores-ready. Come on! The past is not your future.”I am also fully in favour of Helen (“Essex girl and raging lesbian – that’s how I introduce myself!”) and Abby making a go of things. What can I tell you? They’re just right together. I bet Davina agrees with me. If we ever see her again, maybe she’ll say so.Oh, and the two devout Christians, David and Ini! He used to sleep around but it wasn’t making him happy so he “cried to God” for help and it was given. Now he is ready to settle down, start a family, give his children the love he didn’t experience at boarding school and I just know that Ini is the one for him. Sure, it might have been better if he hadn’t mentioned at the altar that there was another woman on the speed dates he would have been equally happy to find coming down the aisle towards him, but every non-marriage has its teething troubles, amirite? I mean, just ask Moray (another boarding-school boy) and Mae (who is single after her ex had a terrible accident “and fell into his colleague’s vagina” and cannot date anyone who drives a manual car because it makes their heads move like chickens’ and makes her feel sick – I pledge undying allegiance to this woman). He tells her on the second day of their honeymoon that she reminds him of his cousin and he’s also getting “little sister vibes”. O tempora, o Moray.It’s a lot of fun, fuelled by optimism instead of despair and populated by people who genuinely seem to like each other and who are frequently funny. It’s a rare beast. Not quite as rare as actual sightings of Davina, but there are several episodes to go. Maybe she’ll be in a mystery crate, along with some pointers for boarding-school boys looking for love.Stranded on Honeymoon Island aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDavina McCallReality TVMarriageDatingRelationshipsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The shortlist encompasses a medical research centre, almshouse, college of fashion, two houses and a quintessential national monument. Geographically, though, they are conspicuously less disparate, with four schemes in London, one in Hastings and one in Cambridge, which begs the question: is there really no noteworthy new architecture north of the Fens?View image in fullscreenCare, shelter and connection … Appleby Blue Almshouse.Photograph: Philip Vile/Royal Institute of British Architects/PAHistorically associated with pastoral benevolence and distressed gentlefolk, the almshouse gets a modern reboot by architects Witherford Watson Mann. TheirAppleby Bluedevelopment in Bermondsey, London, is a place of care and shelter, but above all, social connection. The human theatre of residents in its voluminous garden room can be appreciated from the street through a glazed walkway projecting out along the main facade like a shop window. “The idea was to build right in the heart of the community, not to hide people away,” says project architect Stephen Witherford. Both in its architecture and operation, Appleby Blue is a consciously extroverted presence and a retort to the notion that older people (especially poorer older people) should be shunted to the margins, with adverse effects on their mental and physical health.Swiss practice Herzog and de Meuron’s forte is devising statement buildings for institutional clients, exemplified by the mammoth crystalline doughnut of theDiscovery Centre, designed with BDP for pharma titan AstraZeneca. Being in Cambridge, albeit on a peripheral biomedical campus near Addenbrooke’s hospital, there are nods to the archetype of the college court (quads being the preserve of Oxford), with a lawn-lined central enclave. Wrapped in faceted glazing, which, through cunning flexes of geometry, becomes a sawtooth roof, it’s a classic object building in a landscape, executed with enviable precision, a piece of architectural haute couture that puts its dowdier campus neighbours in the shade.View image in fullscreenEnviable precision … the Discovery Centre.Photograph: Hufton and Crow/Royal Institute of British Architects/PAFormerly based in Oxford Street next to the John Lewis flagship store, the London College of Fashion (LCF) and its attendant satellites have now consolidated and decamped toAllies and Morrison’s “vertical campus”in the expanding cultural quarter of Stratford, London’s East Bank. While its 5,500 students may hanker for John Lewis’s legendary haberdashery department, they have the compensation of soaring atriums, Escher-esque staircases and panoramic views from the LCF’s whopping 17 storeys. Billed as the highest higher education building in the UK, the LCF forms a muscular armature for a teeming anthill of creative endeavour.View image in fullscreenEscher-esque … London College of Fashion.Photograph: Simon Menges/Royal Institute of British Architects/PAThe two houses on the shortlist,Hastings House by Hugh StrangeandNiwa House by Takero Shimazaki, are elegant exercises in how to create atypical, modern domestic spaces. Elevating an otherwise quotidian domestic refurbishment, Hugh Strange augments a floridly eccentric Victorian dwelling – all stained glass, fretted barge boards and decorative clay tiles – with a series of simple, interlocking timber-framed rooms.Niwa House transforms a derelict site at the back of a terrace in Southwark, London. The Japanese inflected design emphasises the relationship between house and garden (niwa), exploring the concept ofengawa, a covered corridor running along the perimeter of traditional Japanese dwellings. Conceived as a modest, lightweight pavilion, the house is a continuous series of fluid, open-plan spaces, with sliding doors and glazed walls that open up to unify its interior with gardens and courtyards.And finally, after five years shrouded in Christo-like wrappings, the Palace of Westminster’s gleamingly restoredElizabeth Tower and the bongs of Big Benwithin it resume their place at the heart of national life, courtesy of conservation specialists Purcell and a battalion of craftspeople. The most comprehensive repair programme in its 160 years restores Pugin’s original Victorian colour scheme of Prussian blue and gold for the four clock faces, strips away the bodges of previous restoration cycles and adds a new visitor lift, eliminating the ordeal of having to wheeze up 334 steps to the top of the tower.While the project represents a singular triumph of conservation, existential issues continue to assail the rotting, neo-gothic wedding cake of the Palace of Westminster, with its 1,100 rooms, 100 staircases, 31 lifts and three miles of corridors.The story so faris of rising costs as political and public debate grinds on about how to make it remotely fit for purpose.View image in fullscreenFluid and open … Niwa House.Photograph: Felix Koch/Royal Institute of British Architects/PAPredictions about a likely Stirling winner are always a hostage to fortune, but whoever scoops the tiara should know that the Stirling imprimatur is no guarantee of architectural immortality.

No wonder they’re having a moment on restaurant menus. But how hard is this shellfish to prepare at home?Clare FinneyWed 3 Sep 2025 10.58 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 10.59 EDTShareIt might be that they’re cheap. It might be that they’re healthy. But, in all likelihood, it’s “because they are just delicious”, says seafood chefMitch Tonks. Whatever the reason, mussels are having a moment. Where oncemoulesmeantmarinière(the classic French dish with white wine and parsley), now you can find them skewered, popcorned, pickled, barbecued, and even breaded and served in a burger bun.Mussels are making waves not just along the coast of Britain but in restaurants and recipes across the land. And they are being greeted with growing excitement, too, because, unlike the majority of food that becomes a fad, creating spikes in demand that cannot help but damage a group of people or their environment, there are no downsides to going mad for mussels.They are “a no-brainer”, says Charles Banks, co-founder and director ofThe Food People, the global food trends agency. “It’s not often you get those foods that make economic and ecological sense and are delicious as well as healthy.” Ask Banks, Tonks or, indeed, anyone who knows anything about mussels why they are perfect, and the resulting eulogy is like a bivalve version of the sonnet “How do I love thee? Let me count the ways”.View image in fullscreenMussels make sense economically and ecologically, plus they are a great-tasting, healthy food.Photograph: fcafotodigital/Getty Images“They grow quickly, and on their own; they don’t need external feed or chemicals or anything. They just naturally feed from their environment,” says Anthony Pender, the founder of London seafood restaurantFaber, speaking from Wales where he’s visiting one of his mussel suppliers.Câr y Môris Wales’s first regenerative seaweed and shellfish farm, whose goal is to support coastal communities and restore the health of the water – and mussels play a vital role in both. “They grow on ropes, which are strung up, down and along – the perfect example of vertical farming at sea – and they are low-intensity, because they require no inputs, create no waste and the generation of their shells sequesters carbon from the water. Meanwhile, inside, the bivalve is cleaning the water through filter-feeding,” Pender adds, “to the extent there is more wildlife in the water now at Câr y Môr than when they started [mussel farming] six years ago.”This way of feeding is partly what makes mussels so cheap – “They are a genuinely affordable shellfish, which sounds like an oxymoron!” laughs Banks – but it is also what makes them so beneficial for the coastal environment. In Lyme Bay, where Tonks’ mussels are sourced for hisRockfishrestaurants in the south-west and for his canned seafood business, the bay’s biodiversity has been transformed by careful management and mussel-growing ropes, which in 2013 were slung into a seascape decimated by decades of destructive fishing. The filter-feeding process by which the mussels extract nutrients from the water counteracts the effects of eutrophication, caused by the excess run-off of agricultural chemicals. Meanwhile, the infrastructure of the ropes, hanging well below the surface of the waves and heavy with mussels, creates a reef-like haven, encouraging smaller fish to shelter and breed.“They are just a great species,” enthuses chef Jamie Savage, who adds to mussels’ list of qualities omega 3 fatty acids, vitamins A, B and D, and the fact that their shells can be repurposed in dog medicine, chicken food and homeware. So smitten is Savage with mussels, in fact, that he’s dedicated his entire restaurant,Savages Mussels, to them: “I fell in love with them when I was a kid going to Eurocamp in the school holidays. I thought it would be mint to have a restaurant using them in different ways.” Savage, the man behind the mussel burger, has even incorporated them into a chilli. “I think people associate them with being on holiday, so there’s a nostalgia about them, too, which is great – but I wanted to teach people about mussels at home. Since opening, I’ve had forty- and fiftysomethings coming in saying they’ve never had mussels in Macclesfield before!”View image in fullscreenPeople are nervous about preparing mussels.Photograph: Zoonar GmbH/AlamyFor years, many British people were wary of mussels – not of moules marinière in a French bistro, but of preparing them at home, which feels fiddly and fraught with risk. There’s the faff of debearding, and the fear of a having a “dodgy” one, which hangs over mussels as it does all bivalves. “People are nervous about cooking something live,” Tonks accepts, “but the basic rule is, if they stay open when you tap them, discard them, and if they don’t open when you cook them, discard them.” The merits of mussels grown on ropes in the open water means there is far less likelihood of grit and sand in the shells, too, while mussel sourcing and processing has improved greatly in recent decades.Besides, debearding is easy. “I posted a video of my four-year-old daughter doing this recently,” laughs Ben King, founder ofPesky Fish, an online fish market that sources seafood from regenerative sources. Since launching Pesky in 2018, King has seen sales of mussels rise steadily, in part because customers are seeing them more in restaurants and feel more confident about cooking them, but mostly because the average price of more popular fish such as hake and sole has rocketed, making mussels an increasingly attractive choice. “They are our third-most popular line,” King says of his mussels, which are handpicked off beaches in Pembrokeshire and cleaned before being reaching homes 20 hours later.View image in fullscreenMussels can be added to a chowder or a broth, as well as in a traditional bouillabaisse.Photograph: Joff Lee/Getty ImagesNick Jefferson, founder ofWylde Market, another online retailer of regenerative produce, calls them “nature’s fast food”. “In the time you have even placed your Deliveroo order, let alone waited for it to arrive soggy and cold, you could have prepared and cooked mussels,” he points out. “Chillies, wild garlic, sherry – I do all sorts, depending on what’s in the cupboard.” Indeed, there have never been so many mussel recipes out there. Tonks uses them in place of clams inchowder; Nigel Slater pairs themwith pasta and dill; Yotam Ottolenghi steams themalla vodka, or in a spicy, lapsang souchong broth. “They pair just as well with rich, creamy sauces as they do delicate herbs and citruses – and they are a perfect vehicle for deeply spiced and layered broths,” saysGurdeep Loyal, whose latest book,Flavour Heroes, suggests a “marinière” of yuzu koshō and smoky bacon.“The sky’s the limit,” saysMatthew Ryle, executive chef ofMaison Françoisin London. His was one of the first restaurants to make mussels a signature dish, with a warm, parsley-buttered flatbread draped with mussels that is a homage to “that last, best mouthful of a moules marinière, when you dip in the bread to soak up the sauce”. Many other restaurants have follow suit, opening with hero mussel dishes such as the moules farcies snack atWildflowersin central London, the asparagus and mussels atCardinal in Edinburgh, or the cherry-glazed barbecued catfish with dried grated mussels at Ukrainian restaurantSinoin London. “The quality is better, plus it’s a time when chefs and customers are [particularly] conscious of prices, so they are more readily accepted than an oyster,” Ryle continues.View image in fullscreenMussels thrive in the cold, nutrient-rich waters of Shetland.Photograph: Neil McCaffrey/PAThanks to the number of sources around the coast, mussels also tend to transcend the seasons, so they can remain on the menu year-round. When the southern coast gets too warm for mussels to fatten properly, Shetland steps in. “The waters are incredibly cold, deep and full of nutrients,” says Scottish restaurateur Stephen Lironi. His seafood tapas bar in Soho,Maresco, was born of his wish to support small coastal communities in Scotland, for which mussels present a huge economic opportunity, and of his learning how much of Scotland’s seafood gets exported, particularly to Spain.“The Spanish can’t get enough of mussels,” he says. They are fried, then canned, in a variety of sauces, then dished up in tapas bars on potato crisps or toast. “They consider tinned mussels a premium product,” he continues. Yet in Britain, too, the popularity and availability of canned mussels is growing: “We went from a standing start to selling 12,000 tins a year,” Tonks says of his own tinned mussels, which launched only two years ago.Sea Sisters, the only tinned seafood company with a cannery actually in Britain (Tonks’ is in Spain) have championed mussels since the start: “We chose to launch with them in 2021 because they are, in our eyes, the most sustainable protein in the world,” co-founder Charlotte Dawe says. “They have always been a top-selling product. We even have customers who are vegan say they eat mussels, because they are a sustainable and ethical source of protein.” This bivalve veganism, as it’s become known, is premised on the fact that oysters and mussels have no centralised, complex nervous system, or brain, so it follows that killing and consuming them causes them no (or little) suffering.With that knowledge, the only remaining objection to mussels seems to float away. They are ethical as well as sustainable, healthy, affordable and delicious. Concerns around preparing them, which are arguably overstated, are allayed by tins and those supermarket vacuum packs that are a good (if overpriced) option for those who want the taste of “fresh” mussels without the faff. “Having mussels at home feels like being in a restaurant, even though they are easy and cheap,” Ryle says. “We should definitely be cooking more of them.” Meanwhile, the pressure to cut costs and provide more sustainable, great-value options means that, in restaurants, the mussels trend is going nowhere. Banks is right; they are a no-brainer, in every sense of the phrase.Explore more on these topicsFoodSeafoodShellfishfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Today, the creator of Black Books, The IT Crowdand – most popular of all – Father Ted, describes himself as a writer “about the current all-out assault on woman’s rights”.His goals are put in almost biblical terms: “To reveal the havoc gender identity had wrought on society, expose those who had enabled it and help bring about its end.”To his supporters, Linehan is a brave warrior, whose relentless campaigning – online and off – is characterised by some as being ahead of his time, after April’s supreme court judgment that the terms “woman” and “sex” in the Equality Act refer only to a biological woman and to biological sex.Others see monomania and, at times, cruelty.

He had been flagged as wanted when landing at Heathrow and they were there to arrest him and take to him a police station for questioning.“Holy shit, I cannot fucking believe it,” he shouted. “You know what this country looks like from America?

Clothing communicates parts of who we are, what we are interested in and how we want to be seen. It reveals choices that we make – but it also exposes lack of choice.I am a disabled woman; I have dwarfism. My disability and stature is obvious and often shapes a first interaction. I’ve learned to love scouring through rails of clothes in high street stores and charity shops, and taking the items for alterations to make sure they fit. I know that if there are patterns or embroidery near the shoulder or ankle of a garment, altering it won’t work. I’ve found that jeans and trousers have to be elasticated at the back so they go over my hips with ease and don’t gape at the back. I’ve also learned that dresses and skirts should have an asymmetrical hemline to accommodate the curve in my spine. As I’ve got older, I’ve discovered that many of these alterations don’t just work for me, but would also improve comfort, independence and dressing for most people. Accessible design is better design.To show you what this looks like in action: I recently had the pleasure of attending a dinner to mark Jannik Sinner’s return to Wimbledon. Beforehand, I was nervous. I wanted to wear something that would instil confidence, be comfortable and allow me to move about with personality and dignity. I chose a blazer, cashmere jumper and black pants. During my time working in fashion, I had the privilege of building relationships with designers, and this jacket was custom-made by Gucci. The pocket is proportional and the buttons are deliberately placed to be mindful of my figure. The wool pants are also custom-made by Prada and close with a fastener and zip, rather than a button, to avoid dexterity issues, and the back of the waistband is elasticated. The jumper is from Johnstons of Elgin in Scotland – their store is step-free and has rails at multiple levels. I chose it because it needed no alterations; the short-sleeve is mid‑length for me, and wearable throughout the year.For disabled people to be valued consumers, they also need to be decision-makers and leadersI’ve spent almost a decade working in the luxury fashion industry, because I want more choice, more representation and more respect for disabled customers – and across the industry there is lots to celebrate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It features the work of Victoria Jenkins, the disabled designer behind Unhidden, a leading adaptive brand that will be part of this year’s official London Fashion Week.Tommy Hilfiger has an adaptive collection, Liberare creates bras that close at the front rather than the back, Tilt Beauty has a line of products that allow you to put mascara on with greater ease, and Primark has increased representation in the in-store mannequins and begun to make their childrenswear range seam- and label-free for neurodivergent kids. But, we need to think of disabled people as more than customers.In 2020, I foundedTilting the Lens, a strategic accessibility consultancy that aims to create the conditions for disabled people to be successful. We’ve developed a scholarship for disabled designers with Parsons School of Design in New York, and we’ve spent the past year undertaking research with more than 200 disabled people across the UK to develop a white paper on adaptive fashion, to improve understanding of the market and innovation opportunities. We’ve learned so much about making clothing more inclusive, but also the need for stores and real estate, packing and delivery to be accessible, too. I want disabled people to be valued consumers – but for that to happen they also need to be decision-makers, leaders and trustees.Explore more on these topicsFashionDisabilityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Jolly good. Unfortunately, this embrace of transparency does not appear to extend to the poor old customers.At this late stage in the dance to decide Thames’s future, you’d expectLondon& Valley Water – the banner under which the consortium of creditors now sail – to opt for straight-talking and openness. Their pitch to rescue Thames, after all, rests on the analysis that they are the folk to inject the necessary pragmatism into a company that has lived a hand-to-mouth existence for years while promoting fantasy turnaround plans.So how, the customers will want to know, do the consortium’s supposedly “realistic” performance targets measure up against the “unrealistic” ones that were set last December under Ofwat’s final determination? Surely it should be a simple matter to say which have been downgraded and delayed, and which may even have been upgraded or accelerated.There was little of that sort inthe consortium’s breezy description of its plan this week. Instead, there were a handful of selected highlights – 135 fewer pollution incidents a year! 2,500km of sewers to be cleaned! – without saying how the figures and budget allocations differ from previous expectations.The details matter because, as the consortium accepts, Thames will have £20.5bn from customers’ bills to use over the 2025-30 period, rather than the £24bn that the company originally sought. An exercise in prioritisation was therefore inevitable; and, yes, some of the consortium’s choices sound sensible. If 14% of serious pollution incidents at Thames are caused by power failures, then it’s logical to invest in resilient kit as soon as possible. But not everything, obviously, can be a priority. You also have to tell the customers which spending targets have been de-prioritised and which environmental projects you would cut.Equally, it is infuriating to hear yet again about the “billions of pounds of new funding” the consortium is prepared to put into Thames if its plan is signed off by Ofwat and the courts and gets a thumbs up from the government. Come on, the sum always had to be billions because Thames is in a very deep hole; the question is how many billions.The other burning (and related) issue is the size of haircuts on the £16bn of senior debt held by the creditors. At the last outing in June, their numbers implied that they were volunteering for 20% write-downs, a level that was plainly inadequate,as argued here at the time. It was too greedy. Even now, though – a full three months later – there is no hint of a better offer to strengthen the balance sheet.Being generous, one could say that the operational plan, the upfront funding, the haircuts and the governance setup can only be thrashed out between the consortium and Ofwat over the next few weeks, and that it would be mad to put the full version on display when the process could still fall apart.But remember this exercise is running to an unofficial deadline of 22 October, the last day Thames can appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority for a review of Ofwat’s December determination. One does not have to be too cynical to think the tight timetable serves the creditors’ interests if this saga ends in an eleventh-hour showdown between the creditors and government to agree a “market-led” solution to keep Thames out of special administration.The most important missing element in this standoff is the one that is surely of most interest to the 16 million customers: the likely regulatory compromises on service standards and penalties. The way this is saga is going, the details will emerge only after it is too late for outside scrutiny. The lack of transparency is appalling.Explore more on these topicsThames WaterNils Pratley on financeWater industryUtilitiesLondoncommentShareReuse this content"

This show of solidarity and strength, he complained, was nothing less than an attempt to “conspire” against the United States. Trump likes military parades – his own, that is. Even more, he likes to be on the podium, at the centre of attention. He casts himself as world number one. The images coming out of the Chinese capital this week challenged him on all three counts.This puncturing of Trump’s insecure ego, and the striking feebleness of his response, will greatly gratify Xi. Trump’s behaviour towards China since taking office in January has been aggressive, vindictive and patronising by turns. Hispunitive trade tariffs, in particular, have caused unprecedented disruption. Though the worst of the levies are paused until November, they help explain Xi’s repeated insistence China is a proud nation that will not be bullied. At the same time, Trump has talked vaguely about offering a face-to-face summit, as if bestowing a great gift. Parading the Beijing triumvirate was Xi’s pointed riposte.Even by Red Square standards, the Chinese president’sostentatious displayof military might was impressive. The pageantry, anthems, immaculately synchronised, goose-stepping soldiers, tanks, artillery pieces – and even the release of 80,000 bewildered doves – all spoke to China’s rapid advance towards global military parity with Washington. Most worrying for the US navy patrolling the western Pacific was the unveiling of hypersonic, nuclear-capable, long-range missiles and underwater drones. China was “unstoppable,” Xi declared. In marking the end of the second world war, “humanity is again faced with the choice of peace or war, dialogue or confrontation, win-win or zero-sum,” he said. This, too, was an unmistakeable warning aimed at Trump. Whether he heeds it is another matter entirely.For all the trumpets and bayonets, Xi’s overall purpose in orchestrating this grand political and diplomatic, as well as martial, performance was to project China’s future global leadership role, as envisioned and shaped by himself. This is what Xi has been working towards ever since he rose to the top of the Communist party pile in 2012. He hascentralised controlto a greater degree than any leader since Mao Zedong, whose often disastrous leadership he reveres. Criticism of Xi’s missteps – and there have been many, over economic management, jobs, a property crisis and corruption – has brought ever tighter restrictions on corporate, media and personal freedoms. As a surveillance state, China is unquestionably world number one. Xi’s foreign policy, notably towards Taiwan and across the South China Sea region, is fiercely expansionist.By gathering dozens of national leaders, first at last weekend’s biggest-ever annual conference of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) – a potential Eurasian EU equivalent – and then in Beijing, Xi set down a marker whose significance will reverberate far beyond the White House.By their presence, the leaders of Turkey, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Iran and many other actual or would-be rising powers kowtowed to Chinese power. Even India’s leader, Narendra Modi,alienated by Trump’s tariffs, played along, minimising longstanding rivalries with China. The SCO’sjoint declarationin effect endorsed a new, emerging global security and economic order that challenges the post-1945 settlement, directed and dominated by Beijing. It was the latest, triumphalist assertion of Xi’s vision of China as pre-eminent 21st-century power.Little wonder Trump was put out. Yet who would seriously disagree that it is his foolish, provocative antagonising of friends and foes alike with his refurbished, multifaceted brand of neo-imperial US overreach that has induced so many countries to throw in their lot with China? That said, the assumption that the Beijing alliance, with the Xi-Putin-Kim triumvirate at its heart,can hold together long-term, and find constructive, nonmilitary ways to cooperate, is highly questionable.Putin needs Xi’s help right now with Ukraine, but Russia has a historical, visceral fear of Chinese expansionism. North Korea’s Kim – whose regionally destabilising behaviour and perpetual impecuniousness worry Beijing – likewise fears Chinese domination. Or look it another way: both Putin and Xi are in their 70s. They will not be in charge for ever. Their rule is highly personalised. Absent them, in both countries, vacuums beckon. The potential forexplosions of dissent, currently repressed, is massive.Theirs is a three-way partnership of expediency, lacking ideological, intellectual or moral underpinning. They are united in opposition to American hegemony, to a western-dominated financial system based on the dollar, to what they regard as noisome universal standards of human and civil rights. They are all antidemocratic authoritarians to their very marrow. In other words, like hard-right populist demagogues in the US andEurope, they know what they don’t like.Whether they know how to replace that which they would destroy, whether they have any viable, credible idea of alternative global structures that reaches beyond mere national self-interest and political, personal advantage is doubtful. Given the choice, many middle-ranking countriesmight well driftback into the US orbit, if it were led by a more rational, less confrontational president.In 1945, when the UN and the present world order came into being, a shared determination, primarily among western powers, that the catastrophes of two world wars should never be repeated, was central to their decision-making, however imperfect. Any similar sense of altruism is wholly absent today from the pragmatic, performative calculations of the Beijing triumvirate. All of which, it must be said, bodes ill for the world. Looking at Xi, Putin and Kim, plus the isolationist-nihilist Trump, biblical scholars might be forgiven for recalling the four horsemen of the apocalypse: conquest, war, famine and death.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Good news if he used his influence with Trump to terminate this obscenity. Dreadful news if he were to be party to it.The plan itself wasfirst outlinedto an incredulous world by Trump in February. The details havenow emerged. It involves the expulsion – the de facto imprisonment – of 2 million Palestinians, while the US administers the exclave for 10 years. Each Palestinian would bepaid $5,000 each plus four years’ rentsomewhere else and one year’s supply of food. Gaza is then rebuilt as a skyscraper wonderland of artificial intelligence investment and tourism. It would be a second Dubaiyielding up to $400bnfor developers.The scheme’s private contractors would be the same “humanitarian” trustnow supplying foodto the famine-hit territory. Trump said that the Palestinians would be better off “living beautifully in another location”. The Americans might one day see a “reformed and deradicalised Palestinian polity … ready to step in its shoes.” It is inconceivable that the plan would be deemed acceptable anywhere, apart from in Israel.All parties to any war have a moral obligation to plan for its aftermath. As the principal sponsor of Israel’s reaction to the Hamas atrocities of October 2023, the US is now party to the destruction ofover 90% of Gaza’s built environmentandthe killing of 63,000 of its inhabitants. As moral obligations go this must border on unprecedented. But when Israel eventually occupies all of Gaza, it and the US will doubtless claim victors’ rights to do as they please.If morality might have been off the agenda at Blair’s White House meeting, the question is: was reality present? There are plenty of possible futures already being mooted for Gaza. They includeone backed by Egypt and the Arab League statesfor its $53bn reconstruction. Another might be a reversion to the 1993 Oslo settlement, which has been periodically undermined by Hamas and Israel. Another might conceivably include some coalition of Palestinian and Israeli development interests under Israeli control.No realisable plan can involve the mass clearing of any land of its historical population and its theft for colonisation by an alien power.Gazacould never be a second Dubai. It would be an embattled ruin plagued by factionalism and terror. For 10 years Washington would be responsible for an embattled building site, until it got bored and left it to its fate, as it did Saigon, Baghdad and Kabul.The United States may be the world’s most successful state but its attempts at imperialism have been dismal. The first was in the 1900s when Teddy Roosevelt approved the takeover of the Philippines andcoveted parts of the Caribbean and Latin America. Attempts to police the world have constantly led to mission creep into prolonged bouts of intervention. General MacArthur almost succeeded in invading China during the Korean war. Having a global presence went to the head of George HW Bush in Kuwait, when he declared a‘new world order’under American control. He generally acted in keeping with his army chief, Colin Powell’s, later warning that “if you break it, you own it” but he still invaded Somalia.His son, George W Bush, followed his foreign policy adviser Condoleezza Rice’s plea that America’s armed forces not be used as “a global police force. They are not the world’s 911 [call centre]”. Bush agreed until al-Qaida’s 9/11 attacks had him and his neocon colleagues itching for war and nation-building. In Iraq he promised to deliver a democratic Iraq, greater American influence in the Middle East and settlement of the Israel-Palestine conflict. America for a while “owned” south Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq and, for a brief while, Lebanon, all at horrendous cost and loss of life. In every case, the gulf between the stated goal and its realisation was enormous.Noninterventionism has a long and respectable history in the US. Every president toys with it until the trumpets of glory and the sheer power at their disposal summons them to war. The most recent and near hysterical anti-interventionist was none other thanDonald Trump. His hostility to Nato collectivism, his tariff wars and turning against Ukraine, demonstrated a near-obsession with detaching the US from the world’s ills. Not for him the Kennedy/Johnson mission to liberate the world and bring “freedom”.As recently as last May in Saudi Arabia, Trump excoriated “so-called nation-builders [who] wrecked far more nations than they built … intervening in complex societies thatthey did not even understand themselves.”He told his Arab audience that the Middle East had been created “by the people of the region themselves … pursuing your own unique visions and charting your own destinies.” At the time he was arming Benjamin Netanyahu to the teeth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Suddenly, he didn’t look like the loneliest guy in the world, but someone on the brink of unlimited camaraderie and cakeWed 3 Sep 2025 12.56 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 21.30 EDTShareIt’s 6am on an unpromising Saturday, and I’m heading west out of London on the stretch where the A4 runs beneath the elevated M4 – two roads for the price of one choking up the same corridor of air. It’s a bleak spot. Even at midday the sun doesn’t trouble this murk. Distressingly, incredibly, there’s sometimes evidence of human settlement in the grim void between carriageways under the flyover. Shelters cobbled together from scrap wood, you know the kind of thing.It’s the last place anyone should be sleeping, obviously, and no place for a pedestrian, either, at any time of day. But here he was, with dawn barely broken, an old boy bearing a shopping bag. A little stooped and listing to one side, he was making slow progress along the pavement. The poor, poor guy.I wondered where it all went wrong for him. No sooner had I passed him, than I had to stop for a red light. Observing him in my rear-view mirror I noticed, slow-moving as he was, a purpose to his gait. He didn’t have the look of someone wandering without anywhere better to go. It was as the lights changed and I drove away that I clocked that he was wearing a red and white football shirt. Ah, this shone a much happier light on the scene. We were close to the stadium of Brentford FC, who I recalled were playing atSunderlandthat day. And I knew with some degree of certainty that this man was making his way to the ground to take his seat on a supporters’ club coach to convey him there.There are those who, knowing this, may well have felt yet more sorry for him, and even questioned his sanity. A 600-mile (965km) round trip to watch a football match? Madness. But for me, he’d gone from looking like the loneliest man in the world to someone who I knew, today at least, would be anything but lonely. In an instant, I’d gone from feeling sorry for him to being rather envious.Someone else (me) will be convinced – no matter who the opposition is – that defeat is inevitableI’ve spent many a Saturday on coach trips like this, to watch my team, West Bromwich Albion. As a kid, with my grandad, beside myself with excitement, and many times since. These days I’m just as excited, albeit with lower expectations of seeing us win. But the joy of it is less in the football match than the sharing of the journey. Each coach will carry supporters from nippers to ancients, many of whom will be familiar to one another.I’d never wear budgie smugglers – but I did once help smuggle a budgie | Adrian ChilesRead moreBased on my extensive experience, I’d wager that these coaches, whichever club’s supporters they’re ferrying, feature a similar cast of characters. There will be those who’ve not a missed an away game since before some fellow passengers were born. Always there will be someone convinced – no matter who the opposition is – that their team will win. Someone else (me) will be convinced – no matter who the opposition is – that defeat is inevitable. Some passengers will never stop talking, others may never start. Somebody will have baked cakes that will be handed around. Every weekend, it’s a great comfort to me to think of all these travelling slices of life criss-crossing their way up and down the country.It wasn’t until Saturday evening that I checked howBrentfordhad got on at Sunderland. Despite taking the lead – joy – with 20 minutes left to play, Brentford swiftly conceded an equaliser before Sunderland, horror of horrors, scored again to win the match right at the death. Oof. Trust me, it’s a long way back from Sunderland after losing like that, wherever you’re going back to. Come to think of it, it’s a long way back from anywhere after losing like that.As I went to bed near midnight, I thought of my man shuffling home along that same wretched road late in the evening, his stoop more pronounced, his shopping bag empty, but already looking forward to next time.Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFootballOpinionHealth & wellbeingBrentfordSunderlandcommentShareReuse this content"

Or, more to the point, up with them. Please sit up straight and pay attention while I make this very serious in-flight announcement: the airline industry should prevent all seats in basic economy from reclining until the general public has shown they know how to use them responsibly. And by “use them responsibly” I mean: don’t recline. Or, if you must, do so courteously and not for the entire flight.Now, I understand a blanket ban might not be a popular solution. But it is the fairest and most utilitarian approach; whatever small degree of comfort you may achieve by being able to lean back a few inches is outweighed by the misery you inflict on the person behind you. Particularly if said person is trying to work on a laptop, eat a meal or nap on their tray table.Why does the Maga elite love conspicuous cosmetic surgery? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreAs you may have guessed, I am “said person”. Excuse me for airing my first world problems, but I recently had a miserable flight from London to Philadelphia because the person in front of me reclined as soon as we took off, and jiggled around violently in their seat for the next seven hours as if they had bedbugs. A model of passive-aggressive restraint, I didn’t go any further than muttering loudly. But if the trip had been any longer, there might have been an in-flight incident.There have already been numerous air rage episodes sparked by reclining seats. A couple of months ago, a Delta Air Lines passenger was allegedly punched in the chest because of areclining seat altercation. Along with alcohol, seat angles seem to be one of the largest contributing factors to trouble at 30,000ft. With air rage incidentson the risein the US, surely a ban is a no-brainer.Speaking of no-brainers, this feels like a job for Donald Trump. The Trump administration recently tookmanagement of Union Station, Washington’s main railway terminal, away from Amtrak. Surely our dear leader now needs to show the airlines who is boss? Trump has the power to fix our reclining seat crisis with just one phone call. Use that power, Mr President: bring peace to the Middle Seat.

But with the far right looming, we need action not despairJohn McDonnell is the MP for Hayes and Harlington. He was shadow chancellor for Labour from 2015 to 2020Wed 3 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 07.30 EDTShareThe Labour party is facing one of the most dangerous moments in its history, possibly an existential threat. Not only is it adrift in the polls, losing one council byelection after another, and with a leader whose popularity has plummeted; but the main threat comes from the xenophobic hard right in the shape ofReform UK.Labour has to wake up to this threat and seize the moment. It must take five basic steps to recovery:1. Stop diggingMost of Labour’s woes are of its own making. Thewinter fuel allowance debacle, thedisability benefits cuts rebellion, the refusal to scrap thetwo-child limiton benefits and, of course, Gaza. Continuing tosend arms to Israelthat are used to murder children, refusing to break the aid blockade and deploying a contorted logic todelay recognition of the Palestinian state, merely compound things.Then to cap it all theproscription of Palestine Actionresulted in the bizarre sight of an 83-year-old priestbeing arrestedalongside hundreds of others – with more to come.So step one is to stop making ludicrous political decisions that are systematically alienating section after section of our core support, and masking much of the good work being undertaken by ministers in their departments.2. ListenStep two is to simply listen to your supporters, party members, councillors and MPs.MPs are coming back from their constituencies with honest warnings of the anger at some of Labour’s policies and the behaviour of senior politicians, including the acceptance of tacky giftsand freebies. They have not only been ignored but have been met with threats of disciplinary action and even loss of the whip.The forcing of Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana out of the Labour party could have immense electoral consequences, which my colleague Richard Burgon has described as Labour losing votes to the left but, as a result, losing seats to the right.The complacent response from party strategists that Labour voters have nowhere else to go is no longer accurate as our supporters stay at home, vote Green or vote independent – or now could vote for thenew leftwing party.This can be avoided by remaking our party as a truly representative broad church, where differences of view are not just allowed but welcomed for strengthening the process in which our decisions are made.View image in fullscreenA rally against planned disability benefit cuts in Parliament Square, London, 30 June 2025.Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/Reuters3. Stop mimicking FarageStep three has to be: stop dancing to Farage’s tune, stop aping his policies. Public understanding of asylum is largely shaped bythe media coverageof the dinghies landing on our shores and the xenophobic rantings of Farage.Those images can be erased by swift decision-making and by establishing safe routes and returns, re-engaging with our European partners to create a Europe-wide strategy.Hotels would become unnecessary if asylum decisions are made swiftly and people are allowed to work, settle and contribute to our economy and society. After Brexit – and with an ageing population – our economy needs a wide range of skills to achieve the government’s growth objectives.To immediately reduce the numbers of those trapped in hotels waiting for a decision at present, the Refugee Council has proposed that we introduce a temporary amnesty for refugeesfrom places such as Sudan, Syria and Eritrea, which are the countries from which asylum seekers are almost automatically given status at the moment.4. Go big this autumnAlthough the asylum issuehas risen in prevalence in the polls, I doubt if many people have had much direct engagement with asylum seekers. But they do have a daily engagement with the cost of living, balancing their income with their outgoings, dealing with ever-rising food and energy bills, their rent and mortgages, and frequently accessing local public services. The forthcoming budget could be a turning point on the issues that really shape people’s lives.We need a big budget.So step four is introducing a huge agenda-setting budget in which we begin to transform people’s lives by tackling the cost of living. A cost-of-living budget would use fair taxation of wealth and excess profits to address the grotesque levels of inequality in our society and the 14.3 million now living in poverty,including 4.3 million children.That could mean redistributing wealth by equalising capital gains tax with income tax and levying a windfall tax on the recent massive profits of the banking and finance sector. Likewise bringing forward a financial transaction tax to correct the anomalies of stamp duty on share sales, introducing a wealth tax on multimillionaires and developing a land value tax.Alongside measures to reduce costs such as rent controls, a fair taxation system would provide the resources to boost the rebuilding of our public services after 14 years of austerity cuts, and to overcome the years of public sector pay cuts and benefit freezes.The very best way of securing the growth the government is crying out for is to put money in people’s pockets, especially the people on low and average incomes who will spend, not hoard like the rich. But all of this will be to no avail without step five.5. The spirit of LabourWe desperately need a Labour government that behaves like Labour. That lives up to its traditions. That truly reflects the best of our country’s culture.It must be a Labour party that advocates for a caring society, where we aim to manage the economy and society in the interests of the many, and where we always live up to our international and humanitarian responsibilities and values.These are core requirements. If the current leadership are not capable of playing this role, then the question has to be asked about whether there is an alternative.For some, this will mean chancing support for the new leftwing party. For others, fearful of splitting the vote and opening the door for Reform, the alternative is a change of Labour leadership and a reclaiming of the party as what it should and must be: a truly democratic broad church of socialist and progressive opinion.John McDonnell is the MP for Hayes and Harlington.

Rachel Reeves mustn’t repeat the mistake with rules markets don’t demandWed 3 Sep 2025 13.48 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 21.30 EDTShareIn 1995, Nick Leeson, a 28-year-old trader for Barings Bank, brought down the City’s oldest finance house by, among other things, betting that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) couldn’tkeep rates lowafter a financial crash led to a government borrowing spree. The devastatingKobe earthquakewas the final blow. The BoJ cutrates, bond prices rose and his losses spiralled to $1.4bn. His failed gamble that markets would beat Japan sank Barings.Barings’ collapse is perhaps a spectacular example of the “widowmaker” trade, where speculators think they can outsmart Japanese authorities. They’ve ended up with egg on their face as their gamble on Japan losing fiscal control proved misguided. Japan, with its own currency and a central bank working with the government, shows how the state shapes markets, not the other way round.Britain seems to have forgotten this lesson with talk of “bond vigilantes”. True, the UK is very different from Japan. But in economic terms there are similarities: both borrow in their own currency; both have floating exchange rates; both are net importers of food and fuel, leaving them vulnerable to imported inflation. Yet only one has built a resilient economic model around these facts. And it isn’t Britain.Sterling’srecent drophas made headlines. But its long-term value, as economistJohn T Harveypoints out, is determined by foreign exchange trading. In the case of the pound and the yen, foreign exchange turnover exceeds trade by more than 100 times. However, interest rates, unemployment, inflation and trade flows are indicators that determine short-term currency prices disproportionately because whatever traders think is true becomes fact as it then moves the market. AsGeorge Sorosnoted, traders’ perceptions matter, and are driven less by facts than by whether the City regards the government as competent.That insight should liberate policy. The UK can and should run fiscal deficits to fund agreen industrial strategy– investing in domestic manufacturing, energy security and a strong export base. Investing in industrial capacity and public goods strengthens the economy, helps reduce inequalities and reduces vulnerability over time.It would also address the UK’s persistent current account deficit. Britain imports more than it exports – and this deficit, by necessity of accounting, is offset by capital inflows, not because they fund government spending. The upshot is Japan is a net capital exporter, while the UK has become addicted to short-term inflows intoproperty, financial instruments, and speculative assets – flows that can reverse sharply, as seen in the 2022 gilt crisis.Which brings us toLiz Truss. Her downfall wasn’t caused by borrowing per se, but by doing it for the wrong reasons. Sacking Treasury officials, bypassing institutional safeguards and promising unfunded tax cuts for the wealthy during a bout of high inflation showed not boldness, but a breakdown in basic statecraft. It wasn’t a macroeconomic crisis but a governance crisis.Rachel Reeves risks a different mistake: adopting fiscal rules to appease markets but that ignore reality. Rather than the self-imposed arbitrary constraints, which she already changed lastOctober, the Labour party should be bold and get rid of them altogether. Better the budget features a shortstatementof how government plans will affect the economy – on trade, inflation and investment. It should be voters, not markets, who decide what’s credible.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This is most obvious in healthcare, where medical science drives change all the time: weight loss drugs,genetic cancer tests, and so on. Thebenefits and risks of AIare another theme, from education tocriminal justice. But some of those involved in trying to improve public services are taking a strikingly different tack. Their work centres not on machines but on relationships.This might sound like common sense. Pretty well everyone recognises the value of an inspiring teacher or trusted social worker.Wes Streetinghas stressed his support for Labour’s policy of “bringing back the family doctor, so patients can see the same doctor for each appointment”.But despite such pledges, the connections between people are too often overlooked when public services are designed and thought about – and this is one of the problems that a current project, Changing Futures, seeks to address. Like the Tories’Troubled Familiesprogramme, led by Louise Casey, Changing Futures targets help at the crisis-prone households that appear to be least well served by existing services. Its particular focus is a population of up to 400,000 people in England who are regarded as highly vulnerable due to some combination of addiction, homelessness, mental illness, domestic violence and involvement in crime.Funding runs until next year, so formal evaluations are not due for some time. But one project, in Northumbria, haspublished descriptions of the “liberated method”through which its practitioners try to break down silos, in order to deliver the kind of person-centred support that is the programme’s guiding principle.Face-to-face work is central, and an approach its leaders describe as “high support and high challenge”. This is informed by methods from the world ofaddiction recovery(AA and its offshoots), including the role of peer-group mentors with lived experience. The rationale is that while current services are configured to address discrete issues (housing, employment and so on), the bigger picture also needs to be seen.Judging from past experience, the prospect of such projects shaping the reform of services nationally is remote – although local leaders might find ways to embed them. Our overcentralised system of government means that most change comes from Whitehall. But the Changing Futures teams are not the only ones banging the drum for relational public services. Ministers made the mistake of undermining their £1bn investment in employment support by linking it to disability benefit cuts. But their Get Britain Working plan does recognise the importance of personalised help – in preference to sanctions. In the words of one adviser at acharity visited by Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, “everything in this business of getting people back into work is about relationships”.In both the benefits context, and Changing Futures, saving money is a big part of the motive for trying new things. The people being supported by the latter include heavy users of crisis services, such asA&E departments. The underfunding of existing services and chronic lack of affordable homes, which make people vulnerable in the first place, must never be overlooked. But that doesn’t mean nothing creative can come of efforts to reconfigure support. Trying to improve public services is a core duty of government.

If I turned up in their street in a balaclava and put up a dozen EU flags, would they regard this as a neutral act? It would, of course, be a political statement.There is also the matter of permissions. As a city councillor I spend a good part of my time having unauthorised displays removed. This is mostly graffiti, but includes signboards and advertisements. Very few residents want a free-for-all on the streets, and the same applies to unauthorised flags.I have asked the council to remove the small number of flags that have appeared in my area, plus the red stripe graffiti on traffic roundabouts. It’s clear they are nothing to do with celebrating our country, but a far-right attempt at intimidation. Genuine patriots don’t hide behind masks and disregard local community rules.Cllr Phil DavisBillesley Ward, BirminghamIn the 1920s the Nazis adopted a Buddhist peace symbol (the swastika) and made it their own. Anyone flying one now is assumed to be a Nazi, not a Buddhist. Its hard on all the Buddhists, but here we are.In the UK, the St George’s cross is mostly seen at far-right demonstrations, like the one at which gangs of violent thugs attempted to burn down a hotel, with the immigrant residents inside.Anyone flying the St George’s cross now is assumed to be a far-right racist. It’s hard on all the patriots, but here we are. It no longer means what it used to.Neil KnowlesLondonRecently in Birkenhead, Wirral, a union jack was tied to the railings of a Muslim centre. It was untied and flown from the windows. While intended to cause offence, the leaders told the BBC that “a strong and powerful response would be to show that this is our flag and we are proud British Muslims”. Maybe it is time for all organisations hated by the far right to reclaim their flag. Most British people and businesses are not generally flag flyers, but as a regular visitor to Wales, I am very used to seeing the Welsh people’s pride in their nation shown in the use of their national flag.Lorna WalkerLiverpoolThe far rightshould not be allowed to take over national symbols, such as the flag. Take the example of Brazil, where in 2018-19 the far right took to the streets campaigning with the green and yellow Brazilian flag and wearing national football shirts, claiming they were patriots in opposition to the “others” that were not. To oppose it, the left flew the red flag of the PT (the local workers’ party) and wore red shirts.From that time on, the far right fixed national symbols to their ideology, and the centre or left opposition was not able to recover them. So, I would strongly recommend that Britons hang on to their national symbols. It is important that the government, as well as all democratic parties, clearly state that they support the national flag, that they all are patriots too.Nelson A RochaCascais, PortugalExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumBritish identity and societyRaceNazismBuddhismThe far rightFar rightlettersShareReuse this content"

Plus letters fromMarjorie WallaceandProf John GallacherWed 3 Sep 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 12.42 EDTShareAs a single parent of a child with suspected autistic traits, I find Bridget Phillipson’s comments deeply unfair (Bridget Phillipson: parents must do more about bad behaviour and attendance in schools, 31 August).Each morning can take me up to two hours just to get my daughter into school. Despite all my efforts, she is often absent due to severe anxiety. I am on my knees with exhaustion. The struggle makes it almost impossible to plan working days or earn a stable income, and I receive no benefits.For more than two years I have tried to access child and adolescent mental health services support. We have only recently been accepted on to the neurodiversity pathway, yet face a further nine-month wait for assessment. In the meantime, there is no meaningful help. Our school does what it can, but cuts to children’s services mean families like mine are left to cope alone.Parents are already doing everything possible. What we need is a government that acknowledges these realities and invests in proper special educational needs and disabilitiesand mental health support, not one that simply tells us to “do more”.Katherine GreenLondonJeremy Hunt’s dismissal of vital support for disabled children as a “cash transfer” stings for parents, like me, who have disabled children (Overdiagnosis of children overlooks that growing up is ‘messy and uneven’, says Jeremy Hunt, 27 August). While other kids learn, play and have fun at their schools and nurseries, my deafblind son Harvey breaks down. We couldn’t get the funding for a nursery place that best meets his needs, so now he doesn’t eat, and gets so distressed he pulls out his cochlear implants.Battling the system to find an appropriate nursery feels lonely and isolating, but in many ways it’s worse to know I am far from alone. Research from Sense, the national disability charity, shows almost half of parents with disabled children have struggled to find a school that meets their child’s needs, meaning there are thousands of children across the country missing out on the support and education they need to get the best start in life.This isn’t about overdiagnosis or children not having enough “resilience” – it’s about cuts to public services that leave children like my son paying the price. This will have lifelong consequences.Behind all this talk are real families like mine, desperate for more investment in this failing system, so children like Harvey can get the support they need.Kimberly HindClitheroe,LancashireStatements about overdiagnosis of mental health problems do not allow for different thresholds of distress. Some people can ride out symptoms, while others experience acute difficulty and despair. The shift in awareness and recognition of conditions, often perpetuated by social media, has helped to make certain labels fashionable and, along with the impact of some campaigns, there will be individuals who self-diagnose.But there is ample evidence that there has been a worrying escalation in the number of young people, especially girls, with anxiety and depression, and a rise in hospital admissions for eating disorders, self-harm and attempted suicide.It does not make economic let alone humane sense to underestimate too readily those who may be struggling in silence but need urgent help, as two-thirds of later and lifelong mental illness starts in adolescence.Marjorie WallaceChief executive, SaneSally Weale’s article reflecting on overdiagnosis of mental health conditions in young people will touch many raw nerves, particularly in parents with teenagers. The debate as framed puts these parents between a rock and a hard place. While we want the best possible support for our children, we don’t want them to be labelled without good cause.Framing the debate around diagnosis rates creates an illusionary binary model of health: either you are well, or you are not; either you have an anxiety disorder, or you don’t. The reality, however, is very different. We all sit on a continuum of cognitive and emotional wellbeing: we all have good days and bad days. However, crises apart, there is greater value in improving the wellbeing of everyone, especially for those at most risk.Surprisingly, improving the wellbeing of the population as a whole also helps the most vulnerable. It reduces their vulnerability and in so doing reduces the number who need professional support. This not only reduces health service burden but increases accessibility for those at most risk.An unlooked-for benefit of the mental health crisis in young people might be a national conversation on the kind of society we want, and how this can be achieved to the benefit of everyone.Prof John GallacherOxfordHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Before that, it was a “challenge” for Rachel Reeves (12 August)(22 July), a “gloomy autumn” (22 July)“UK economy shrinks unexpectedly in blow to Rachel Reeves” (14 March) and a “generational shift” in investment (10 June). Reeves must  feel like Mary Earps, keeping goal with balls flying at her from multiple directions! But the more serious take on this is the tendency for the media, including the Guardian, to push the narrative of a fragile economy whose health is subject to very short-term, daily events.This is a narrative derived from the bond markets, which strive to reduce long-term stability to short-term volatility in order to multiply transactional opportunities. The time has long passed to exert the kinds of control on “casino capitalism” that were scrapped in the 1970s, and to reassert the priority of long-term thinking. There is no sign of Reeves doing that – in fact, almost the opposite. Some bond marketeers seem confident that the chancellor needs to keep the bond markets onside. Does she really? Perhaps we should start by challenging the narrative.Prof Saville KushnerLiverpoolWith the British government’s need to balance the budget by raising taxes, why is there not more discussion about taxing people for polluting, given the worsening climate crisis?Why not consider bringing back vehicle taxes based on emissions (though be realistic about what plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) do – mine averages 120 miles per gallon, not the 250mpg claimed); increase taxes on aviation fuel, tax frequent flyers, tax heavy SUVs that enter cities, tax cruise ships that use diesel generators when they are docked. There are many taxes that can help reduce such harm to our planet. So,Rachel Reeves, take the blinkers off please, and also don’t be so afraid to tell greedy vested interests to get stuffed.This government has, to its credit, started anincentive for production to buyEVs produced using greener methods, so why not tax producers who use the most polluting methods?Dave HollisNorwichHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

However, I cannot agree with his argument that we should focus on the violence that a significant number of men involved in the protests, and riots following Southport last year have shown to women.I think this would be like a red rag to a bull to the many protesters not involved in crimes of domestic violence. They would simply call it out as a lefty slur against all men protesting against immigration. This is, therefore, no more of a nuanced argument than calling people Nazis and fascists. Calling men out as wife-beaters simply won’t cut it.Having said that, I believe Renton is also wrong on Tommy Robinson. He may not reference Hitler’s Mein Kampf, butdeliberately targetssingle Muslim men, a fact Renton acknowledges. Robinson is an Islamophobe. If we can’t get that blatant fact out there as our argument, then I’m afraid we are, as they say, screwed.Desmond HewittMarlborough, WiltshireThe charge of fascist has been used far too loosely in response to official behaviour for decades, and, unless people have studied modern history, there’s a good chance that it means nothing to them. But “racist” is clear, unambiguous, and justified. There’s too much talk of “legitimate concerns”, enabling racists to claim that they are acting for their communities. Racism must be called out and confronted, or otherwise it will become the dominant, respectable route to government in our democracy.Rod PennyPoole, DorsetI admire David Renton’s optimism about how to combat those protesting outside hotels, but, as shown with Brexit, Trump (twice) and many public policies, you can’t fight feelings with facts.Richard WetherellLondonSurely one way to disarm the “jelly-bellied flag-flappers” (Rudyard Kipling) would be for counter-demonstrators to put aside all distaste and themselves turn up en masse bearing St George’s flags.Paul RoperBridport, DorsetHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Less than eight weeks after she had been double-bagelled by the Polish star in the final at the All England Club, the 24-year-old American struck back with fearless ball-striking and nerveless resolve to reach her first US Open semi-final.Swiatek, a six-time major champion and the 2022 US Open winner, looked intent on reprising the script when she broke immediately to extend her personal run to 13 consecutive games in the rivalry. But the eighth-seeded Anisimova struck back on her third break point, finishing with a thumping forehand overhead that drew a roar from the Arthur Ashe crowd and ensured this would bear no resemblance to the rout in July. “Honestly, when I wasn’t able to hold in that first game, I was really, like, OK, here we go,” Anisimova admitted afterwards. “Winning that first game kind of took some stress off my shoulders. Once I got it, I was easing into the match.”Djokovic unsure if he’ll be fit enough to beat Alcaraz in US Open semi-finalsRead moreThe opening set was tightly wound and fiercely contested, Anisimova fending off break point with a crisp backhand down the line at 2-2 and Swiatek producing her best point of the match, a 17-shot exchange capped with a forehand overhead, to keep pace at 3-4.With Swiatek serving at 4-5, Anisimova forced two set points and converted the second when her rival sprayed a forehand long. In 50 minutes she had pocketed the opener, winning 12 of 17 points on her opponent’s second serve with the kind of incendiary hitting and baseline aggression that have long been her trademarks.Swiatek, whose summer haul already included titles at Wimbledon and Cincinnati, tried to reassert herself at the start of the second, breaking for 2-0 as the crowd stirred uneasily. Anisimova refused to retreat, holding firm from 15-30 and then lashing a forehand return winner to create double break point in the fourth game. A ballistic backhand sealed the break back and from there the American never let go of the initiative.Swiatek’s usually impenetrable composure began to crack as her first-serve percentage dipped and the intensity of the duress mounted. Serving at 3-4 she faltered again, coughing up the decisive break with her third double fault of the set. Moments later Anisimova secured her place in the last four with a backhand winner that clipped the net cord and tumbled over.“Today was definitely different than any other match I’ve played because of the circumstances,” said Anisimova, who was born in central New Jersey and grew up in Florida. “I really tried to prepare myself mentally over the last 24 hours, more than physically. I came out there with not an ounce of fear. I was constantly moving and trying to pump myself up, which is not something I usually do. I felt like I was really supporting myself, and that helped me play better.”She also revealed she had revisited the trauma of Wimbledon the night before. “Nobody told me to, but I watched it back, as painful as it was, just to see what I can avoid or what went wrong,” she said. “Then I had to watch some good highlights to remove that from my brain. I think it was important for me to see what happened last night going into today’s match. I realised I was so slow in that final. But it happens, I’m human. Some people freeze sometimes.”View image in fullscreenAnisimova and Iga Swiatek embrace at the net.Photograph: Cristóbal Herrera/EPASwiatek, candid in defeat, pointed to her serving struggles. “From the baseline I felt it was good, but the serve made the difference,” she said. “Amanda was winning more points from her serve, and I struggled to make first serves in. She returned the ball so well from my second serve. That made the difference.”She stressed that Wimbledon hadn’t given her a false sense of security: “It didn’t matter to me. Everybody knows how Amanda can play. She didn’t play well at Wimbledon, but it’s not like she’s always going to make the same mistakes. Today everything was different.”For Anisimova, who took a mental-health hiatus in 2023 and only last year clawed her way back into the top 50, the win was both cathartic and historic. Already a finalist at Wimbledon this summer and a semi-finalist at Roland Garros in 2019, she has now delivered her breakthrough on home soil. She is also the first American woman since Serena and Venus Williams in 2002 to reach the semi-finals on all three surfaces at grand slam events.She crunched nearly twice as many winners (23) as unforced errors (12) and controlled the tempo throughout, rushing Swiatek with the depth of her groundstrokes and holding her nerve in the biggest moments. “Today is definitely the most meaningful victory I’ve had in my life,” she said. “It’s the farthest I’ve ever gone at the US Open and it feels surreal. I feel like I’ve proved to myself that I can really go head-to-head with the top players.”On Thursday she will face either Naomi Osaka or Karolína Muchová for a place in the final. “Both are incredibly tough opponents,” she said. “Naomi has won four grand slams and she looks like she’s really found her groove. Karolina is so crafty and I love watching her play. Either way it will be really difficult, but I’m looking forward to it.”As will the Ashe stadium crowd that will firmly be in her corner. Fifty-three days after her Wimbledon heartbreak, she has given New York a comeback story to savour.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Iga SwiatekUS Open tennisTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

After the start of the Vuelta a España’s 11th stage was the latest major cycling race to be disrupted by pro-Palestinian human rights protesters, race organisers took the decision to neutralise the finish as it became clear the finish line in Bilbao could be targeted.It was a call made to protect the safety of the cyclists but it also potentially denied a visibly frustrated Tom Pidcock a first stage win at the Spanish Grand Tour. The Briton attacked on the final climb and achieved the rare feat of troubling Jonas Vingegaard, the man in the leader’s red jersey, but the battle was not allowed to reach a proper conclusion.Jay Vine takes Vuelta stage 10 as Juan Ayuso attacks UAE team ‘dictatorship’Read moreThe Dane did get back in touch with Pidcock on Alto de Pike and the pair were pulling away from the other general classification favourites on the run into Bilbao when the stage was waved off.The riders were informed just after passing the point with 20km to go about the decision to halt the stage 3km out from the original finish line, but Pidcock was not aware of where that point was on the course and was still in race mode when the marshals flagged the leaders off.The Q36.5 ProCyclingrider gave a measured interview after the race, stressing that he “didn’t want to say anything political” but, having had to duck under a protester’s banner on the penultimate climb, he was keen to make the point about rider safety.“It’s hard to describe the disappointment,” Pidcock said. “I felt like today was my day. I feel like there should always be a finish line, we’re not riding a fucking sportive, are we? It’s not easy, the Vuelta did what they could to keep us safe.“A lot of people have held back from talking about it publicly but it is a bit scary sometimes in the peloton. I think as long as our safety is first then we can continue racing and that’s what we’re here to do. I think bike racing has got nothing to do with what is happening in other … yeah.”Asked if he had a message for the protestors, he said: “I think putting us in danger isn’t going to help your cause, that simply isn’t going to help what they’re protesting for. Everyone has the right to protest whatever they want – putting us in danger is not the way forward.”The main target of protest is the Israel-Premier Tech team, who were stopped last week during the time trial by activists holding Palestinian flags. A stage held in the fiercely independent Basque region ofSpainwas always going to be a potential flashpoint, with the local political party EH Bildu calling for Israel‑Premier Tech’s withdrawal from the Vuelta in the buildup.View image in fullscreenTom Pidcock  broke away in the final kilometres to come to the premature finish first.Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty ImagesThere have been reports that riders want Israel-Premier Tech to withdraw amid concerns over their safety, but no one has gone on the record with that demand. The Professional Cyclists’ Association released a statement after the disruption at the start of the stage, saying: “Everyone has the right to protest but this cannot be done at the expense of athletes who are doing their job.”Calling on the Spanish security services to do “everything in their power” to ensure rider safety, the CPA statement also said: “It is unacceptable that associations, whatever their nature or motivations, should allow themselves to compromise the safety and physical integrity of athletes on the road.“Cycling is a demanding sport that requires total dedication and superhuman effort from riders. They face extreme physical challenges on a daily basis, and it is unacceptable that external threats should add to these difficulties. The CPA will never tolerate irresponsible and dangerous actions by a minority that endanger the lives of our members.”GC times were taken at 3km from the finish and Pidcock did take two seconds off Vingegaard by coming over the top of Alto de Pike first. The British rider moved into the podium places as Norway’s Torstein Træen (Bahrain-Victorious), who started the day second, had been dropped earlier in the stage.Amid a week of brutal climbing for the peloton, the famous L’Angliru climb awaits the riders on stage 13 but before then Thursday features two categorised climbs, including the Collada de Brenes, a 7.7km drag at an average gradient of nearly 8%.Explore more on these topicsVuelta a EspañaCyclingSpainnewsShareReuse this content"

In the model discussed on Wednesday, a 12-team County Championship Division One would be split into two pools of six, with the remaining six clubs in Division Two.At least 12 out of 18 counties must vote in favour to alter the structure of the Championship, which has led to a standoff. Surrey, Yorkshire, Middlesex, Essex and Somerset have publicly stated they will oppose any reduction to the 14-game season, while Derbyshire, Sussex and Kent are also yet to be convinced by the various alternatives offered to the status quo.The 10-strong advocates of a restructure are equally reluctant to back down, however, which led to more informal discussions between the counties on Wednesday over whether any of the previously rejected models can be revived. Those include three conferences of six, a single 18-team league with a Champions League-style Swiss-model fixture list, a midseason split similar to that of the Scottish Premier League, as well as several different variants of the current 10/8 divisional makeup.With 83% of players in a survey last year expressing concern over their physical wellbeing because of the volume of domestic cricket played, the PCA will continue to lobby hard for a cut. The possibility of a players’ strike has been mooted by some of the unhappy county executives, although that dramatic course of action has yet to be discussed in any detail.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I wasn’t in a good place. It was about more than what happened in that match. There’s a lot that people didn’t and don’t know about.”Shaw is speaking for the first time about her decision towithdraw from Manchester City’s League Cup semi-final against Arsenalin February, four days after she hadsuffered horrific racist abusefollowing a4-3 loss against the same sidein the Women’s Super League. Manchester City said they were “appalled” and reported the matter to the police.“It was pretty scary to some extent,” adds Shaw, the WSL top scorer in the past two seasons. “But I’m lucky enough to have my family, my friends and those that care about me close. They’ve been there and supported me and helped me throughout that tough period.”The Jamaica international wants to see more done to protect players, particularly female players, who don’t have the same levels of security or representatives to run social media accounts for them as male players do.“There needs to be a lot more accountability as well because we can only talk for so much,” says Shaw. “We can do our actions on the pitch but if it’s the same cycle of abuse over and over again then they’ll feel they can always get away with it. We need the higher-ups to do something about it because otherwise year on year on year we’re going to see more of the same.”View image in fullscreenThe striker says ‘there was more to the abuse than what the majority knew’, but that the time does not yet feel right to reveal the details.Photograph: Andrea Southam/WSL/FA/Getty ImagesShaw, the human at the centre of the storm, is not ready to talk about the details of what she faced or where her head was at, and there should be no pressure on her to ever have to do so. Sitting at a table set up on the astro of City’s indoor pitch, Shaw shares the frustration that the onus is on her, orJess Carter, or other Black players, to speak up on racism. “It’s not right,” she says. “There was more to it all than what the vast majority knew and, when I have time and when it’s right, I’m definitely going to speak on it. For now I just want to focus on the season and the first game.”Ambitions for the new season are high. Last campaign, with a disappointing City side crippled by injuries and a little rudderless, Gareth Taylor was sacked on the eve of four back-to-back games against the eventual treble winners, Chelsea. City’s former manager Nick Cushing stepped in but they finished trophyless and fourth in the WSL table, one point behind Manchester United, missing out on Champions League qualification.View image in fullscreenShaw says the mood at City has been transformed by Andrée Jeglertz’s arrival as head coach.Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty ImagesAndrée Jeglertz, who was in charge of Denmark at the Euros, is the coach charged with guiding them through their next phase. Sometimes change, regardless of what it is, is needed. “100%,” says Shaw. “You find that we have energy we didn’t have before. For whatever reason, I don’t understand why. The energy has definitely been different and definitely been better, possibly because it’s new and we don’t know what to expect. That drives the training more every day.”The Swedish coach has been clear about what he wants to see. “He’s made it known from the get-go exactly what he wants from this group,” says Shaw. “He told us that he’s not trying to change us dramatically as players. We’re just trying to grasp the information and implement it as best as possible on the pitch to ensure when the first game comes, we are at least at a level to go out and perform at our best.”Shaw was one of the many City players sidelined last season, with a foot injury meaning she started only 10 league games. Despite that she shared the golden boot with Arsenal’s Alessia Russo, having scored 12 goals before her injury.“It was definitely my weakest season,” she says. “I started the season really well and unfortunately I had an injury that was out of my control, a fractured foot. Can’t really do much with that. I didn’t know I’d won the golden boot until the last day, on the pitch when they announced it, because that was nowhere in my thought. I was mentally not in a good place because I knew I couldn’t help the team the way I wanted to; as a player that’s what you want to be able to do, to be available for every game.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was tired. Come November I’d played every game, I was definitely tired. Physically and mentally it can be a lot.”Now, though, the 28-year-old is feeling refreshed going into the new campaign. “Body’s feeling good, I feel positive and mentally I’m in a good place,” she says. She is also looking forward to developing her on-pitch relationship with Vivianne Miedema, which was only glimpsed last season.“We spoke about it and I think we only played three full games together, which is crazy,” says Shaw. “We’re both in a good place at the moment, so it’s just about building now and then coming into the season, hopefully we’re ready.”The pair will strike fear into the heart of every defence in the league, starting with Chelsea in the WSL opener at Stamford Bridge on Friday. Shaw is dismissive of the narrative last summer that questioned whether they could play together. “I definitely say we can play together, I don’t know why people questioned who will start. Viv is not just a goalscorer, she can also assist goals, she likes playing in the No 10.”The goal this season could not be clearer: win the league. “It’s City we’re talking about,” says Shaw. “The ambition has to be there. It’s always fine margins. Two years ago we lost the league on goal difference. So it’s not like we’re far off.“No Champions League is the reality. We’re in this position, we have a game every Sunday and that game should be the most important and that’s how we’re going to attack each game. Ultimately we have no excuse to not go and win the league.”Explore more on these topicsManchester City WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballRaceinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Its case centred on connections between the Brazilian and 27 of the 253 individuals who placed apparently suspicious bets on him to be booked in one or more of the four games, with combined bets of £47,000 bringing a profit of £167,000.The commission concluded there was no evidence of corruption and that the unusual betting patterns were more likely explained by the “rather random passing of ‘hot tips’ or perceived ‘inside information’ within Brazil than a spot-fix”.The three-person panel accepted Paquetá’s testimony that there was frequently talk of betting, including on the player himself, among his family and friends, and that it would defy logic for individuals involved in a spot-fix to be so “loose” with relevant information and tips. It also noted that the FA failed to find any mention of the case or any discussion of betting on two mobile phones belonging to Paquetá which it seized as evidence.View image in fullscreenLucas Paquetá (centre) training with Brazil this week ahead of their World Cup qualifiers.Photograph: Ricardo Moraes/ReutersThe commission’s report is particularly damning of the FA betting integrity investigator, Tom Astley, who was also the governing body’s chief witness. The failure to produce an independent assessment of the betting data is described as “surprising” and the commission noted that the FA appeared to contradict the statements of its main witness.Jonathan Laidlaw KC, the FA’s main prosecutor, disagreed with Astley’s description of the betting patterns as “highly orchestrated”, a difference of interpretation the commission concluded was concerning. “The clear appearance given to the commission was that the FA was not altogether certain what case it was presenting against the player,” it said.The commission reviewed bet‑by‑bet data for 33 individuals and concluded there was no evidence of a spot-fix. The report notes that the bettors did not place the maximum stake permitted, which would be expected if there were a spot-fix, and the fluctuating number of bets on each of the four matches was also interpreted as the bettors acting on tips rather than attempting a fix.Paquetá’s on-field performance was also analysed by the commission, with his former manager at West Ham, David Moyes, and the former referee Mark Clattenburg giving evidence on his behalf. Clattenburg described Paquetá’s on-field actions during the four matches as “entirely within the normal range of actions for this player”, and the defence team also produced evidence showing that the rate at which he received yellow cards remained consistent before, during and after the games in question, which took place in the 2022-23 season and at the start of the 2023-24 campaign.The commission also questioned the independence of the FA’s expert witness on performance, Jack Johnson of Stats Perform Integrity Services, because it has a commercial relationship with the governing body. Johnson was accused of “confirmation bias” for failing to consider Paquetá’s conduct in isolation from what he had been told about suspicious betting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The commission’s report reveals that Paquetá subsequently offered to answer any questions from the FA, only for it to decline to ask any.“The commission wishes to record its surprise that at the investigation stage of what were clearly serious matters … the FA were apparently not interested in what the player had to say, notwithstanding his stance, taken on advice, in the first interview,” the report says. Paquetá gave evidence at the hearing.View image in fullscreenLucas Paquetá has been one of West Ham’s key players during his time under investigation.Photograph: Dan Istitene/Getty ImagesThe FA has no plans to appeal. “The FA is committed to ensuring that the integrity of football is maintained, and full and thorough investigations will always be conducted into serious allegations of rule breaches,” it said in a statement.Alastair Campbell, a partner at the law firm Level and the head of Paquetá’s legal team, said on Wednesday: “The evidence not only showed he has no interest in gambling whatsoever, but confirmed that his integrity as both a player and a person is beyond doubt.“We are still making submissions in relation to the non-cooperation charge. But in a case where his entire career was at risk, Lucas is unquestionably the successful party.”Explore more on these topicsThe FAWest Ham UnitedFootball politicsShareReuse this content"

He was always going to have to exclude six players from his 25-man “A” list.FA criticised for ‘obvious flaw’ in spot-fixing case of West Ham’s Lucas PaquetáRead moreThe others to miss out are James Maddison, who will be unavailable for the entire league phase of the competition with an anterior cruciate ligament rupture, the new signing Kota Takai and Yves Bissouma,who is out of favourand linked with a move to Turkey, where the transfer window will remain open until Friday of next week.It would have been a particularly difficult conversation for Frank to have had with Tel, who joined from Bayern Munich only in January, initially on loan – for which Spurs paid a fee of £8.7m.They paid a further £30m to make the deal permanent during the summer.The 20-year-old winger appears to have been a casualty ofthe deadline day loan signing of Randal Kolo Muanifrom Paris Saint-Germain, another non-locally trained player, who has been named in the squad.The Guardian reported last monththat Kulusevski was expected to be out until around the turn of the year after undergoing knee surgery in mid-May.

He’s been the best at handling that,” said McIlroy, who won his only Irish Open title nine years ago on this course. “He’s had to deal with it his whole life, whether it’s playing against an American in New York or playing against Roger [Federer] or Rafa [Nadal].“He came and spoke to us a little bit about that stuff last time in Rome, so maybe [it’s about] taking a leaf out of his book and channelling that energy the right way. All we can do is control our reaction and our emotions to it. I think the less we play into it, the better it is for us.”After Luke Donald made his six captain’s picks on Monday, meaning an unprecedented 11 of the 12 players victorious in Rome will head to the US, McIlroy said it was the “right 12 players”. And following a landmark year personally when he completed the career grand slam by winning the Masters, he is looking to surpass his own expectations.“Obviously I’d love to win this week, I’d love to win next week at Wentworth [the BMW Championship],” said McIlroy, who has signed up to captain a four-man team against the world No 1 Scottie Scheffler in theGolfChannel Games in December at Trump National Golf Club in Florida.“But if we were to win an awayRyder Cupwith everything else that I’ve been through this year, 2025 would be the best year of my career.”Explore more on these topicsRyder CupRory McIlroyNovak DjokovicGolfTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up now!Barry GlendenningWed 3 Sep 2025 11.07 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 11.48 EDTShareTHE LONG AND WINDING ROADConsidering Cymru head coach Craig Bellamy is so patriotic that he lives in a house constructed entirely of Fragrant Spring daffodil bulbs, thinks the long-running BBC soap opera Pobol y Cwm is a documentary and has Dafydd Iwan’s stirring anthem Yma o Hyd as his ringtone, it was no surprise he was impressed by thejourney undertakenby Wales fan John McAllister to get to his nation’s World Cup qualifier in Kazakhstan. Currently sitting second in Group J, a point behind North Macedonia but with Belgium three points further back with two games in hand, Wednesday afternoon’s match in Astana is a fairly must-win one for Wales. Anything less than three points would prove a crushing disappointment for McAllister, who set off for the Kazakh capital from Barry five weeks ago and has taken in 11 football matches, no end of foreign boozers, a heavy metal gig and some Irish stranger’s stag do as he travelled around 5,000 kilometres east across four time zones and 12 countries on a series of 17 trains, 11 buses and one plane (a flight he’d rather have not taken but was unable to avoid).“We’ve got to see him, because it means so much to us,” said Bellamy of McAllister’s bonkers odyssey. “I’m beyond proud of that fact.” While super-fan McAllister may kick himself when he discovers he could have just taken a direct flight from Cardiff to Astana like the Wales team, he is likely to receive a hero’s welcome from around 1,000 fellow supporters who took a far less circuitous and comparatively unadventurous route to Astana. “To see how they all get on with each other as well,” said Bellamy, beaming with pride at the devotion of his bucket hat-wearing brethren. “They look after each other, they’re well behaved but they enjoy themselves. We want to be like that, we want to play like that.” While Celtic’s Bigger Cup exit at the hands of Kairat Almaty last week proved that teams from far-flung European outposts don’t always have it their own way when they visit Astana, the current incarnation of Wales should realistically expect to beat a team 83 places below them in the Fifa rankings and one who they have already seen off in Cardiff. For the first time in 15 years, the Welsh team is also likely to be boosted by the rare inclusion of representation from Hollywood FC.“I think we’re all captivated by the journey of Wrexham,” trilled Bellamy of the plucky rag-tag assortment of churchmice and underdogs from the Racecourse Ground who spent over £30m on 13 players in the recent transfer window. “It’s been amazing for Welsh football and hopefully now in a number of years we’ll see young players coming through. Surely, whether it’s Swansea, Newport, Cardiff, Wrexham, the better they do the better chance we have of being a stronger nation in football.” While Danny Ward and Nathan Broadhead will miss out against Kazakhstan with knack, along with Leeds defender Joe Rodon, the in-form Wrexham striker Kieffer Moore is likely to feature and it is to be hoped the 6ft 5in target man was afforded plenty of leg-room on the eight-hour flight over.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Previousstudies have suggestedthey may increase the risk of a range of diseases including type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart problems, depression and dementia, and damage the gut wall.Sweeteners’ association with cognitive decline is of such concern that consumers should instead use either tagatose, a natural sweetener, or alternatives such as honey or maple syrup, the researchers said.They looked at the impact of seven sweeteners on the health of the study’s participants – 12,772 civil servants in Brazil, with an average age of 52 – who were followed up for on average eight years. Participants completed questionnaires detailing their food and drink intake over the previous year, and later underwent tests of their cognitive skills such as verbal fluency and word recall.People who consumed the most sweeteners experienced declines in their thinking and memory skills 62% faster than those with the lowest intake, the researchers found. This was “the equivalent of about 1.6 years of ageing”, the researchers said.Consumption of combined and individual LNCs, particularly aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame K, erythritol, sorbitol and xylitol, was associated with cognitive loss.“Daily consumption of LNCs was associated with accelerated decline in memory, verbal fluency and global cognition,” the authors say in their paper, published in the American medical journal Neurology.‘No place in children’s hands’: under-16s in England to be banned from buying energy drinksRead moreHowever, the trend was only observed in participants under the age of 60. That shows that middle-aged adults need to be encouraged to use fewer sweeteners, they added.The sweeteners studied are also found in flavoured water, low-calorie desserts and energy drinks.“Low and no-calorie sweeteners are often seen as a healthy alternative to sugar. However, our findings suggest certain sweeteners may have negative effects on brain health over time,” said Claudia Kimie Suemoto, of the University of São Paulo in Brazil, the study’s lead author.Food and drink industry bodies cast doubt on the findings. “By the authors’ own admission, this study cannot prove cause,” said Gavin Partington, the director general of the British Soft Drinks Association.“Non-sugar sweeteners are safe, according to all leading health authorities in the world, and that’s why they have been used in a vast array of food, medicine, dental and drinks products for many decades.“Their use in soft drinks has helped UK manufacturers to remove just under three-quarters of a billion kilograms of sugar from product since 2015.”The International Sweeteners Association (ISA) said there was an “established scientific consensus” that sweeteners are safe.“This research is an observational study, which can only show a statistical association, not a direct cause-and-effect relationship,” the ISA said in a statement. “The reported link between sweetener consumption and cognitive decline does not prove that one causes the other.”Explore more on these topicsFoodSoft drinksDiets and dietingHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Last year Roblox submitted more than24,000 reportsto theUS National Center for Missing and Exploited Childrenwhich handles suspected child sexual exploitation in the US.It said on Wednesday that by the end of 2025 it will start requiring all users who use the text and chat communication tools that sit alongside the thousands of available games to go through age checks. If they cannot prove they are 18 or over they will have to prove they already know the person they want to talk with. Currently Roblox only requires proof that a user is over 13 years old to allow communication.“We’re making two fundamental changes,” said Matt Kaufman, the chief safety officer at the games company worth about $92bn. “By the end of the year, we will require all users who have access to communication on Roblox to go through an age check process or age estimation process.“What that process does is it gives us more information about how old the user actually is without relying on their self-reported age at sign up. That’s important, both for young users, so that we know whether they’re really at the right age to be able to use communication features. And it also helps address bad actors who may try to impersonate younger users. The second thing we’re doing is we’re implementing limits so that younger users cannot talk to adults who they do not know in real life.”The platform has been growing rapidly and recently started allowing film, TV and games companies like Netflix, Lionsgate and Sega, to create games using their intellectual property on Roblox.In April, the Guardianreported“deeply disturbing” research that exposed how easy it was for children to encounter inappropriate content and interact unsupervised with adults. One parent also said they had discovered that adult strangers had been able to approach their child on the platform and coax them into sharing nude images of themselves. Others complained the platform exposed their children to violent and sexual content that left them disturbed and struggling to sleep.Roblox said in ablog: “Our users, creator community, parents, partners, legislators all want the same thing we do: to help keep young people safe while they play, learn, or explore on Roblox. We’re continually innovating on this front – refining and optimising our safety systems, policies and moderation tools.”Explore more on these topicsGamesChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

Four people including three teenagerswere arrested at UK addressesin July aspart of an investigationinto the retail cyber-attacks.Britain’s biggest carmaker halted production at key sites on Monday after admitting its manufacturing and retailing activities had been “severely disrupted” by a cyber-incident. It said there was no evidence that any customer data had been taken but had “proactively” shut down its systems and taken “immediate action to mitigate” the impact.JLR did not give more details about who was behind the incident, when it was discovered or how long it would take to recover from it.Car industry sources said the incident had severely affected its suppliers, which normally make regular deliveries of parts to its factories. These suppliers could lose tens of millions of pounds in sales because of the halt in production, they added.Aiden Sinnott, a security researcher at UK cybersecurity firm Sophos, said one of the personas on the Telegram group, Rey, shared the same name as a member of Hellcat, the ransomware gang that claimed to have extracted data from JLR earlier this year. Sinnott said Hellcat fitted the same mould as Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters.“They speak English and they are keen on using social media channels,” he said, adding that Lapsus$ shared similar tactics and demographics as the Scattered Spider collective.The cyber-attack at JLR comes amid disruption from theimpact of US tariffs and declining sales.The carmaker reported that underlying pre-tax profits fell by 49% to £351m in the three months to June, which included a period when the companytemporarily paused exports to the US.In 2023 an 18-year-old from Oxford and part of the Lapsus$ hacking group, Arion Kurtaj, who is autistic, wassentenced to an indefinite hospital orderafter stealing 90 clips of the unreleased Grand Theft Auto 6 game as part of a hacking spree.Describing ShinyHunters and Scattered Spider, Sinnott said: “Consolidating them into a group is difficult because they are essentially individuals operating online, communicating via platforms like Telegram, who might sometimes work together.”Sinnott said Scattered Spider was an “umbrella term for a kind of demographic” of hackers in their late teens or early 20s who are native English speaking and “don’t really fit into a box as a structure hierarchy”. Traditionally, groups that deploy ransomware – malicious software that locks up a target’s IT systems – are linked to eastern Europe and former Soviet Union countries including Russia.The ShinyHunters group also has French links. Sebastien Raoult, a French man in his early 20s, was sentenced to three years in prison in the US last year for his activities as a ShinyHunters member.The Telegraph first reported the activity on the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters group.A spokesperson for the National Crime Agency said: “We are aware of an incident impacting Jaguar Land Rover and are working with partners to better understand its impact.”The carmaker, which is headquartered in Coventry, employs 32,800 people in the UK across 17 different sites.JLR has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsJaguar Land RoverCybercrimeAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

In an apparent breach of data protection laws, Viagogo mistakenly copied him into an email with several strangers, all of whom received a link to the same scanned passport.The reason for this curious pre-gig ritual is thatTicketmaster, the primary ticket agent for the Deftones gig, had expressly forbidden unauthorised resale in its terms and conditions.To get round this, evidence seen by the Guardian indicates, Viagogo arranged the sale on its own platform. Viagogo then appears to have told the seller to send the tickets through Ticketmaster’s own transfer systems, which are intended for groups of friends to share tickets between them at face value.But the face on the passport was not a friend of Danny’s.In fact, according to a ticketing expert, Reg Walker, the seller was a well-known tout and prolific user of ticket-buying “bots”,software deployed to harvest tickets illegallyand resell them for big profits.“It [the sale] is potentially a fraud offence because if the buyer gets stopped, they may not be let in,” said Walker, who works with venues to stop touts.He said the use of bots to bypass limits on how many tickets could be purchased also constituted fraud.Danny and his friends were not challenged at the turnstile and were able to see the band.Not everyone who buys a resold ticket is so lucky.Kieran Maguire, an author and academic specialising in football finance, is no stranger to market forces. He was desperate to see Fontaines DC in London’s Finsbury Park, so he bought a ticket from Viagogo for £92, including fees.On the day of the gig, just as he was about to buy his train ticket to London, Viagogo told him the ticket was not available after all.“I’d noticed by now that tickets were on sale [on Viagogo] for £200,” said Maguire.“I’m not daft, I know what probably happened. The vendor is now able to sell it for more so they’ve withdrawn it and made it available to somebody else. The feedback I saw was that it had happened to quite a few people.“I count myself lucky compared to people who might have come from overseas and booked a hotel.”Viagogo does reimburse the cost of tickets when it fails to deliver them but not extra costs such as accommodation and travel. The company said it apologised for failing to provide tickets after the sale “fell through” and said Maguire received a full refund.“The rules, as they work at present, are completely anti-fan and encourage a touting culture,” said Maguire.Viagogo said it had strict anti-fraud measures in place and denied it encouraged a touting culture.But the existing culture, and the rules that angered Maguire, may be about to change.Earlier this year the government opened a consultation on capping for-profit resale at between zero and 30%, making good on Labour’s general election manifesto.Resale at face value plus a service charge, such as through Ticketmaster’s internal system and third-party providers such as Twickets, would be unaffected.To many fans, as well as to music industry figures, the choice facing the government is a no-brainer, particularly given the resale industry’s chequered history.View image in fullscreenDiana Ross on stage. Mark-ups of between 100% and 1,149% were uncovered on gigs by acts including Ross, Billie Eilish and Oasis.Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty for The Recording AcademyThe Guardian has previously uncovered evidence of howresale sites can be used by professional touts, some of whomscoop up tickets through illegal methods, such as using bots, multiple IDs and even employing people to masquerade as separate customers to bypass ticket limits.Having skipped the long online queues, the touts then exploit fans’ disappointment and desperation to charge huge mark-ups.A recent analysis of more than 1,000 ticket listings by the telecoms company and venue sponsor O2 uncovered mark-ups of between 100% and 1,149% on gigs by acts including Billie Eilish, Oasis and Diana Ross.Such profits create incentives for dubious practice.In the past few years members of several powerful tout networks have beenjailedafter making millions of pounds by committing multiple frauds, including via prominent resale sites.Anti-touting campaigners continue to uncoverevidence of so-called speculative selling, a fraudulent practice where touts advertise tickets they do not have, hoping to secure a sale first and source the tickets later.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The plot, exposed inundercover footage filmed by the Guardian, appears to have failed.In recent weeks, a series of smartly presented reports have emerged, warning that the alternative to resale platforms and their much-maligned business model is even worse.A cap on the legitimate and regulated resale market, they say, will lead to a surge in outright fraud and scams, with touts plying their trade instead through social media, where consumers have no guarantees of a refund when things go wrong.One key report, written by the public affairs consultancy Bradshaw Advisory, points to polling suggesting that rates of fraud were higher in Ireland and the Australian state of Victoria, both of which restrict resale, than they are in the UK.However, the report conceded that there was no available data to show whether fraud actually rose because, or even after, restrictions on resale were introduced.What is more, in the initial post on its website outlining the report’s findings, Bradshaw failed to disclose that the work was paid for by the resale site StubHub, only amending this after a complaint by music industry anti-touting group, FanFair Alliance.View image in fullscreenEd Sheeran in concert. Viagogo has in the past profited from one of his gigs for a cancer charity.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/PAA spokesperson said the company did disclose the relationship in press releases and that its research was independent and unaffected by StubHub’s position.Viagogo also paid for a report, by the Centre of Economics and Business Research (CEBR), which concluded that a resale crackdown could cost the economy £183m, if 25% of ticket holders decided neither to attend nor resell their ticket at face value.NME, the 72-year-old music magazine, is among outlets that have been paid to publicise the findings via advertorial posts. The magazine did not respond to a request for comment.Adam Webb, a spokesperson for FanFair Alliance, questioned the evidentiary value of reports that produced outcomes so apparently favourable to the companies that commissioned them.“Both these groups have presented the Bradshaw and CEBR reports as independent and authoritative, despite everyone being on the resale industry payroll,” said Webb.He said there was “no actual evidence” of fraud rising in Ireland after curbs on resale took effect and such a conclusion ran counter to what FanFair Alliance had been told by Irish banks.The CEBR said its ethical policy meant that it would not say anything on behalf of paying customers that it would not in principle say if it were unpaid.Viagogo also appears to have a commercial relationship with two private anti-fraud organisations, We Fight Fraud and Get Safe Online, both of which have spoken of the perils of price caps.We Fight Fraud said: “We’ve been open about Viagogo as a funder, as we are with multiple other consumer brands whom we advise on safety and crime prevention.“The source of funding does not influence our findings. The integrity of our methodology and the data itself are what determine the outcomes.”Get Safe Online said: “Purely impartially, we believe that the enforcement of a ticket price cap will open up an opportunity for scammers to upscale ticket fraud, especially on social media – putting thousands of fans at potential risk. Our focus has always been,and will always remain, consumer protection, irrespective of any relationships we enter into with third parties.”Viagogo said it was a regulated marketplace that operated in compliance with consumer law “with robust security and fraud measures in place”.“Sellers on Viagogo must adhere to strict policies. If Viagogo has reason to believe a listing is speculative after review, it is taken down and we ask the seller to provide further proof of purchase.”The company said it apologised for the apparent GDPR breach and said it took data protection seriously, provided regular training, and would review its procedures.StubHub International said: “We are committed to keeping fans safe from real ticket fraud which takes place on unregulated channels such as social media […].“As a regulated secondary ticketing platform, StubHub International is one of the safest options for consumers wishing to purchase a resale ticket, and we remain dedicated to protecting fans in their pursuit to see their favourite live events.”Explore more on these topicsViagogoTicket pricesConsumer affairsTicketmasterData protectionMusic industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Would you like to have it removed?”With less than three months until tens of thousands of climate negotiators, campaigners and diplomats flock to this sweltering riverside metropolis to discuss the future of the planet, Belém’s love motels are racing to remodel themselves to receive visitors from around the globe.Ricardo Teixeira, the owner of Love Lomas, said a “de-eroticization” campaign was in full swing as motels – traditionally used for passionate rendezvous between lovers – stepped into the breach to help authorities cope with the huge influx of outsiders for November’sCop30summit.View image in fullscreenA construction site enclosed by Cop30 panels in Belém on 21 August.Photograph: Alessandro Falco/The GuardianMirrored ceilings, pole dancing poles and sex chairs resembling a cross between a torture rack and a weight bench were being covered or removed. Mattresses were being changed and kitsch erotic artwork being stored away to ensure bashful conference-goers felt at home.“There’s a certain stigma [attached to motels] … because they charge by the hour … but the only difference is that they’re mostly used for romantic liaisons,” said Teixeira, urging delegates to make a booking at his 48-room drive-in, just around the corner from Cop’s main venue and directly opposite the environment secretariat.Teixeira insisted love-makers were not the only ones who frequented his motel, where bedside menus offer condoms and caipirinhas and there is a £1 surcharge for dirty sheets. During Covid, frontline health workers rented rooms to avoid infecting their families. Business travellers from the interior of Pará, a state the size of South Africa of which Belém is capital, sometimes used its air-conditioned chambers. “People still have the wrong idea about motels … that outdated image from TV and films that they are brothels,” complained Teixeira, who said visiting delegates were welcome to keep the erotic chairs, if they wished. “You never know, do you?”View image in fullscreenWorkers refurbish the entryways at the Love Lomas motel in Belém during the morning to avoid client disruption, as part of renovation works ahead of Cop30.Photograph: Alessandro Falco/The GuardianThe love motel community’s efforts to support the climate summit comes at a delicate moment for Brazil’s government which is facing a backlash over the failure to sufficiently improve Belém’s hotel infrastructure since President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced the city would host Cop30 two years ago. The lack of accommodation has caused a jaw-dropping surge in prices, with rooms hard to come by, even now.One reportshowed a budget hotel had hiked its rates from about £10 per night in 2023 to nearly £800 during the gathering, which is set to take place between 10 and 21 November.Earlier this month Austria said its president and negotiators would not attend the Amazon’s first-ever Cop summit citing “particularly high costs”. Some diplomats have even suggested partially relocating the event although Brazilianofficials insistthere is no “plan B”.In an open letter, the Climate Observatory watchdogwarned the summit risked being “the most exclusionary in history” with civil society, representatives of developing nations and the press priced out. “A poorly attended Cop would be, as well as a historic humiliation for Brazil, a precious opportunity missed at a moment when we have just five years to keep the [Paris] climate agreement’s temperature target alive,” it said. So far, just 30% of the nearly 200 countries that are part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Changehave reportedlymanaged to confirm bookings in Belém.View image in fullscreenInterior of a suite at the Fit motel in Belém, featuring a pole dance bar next to the bed.Photograph: Alessandro Falco/The GuardianMárcio Astrini, the Observatory’s director, voiced frustration that the lack of accommodation had supplanted the climate breakdown as the main topic of debate. “Fossil fuels is the key discussion we should have on the agenda right now … How is the world going to organize so there is a plan to transition away from fossil fuels?“[But] to have a negotiation about transitioning … you need to have a room full of negotiators … If the negotiators are saying they won’t come, how are you going to negotiate these topics? It simply won’t happen,” Astrini said.Addressing complaints over the lack of lodging earlier this year, Lula declared: “If there isn’t a five star hotel [available], sleep in a four-star one. If there isn’t a four-star one, sleep in a three-star one. If there isn’t a three-star one, sleep looking up at the stars … and it will be wonderful.” Authorities plan to deploy two cruise ships to serve as floating hotels for about 6,000 visitors.Belém’s sex moteliers have another solution in mind for policy wonks, ambassadors and reporters struggling to find affordable beds. “They are welcome here,” enthused Teixeira, who is the regional representative of the Brazilian Motel Association. Teixeira said motel bosses had so far offered to make nearly 600 of their estimated 2,050 rooms available for the summit.View image in fullscreenCristiano Ribeiro said the town had ‘progressed 30 years in one’.Photograph: Alessandro Falco/The GuardianCristiano Ribeiro, the 51-year-old owner of a motel called Só Prazer (Pleasure Only), has rented eight of its 33 rooms to Cop-goers through a government website. Guests will pay $200 a night, or $280 for rooms with jacuzzis.Ribeiro’s father, a truck driver who migrated to Belém in the 70s, founded Pleasure Only in 1995 – the year Cop’s first meeting was held in Berlin. Initially called Ponto G (G-spot), the motel changed its name to Pleasure Only after a copyright complaint from a rival.As he showed off his açaí palm-flanked premises, Ribeiro celebrated how Cop was transforming his culturally rich but economically disadvantaged home town. “It’s wonderful. We’ve progressed 30 years in one,” he said of thehundreds of millions of dollars of infrastructure investmentsthat have turned much of the city into a construction site.Ribeiro has paid a graffiti artist to cover his roadside motel with murals celebrating the Amazon’s wildlife and Indigenous peoples, hoping foreign visitors would enjoy their stay. By the time they arrived, the adult channels on its televisions would have been deactivated; the sex shop selling nurses’ costumes removed; and the laminated catalogues offering furry handcuffs and “Real Peter” dildos replaced by English-language menus offering food. Pole dancing poles could be used as coat hangers.Climate negotiators would receive a warm reception. “We’ve all kinds of clients,” Ribeiro said as a pair of lovers swept into Pleasure Only on motorbike for a lunchtime romp. “We welcome them all.”Explore more on these topicsCop30BrazilAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The government has recentlysigned lithium mining contractswith two foreign companies – one Russian and the other Chinese – and residents fear more serious damage is yet to come.“Our communities are in a state of emergency,” says Alí Ramos, who lives in Río Grande, a small town on the southern edge of the Uyuni salt flats 18 miles (30km) away from YLB’s Llipi lithium plant.View image in fullscreenFranz Alí Ramos says the people of Río Grande, near the salt flats, feel powerlessLithium industrialisation in Bolivia began in 2008, when the then president Evo Morales announced aplan to nationalise the country’s reservesconcentrated in the Uyuni salt flats.It took until2023 for the first plant to open, however, after claims ofmismanagementby YLB and the2019 political crisis– when Morales was forced to resign by the military over allegations of election fraud – brought delays.Map of Uyuni salt flats in BoliviaSince the plant’s inauguration, output has fallen far short of targets: in 2024, it produced only2,000 tonnesof lithium carbonate, far below itsestimated annual capacityof 15,000 tonnes.Frustrated by the slow progress, YLB signed contracts worth $2bn (£1.49bn) with Russia’sUranium One Groupand the Chinese consortiumCBClast year.We’ve never had much water here. If it runs out, we’ll have to migrate to the citiesIván CalcinaThat meant a change in strategy to unlock the underexploited metal’s potential using a new extractiontechnology that enables faster lithium processingthan traditional methods, supposedly using less fresh water – although critics dispute this, noting it increases the amount of waste brine.AUS Geological Survey reportthis year estimated Bolivia’s lithium reserves to be 23m tonnes, 20% of the global total. Advocates hope the metal – a crucial ingredient in electric-car batteries – can provide a path out of the country’sworst economic crisisin decades.The contracts have been approved by aneconomic commission of deputiesbut await signoff from the full legislature before they take effect.View image in fullscreenYLB says it will conduct environmental impact studies on the Uyuni salt flats – but only after mining contracts are approvedHowever, Bolivia is in the middle of a presidential election. In thefirst roundof voting on 17 August, a conservative and a centre-right candidate emerged as frontrunners and will face each other again in a runoff in October.Protesters want MPs to delay ratifying the dealuntil after the new government takes office in November.Their concerns go beyond the timing of the elections. YLB has beencriticised for the opacity of the contractsand it failed toconsult Indigenous communitiesor conduct an environmental impact study, as required under Bolivian and international law.The company maintains that consent from communities near the mine is unnecessary because the salt flats fall under national jurisdiction.But Gonzalo Mondaca, of the environmental organisationCedib, argues that it is very much a local issue because the high desert ecosystem relies on fragile, nonrenewable aquifers andlithium mining is water-intensive, extracting from below ground 15 times what is naturally replenished by rain.View image in fullscreenA well installed by YLB. Locals say the wetlands where vicuñas grazed have dried up“Any exploitation, even at the lowest level, could alter the system,” he says, pointing to the International Labour Organization’sIndigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, to which Bolivia is a signatory. “It does not just refer to territories, but to the possibility of being affected. That’s why communities are demanding consultation.”Heavier water use would be felt acutely by the majority Quechua population in theNor Lípez Indigenous territoryjust south of the salt flats, says Iván Calcina, secretary general of the Provincial Central Union of Indigenous Communities of Nor Lípez (Cupconl), which represents local Indigenous people.Groundwater sustains llama herding and quinoa farming, which are essential to local livelihoods but could become unviable if lithium mining expands. “We’ve never had much water here,” Calcina says. “If it runs out, we’ll have to migrate to the cities.”View image in fullscreenIván Calcina at the base of Cerro Llipi. YLB has restricted access to the mountain, where local people perform rituals for rainMany from his community of Culpina K have already moved to Chile in search of work. “Prior consultation is important so that the state can tell us how we’ll be affected, and what they’ll provide in return,” says Calcina.Although it has rejected the need for community consultation, YLB has stated that it will conduct environmental impact studies – but only after the legislature approves the two contracts.“If they say the project isn’t viable, the money will already be there,” Calcina says. “It’s like putting on your shoes before your socks – it makes no sense.”So far, YLB’s mining have been a relatively small-scale operation, but residents worry that existing problems will be intensified if the contracts are approved – and have little hope for the promised economic benefits. “There isn’t even a law regulating lithium,” Calcina points out.Most residents of Río Grande work in agriculture or in nearby zinc and lead mines. “We were very hopeful when they announced the industrialisation project in 2008,” recalls Donny Alí, a former president of the town’s civic committee and a former general director of lithium at the energy ministry. “They made us believe we’d become the Dubai of South America.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Vicuñas – wild camelids whose wool fetches a better price than alpacas’ fleece – are an essential source of income for local people who shear them. But after YLB installed more than 20 wells near the town, residents claim that the high-altitude wetlands where the animals congregated have dried up.“The vicuñas have had to migrate to other areas where there aren’t humans,” Alí says, making them harder to corral. “It’s a financial loss, and no one’s making up for it.”If the new contracts are approved, he fears that increased industrial water use could worsen the problem. “There aren’t any technical reports that guarantee we will continue to have water,” he says.Alí Ramos, a member of Río Grande’s civic committee, says the community feels powerless, adding: “We’re the ones who will be affected.”View image in fullscreenLlama herding, which depends on groundwater supplies, could become unviable if lithium mining expandsTourism has also suffered. Residents say YLB prohibits traffic across the salt flats near Río Grande, so anyone wanting to visit them has to make a 60-mile (100km) journey east to the main entrance near the town of Uyuni. The company has also reportedly restricted access to Cerro Llipi, a mountain where residents perform traditional rituals for rain.“We fought to at least be able to access our mountain without permission, but they denied us that as well,” says Alí Ramos.José Valda Belén, a tour operator based in Uyuni, believes the same could happen to the tourism industry if the contracts are approved. “They might impose visiting restrictions,” he says, fearing problems for one of Bolivia’s top destinations.God willing, the next government has the environment on its agendaAlí RamosDespite repeated requests for comment, YLB declined to respond directly, citing administrative reasons.In October, thecentre-right senator Rodrigo Paz Pereira, son of a former president, and the rightwingformer president Jorge “Tuto” Quirogawill face off in the presidential election, which willend nearly 20 years of leftwing governments. Both candidates say the “white gold” will revive Bolivia’s struggling economy.Quiroga has promisedto manufacture batteries domestically, which the environmentalist Mondaca says isunfeasibledue to Bolivia’s distance from major markets and lack of other battery materials.View image in fullscreenJosé Valda Belén, who runs tours of the salt flats, pictured in Uyuni’s ‘train cemetery’. He worries that restrictions could damage tourismPaz Pereira has pledged to process magnesium byproducts as well as lithium carbonate to create more products for export. This proposal “is more realistic”, says Mondaca. “But the truth is that even if the work started in earnest today, there wouldn’t be results for years.”Meanwhile, lithium priceshave declined by 90%over the past two years, despite growing demand for the metal, due to oversupply by China.In May, the local Indigenous organisation Cupconlfiled a lawsuit, alleging that YLB had failed to consult the community, as required under the constitution buta judge dismissed the caseon the grounds that a class-action suit was not appropriate. Calcina says the group plans to appeal against the decision and take the case to theInter-American Commission on Human Rightsif necessary.Battle lines redrawn as Argentina’s lithium mines ramp up to meet electric car demandRead moreOn 20 August,a judge ordereda temporary pause in the contract approval process until YLB conducts an environmental impact study and obtains consent from the affected communities.Opponents of the mines are now waiting to see what the new government will do, amid disillusion with the previous leftwing government. Mondaca notes that the Movement Towards Socialism (Mas) party, which wasin power since 2006, talked about Indigenous rights but often failed to translate the rhetoric into action.Though the results of the election’s first round mark theend of Mas’s grip on power, critics say that the rightwing parties’bet on lithiumas an economic saviour for Bolivia’s problemscontinues an extractive modelthat has caused environmental destruction and violated Indigenous rights since colonisation.Alí Ramos in Río Grande is one of those who has lost faith in Mas. “God willing,” he says, “the next government has the environment on its agenda.”Explore more on these topicsSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanBoliviaConservation and indigenous peopleEmploymentAccess to waterConservationMining (Environment)featuresShareReuse this content"

This was later pushed back to 2025.Machteld de Haan, the company’s head of downstream, renewables and energy solutions, said: “As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low-carbon products.“This was a difficult decision, but the right one, as we prioritise our capital towards those projects that deliver both the needs of our customers and value for our shareholders.”She added that the company continued “to believe that low-carbon molecules, including biofuels, will underpin the future energy system” and that Shell was “one of the world’s largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Listed as one of 15 priority species in Bedfordshire, it sits alongside charismatic species such as the hazel dormouse, water vole, brown trout and nightingale. A member of the mint family, it is a primitive plant that appears in only three places in the county.It was popular in Tudor times for its medicinal qualities and its smell of pine when crushed – hence its common name – although it is also called dwarf bugle, yellow bugle or bugleweed.This year so far will probably have suited this plant, as it likes heat and is drought tolerant, growing in bare disturbed patches of ground. It looks like a miniature pine tree, and likes the chalky soils found in the Chilterns.This is the peak time of year to see ground-pine, an annual plant that cannot stand frost and currently reaching its maximum size of 30cm. About this time, the yellow flowers with red or purple spots are disappearing, changing into tough seeds that look like small nuts.These seeds can survive in the ground for a remarkable 50 years, waiting for the right conditions before germinating, and so ground pine could still crop up in unmapped sites and surprise us.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentSpecieswatchPlantsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Herbody was recovered from the River Derwenton 22 October after an extensive search.The inquest into her death in Northallerton heard that Taylor struggled with alcohol and mental health problems related to a childhood trauma.Coroner Catherine Cundy said the trauma left “an indelible mark” on Taylor’s life “in the form of depression, anxiety and chronic feelings of worthlessness”. Recording a narrative verdict, Cundy said she could not be sure of Taylor’s intentions when she went into the river.In a statement issued afterwards, Taylor’s sister, Emma Worden, said she hoped the inquest would be a turning point. She said: “Vixx was a devoted mother, a loving fiancee and a fiercely loyal sister. She showed up for those she loved with warmth, humour and a deep sense of care.“Her relationships were central to her identity, and she gave everything she had to protect and support the people around her. She also lived with challenges, these were not hidden.“She reached out for help. She made herself visible to services. And yet, time and again, she was failed and left without the support she needed. The failures in her care were not isolated incidents. They were part of a wider pattern of systemic neglect and under-resourcing in mental health services.“Vixx deserved better. She deserved to be seen, heard and supported. Instead, she was left to carry burdens alone. Her death is a tragedy, but it must also be a turning point. Let this inquest be a step toward accountability, learning and change.”During the daylong inquest Worden turned to representatives of Tees, Esk and Wear ValleysNHSfoundation trust (TEWV) saying they were going “round in circles”. She said: “Nobody looked her in the eye and said: ‘We will help you,’ and she’s not here now because you failed her.”The coroner said she would be writing to TEWV and a number of other agencies with her concerns over the support Taylor was given.She said she found it “difficult to understand” why community mental health services repeatedly declined to offer Taylor support as her situation deteriorated during 2024.Cundy said she believed this was partly because Taylor was treated as an alcoholic when she was not dependent on alcohol, instead being someone who binged on wine when her emotions relating to her traumatic past overwhelmed her.Elspeth Devanney, the group director for nursing and quality at TEWV, said: “Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with Victoria’s family and friends during this incredibly difficult time.“Following Victoria’s tragic death, we completed a review and have made changes to improve our services. We will respond to the coroner’s report and take action to continue to improve and provide high-quality care to the people in our communities.”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Make a scene, call the cops and if all else fails, punch him in the balls.”In his statement, Rowley said the officers had reasonable grounds to believe an offence had been committed under the Public Order Act but that he understood the concerns raised.“While the decision to investigate and ultimately arrest the man was made within existing legislation – which dictates that a threat to punch someone from a protected group could be an offence – I understand the concern caused by such incidents given differing perspectives on the balance between free speech and the risks of inciting violence in the real world,” he said.“Most reasonable people would agree that genuine threats of physical violence against an identified person or group should be acted upon by officers. Such actions can and do have serious and violent real-world implications.“But when it comes to lesser cases, where there is ambiguity in terms of intent and harm, policing has been left between a rock and a hard place by successive governments who have given officers no choice but to record such incidents as crimes when they’re reported. Then they are obliged to follow all lines of inquiry and take action as appropriate.“I don’t believe we should be policing toxic culture wars debates and officers are currently in an impossible position. I have offered to provide suggestions to the Home Office on where the law and policy should be clarified.”In comments that echoed those of the health secretary, Wes Streeting, earlier on Wednesday when he proposed a change in the law, Rowley added that he was ready to test a new approach “within a matter weeks”.Rowley said: “Greater clarity and common sense would enable us to limit the resources we dedicate to tackling online statements to those cases creating real threats in the real world. If agreed, we could be ready to test new approaches quickly, within a matter of weeks.“As an immediate way of protecting our officers from the situation we find ourselves in today, we will be putting in place a more stringent triaging process to make sure only the most serious cases are taken forward in future – where there is a clear risk of harm or disorder.“But officers across the country will have to make similar decisions in future unless the law and guidance is changed or clarified. I hope to see this happen without delay so policing’s focus can be squarely on tackling priority issues like street crime and serious violence.”Keir Starmer told the House of Commons on Wednesday that he believed the police should be able to focus on the most consequential issues.He said at prime minister’s questions: “The commissioner has put out a statement in relation to the particular case this morning. I’ve been clear throughout that we must ensure the police focus on the most serious issues and the issues that matter most to our constituencies and all communities, and that includes tackling issues like antisocial behaviour, knife crime and violence.”Speaking before a congressional committee in Washington, Reform’s leader, Nigel Farage, repeatedly cited the arrest of Linehan as what he called an “awful, authoritarian” situation for free speech in the UK.Shami Chakrabarti, the former shadow attorney general and director of Liberty, said there were issues around free speech but there must always be limits.She said: “Our society has become both polarised and illiberal, and public order laws have mushroomed in a vague and ad hoc way that is open to abuse.“But inciting violence must always be a crime in a civilised society. Trans people are an especially vulnerable group who are now routinely subjected to threats of violence.”Linehan is best known as the co-writer of the Father Ted comedy series and has been vocal about trans issues on social media.The Guardian understands the Met is now talking to the Crown Prosecution Service, which decides whether criminal charges should be brought.Writing on Substack, Linehan said he intended to sue the Met for wrongful arrest and breach of his human rights with the support of the Free Speech Union (FSU), which campaigns for the protection of freedom of speech.Linehan said: “This was a horrible glimpse of the dystopian clown show that Britain has become. The FSU will support me by providing lawyers to advise on a claim against the Met police for wrongful arrest and wrongful imprisonment in the hope that no one else is treated like a terrorist for speaking their mind on social media.”He said that after questioning by police his blood pressure “was over 200 – stroke territory” and that he was taken to hospital and kept under observation before being discharged and released on bail.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s quite a high number. It is actually not a number that is being used for funding at all at the moment.”He said theincrease in the yield on 30-year bondswas governed largely by pension funds moving away from long-term financial products.“You have seen a steepening of yield curves across the whole developed world really … the underlying driver of this is global,” he said.Yields are a measure of the interest rate that investors demand when lending to a government or company.Speaking to the Treasury select committee, Bailey also said there was “considerably more doubt” about when the Bank will be able to cut interest rates again.Bailey, who was in the narrow majority voting for last month’scut from 4.25% to 4%, said: “Although we’ve taken a further step, and although I think that the path will continue to be downwards, gradually over time, because policy is still restrictive … there is now considerably more doubt about exactly when and how quickly we can make those further steps.”He added: “That’s the message I wanted to get across. Now I think actually, judging by what’s happening to market pricing, I think that message has landed.”A Reuters poll of economists last month showed a median expectation for a further rate cut before the end of this year and another quarter-point reduction in the first quarter of 2026.Since then, UK inflation has picked up to 3.8%, nearly double its target and the highest among the G7 advanced economies.Recent forecasts by the Bank show inflation reaching 4% later this month and not returning to 2% until the second quarter of 2027.Reacting to more recent data, financial markets expect the Bank to delay the next cut in the cost of borrowing to April 2026.Bailey’s comments, which coincided with calmer trading on global bond markets and a fall in long-term yields, helped the pound rise against the dollar to $1.34, partially reversing falls earlier this week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Frankfurt, Germany’s DAX gained 0.5%, while France’s CAC jumped almost 1%.Asked by MPs aboutattacks on the Federal Reserve by Trumpin recent weeks, Bailey said he was “very concerned”.He said: “This is a very serious situation and I am very concerned because the Federal Reserve is the central bank for the world’s strongest economy … it has built up a very strong reputation for its independence and for its decision-making.”The Bank chief said: “Monetary stability and financial stability underpin the foundations of policy” that enables governments to make political decisions.“I think what we’re now seeing is people saying we should be able to trade off the foundations for those other decisions, and I’m afraid I just think that is avery dangerous road to go down,” he warned.“The job of an independent central bank is to provide those foundations, to take independent decisions to do it … that’s how it works, that’s how it should work.“And so the threats to that I take very seriously.”Explore more on these topicsBank of EnglandAndrew BaileyBudget deficitEconomicsTax and spendingBondsGiltsnewsShareReuse this content"

He received threats to his life, but he was left unsupported. Four years later he was shot dead. That will enrage any decent person. We need radical change, now.”His comments were raised in court, without the jury, by the prosecutor, Alex Leach KC, the following day, when he told Mr Justice Goose that “the post is problematic because it delivers as apparent fact what the prosecution relies upon”. The prosecution took steps to have it taken down and it is no longer online.Caroline Goodwin KC, representing the defendant, said that the post “put political ambitions first and the requirements of justice second”. She also said that Jenrick, a qualified solicitor, “should know better” than to share a “hard-lined opinion” about continuing proceedings, the Echo reported. She said: “We ask he reflects carefully as a shadow lord chancellor should. We ask he thinks and he refrains from commenting further.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Tuesday, Goose sentenced Morgan to a life term with a minimum term of 45 years.Mahmood told the committee: “There are some very important rules that all politicians with their huge platforms should bear in mind. It will be an absolute travesty of justice if somebody walks away from a murder charge because of social media activities and the desire to have a viral tweet.”The Guardian has approached Jenrick for comment.Explore more on these topicsRobert JenrickUK criminal justiceShabana MahmoodConservativesEnglandLiverpoolLancashirenewsShareReuse this content"

As he made his way up the aisle, he spun around and danced without music, leaving the room in an awkward silence. Some attendees looked away while others buried their faces in their hands.Around 40 seconds into his performance, Thilly reached the podium, let out a sigh before jogging back to grab a bottle of water and some papers. The room remained silent until he spoke. “How was everyone’s weekend?” he asked, before adding that he had just returned from Monterrey, Mexico.Man dancing“There’s no pizza there … [but] it’s a beautiful town with lots of history,” Thilly said. He then asked: “Anyone here afraid of flying?”Breakdancing for Trump and the Mud Olympics: photos of the weekendRead moreThilly proceeded to ask if anyone wanted to see him perform a backspin. When no one responded, he laid on the ground, lifted his feet and spun several times. As he danced, the crowd stayed silent, with some attendees looking uncomfortable. When he finished, Thilly gestured for applause but received none.He then asked: “Why did our taxes go up so much?”Thilly went on to reference a previous local referendum, questioning why the tax increase was apparently higher than anticipated. He said: “We were told the referendum was going to bring [taxes] up for an average household [by] around $400 … and mine went up like 900 bucks … We were told like that was from the schools or something? But the school referendum said it would only go up … like 400 bucks on an average assessed home … So I wanted to know why it went up, if it did that and what extra expenses were incurred by the schools that weren’t told to the public when we voted on that referendum?”Following his remarks, Thilly gathered his papers and water bottle and moon-walked away from the podium, again in silence.Thilly appears to have a track record of unconventional town hall appearances, frequently posting videos of them on Instagram in recent months. In these videos, he makes various calls for change.At some town hall meetings, he urges wealthy developers to pay their own taxes rather than shifting the burden to residents. In others, he encourages residents to be friends with each other. And sometimes he stands at the podium saying nothing at all.Currently, Thilly is running as an independent candidate for the Cranford township committee.On his campaign website, he says: “I want to be elected to stop the resident-funded overdevelopment of Cranford … Our township meetings need to be about getting residents what they want, by offering clear answers to their questions, encouraging open discussion and dialogue, and ultimately working together for consensus and compromise. I will lead this effort.”Thilly explained his dance, saying: “The dance was basically improv[,] decided almost on the spot. The main goal is to have our local government lighten up and look at the residence [sic] as friends and equals. The division and lack of community decision-making is what seems to be our biggest problem. Not to mention people are overly stressed and taking stuff too seriously and are not feeling free to speak and express themselves as they might wish.”Citing his frustrations with tax breaks for wealthy developers, he added: “If elected, we would hope to change how our committee does business by making sure decisions are made by the residents as a community and not by three committee members who appear to be too overly influenced by their political party higher-ups.“Possibly even more important than helping our town make wise financial decisions that the residents are aware and approve of; I hope to bring a friendly, stress-free way of our committee when dealing with the public. The more friends we become with each other, the better happier and less lonely all of us will be,” Thilly explained.Explore more on these topicsNew JerseyDanceTax and spendingUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was the 16th or so stop (he can’t quite remember) of a remarkable airborne odyssey that he hopes will make him the youngest supported pilot to fly around the world.The adventurebegan at his home in Brisbane, Australia, four weeks ago and has taken the teenager across the Indian Ocean and through the Middle East to Europe, from where he will venture around the other half of the globe back home. Though he is accompanied by an instructor – global aviation rules not easily permitting children to fly around the world on their own – Byron does all the flying of their tiny single-engined Sling TSi aircraft.They spend the flights – the longest of which so far was a 10-hour stretch from Singapore to Sri Lanka – chatting, calling family or occasionally listening to music, if he can get it to work, the teenager told the Guardian.What’s on the playlist? “Normally a good bit of Top Gun towards the start of the cruise, and then go into something else. I like to have it quiet for takeoff and landing, just so you can hear air traffic control and stuff.”It may not be how a typical teenager will spend September, but little about Byron’s life so far has been typical. Very unwell almost from birth, he spent his childhood in and out of hospital – “sometimes it was weekly, sometimes it was daily, sometimes it was monthly” – before finally being diagnosed with the bowel conditionCrohn’s diseaseaged 14. “It took a big toll on my life,” he said. “I missed birthday parties, missed school, missed, like, just normal school sports and all that sort of stuff.”Despite this, or perhaps because of it, he caught the flying bug young, thanks to a Scouts activity day that involved a trip in a small plane when he was just four. “That was the start of it, and from there it was like a fire lighting. It just kept sparking.”View image in fullscreenByron is making the journey in a single-engined Sling TSi aircraft.His had his first flying lesson at 13 and obsessively loved it. “It was like a new beginning, really. It gave me motivation to keep going and get out of the hospital.” The following year, finally in remission, “I thought: how do I raise awareness for Crohn’s and the Queensland children’s hospital, which I’d spent most of my life in? And I thought I’d fly around Australia.” That mission having beencompleted last year, the world was next.What do his parents make of it? “Yeah, I had to persuade them a little bit. At first they were a bit worried, but they’ve seen how safe it actually is and how we’ve put in the correct strategies to make sure the trips are as safe as possible. They were a little bit worried, but now they’re fine with it.” They are all in constant contact, often during flights, he said, with his mother, Jeni Langdon, acting as his manager, fixer and publicist back home inBrisbane.Apart from the personal challenge, he hopes his story will inspire other young people. “People just don’t have the right motivation. They’re all on their devices. They just don’t have the motivation to overcome barriers. And I thought: why not try make a global mission of showing people that they can achieve their dreams, they can overcome their obstacles?”After a brief touchdown at theInternational Ayr Showin Glasgow this weekend, Byron’s next stop will be Iceland, then Greenland, then onwards. He hopes to land back home on 13 October, his birthday, where he is looking forward to seeing his family and his dog – and to turning 16, when he can finally apply for arecreational pilot’s licence, allowing him to fly a single-engine plane without supervision.“I might have a week off flying, and then I’ll get into it again,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAir transportBrisbaneQueenslandnewsShareReuse this content"

The same judge had ruled in favor of US prosecutors nearly a year ago, finding that Google built and maintained an illegal monopoly with its namesake search engine.Groups critical of Google’s dominance in theinternetsearch and onlineadvertisingindustry are furious. They contend the judge missed an opportunity to enact meaningful change in an industry that has suffocated under the crushing weight of its heaviest player. Tech industry groups and investors, by contrast, are thrilled. Shares inAlphabet, Google’s parent company, have risen 9% since Tuesday afternoon.Judge Amit Mehta did order Google to share data from its search engine with its rivals. He also enjoined the company from entering or maintaining exclusive contracts relating to the distribution of its products includingChrome, Google Assistant and the Gemini app. That penalty will not, however, prevent it from paying distributors such as Apple and Mozilla, which use Google as the default search engine for their respective browsers. Google faces a separate hearing later this year on its monopoly over online advertising technology.The Department of Justice celebrated the ruling in a Tuesdaypress releasethat called Mehta’s proposed remedies “significant”.“The court’s ruling today recognizes the need for remedies that will pry open the market for general search services, which has been frozen in place for over a decade,” the announcement reads.It’s not enough, say free market advocates.Critics say judge handed Google a lenient winMehta’s decision resulted in an immediate wave of backlash from big tech critics who have been closely following the antitrust case for years. Many of these thinktanks and advocacy groups hadlong calledfor Google to be broken up for its monopolistic tactics, arguing that forceful action was needed to restore meaningful competition.Google will not be forced to sell Chrome, federal judge rulesRead moreInstead of opening up the online search industry, however, critics of the ruling allege that it will now retrench Google’s dominance while setting a precedent that big tech need not fear serious consequences for breaking the law.“Google for years has wielded its vast power over all layers of the digital economy to crush competitors, halt innovation and rob Americans of their right to read, watch and buy what they want without being manipulated by one of the most powerful corporations in human history,” Barry Lynn, executive director at the Open Markets Institute thinktank, said. “Judge Mehta’s order that Google share search data with competitors and cease entering into exclusive contracts does nothing to right those wrongs. Instead, it lets Google and every other monopolist know that even the most egregious violation of law will be met with a slap on the wrist.”Some groups and experts took issue with how Mehta’s ruling that Google hadillegally maintained a monopolycould result in the more lenient decision handed down this week.“You don’t find someone guilty of robbing a bank and then sentence him to writing a thank you note for the loot,” said Nidhi Hegde, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project non-profit.Several tech leaders, including the CEOs of Yelp, search engine DuckDuckGo and Epic Games, additionally condemned the decision for failing to adequately level the playing field for competitors. Yelp and Epic Games have both sued Google over antitrust issues, while DuckDuckGo’s CEO testified in the government’s antitrust trial against the search giant.“It’s like a defendant robbed a series of banks and the court verdict found them guilty, then sentenced them to probation under which they may continue robbing banks but must share data on how they rob banks with competing bank robbers,” Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, posted on X in yet another use of a bank robbing analogy.Democratic lawmakers who have urged for stronger regulations on big tech similarly denounced the ruling, in some cases calling for the justice department to appeal the decision.“The court previously ruled that Google’s search business is an illegal monopoly, but now the judge’s remedies fail to hold Google accountable for breaking the law,” the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said ina statement. “Instead of restoring competition and ending Google’s dominance, this ruling is a slap on the wrist for unlawful behavior that warranted the breakup of this tech giant.”The chairs of the Monopoly Busters caucus – US representatives Chris Deluzio, Pramila Jayapal, Pat Ryan and Angie Craig – also issued a statement calling the decision a “slap on the wrist” and alleging it undermines bipartisan efforts to rein in tech monopolies.“In practice, this ruling allows Google to stay a monopoly. Despite finding Google guilty of search monopolization, the court is allowing the company to retain Chrome andAndroid, key tools that Google uses to dominate the market,” the caucus said.The decision also drew the ire of human rights group Amnesty International, which said that Google’s business model is built on“pervasive surveillance” and that Chrome is an important tool used for harvesting the personal data of Google users.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Industry groups weighed in saying Mehta’s decision avoided calamitous results forSilicon Valley. The Developers Alliance, a tech industry group, said it was pleased that the judge “rejected the draconian structural remedies” that the justice department had requested in the case.“Divesting Chrome and Android would have had disastrous consequences for web and app developers and the broader digital ecosystem,” the group said in a statement. “Developers are relieved that the political theater of this trial has ended.”Another industry group, the Consumer Choice Center, invoked Google’s arguments from the trial in which the search engine giant said it had the best product and that is why it dominates the market. Stephen Kent, the group’s media director, said the justice department’s “politicized case” held “larger players in contempt for having superior products that people freely use instead of rival apps and services”.Many of these groups cited Mehta’s argument that in the year or so since he originally ruled that Google’s search business was monopolistic, the burgeoning AI space has produced both financially and technologically viable competitors to Chrome for the first time in years. “These new realities give the court hope that Google will not simply outbid competitors for distribution if superior competitors emerge,” Mehta’s ruling read.“Arguing about search engine market share when dramatic and remarkable advances in AI were upending the industry was head-scratching at best,” the Developers Alliance said.Jennifer Huddleston, senior fellow at libertarian thinktank the Cato Institute, said the courts should proceed with caution and “recognize that innovation often remains our best competition policy” when attempting to rule on antitrust cases.“The months that have passed between the initial ruling and the remedies decision have shown how rapidly markets in the tech sector can change,” Hiddleston said in a statement. “This is particularly true in the present, given the disruptive nature of AI products in search. As Judge Mehta’s decision notes, such cases ask courts to predict the future of a rapidly changing market rather than merely look at historical facts, as it typically does, and that doing such is not a judge’s forte.”As Google’s stock bounced on the news of Mehta’s ruling, Apple also saw a boost. The iPhone maker historically received billions of dollars from Google annually to make Google Search the default engine on its phones and tablets. The deal between the two companies amounted to about 15% of Apple’s operating income. Its shares rose nearly 4% since Tuesday.“Apple also gets a nice win because the ruling forces Google to renegotiate the search deal annually,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, wroteon X.Critics of the remedies ruling were not surprised by Wall Street heralding Mehta’s decision as a win. “There’s a reason Google’s stock jumped after this ruling was released,” saidChristo Wilson, a Northeastern University computer science professor who has conductedresearchon Google’s monopoly. “It is a historic misfire that fails to meet the enormity of the finding that Google is a monopolist in online search.”Explore more on these topicsGoogleAlphabetAndroidChromeSearch enginesInternetSilicon ValleynewsShareReuse this content"

There have been lurid fables of cold war bunkers, secret service shooting ranges, CIA interrogation chambers and even escape tunnels to Hyde Park. But none of these fictional fantasies quite compare to the underground lair that has now been excavated below the imposing block, in its new incarnation as one of the fanciest hotels inLondon.Owned by the royal family of Qatar, and operated by an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands, belonging to one of Hong Kong’s wealthiest dynasties, this former outpost of US imperialism has become a gilded temple to the new global order. Reborn asthe Chancery Rosewood, it is a beacon of luxury designed to attract the cream of the world’s ultra-high net worth individuals, so it is only fitting that it should boastthe mega-basement to end all mega-basements.Descending a grand ceremonial staircase, you find yourself in a colossal marble-lined antechamber, a four-storey volume dripping with chandeliers and veneers, reflected in a mirror-polished black ceiling. It feels like the entrance to Kim Il Sung’s mausoleum, but it is the prelude to a gigantic ballroom (serviced by its own car elevator) which sits atop a subterranean spa complex, with swimming pool, saunas and therapy rooms, dug 20 metres below the ground. Long off-limits to the public, access to the building is now limited only by the size of your chequebook. The entry-level “junior suites” start at £1,400 per night.View image in fullscreenPublic ire … protesters outside the American Embassy in 1965.Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty ImagesFor the architects, however, the ambition was to open up a building that had long been sealed off. “We really wanted to make it feel as public as possible,” says Julia Loughnane, director atDavid Chipperfield Architects, the firm responsible for this somewhat sisyphean task. “It was about stripping away all the barriers and restoring a sense of openness.”When the Finnish-American architectEero Saarinendesigned the building in the 1950s, as the first purpose-built embassy in London, it was intended as an image of open, easy-going America. It featureda public librarynext to the visa office on its raised ground floor, flooded with a sense of airy transparency and framed by a striking “diagrid” ceiling of intersecting concrete beams. But the blocky form and chequerboard facade, with windows surrounded by big picture frames of Portland stone, wasn’t to everyone’s taste. Critic Reyner Banham called it “monumental in bulk, frilly in detail,” while others compared it to a cigarette factory.Public ire against the hulk only increased in the following years, when it became the focus of Vietnam war protests and other demonstrations against American might, which in turn prompted the construction of ever more defensive barriers and security pavilions. By the 2000s, the perceived terror threat was so great, and Mayfair neighbours so irate, that the mission fled across the river to Nine Elms, retreating insidea plastic-clad castle on a hill, surrounded by a moat.View image in fullscreenMarble for days … Chancery Rosewood Jacqueline BoudoirPhotograph: Ben AndersIn many ways, Saarinen’s building is therefore more open and accessible than it has ever been in living memory. Not that much of the structure is actually still there. In order to accommodate the services required by the hotel, practically everything behind the facade has been demolished and rebuilt. The original U-shaped block has been given a fourth side in order to fit 144 suites, with an atrium in the middle. It has grown vertically too, not that you might realise at first.“Typically,” says David Chipperfield, “the conservation lobby wants to see a very clear distinction between what was there and what has been added. But we’ve developed a different strategy on a number of projects, from theNeues Museum[in Berlin] onwards, where the difference isn’t so obvious.”In the case of Grosvenor Square, his team has “stretched” Saarinen’s facade, adding a much taller sixth storey, in the same manner as the original, with an additional two storeys set back as a golden rooftop pavilion, housing a bar and two humungous penthouse suites. The move is deft and precisely executed, and justified on heritage grounds thanks to one of Saarinen’s own sketches. He came up with his competition-winning design while on his three-week honeymoon in London, where he covered the walls and mirrors of his hotel room with sketches – one of which, to the Qataris’ joy, depicted a much bigger version of the building.View image in fullscreenOriginal details … the exposed ‘diagrid’ ceiling.Photograph: Ben Anders“It was a very helpful discovery,” says Chipperfield. “I suspect Saarinen wanted a taller building, but there wasn’t the need for it, once he had laid out the functions across the full width of the square.” He’s right: the inflated version actually feels better suited to its context than the original. The removal of the defensive sloping stone bank, or glacis, that used to ring the building is a welcome change too, making the ground floor open to the pavement for the first time.The Qataris have also been lucky in that the Finn had a penchant for bling. Visit the building today and you will find the ends of the beams, which project through the facade, clad in gold-anodised aluminium, along with further gilded adornments around the windows, and a frilly gold crown along the roof. They look like the tacky trappings of a luxury hotel (or something a modernist Trump might add to his Oval Office), but these are in fact original. They were intended, Saarinen said, to “add sparkle to the facade”. (Not so the new gilded entrance canopies, which bear the gaudy hand of the Rosewood takeover.)We used up the world’s last remaining green Indian marble. It took one mason six years to cutSaarinen’s gold cruciform columns extend into the lobby too, although that’s pretty much all that’s left of his interior. Chipperfield’s team have done their best to restore and extended the diagrid ceiling, as well as preserve the light fittings and various bits of balustrade, but any sense of the original scheme has been entirely drowned out by Rosewood’s interior designers, who have cranked up the sparkle setting to the max.Masterminded by French designerJoseph Dirand, it is a fever dream of opulence, every surface writhing with exotic stones, woods and fabrics, a plush palette that looks plucked from an oligarch’s luxury yacht. There have been some attempts to riff off the original building. The new atrium, for example, is lined with giant square O-rings like the facade, but covered in dark wood. “We inspected 1.4m square metres of walnut,” a Rosewood spokesperson tells me, “in order to use 600 sq m, because we wanted it without the knots.”View image in fullscreenBald statement … the rooftop eagle, made from bits of B-52 bombers.Photograph: Oliver WainwrightSuch lengths of profligate perfectionism extend to every detail. The bathrooms in the junior suites are entirely smothered in green Indian marble (“We used up the world’s last remaining marble of that type,” they tell me proudly), which they say took one mason in Carrara, Italy, six years to cut. Another marble apparently comes from the same quarry as the Pantheon. “We have 100 types of stone from all across the world,” the rep continues, “and we are slated to be the first five-star hotel to be rated Breeam Outstanding for sustainability”. That will be some feat, if theembodied carbon footprintof crushing an existing concrete building and shipping countless tonnes of stone across the globe are factored in to the assessment.The suites swell in size as we rise through the hotel, progressively expanding to include offices, private kitchens, steam rooms and two-person bathtubs. The rooms are also configured with little lobbies, so they can be rented together for extended family and staff. One future guest recently visited with his entourage, with the intention of “taking a couple of floors,” with enough space for his doctor, chiropractor, chef and security detail. Ironically, guests here are likely to come with bigger retinues than even the ambassador would have had.The maximalism reaches an absurdist conclusion on the roof, home to a pair of 350 sq m penthouses, named Elizabeth and Charles, with rates topping £20,000 a night. “We’ve included subtle touches that reflect the royals’ interests,” the stylist tells me, as she curates a cluster of ornaments. “We have artwork relating to the queen’s brooches and love of dogs, while Charles House had nods to polo and Highgrove.” Sadly missing is a framed2009 letter from Charles to the Qataris, expressing his fury over their choice of architect for their previous London mega-project, at Chelsea Barracks. If only he had similarly intervened here to insist they retained Chipperfield for the interiors.That said, it is hard to imagine Sir David coming up with something as magnificently gaudy as the Eagle Bar on the roof. Conceived as an end-of-days art deco-ish fantasy, with a swooping multicurved ceiling, the bar looks out at the back of the gilded American eagle sculpture that has always crowned the embassy. For the first time, standing out on the terrace, you can see up close how this patriotic symbol of America’s strength and freedom is in fact made from trash – pieced together from leftover bits of B-52 bombers, forming a sinewy pile of scrap metal, daubed with gold paint.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureHotelsLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Kass begins with a narrative feint: after some dutiful lovemaking with husband Lee (Will Poulter), young bride Muriel (Daisy Edgar-Jones) spies Lee’s studly drifter brother Julius (Jacob Elordi) sprawling shirtless on a station wagon outside, the playing cards in his pocket signifying trouble. Things aren’t as hetero as they appear, however: Muriel is drawn to Julius for what he represents rather than who he is, cueing an atypical love triangle where the protagonists are mostly prised apart, and where the optimal outcome may well be for all concerned to pursue their own paths.Pufahl’s intention, boosted here by longtime Todd Haynes producer Christine Vachon, is to flag that this moment in American life wasn’t entirely as staid as we’ve been led to believe, that identities were shifting beneath the placid surface of postwar reconstruction. Waitress Muriel gambles on racing tips from her regulars, before trysting with a sapphically inclined neighbour (Sasha Calle). Julius sells his body to fellow cardsharps and becomes a professional peeper, prowling a casino’s eaves to spot blackjack cheaters. (Even here, the rising heat obliges him to lose the shirt.) Only Poulter’s Lee, upright in flannel, clings to an older, squarer design for life, installing his wife in a little box on a California hillside – yet he seems as destined for heartbreak as anyone.With TV veteran director Daniel Minahan (Six Feet Under, Deadwood) keeping these lonely furrows premium-cable handsome, the film’s own secret may be that it is a miniseries squeezed into a feature-film closet. (Lorded over by Don Swayze, the casino surely merits its own episode.) The minor-key romantic snafu, composed chiefly of undercurrents, remains a touch callow to generate the devotional passions of a Far from Heaven or Carol; these are just kids, arranged into attractive, affirmative poses to feel each another out. Yet Kass and Minahan combine old and new while rubbing suggestively against the grain: the familiar pleasures of watching charismatic young actors meet the novelty of seeing them plugged into situations our period dramas have historically overlooked.On Swift Horses is in UK and Irish cinemas from 5 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsDrama filmsPeriod and historical filmsFilm adaptationsDaisy Edgar-JonesJacob ElordireviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet despite sequels that went big (2016’s The Conjuring 2, converting theEnfield poltergeistsaga into a 4DX-readytheme-park ride) and then sideways (2021’s true crime-adjacent The Devil Made Me Do It), the series’ underlying mechanics have proved stubbornly resistant to change. The current multifaceted horror renaissance makes this an apt moment for the franchise to exit stage right; facing these upstart punks, the generally sluggish Last Rites presents as something akin to dad-rock horror, doing with jump-scares what Status Quo used to do with power chords.One selling point – that these films are character- rather than carnage-driven – now seems to be a liability. After a nicely cast prologue describing their days as young parents, Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are reintroduced in 1986, when the film positions these middle-aged squares as yesterday’s exorcists, heckled by students who would rather talk Ghostbusters, in the way today’s cinemagoers will emerge discussingWeaponsorSinners. They head for a Pennsylvanian household whose antique mirror doubles as a portal to hell, but ithere are 75 minutes of beigey soap before the usual satanic hokey-cokey kicks off, forcing us to consider the threat Armageddon poses to the forthcoming nuptials of the Warrens’ daughter Judy (Mia Tomlinson).The squareness may be the point: the Warrens have become reassuring touchstones for folks who don’t want their horror too messed-up. Within its own narrow parameters as a delivery system for bland guignol, Last Rites may meet that core audience’s specifications. Wilson and Farmiga remain solidity incarnate, capable of enlivening even speculative spiritual dialogue. The film-making pulls no surprises out of the hat, though, and gives no indication that it would if it could. There’s another creepy doll, demonic makeup from the Linda Blair Fall ’73 range, and an ascent of a darkened staircase – but the floorboards have never seemed creakier. Last Rites has Howard Jones on the soundtrack and still feels obdurately Victorian.The Conjuring: Last Rites is in UK and Irish cinemas from 5 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsThe Conjuring 2reviewsShareReuse this content"

Netflix reportedly offered $150m but the deal was won by Warner Bros, who paid just $80m, with both Fennell and Robbie expressing their desire for a theatrical release.Last month sawreportsthat the film received mixed reactions from an early test screening.

It’s a true epic. It’s visually beautiful. The script is beautiful. The costumes are incredible.”The choice to cast Elordi has already led to a backlash, with many fans of the novel pointing out that Heathcliff is described as having dark skin. The casting director, Karmel Cochrane, defended the decisionearlier this year.“There was one Instagram comment that said the casting director should be shot,” she said. “But just wait till you see it, and then you can decide whether you want to shoot me or not. But you really don’t need to be accurate. It’s just a book. That is not based on real life. It’s all art.”The novel has seem numerous adaptations over the years, including William Wyler’s 1939 film and Andrea Arnold’s 2011 version.The film will be released on Valentine’s Day next year.Explore more on these topicsEmerald FennellMargot RobbieJacob ElordiWuthering HeightsEmily BrontënewsShareReuse this content"

The chic Chinese-American actor who first made a splash in the silent era has been fictionalised in films and TV shows, including Ryan Murphy’sHollywoodand Damien Chazelle’sBabylon, and an excellent novel, Amanda Lee Koe’sDelayed Rays of a Star. She has herface on the quarter, the first Asian-American to be honoured in that way, and she is the subject of a page-turner of a biography,Not Your China Dollby Katie Gee Salisbury. But what about the films? This month, BFI Southbank in London hosts a retrospective of this remarkable star’s career, titledAnna May Wong: the Art of Reinvention.Wong was born in Los Angeles to second-generation Chinese parents in 1905. At the very beginning of her film career in 1921, she self-consciously told a movie magazine that she was “a considerable spot of yellow that’s come to stay on the silver of the screen”, announcing her difference as a rare Asian-American leading lady and her determination to become a star in the same breath. As her career continued, she would become more outspoken about the challenges of typecasting and her disappointment with the representation of Chinese characters on screen.“I was killed in virtually every picture I appeared in. Pathetic dying seemed to be the best thing I did,” she said. She never got the career she deserved, banned from playing romantic leading roles where she would kiss a white co-star, and passed over for Chinese roles in favour of white actors in yellowface. “She was forced to reinvent herself at different points of her career,” says season curator Xin Peng, assistant professor in film and screen studies at the University of Cambridge. “She didn’t have the option to repeat what she was doing, or retire in luxury.”View image in fullscreenHer first leading role … The Toll of the Sea.Photograph: BFIThe season traces Wong’s career from her first leading role in early Technicolor silent The Toll of the Sea (1922) through to her last film appearance in the Lana Turner vehicle Portrait in Black (1960) – plus, Flower Drum Song, the spectacular musical she was preparing to star in when she died in 1961. “By watching those films, we can imagine the kind of alternative futures that she may have had,” says Peng.There is plenty in the season to show how impressive Wong was on screen, charismatic even in small roles in silent fantasy The Thief of Bagdad (1924) starring Douglas Fairbanks, or Peter Pan (1924), beautifully shot by Chinese-American cinematographer James Wong Howe. Not to mention the unforgettable Shanghai Express (1932) where she shares a railway compartment and a worldly glamour with Marlene Dietrich. “They put Wong in the background, but I’m not sure she’s very good at staying there,” says Peng. “The Thief of Bagdad is exemplary of Wong’s ability to steal the show, because even with the most fleeting appearance, she was able to shift your attention from any of the stars. You wonder: ‘Who’s that?’”View image in fullscreenShared glamour … with Marlene Dietrich in Shanghai Express.Photograph: BFIIn search of better roles, Wong went to Europe, where she made two beautiful silent melodramas in Germany and another in the UK: Piccadilly (1929), a romance set in multicultural London, with a screenplay by Arnold Bennett. She was particularly warmly received in the UK, at least at first, after her struggles for recognition in Hollywood. In Piccadilly, director EA Dupont filmed a kiss between Wong and her white leading man, Jameson Thomas, which was cut before release against the director’s wishes. In 1930’s Hai-Tang, an early talkie filmed in English, French and German, once again her kiss, with John Longden, was cut for British audiences. Not until 1934’s Java Head would Wong break that taboo, kissing John Loder on screen – a landmark for British cinema.Wong did return to Hollywood in the 1930s, for Shanghai Express and plenty more besides. These films are something of a rollercoaster. Daughter of the Dragon (1931), in which Wong gets top billing, nevertheless contains a collection of orientalist stereotypes, with Wong playing the vengeful child of Fu Manchu. Bizarrely, Wong plays opposite Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa and Swedish Warner Oland, all three playing Chinese characters.View image in fullscreen‘It’s the most spectacular ending, with a virtuosic performance from Wong’ … Dangerous to Know.Photograph: BFIWong finally visited China in 1936, where she was roundly criticised for her portrayals of Chinese villains and stereotypes in foreign films. On her return, she determined to take charge of her career. In B-movies such as Daughter of Shanghai (1937) and King of Chinatown (1939), she was able to play characters with more control over their destiny, and formed Hollywood cinema’s first Asian-American screen couple, with her childhood friend Philip Ahn, a Korean-American actor and activist.In the Edgar Wallace adaptation Dangerous to Know (1938), Wong revives a role she played to great acclaim on stage. Although Wong plays the marginal role of the gangster’s mistress, the climax of the film contains one of her greatest moments on screen. “It’s the most spectacular ending, with a virtuosic performance from Wong, and that performance was possible because of her life experience, her whole career of being typecast in a certain character with a certain fate,” says Peng. “I was completely shocked when I first watched the film.”Wong has many such arresting scenes. Even when playing hackneyed characters, she strikes a bold, modern tone. Following the strange course of her career across these films tells a remarkable story of a woman with a powerful talent, who indeed made her mark on the silver screen – as both a brilliant actor, and a trailblazer in an often hostile industry.Anna May Wong: The Art of Reinvention is atBFI Southbank, London, until 6 OctoberExplore more on these topicsFilmBFIRaceSilent filmfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Georgios Varouxakis argues that the idea is older, quintessentially European, and even anti-imperialistWed 3 Sep 2025 07.26 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 12.27 EDTShareFor your book The West: The History of an Idea, you spent 12 years researching what people mean when they talk about “thewest”. At a timewhen America’s president shows more admirationfor autocratic Russia than for Nato-allied countries in Europe, are we witnessing the end of thewest as an idea?I certainly wouldn’t write off the west. What we are seeing is a challenge to a version of the west that had America as its leader. But it doesn’t have to signal the end. The west is crucial to Europeans, and they have been the core of it. America joined at some point as an offshoot; it has been isolationist before, and it may become isolationist again. So we may see a different version of the west for a while, with its core inEurope, as it historically has mostly been. But America will surely return sooner or later.Awest without America is hard to getone’s head around. When we use that term, most people think of thecoldwar, and awestern alliance led by the Anglosphere …Of course. One common view is that the notion of the west gains traction with the foundation ofNatoin 1949 and the cold war. At the other extreme there’s the “from Plato to Nato” idea, which says the west started with ancient Greeks when they fought off the Persians. Meanwhile, among historians, there has been a boringly universal consensus that the west as a self-conscious idea begins in the 1880s or 90s, and is due primarily to the needs of British imperialism: it was invented to justify imperialism, to demarcate the oriental east of Asia and Arab peoples as an “other”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: book jacketBut I disagree. In my research I found it was French writers who first started using the word in the 1820s, and they did so because they realised the term “Europe” was no longer fit for purpose.What was wrong with “Europe”?The problem was that geographically and politically, from the time of Peter the Great in the early 18th century, it included Russia. Later, Russia’s Tsar Alexander I came to dominate the 1815 Congress of Vienna and the Holy Alliance that he established subsequently. More and more western Europeans began to worry about Russia’s inevitable domination of Europe. It was a large and expansionist monolith. The 1820s saw the Greek war of independence against the Ottoman empire, but for a lot of French commentators the real danger was that Russia could take Constantinople after an Ottoman collapse they saw as imminent. They began to see the Greeks as a kind of rampart of the west.In the 1830s, talk of “the west” and a “western alliance” became more acute, because by then Alexander I had died and Nicholas II was very despotic. There was an anxiety that Russia was not on the margins anymore and could be about to dominate Europe. Crucially, France had become a constitutional monarchy as of 1830 with the July Revolution. Suddenly an Anglo-French “western” alliance of constitutional regimes made sense in a way it didn’t before with the absolutist Bourbons. And so more and more you had speeches by French members of parliament proposingune alliance européenne ou plutôt occidentale.View image in fullscreenA battle scene from the Greek war of independence.Photograph: piemags/AlamyGeographically, where did this original version of the west start andend?This is where Auguste Comte comes in, perhaps the most neglected philosopher of the modern world. These days he is mostly remembered for inspiring the motto “Ordem e Progresso” (Order and Progress) on the Brazilian flag, and for being cited in practically every novel by the controversial French novelistMichel Houellebecq. But in the 19th century, Comte’s philosophy of positivism was immensely influential, comparable in impact only to Hegel. And Comte endlessly banged on about the importance of speaking about the west and not Europe, and defined and analysed what he meant by “the west” in many voluminous writings and in great detail.View image in fullscreenFrench philosopher Auguste Comte.Photograph: The Granger Collection/AlamyComte insisted the west needs to include what he called the five great nations, by which he meant linguistic groups: German (which for him included the Scandinavians and the Dutch), French, Italian, Iberian and English – plus the descendants of their settler colonies in the Americas, Australia and New Zealand.He tried to make “the west” as non-religious a unit as possible. It was not the same as “Christendom” – unlike more modern “western civilisation” advocates such as Samuel Huntington, Comte didn’t believe that your religion is your destiny. So he included Greece, in spite of its Orthodox religion and its being located on the edge of the Balkans, because of the importance of ancient Greek culture for Rome. And he didn’t want the west to be an ethnic unit either, so he also included Poland even though it was Slavic, because it had been Catholic for 1,000 years. So from the beginning the west went with an open-ended vision of a membership not based on genetic or religious origins, and thus allowing the possibility of expansion or enlargement of membership.That does make it sound a bit like an imperial project, though…On the contrary. Comte’s vision was that the west would one day come to include the whole world – but never through the means of conquest. He insisted empires should be abolished: Algeria should be given independence, the English should leave India, and each large country should split into smaller republics so they could be better governed.Comte included both South and North America in the supranational unit he called the west, orRépublique Occidentale. But America only signed up to the idea of the west belatedly, towards the end of the 19th century and more decisively during the first world war. Even then it did so reluctantly, mainly due to the influence of academics who had studied at German universities and German migrants. Americans in the early decades of their country’s existence had fair reasons to be sceptical, since the last thing they wanted, as the world’s first postcolonial nation, was to be associated in some cultural or political unit with the imperialist and semi-aristocratic Europeans.As the idea of the west has evolved over time, various states and regions have been added on or taken away. During the cold war, Japan was seen as part of the west – albeit mostly politically, militarily and technologically, and less so culturally. Westernisation and modernisation are not the same thing. Turkey was – and in a sense remains – part of the west because it is in Nato, even though Mr Erdoğan would hate to hear Turkey described as part of the west. The vision of the founder of the Turkish Republic, Kemal Atatürk, and of a major ideologist of Turkish nationalism, Ziya Gökalp, was for Turkey to join “western civilisation”. But currently Erdoğan seems to have different plans.View image in fullscreenTurkish soldiers on parade during Republic Day, 2015.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesWouldUkrainehave fit into this original version, into the West 1.0?Ukraine’s situation in the 2020s is comparable to that of Greece in the 1820s, in that both countries’ cultures have been shaped by Orthodox Christianity. Religion is important, but people also make their own history. I challenge anybody to explain to me how you can tell the Ukrainians they are not western if they decide to be, and if they fight as hard as they do to prevent their conversion into a satellite of Russia. The way Europeans talk about Ukraine now is very similar to how French commentators spoke of Greece exactly 200 years ago. The Franco-Swiss writer Benjamin Constant wrote that Europeans had become used to their luxuries and their peace, and in Greece he saw a people willing to fight for freedom and to be the rampart of the west, as he explicitly put it in 1825. Thus Ukraine is an additional new member, as the west is once again being redefined.View image in fullscreenZelensky meeting with Trump and European leaders in Washington, USA, this year.Photograph: White House/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockIf the idea of the west is so malleable, are there any common denominators at all?If you are asking if there is a common denominator among the widely different definitions of what distinguishes the west from other cultures, I would say there is. Thinkers ranging from the Trotskyite anticapitalist Cornelius Castoriadis to conservative liberal Raymond Aron agreed that what distinguishes the west is its capacity for self-criticism and self-correction. In the course of history you have governments that do terrible things, but then you have regenerative and corrective movements that come as a reaction to previous injustices. It seems to be ingrained in the value system of the west to be self-critical. Most criticism of the west, such as anti-colonialism, has emerged from within its own value system. Some of the most fascinating criticisms of the policies of its governments, such as by the African American novelist Richard Wright, were asking the west to do the “western” thing, to live up to its principles more consistently.View image in fullscreenProtesters demanding a ceasefire in Gaza near Place de la Nation in Paris, 2023.Photograph: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty ImagesThat sounds less like a value and more like a habit.You are right. It’s a predicament, a historical accident. The French Protestant historian François Guizot argued in the 1820s that the reason western Europe’s civilisation had not stagnated since the fall of the Roman Empire was conflict and plurality. It’s not that the Catholics didn’t want to abolish the Protestants, that the Germans didn’t want to abolish the French or the French didn’t want to abolish the Germans, the aristocrats, the democrats, and so on: it’s that nobody prevailed. So people learned to live with disagreement and conflict, and learned how to put up with each other. Not because they have any genetic or inherent superiority but just because they had to.I’m against the use of the term “western values”, because if you call something western you can’t hope for others to consider adopting it. Calling liberal democracy, constitutional guarantees, freedom of speech, freedom of sexual orientation, justice, equality of treatment, and so on, “western values” plays into the hands of Putin and every dictator. It is probably wiser to call such values by universal names if they are to have a chance to be attractive to people from other cultures. That a number of values, institutions and principles that many of us today cherish came to be combined in the west is a historical reality. But they do not need to be called “western values” because nobody has ownership of cultural productions.But I also think if we resign to abolishing the west, or allowing it to auto-destruct, many progressives will end up badly missing it. If we throw the baby out along with the bathwater, as Richard Wright put it in 1956, “the precious heritage – the freedom of speech, the secular state, the independent personality, the autonomy of science – which is not western or eastern, but human, will be snuffed out of the minds of men.”Explore more on these topicsHistory booksNatoUkraineEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

With breathtaking confidence, Knausgård mirrors the first book, The Morning Star, giving us other, richer perspectives on the material. The book opens and closes with Tove, the manic-depressive wife of the jaded academic Arne. And her mix of despair and insight, humour and visionary brilliance turns out to be what these novels need most.“Hell isn’t the psychosis. Hell is leaving the psychosis,” she observes, awakening from the manic episode she entered in The Morning Star. Scenes from that book are then enacted from her perspective. The result is an exemplary masterclass in what fiction can offer: the expansion of readerly sympathies, bringing a sense that there are potentially endless perspectives available.Into this is thrown the possibility that there really are incarnated devils wandering the land. Indeed, three members of one of Norway’s notorious black-metal bands are murdered in a lurid act that doesn’t seem humanly possible. Throughout, devils communicate primarily with the already psychotic. There’s a kind of RD Laingian suggestion that psychotics may be more capable of imaginative insight, but also a sense that we could all see like this if we looked differently.And the point of it all? Not many readers will come away believing in devils, so what’s gained isn’t new theological insight but something else: a commitment to the possibilities of transcendence within realism. Arguably, this has been Knausgård’s project all along, even as he was describing himself clearing up his dead alcoholic father’s flat in his breakthrough autofictional series My Struggle. But now the transcendent more luridly floods the everyday.Lara Feigel£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionLost loveThe City and Its Uncertain WallsHaruki Murakami, translated by Philip GabrielThe City and Its Uncertain WallsHaruki Murakami, translated by Philip GabrielLost loveThe City and Its Uncertain Walls is narrated by a man of indeterminate middle age. In its opening section, he recalls his first love: the sweetheart he meets at the prize-giving ceremony for an inter-school essay writing competition, aged 17. Their unsophisticated, all‑consuming romance plays out across one perfect summer between Tokyo and the narrator’s coastal home town. It is convincingly drawn, though perhaps a little too saccharine (at one point the narrator, marvelling at the smallness of his lover’s hands, is “impressed that such tiny hands could do so much. Twisting open bottle tops, for instance, or peeling tangerines”). The lovers exchange letters, and occasion­ally meet up on park benches to kiss and talk. When she begins to describe to him a mysterious town, full of “made-up stories and contradictions”, surrounded by a high wall, he is as entranced by the notion of this strange place as he is by her tiny hands. This walled town, she says, is where the “real her” lives. Months later, as the new school year begins and their meetings become fewer and further apart, his lover vanishes without explanation.This story of tragic young love unfolds across short chapters that alternate with a second narrative, set in the walled town of the young woman’s imagining. Here, again, is our narrator, though now middle-aged. Here, again, is our teenage girl, still a teenage girl. In this town, the narrator works as a “dream reader” in a mysterious library, and the girl is his assistant. The town is populated by strange unicorn-like creatures and veined by willow-fringed rivers. It is serene, colourless and timeless. With its ever-changing walls, it is later described as “a dark realm of the unconscious” – but it’s hard not to read it as a symbolic manifestation of the stasis produced by grief over lost love.AK Blakemore£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionLight in the darknessThe Land in WinterAndrew MillerThe Land in WinterAndrew MillerLight in the darknessIn The Land in Winter, Miller turns to the difficulty of loving in an unlovely world. The book opens with a tragedy: a young man’s suicide at night, in the basement of an asylum, his body discovered by an older man who is woken by his absence from the ward. Both are inpatients, and neither – it turns out – is a protagonist in the novel at hand. We will return to them, but only in so far as their fates cross over with the primary characters we are about to meet. Their actions in this first chapter, however – their presence in the hospital and their deep unease with all that lies beyond – underpin everything to come.What unfolds from here is ostensibly a story of two couples over the course of one very cold English winter. It’s December 1962 and Eric Parry is a young West Country GP; Birmingham-born, he moved in boyhood “from the rough centre to its smarter suburbs”, and he’s still unsure where he belongs, conducting his rounds as a country doctor at one remove. His wife, Irene, is all at sea in their rural cottage, far from her old life in literary London.Their nearest neighbour, Bill Simmons, is a farmer, but only since last year when he bought his few acres and an awkward bull. He’s a dreamer, a drifter in search of solid ground, or maybe “a rich man’s son playing at farming for reasons of his own”. His wife, Rita, is even more of a conundrum. A year ago, she worked as a dancer in a Bristol nightclub; now she’s a farm wife, much to her own bemusement, eating spaghetti with her fingers from the pan, reading paperbacks on the floor by the Rayburn.The war and the Holocaust are both still so recent. It is a mark of Miller’s skill that he makes spare mention of either, and yet they loom large. Love does too, though. For all its wintry setting and cold echoes of the past, and for all that it opens with a death in an asylum, this is not a bleak book. The people in it yearn and reach; they make mistakes, too – some of them terrible. But all the while, somehow, you feel – you hope – they might find a way through.Rachel Seiffert£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseSocietyThe quest for a normal lifeWhat Iranians WantArash AziziWhat Iranians WantArash AziziThe quest for a normal lifeOne Tuesday in September 2022, Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, arrived in Tehran to celebrate her birthday and go shopping – to enjoy herself a bit before the start of the university term. “Mahsa had not come to Tehran to be a hero,” the historian Arash Azizi writes, or, indeed, to become a hashtag tweeted millions of times. But soon after she exited the metro, the 21-year-old was detained by the Iranian police’s moral security division for an alleged infraction of the rules around female dress: her head covering had been deemed insufficiently modest. Witnesses reported seeing police beat her; by Friday, she was dead. The result was an outcry and a record-setting series of protests. “Her murder touched a nerve precisely because so many Iranian women knew it could have been them,” Azizi notes. Although, he adds, “Amini would not have wanted any of this”.What she did want, by all accounts – and what so many Iranian women and men want, was only to live. It’s a sentiment underscored by the widely adopted slogan “Women, Life, Freedom”, and its key demand of “a normal life”.How might “normal” freedoms be achieved? What Iranians Want is methodically organised around areas of struggle including employment, environmentalism and religious freedom. The book is, in the end, a document of real optimism, and a thoughtful examination of the layers of work on which political change is built – not just on the streets, but in accumulated acts of civic faith and calculated defiance in the face of a regime that has been enduring “dual crises of legitimacy and competency” for some time.Mythili Rao£10.79 (RRP £11.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA cut aboveKilling TimeAlan BennettKilling TimeAlan BennettA cut aboveHill Topp House, a council home and the setting for Killing Time is, in Bennett parlance, a cut above: in return for a supplement on the fees, the residents benefit from “a choir and on special occasions a glass of dry sherry … only last week we went to a local farm where they have a flamingo”.Mostly, though, the elderly occupants do jigsaws and knit and eat Angel Delight. They jostle for the better class of bedrooms, which have their own washbasins. The handyman offers sexual services to a shifting clientele of both sexes in the lawnmower shed for a token sum, while Mr Woodruff, the oldest resident, diverts himself with some therapeutic flashing, being firmly of the opinion that “since this was what made his heart beat faster, it was to be encouraged”. There is, despite passing mention of iPads, a distinctly 1970s flavour to Hill Topp House. There is also a persistent low hum of fear, particularly for the less affluent denizens, that, due to some misdemeanour or a shortage of funds, they might be demoted to neighbouring Low Moor, an altogether less salubrious establishment. Life, as Mr Woodruff ruefully notes, “was snakes and ladders”.Bennett is in his element in such an establishment, attuned to both the grim apprehensions of old age and its awful comedy, and shifts deftly between the two. It is familiar territory, but nobody does it like him. Teeth and wigs go missing. So do memories and the threads of conversations. “It’s the same as us,” one resident observes mordantly. “We’re all lost property now.”Clare Clark£8.09 (RRP £8.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionThe wonder of the oceansPlaygroundRichard PowersPlaygroundRichard PowersThe wonder of the oceansThe oceanographer Evie Beaulieu stumbles on her heart’s desire while surveying the wreckage of a second world war naval battle. Thirty metres down in the waters of Micronesia’s Truk lagoon, past the Japanese submarines that have become kelp gardens and the sunken warships teeming with fish, she alights on the skeletons of two sailors that have long since become coral sculptures. Momentarily starved of oxygen, Evie foresees her own death and her ideal resting state. She decides she wants to die at sea, become a reef and thereby secure a rich and strange afterlife.Themes of transformation, loss and regeneration abound in Richard Powers’s Booker-longlisted Playground, a transcendentalist deep dive of a novel that at times almost caves under the weight of its ambitions. Ostensibly, it spins the tale of Makatea, a Polynesian atoll that finds itself preyed on by a consortium of shadowy Californian investors who want to build modular parts for vast floating cities. But that’s only the surface narrative, a protruding rock to navigate by. Playground freely references The Tempest with its framing of Makatea, an island haunted by its past and ripe for exploitation, and cites Arthur C Clarke, who said that the planet we live on should by rights be named Ocean. What we think of as Earth is “the marginal kingdom”, an ancillary to a main stage that occupies 70% of the globe. The real story – the real treasure – can be found in the water.Xan Brooks£8.49 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseHistoryYoung at heartThe Haunted WoodSam LeithThe Haunted WoodSam LeithYoung at heartDelight, as Sam Leith argues in this splendid survey of children’s literature from Aesop to Philip Pullman, lies at the very heart of the genre. A good children’s book thrills its readers with ripping adventures and strong characters; it evokes mental images that can stay imprinted forever. It revels in words: think of Dr Seuss’s stories, or Rudyard Kipling’s perfect ear in lines such as: “Go to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, and find out.” Underlying it all, children’s books tend to remain close to the deep structures of myth, providing a fast track to readerly satisfaction.Having written about ancient and modern rhetoric in You Talkin’ to Me?, Leith knows a lot about these structures and techniques. Here, he adds a more personal angle, having revisited many old favourites with his own children. The result is not an academic history so much as a thoughtful, witty and warmhearted journey through works from different periods, mostly but not exclusively British.Sarah Bakewell£11.69 (RRP £12.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseHistoryA must-read graphic historyWakeRebecca Hall, illustrated by Hugo MartínezWakeRebecca Hall, illustrated by Hugo MartínezA must-read graphic historyIn Wake: The Hidden History of Women-Led Slave Revolts, Hall combines a narrative of her own family life and ancestors with the sometimes-maddening search for enslaved women who died rather than be kept captive.At the very start, she wonders where she might find those foremothers who have resisted, and it’s this question that keeps her traveling, away from her wife and son. She burrows into archives half a world away, in London and Liverpool, through obscure histories of colonial governments, in search not only of what was written but those things alluded to and sometimes obscured by the historical record.She credits the banding together of a group of historians who have long searched the archives for the outlines of the transatlantic slave trade: “By the 1990s, some historians started using new digital technologies and began pooling their resources. Quantitative historians, who use statistical tools to study big-picture historical trends, created a vast database of research on over 36,000 slave ship voyages that took place over 400 years.”At least one in 10 voyages was disrupted by revolt. This doesn’t sound like many until one considers that for centuries no one believed these captives were capable of revolt at all. Quantitative historians could not figure out why some ships were the site of revolts, and others were not, save for a single fact: “The more women on board a slave ship, the more likely a revolt.”In examining records in London, Hall tracked reasons women were likely to rebel. Chief among them was opportunity. Women or girls were placed on the quarterdeck, near the ship’s weapons. Men were below in chains. The enslavers had no reason to believe women would fight, since their views of womanhood were more likely influenced by women in their own lives, bound by a culture of propriety.Hall has written, and Martínez has illustrated, an inspired and inspiring defense of heroic women whose struggles could be fuel for a more just future.Rosemary Bray McNatt£13.49 (RRP £14.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA multifaceted rural taleThe Mighty RedLouise ErdrichThe Mighty RedLouise ErdrichA multifaceted rural taleSet in Tabor, North Dakota, The Mighty Red is part romcom, part overblown family saga, part cli-fi warning, part absurdist heist, part small-town satire, all tumbling out amid the turmoil of the 2008 financial crash.The dominant romantic plot is constructed round a love triangle involving Kismet, Gary and Hugo. Hailing from a “rattled, scratching, always-in-debt” family, Kismet is a gothy and gifted teenager, destined for greatness beyond the town’s limits, at least as far as her sugar beet hauler mother, Crystal, is concerned. Crystal’s aspirations are dashed when Kismet succumbs to the allures of troubled jock-with-a-heart Gary Geist. He’s the son of the wealthiest landowning family around; indeed, the Geists own the farm on which Crystal works. Gary haphazardly proposes to Kismet in a silly set piece involving an errant champagne cork. Against her better judgment, mesmerised by his inscrutable vulnerability, Kismet accepts.Kismet finds herself a conflicted and reluctant bride, not only due to the presence of her mother-in-law, high-pitched Winnie Geist, but also because of the intractable “psychic magnetism” she feels towards nerdy Hugo. Much of the central act of the novel focuses on Kismet’s attempts to quiet the unease she feels as a new member of the Geist household, and her tortured attempts to make her marriage work. Throughout, Kismet’s reading of Madame Bovary – a present from Hugo – is comically symbolic.Erdrich’s achievement is pretty remarkable: a voice with brio and lightness that wends and weaves, as the titular river does, between modes and moods.Michael Donkor£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirA likable and liked leaderFreedomAngela MerkelFreedomAngela MerkelA likable and liked leaderFreedom starts with a lengthy section on Merkel’s first three decades behind the iron curtain, and it’s hard to shake the impression that this is the book she really wanted to write. Not because of any lingeringostalgie: she thought the German Democratic Republic was “as petty, narrow-minded, tasteless and humourless as it could possibly be”. Rather, this reads like the voice of someone finally unburdened of the need to keep quiet about their upbringing. Her first experiences with journalists after the Berlin wall went down, she writes, make her realise that it is difficult “to speak openly with West German media about one’s own life in the GDR”, and she explains that she was reluctant to make too much of becoming Germany’s first female chancellor because she didn’t want to be “pigeonholed”.The second half of the book, which deals with geopolitics, is more breathless, as if its pace is still dictated by her crammed diaries during the cumulative crises that marked her career: the global banking crisis that began in 2007, followed by the threat of the break-up of the eurozone, the arrival of an estimated 1.3 million displaced people on Europe’s borders in 2015, and a brewing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine.All the human qualities that made Merkel a likable and liked leader are in this book: the lack of showmanship, the understated sense of humour, the dedication to building alliances and forging compromises. And yet you finish Freedom asking yourself whether good human beings automatically make good decision-makers.Is it fair to hold one woman accountable for the mess in which the western liberal democracy she embodied finds itself in 2025, especially given her leadership of a country with more restraints on executive power than her counterparts in France or the UK? Merkel answers that question herself. What she admired most in her former patron Helmut Kohl, she writes, was his capacity for “genuinely assuming ultimate political responsibility”.Philip Oltermann£11.69 (RRP £12.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseReligionSex and the churchLower Than the AngelsDiarmaid MacCullochLower Than the AngelsDiarmaid MacCullochSex and the churchJesus never mentioned homosexuals, masturbation or the role of women in social, let alone sacred, life. Yet that hasn’t stopped millennia of godly scholars and lay Christians acting as if he had. According to these finger-waggers, extrapolating from biblical apocrypha, exegesis and their own personal fantasies, women are either morally superior or corrupt whores. Likewise, same-sex love is at one moment the emotional glue that binds celibate monastic communities and at another a sin that requires participants to be stoned.In this masterly book, the ecclesiastical historian Diarmaid MacCulloch sets out to show that the source for Christianity’s confused teachings on sex, sexuality and gender is its own untidy DNA. Woven lumpily from two distinct traditions, Greek and Judaic, each crafted in distinct ways for at least a century before Jesus’s putative arrival on Earth, the Christian church remains an essentially heterogenous affair. MacCulloch conceives it as “a family of identities”, by which he means Roman Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox, as well as a myriad other sects and splinter groups, some of which have long disappeared. And, like all families, there has been tremendous potential for bickering and bad feeling. This is obvious enough when the subject for debate is, say, the precise nature of the Trinity. But introduce human genitalia as the topic under discussion, and the result is slammed doors and sullen silences.MacCulloch deals candidly with the clumsy and often cruel way in which churches in the post-second world war period dragged their feet on contraception, gay and lesbian rights and the ordination of women. His book is not in any sense a campaigning document, but he concludes with the mild and sensible suggestion that what is desperately needed is a general agreement that the church’s teachings on sexuality have little to do with scripture and everything to do with the muddled fears, fantasies and self-interest of subsequent commentators and the historical societies in which they lived. The best thing to do now would be to look beyond the old and often damaging dogma and take proper notice of how real people, in all their splendid variety, organise their sex lives most comfortably when left to their own devices.Kathryn Hughes£17.09 (RRP £18.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClose"

A black-and-white image of a couple relaxing on a pair of sun loungers in front of a luxury ski hotel: him, squinting against the sun; her, smiling at the camera, wrapped in a white fur coat. It is their honeymoon in Cortina, up in the Italian Alps.The year is 1941, and the woman is Lea Ypi’s grandmother. Ypi saw the picture after it had been posted online by a stranger, gone viral acrossAlbania, and attracted a stream of abuse. “Morally degenerate” was one comment. “Fascist collaborator” another.And so, in Indignity, Ypi sets off to find out exactly who her grandmother was. It is, she writes, partly out of a sense of duty, to defend her family member from the trolls – a kind of 21st-century version of EP Thompson’s famous call for history to rescue the dead from “the enormous condescension of posterity”. But partly, Ypi admits, it is because she finds the photo unsettling. How to reconcile her beloved, compassionate grandmother with this glamorous young woman living it up in Mussolini’s Italy?From here, two parallel stories unfold. The core of Indignity is a richly reimagined retelling of Ypi’s grandmother’s life. Born in Salonica (now Thessaloniki) in 1918, Leman Leskoviku came into a world that was already falling apart. Cosmopolitan empires were collapsing into nation states, unsure how to treat families like hers: Albanian-speaking, living in Greece, with a proud record of service to the Ottoman state.Leman’s childhood is shaped by the uncertainty of those years: the trauma of wars just ended, economic decline, and blunt, brutal social engineering. As Ypi describes, millions were forcibly moved across newly drawn borders. Leman’s nanny, one of Salonica’s many Muslim Turks, is barely able to hold back tears as she is packed off to central Anatolia.It is suspenseful not least because Leman’s adopted family is so close to powerAmid the ambiguity, and to escape an unwanted suitor, Leman sets her own life on a different path. At just 18, she decides to move to Albania alone. Ypi’s Ondaatje prize-winning memoir,Free, was haunted by stories of Albanians fleeing to neighbouring countries to escape the violence of the 1990s. This story hinges on a young woman’s extraordinary choice to move the other way.In 1936 Leman finds herself in Tirana for the first time, a city of contrasts, of “Chanel perfume and sheep manure”. She lands not only her own job as a civil servant, but a husband of her own choosing, too. He is the son of an Albanian statesman, at a time when all of politics is in flux. And so the book moves through the next two decades, formative years both for Leman and for the young country she now calls home. It is led in turn by a self-crowned politician-king, then by a civilian government – guided partly by Leman’s father-in-law, and drawn into the orbit of Mussolini’s Italy. Finally, as Europe descends into war again, it is overrun by fascist, Nazi and communist troops.It is a history brought to life through Ypi’s novelistic style. Deaths in the family – whether on a tragic wedding day or out on the front line – are more poignant seen through Leman’s eyes. The narrative is suspenseful, not least because Leman’s adopted family is so close to power – close enough, for example, that she can smell “lavender and onions” on the breath of a young Enver Hoxha, the Stalinist who would go on to rule Albania for 40 years. Eventually Leman’s husband – Ypi’s grandfather – is accused, in Hoxha’s new Albania, of being an enemy of the state, with devastating consequences for her and her young son.Alongside that story, the book also traces Ypi’s own search among the archives to see what she can find out about Leman. Sometimes, the documents she uncovers – informants’ reports, prison confessions, transcripts from the Albanian constituent assembly – are used to brilliant effect, complementing the broader historical story. But it is much less clear whether this quest lives up to the initial sense of intrigue – the hints of spying, fascist collaboration, and the photo of a young couple enjoying their honeymoon in the Alps. Her conclusion – about the limited nature of the historical record itself – is thought-provoking. But it is narratively unsatisfying, too.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

When Ypi’s grandmother died in 2006, she explains, she spoke at her funeral, but couldn’t find the words to do justice to the woman Leman had been.

My first instinct was fear that one day I would break it. It looked fragile, a needle of stone with Nyami Nyami’s serpentine body coiled up and gathered at the top, where instead of a snake’s head, a fierce fish’s head sprung out bearing sharp teeth. It was surprisingly heavy. I wore it straight away. A snake with a fish’s head. It was a strange form, as if all life forms were connected and fluid in their existence. No one had ever given me anything like this before.”It’s telling that Chikwava’s usually peppy narration slows to scrutinise this keepsake. The pendant is an emblem of Shamiso’s twisty, mixed path from girlhood to womanhood, a path reminiscent in places of both NoViolet Bulawayo’sWe Need New Namesand Tsitsi Dangarembga’s Nervous Conditions. This curious talisman represents, too, her contrarian nature. “Why can’t you be like other girls?” Shamiso’s father shouts, after she’s been insubordinate at school. It’s a question the novel attempts to tackle throughout.This vibrant, sometimes surreal picaresque begins in a post-independence Zimbabwe. The country is fissured by suspicion and social unrest. Disquiet marks Shamiso’s family life, too: she has been abandoned by her unstable mother, who “lives for the bar and carries a brick in her bag”. She lives instead with her remote father, a former soldier whose desire for orderliness is at odds with Shamiso’s dreamier sensibilities. There is a striking, phantasmagoric scene in which, dusty and disoriented, Shamiso doggedly climbs mountains outside Harare, illustrative of her pursuit of an ineffable promise ofsomethingbeyond the strictures of her sterile home life. Jimson, her Falstaffian, spirited elderly relative, is a self-taught artisan who nurtures Shamiso’s creative yearnings. Her hopes to give freer rein to this more imaginative part of herself are seemingly realised when she gets the chance to study art at the University of Brighton in England.They drift through Brighton’s bars. George has a penchant for drag that is ‘wild, colourful, fun, scary, bold and fearful’The short novel bounds through Shamiso’s fish-out-of-water campus experiences and her attempts to settle herself into a bewildering new world with a host family. We also follow her post-graduation life as she scratches a living as a sculptor in London, producing works that she hopes possess the mystique and force of Nyami Nyami.It is a commonplace of the Bildungsroman that the lead’s self‑discovery is accelerated by encounters with educative external characters. In the earlier part of the novel, this function is fulfilled by vivacious Jimson. With his hare-brained get-rich quick schemes and hot temper, he is a highlight of the novel. In the Brighton section, Chikwava seems to imply that non-binary George will take on this horizon-expanding role. Together they drift through Brighton’s bars and clubs; George has a penchant for drag that is “wild, colourful, fun, scary, bold and fearful”. The implication is that George is a kind of incarnation of Nyami Nyami’s brilliant, powerful strangeness.I write with a general tentativeness here because George’s portrayal and, more broadly, the connection between the protagonist and George was one of a number of uncertainties I had about the novel. George is described as a “terrific human being”, but I wasn’t sure that the writing helped me believe in their charisma at all. Lost on me, too, were the stakes and status of a romantic relationship that blurs in and out of focus. When considering what exactly is going on between herself and George, Shamiso declares: “We understand each other, I think”. That equivocation was something I felt too and couldn’t get past when mulling over what held these characters together.The disjointed shape of the novel also puzzled me. While flinty concision is much praised at the moment, this book could have done with being fleshed out more, not least to enrich the relationship between George and Shamiso. Halfway through, Shamiso exults that she “loves life and makes fast, flash friendships even though [she] cannot hold a thought in [her] head for longer than five seconds”; the odd pace and proportions of the novel attest to this. Jimson seems to be a central character, but is wrested from the narrative far too soon. The depiction of Shamiso’s schooldays, especially when she is exiled to boarding school by her father – the eventual springboard for her life-changing voyage abroad – is compressed and truncated. In the final third, a modelling scam arises that seems like an important plot twist; but this soon fizzles out. Shamiso also stages a risky, seemingly impactful protest in the midst of a gallery opening but this ultimately proves to be fairly inconsequential, too.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

A cooperative multiplayer adventure where players are let loose to explore an open world, I’m interested to see what emergent gameplay comes out of it. Could Big Walk allow for a kind of community archaeology with friends? I certainly hope so.When games use environmental storytelling in their design – from the positioning of objects to audio recordings or graffiti – they invite players to role play as archaeologists. Game designer Ben Espositoinfamously jokedback in 2016 that environmental storytelling is the “art of placing skulls near a toilet”–which might have been a jab at the tropes of games like the Fallout series, but his quip demonstrates how archaeological gaming narratives can be. After all, the incongruity of skulls and toilets is likely to lead to many questions and interpretations about the past in that game world, however ridiculous.I used to work as an archaeologist in the analogue world, where my work consisted of excavations, fieldworks and assessment of potential development sites across the UK. Now I’m doing a computer science PhD focusing in video game archaeology, where I get tocome up with novel ways to record gameplay experiences, like doing in-game walking interviews with players in the MMO Wurm Online, or recording the location of player messages in Elden Ring.Because I know what being an archaeologist entails, I often find myself thinking about games that just have you play as a person with that job title, such as Tomb Raider or Uncharted, versus those that have you engage in work similar to what we do in the field. Walking sims like Gone Home and What Remains of Edith Finch invite you to explore a space and interpret what all of the objects left behind in the landscape mean. Dr Melissa Kagen, assistant teaching professor in interactive media and game development at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, refers to this interpretive gameplay in walking simulators as “archival adventuring”.View image in fullscreenReady for role play … Outer Wilds: Archeologist Edition.Photograph: Nintendo SwitchIt’s not just walking sims though. There is a growing genre of puzzle games that I would argue also puts you in the role of an archaeologist, piecing together clues about the past from material remains and archival material. Some people refer to these games as “Metroidbranias”, but I’m personally quite fond of them. Essentially, “information games” (as developer Tom Francis calls them) require players to come up with theories based on the information they have, to in turn use those theories to acquire more knowledge. With its central mechanic of deciphering an ancient language, Heaven’s Vault is an obvious candidate, but I would argue that other information games like Return of the Obra Dinn, Her Story and Outer Wilds (which literally has a special “archaeologist edition”) also encourage you to role play as an archaeologist, searching for clues in the environment and past records.In my own work I investigate how to preserve contemporary games, as carefully as you would an ancient artefact. SoI’ve been thinking a lot about parallels in the game world too: how players record their own experiences through screenshots, map-making and diaries, and these are also methods used by real world archaeologists. Some games use these recording methods as central game mechanics. A great example is Season: A Letter to the Future, in which you document the world on the eve of its destruction in your journal.Gamesthat inspire you to take notes also arguably result in a record of the gameplay experience – a good example is 2025’s puzzle sensation Blue Prince, which explicitly encourages players to record anything interesting they see in each of the clue-filled rooms as they explore an ever-shifting estate.Rather than raiding tombs, if you want to be a video game archaeologist, look out for those skulls next to toilets. Better yet, record them. A future games archaeologist will thank you!What to playView image in fullscreenCompulsive and stylish … Shinobi: Art of Vengeance.Photograph: SegaWe’re seeing a lot of classic 80s arcade games being rediscovered at the moment, with Gradius Origins pleasing shoot-em-’up purists and Bandai Namco’s Shadow Labyrinth thrillingly reimagining Pac-Man.Next, here comes Sega withShinobi: Art of Vengeance, a compulsive and stylish adventure platformer based on its classic series of ninja brawlers.

In February, Xbox chief, Phil Spencer,told XboxErathat he was no longer looking to take gamers from PlayStation or PC. Three months later, the previously exclusive title Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was released on PS5, and Gears of War: Reloaded is also bound for Sony’s platform. Meanwhile, Sony has brought Helldivers 2 to Xbox and more titles are likely to follow, if arecently spotted Sony job advertis to be believed.Of course, cross play – the feature of online games such as Fortnite and Apex Legends which allows people to compete against each other whatever machine they’re using – started us off in this direction. Now, in an industry where smartphone gaming is dominating (figures by NewZoo indicate mobile games were worth $92.5bn to the global economy in 2024, compared to $50.3bn for console), and the idea of two games hardware titans expensively competing on proprietary tech and software exclusives seems increasingly anachronistic.And yet … Gamers are intrinsically territorial and always have been, while brand loyalty is a key facet of fandom (and, let’s face it, capitalism) – see also Nikon v Canon, Nike v Reebok or Android v iPhone. Tech specs are only ever part of these conflicts – style, image and identity come into play too. So don’t expect Xbox and PlayStation to, in the near future, become mere apps on a multitude of faceless platforms. Several battles may be over, but the war lumbers on.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterArchaeologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The lead character in Ghost of Yōtei is a wandering sellsword from a lowly family. Her sex and lack of status mean that, following the murders of her family, she has no fixed place in 17th-century Japanese society, and there is no permitted path for her to tread if she is to get revenge on the Yōtei Six, the men who killed her loved ones. As the game’s co-director Nate Fox puts it, “Atsu is not somebody who walks in to a room and people pay respect to.”Yōtei’s predecessor, Sucker Punch Productions’ 2020 sprawling open-world gameGhost of Tsushima, is the story of a samurai, Jin Sakai, who shreds his honour to defend his homeland. Jin can’t repel the Mongols attacking Tsushima as a noble warrior, but as “the Ghost”, a fear-inspiring legend willing to use any dirty tactic to gain the upper hand, he can. If Ghost of Tsushima is about a man grappling with the trade of one kind of power for another, Yōtei sees Atsu seize the only power she can with both hands.View image in fullscreenPeak of achievement … Ghost of Yōtei.Photograph: Sony Interactive EntertainmentAtsu adopts the mantle of anonryō, a revenge spirit from Japanese folklore. By embracing this legend, she becomes a figure of fear to her enemies. While the resulting game is similar to Tsushima – in Ghost of Yōtei you also travel across a romanticised open-world recreation of feudal Japan on horseback, carving up your enemies with precise strokes of your katana – the shift from high-class samurai to vagrant sellsword shows itself in unexpected ways.“She has a different life than Jin, and we want to bring that out through interactivity,” Fox says. That means removing Ghost of Tsushima’s contemplative moments, such as those during which Jin would meditate on his surroundings and transform his struggle into haiku. “Jin was a scholarly samurai; he would pause to reflect and take in the beauty of nature. Atsu is not that person.” Those moments softened the rough edges of Tsushima, a mellowing that Sucker Punch doesn’t want to apply to the feral world of Yōtei. Atsu doesn’t write poems; she collects bounties as she hunts down the warriors that stalk Hokkaido.Sucker Punch also expresses the difference in protagonists with a subtle innovation for open-world games: a movable campsite. “We like creating features that are tonally supportive,” Yōtei’s other game director, Jason Connell, says. “Camping is something you would expect in a world like this.” And Fox adds, “Atsu’s a sellsword used to sleeping rough”.Ghost of Tsushima review – Kurosawa-inspired samurai showdownsRead moreAs game worlds have expanded and the numbers of questlines and upgrade trees have multiplied, it has created a barrier of administration between players and the worlds they’re exploring. Instead of moving on foot, they use fast travel to warp between markers on the map. “It’s discordant,” Connell says. One moment you might be in a tropical forest fighting mercenaries, the next you’re on a mountaintop upgrading a weapon before hopping to a beach to deliver a quest item. Atsu’s camp is Sucker Punch’s attempt to redress this disruption and wrap the world around the player. Quest givers, shopkeepers and key characters will now visit you, providing a way to continue your journey without interrupting the flow of the story. “It’s a convenience,” Connell says, “and a more diegetic experience.”In this way, Yōtei is set to be both an evolution of Ghost of Tsushima and an inversion. Set 300 years after the first game and on the other side of Japan, with the player wearing the sandals of a character from the opposite end of society, it promises to be a familiar world filled with unexpected change.Ghost of Yōtei is released onPlayStation 5, on 2 OctoberExplore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsPlayStation 5PlayStationAction gamesAdventure gamesFighting gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her trial had been planned to start later this month.In a brief statement when the deal was announced on 18 August, Sangha’s lawyer Mark Geragos said only: “She’s taking responsibility for her actions.”Prosecutors had cast Sangha, a 42-year-old citizen of the US and the UK, as a prolific drug dealer who was known to her customers as the “Ketamine Queen,” using the term often in press releases and court documents.Her guilty pleas are set to include one count of maintaining a drug-involved premises, three counts of distribution of ketamine, and one count of distribution of ketamine resulting in death.Prosecutors agreed to drop three other counts related to the distribution of ketamine, and one count of distribution of methamphetamine that was unrelated to the Perry case.The final plea deal came a year after federal prosecutors announced that five people had been charged in Perry’s 28 October 2023 death after a sweeping investigation.If Sangha pleads guilty as planned, a judge will schedule sentencing for Sangha. She could get up to 45 years in prison. The judge is not bound to follow any terms of the plea agreement, but prosecutors said in the document that they will ask for less than the maximum. None of the co-defendants have been sentenced yet.Sangha and Dr Salvador Plasencia, who pleaded guilty in July, had been the primary targets of the investigation. Three other defendants – Dr Mark Chavez, Kenneth Iwamasa and Erik Fleming – pleaded guilty in exchange for their cooperation, which included statements implicating Sangha and Plasencia.Perry was found dead in hisLos Angeleshome by Iwamasa, his assistant. The medical examiner ruled that ketamine, typically used as a surgical anesthetic, was the primary cause of death.Sangha presented a posh lifestyle on Instagram, with photos of herself with the rich and famous in cities around the globe. Prosecutors said she privately presented herself as a dealer who sold to the same kind of high-class customers.Perry had been using ketamine through his regular doctor as a legal, but off-label, treatment for depression, which has become increasingly common. Perry, 54, sought more ketamine than his doctor would give him, and his search for more led him to Sangha through his friend Fleming about two weeks before his death, prosecutors said.Fleming messaged Perry’s assistant saying her ketamine was “amazing” and that she deals only “with high-end and celebs”.Perry bought large amounts of ketamine from Sangha, including 25 vials for $6,000 in cash four days before his death, prosecutors said.On the day of Perry’s death, Sangha told Fleming they should delete all the messages they had sent each other, according to her indictment.Sangha has been in federal custody for about a year.Perry struggled with addiction for many years, dating back to his time on Friends, when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC’s megahit series.Explore more on these topicsMatthew PerryDrugsLos AngelesLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

For now, it will just be these ones but who knows where this will all lead.”Hopeful fans will have topre-register on Radiohead’s websiteto be in with a chance of buying tickets, a move intended to “reduce competition from bots and ticket touts”. The greater share of tickets will be apportioned to fans living nearer the shows,which they illustrated on a map.“There will be allocations for those who wish to travel inside Europe and for those outside Europe,” they said. “Our aim is to distribute tickets according to demand in a fair and geographically convenient way.”The band also said it would include a £1 levy in each UK ticket price in order to support the Live Trust initiative for arenas and stadium concerts to raise funds for struggling grassroots venues. In Europe, €1 per ticket will go to Médecins Sans Frontières, with Radiohead matching the total raised.The band’s ardent fans had guessed that the news was coming after the band updated its logo on Bandcamp and made their website show an intentional Error 404 message, and noticed that their longstanding visual artist Stanley Donwood shared the rocket-like image from the flyers on his Instagram.In case this sounds far-fetched, Radiohead fans predate Taylor Swift’s when it comes to scrying for clues about future activity. In March, Redditors noticed that the band had formed a new legal entity, a limited liability partnership with the name RHEUK25 – an arcane move they have previously made to herald their next moves. Last summer, bassist Colin Greenwood told NME that they had spent a few days rehearsing.The European dates are the band’s first live shows since 2018, when they concluded the tour for their ninth album, 2016’s A Moon Shaped Pool. Each member has subsequently continued their respective solo careers. Frontman guitarist Thom Yorke and lead guitarist Jonny Greenwood formed the Smile with jazz drummer Tom Skinner, and have released three albums to date. Yorke and Donwood recently collaborated on an art exhibition at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, which Guardian critic Eddy Frankel called“a succession of bad paintings”in a two-star review.View image in fullscreenThom Yorke and Stanley Donwood at their exhibiton This Is What You Get.Photograph: Photograph by Julian Broad, courtesy of TIN MAN ARTGuitarist Ed O’Brien released the solo album Earth in 2020, which featured Colin Greenwood on one song; the latter has also collaborated with the Belgian-Egyptian singer Tamino and toured as part of the live band with Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, as well as Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and Cave’s solo shows. Selway released his third solo album, Strange Dance, in 2023, and played drums on the fifth album by Newcastle band Lanterns on the Lake.Jonny Greenwood also collaborated with Israeli musician Dudu Tassa on the 2023 album Jarak Qaribak, comprising reworkings of Middle Eastern love songs recorded in Tel Aviv, Israel, and Oxfordshire, UK. The ensemble also features musicians from Syria, Lebanon, Kuwait and Iraq. A European tour was cancelled after the Israel-Gaza war broke out in October 2023. In 2024, Greenwood joined protests in Israel calling for the removal of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and for the release of hostages held by Hamas; he and Tassa also performed in Tel Aviv, which drew condemnation from pro-Palestinian activists.This year, the collective had two UK performances cancelled after reports of allegedly credible threats to the gigs. Greenwood said in response that they “dread the weaponisation of this cancellation by reactionary figures as much as we lament its celebration by some progressives”.Israel has proved a fraught subject for the band. Radiohead performed in Tel Aviv on their last tour, in July 2017, despite calls to cancel the performance. Yorke said at the time: “Playing in a country isn’t the same as endorsing its government.”In October 2024,Yorke walked off stage during a solo concert in Melbourneafter being heckled with pro-Palestinian remarks by an audience member. Yorke responded: “Come up here and say that … hop up on the fucking stage and say what you wanna say.” The protester then yelled: “How many dead children will it take for you to condemn the genocide in Gaza?” and Yorke ended the show.1:08Thom Yorke walks off stage after row with Gaza protester at Melbourne show – videoIn May, Yorke released a statement about the war in Gaza, saying that Netanyahu and his administration “need to be stopped” and that Hamas “chooses too to hide behind the suffering of its people”. He said that the Melbourne concert had not seemed like the right moment to “discuss the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza” and that afterwards he was shocked to see his “supposed silence … somehow being taken as complicity”. He added that he thought it would be “self-evident” from his music “that I could not possibly support any form of extremism or dehumanisation of others.”In July, O’Brien posted on Instagram in support of Irish rap trio Kneecap, which drew a comment from a fan about Radiohead’s stance on Israel. O’Brien responded: “My brothers abhor what is going on in Gaza. Just because they aren’t all over social media or using the exact wording that some feel is necessary does not mean they aren’t genuinely upset and angered by what is going on.” He added that “the algorithm feeds division and it’s not a place that many of us feel comfortable expressing our anger”.Before Radiohead’s new dates were officially confirmed, the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel had already shared a statement calling for a boycott of the tour as a result of Jonny Greenwood’s performance in Tel Aviv.“Even as Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza reaches its latest, most brutal and depraved phase of induced starvation, Radiohead continues with its complicit silence, while one member repeatedly crosses our picket line, performing a short drive away from a livestreamed genocide, alongside an Israeli artist that entertains genocidal Israeli forces,” it read.“Palestinians reiterate our call for the boycott of Radiohead concerts, including its rumoured tour, until the group convincingly distances itself, at a minimum, from Jonny Greenwood’s crossing of our peaceful picket line during Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.”Yorke has been less equivocal on the matter of Radiohead’s long-rumoured reunion. Last year, when asked by Australian radio outlet Double J how he felt about speculation over the band’s return, he replied: “I am not aware of it and don’t really give a flying fuck. No offence to anyone and er, thanks for caring. But I think we’ve earned the right to do what makes sense to us without having to explain ourselves or be answerable to anyone else’s historical idea of what we should be doing.”For many bands, a new tour would mean a new album – Radiohead’s 10th. But precedent – and Yorke’s comments – suggest no such guarantees.Radiohead’s EU tour dates in fullMovistar arena, Madrid, Spain – 4, 5, 7, 8 NovemberUnipol arena, Bologna, Italy – 14, 15, 17, 18 NovemberThe O2, London, UK – 21, 22, 24, 25 NovemberRoyal arena, Copenhagen, Denmark – 1, 2, 4, 5, DecemberUber arena, Berlin, Germany – 8, 9, 11, 12 DecemberExplore more on these topicsRadioheadThom YorkePop and rockIndieJonny GreenwoodnewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t just take some snaps and then go, I fully immerse myself in the lives of the friends I make. Who am I to speak on anybody’s behalf if I haven’t experienced what they have, myself?I photograph where I live, in southWales, because I know it better than anywhere else, but in this case I wanted to document a community I lived near but wasn’t part of. The body of work this picture is part of came about as a result of working with people who have been in and out of prison and become trapped in a cycle of incarceration, freedom then back to incarceration. I was wondering what draws them back to the place where they committed all their crimes.I found a kind of tour guide who’d been released from prison after many, many years, though he’s since gone back inside. He became my friend. He took me around the estate where he lived. During that process, I met a guy who’d just “acquired” a plot of land – I’m using the word loosely. He had chickens, horses and ducks, and he’d just bought some young doves. He told me the most beautiful story, which became a big part of the thought process behind my work.He said that at first he’d put the doves’ food on the floor of the cage, so they’d start to learn about love and family. After a week or two, he put the cage up on top of the horses’ stable, from where the doves would be able to see the clock tower on the school opposite, and he’d feed them up there. Finally, he opened the cage door and they were free.But they’d always fly back to that cage, after homing in on the clock tower – after a few weeks, he’d release them 500 miles away and they’d still find their way back, he said. They had the freedom to fly anywhere, but this was home. They’d go back into their cage, and the owner would lock them in.As it happens, the day I was on this guy’s plot there were kids playing all around. One kid had gone into a caravan, and he looked out at me and in that moment, I made this image. As viewers, we do the rest of the work in our heads – it’s our projection. Does he look reflective? Does he look sad? Actually, he was having loads of fun.My work is made with people who are friends with each other. I’ll go months without even making an imageIn essence, my work is about home, family and relationships. It is all made with people who are friends with each other. I’ll go months without even making an image at all, but my camera is always present. I edit the work into chapters and include text from the conversations I’ve recorded. This first chapter was calledThe Budgie Died Instantly, and was about the wider community. For the second chapter,It’s Hard to Report a Stolen Bike Stolen, the focus narrowed in on a particular group of friends, including a man called Tony who I’d approached after seeing him swearing and ranting in the street. We became dear friends, and the third chapter,As Far As They’re Concerned We Are a Normal Family, was all about Tony.Tony had a townhouse but chose to live in a big bell tent in the garden. He was desperate to find his tribe. Sadly, he took his own life in 2022, and I haven’t really made any pictures since. He never got to find out that I’d moved into a caravan myself as part of the process between us – I’ve lived that way for four years now.On reflection, I think Caravan Kid is looking out of the window and seeing the world at his feet. Kids are setting up their hierarchy at that age, they’re fighting for their place in the pecking order. There’s always a pecking order in both kids and adults, in the workplace and beyond. It’s that fight not to be the bottom dog.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Ahead of it coming out on 19 September, frontman Simon Neil will take on your questions.With Neil on vocals and guitars backed by twin brother rhythm section of James and Ben Johnston, the trio released their debut album Blackened Sky back in 2002, the start of a dogged, delightful march into the mainstream. Trailing sudden dynamic shifts and eye-catching song titles in their wake (special mention for Toys, Toys, Toys, Choke, Toys, Toys, Toys, ... And With the Scissorkick Is Victorious and There’s No Such Thing as a Jaggy Snake), they jumped to a major label for 2007’s Puzzle, to double-platinum sales with follow-up Only Revolutions and to the top of the UK album chart with 2013’s Opposites.Since then there’s been two more UK No 1 albums, headline slots at Download and Reading and Leeds festivals, and a series of arena tours. Now with what is tantamount to a greatest hits set – featuring Many of Horror, Mountains, Bubbles and so many more – the next one begins in January, with stellar support from Soft Play and the Armed. Neil has also found time for side projects Marmaduke Duke, Empire State Bastard and ZZC, and co-wrote a film, Balance, Not Symmetry, for which Biffy Clyro also did the soundtrack.It’s a huge body of work to get into with him – post your questions by Wednesday 10 September, and we’ll publish his answers on 19 September.Explore more on these topicsBiffy ClyroFilm & Music reader interviewPop and rockcalloutShareReuse this content"

Our young love didn’t survive my move home to Scotland, but years later, quite unexpectedly, we found each other againBruna De LucaWed 3 Sep 2025 01.55 EDTShareGrownups often roll their eyes at young love: at how all-consuming it is for the teenagers involved, and how predictably doomed it is to fail. But my holiday romance changed the course of my life.I was 16 when I met Giacomo at a bar in Atina, the tiny Italian mountain town where my parents grew up. There was a local festival one evening and tables were scarce, so our two friendship groups ended up squished around the same one. At more than 6ft tall, Giacomo was hard to miss. He was also friendly, smiley and, while he didn’t speak a word of English, I loved that he spared me the wholeciao bellaswagger usually reserved for “foreign girls”.I wasn’t foreign. Not really. My parents moved to Scotland in the 1960s, settling in the Borders town of Selkirk, but Atina had always been part of our lives, woven into every holiday, every dish on the dinner table. But, after meeting Giacomo, I began to see Italy differently. It wasn’t simply something I’d inherited any more; it was something I was experiencing for myself.So, when summer ended and real life began, I didn’t return to Scotland as I’d originally planned. I hadn’t enjoyed school and had left as soon as I could, intending to continue my studies through other routes. I stayed in Italy to figure out what I wanted to do with my newfound sense of independence – and my newfound love.A moment that changed me: I slipped in the shower, realised I was exhausted – and transformed my lifeRead moreWhen Giacomo moved to Rome to study architecture that autumn, he proved to be an excellentcicerone– an Italian word for a cultural guide – and I got to know a version of the city that went beyond its landmarks. Through him, I was introduced to student life, open-air music festivals, and secret little bakeries that sold pastries from the back door in the early hours.But it wasn’t all gelato and romance. I drifted between courses and jobs, hoping something would click, but nothing ever quite did. I tried studying in Italy but couldn’t get past the oral exams and, missing home, committed to a degree at Edinburgh University where – to no one’s surprise – I ended up studying Italian. Giacomo and I tried to make it work long distance, but mobile phones didn’t exist and the constant push and pull between countries, cultures and expectations took its toll.Our relationship didn’t last, but my love for Italy never died. The Italian side of me longed to be recognised and, after graduating, I moved to Italy again, this time to cities I chose for myself.I lived in Florence and Bologna. I worked, studied, and made lasting friendships – some with what I think of as Italian-Italians, others with third-culture kids like me. Despite our varied backgrounds, often with four or five nationalities in the mix, we understood what it meant to belong to more than one place – and to no place at all. To always be missing somewhere, or someone.Atina remained a constant, however, and I often spent holidays there, catching up with friends and family. Then, one summer, 12 years after our relationship ended, I saw Giacomo there, too – at the same bar where we had met all those years ago. Still tall (possibly even taller), still smiling. Still unable to speak a word of English.This time, the bar wasn’t busy – we didn’t have to share a table but, perhaps glimpsing the hopeful teenagers we’d once been, we chose to. And a new chapter opened in a story we thought had ended.View image in fullscreen‘Our lives are a mashup’ … Giacomo and Bruna in Atina, Italy.Photograph: Bruna De LucaGiacomo was going on holiday the next day, and we were both reluctant for the night to end. We lingered until we were the last ones at the bar, talking for so long that, at sunrise, his dad appeared to take him straight to the station, shaking his head at the sight of two thirtysomethings acting like teenagers. This time, we had mobile phones, so we exchanged numbers, and I remember wondering if it would come to anything, already half-knowing it would. Giacomo came to visit me in Bologna the first weekend he was free, and that became the first of many visits until, two years later, I moved to Rome.We’ve now been married for more than a decade. We eloped – not because we’re wildly romantic, but because it was the only option that made emotional sense. We both had large families, many of whom had also emigrated and were now scattered across Europe. The thought of bringing everyone together – of choosing one country over another, one language, one version of celebration – felt impossible.These days we’re officially based in the Scottish Borders, but our lives are still a mashup – from the way we flip between English and Italian (often in the same sentence) to our jointly owned business that straddles both countries and keeps us travelling back and forth. As we travel, we find ourselves filling in the 12-year gap in our story; beaches we both visited years apart, mutual friends we hadn’t realised we shared, and regional dishes familiar to one of us and new to the other. Perhaps our daughters will have their own holiday romances one day. I’ll try my best not to roll my eyes. Because, sometimes, it’s worth paying attention to the early instincts of young love.Livia in Rome by Bruna De Luca is out now (Chicken House, £8.99).

At first, I was served up joyful videos. Then the tone became much darker ...Kathryn WheelerWed 3 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTShareIdon’t remember where I was when myTikTokfeed showed me a video of a woman holding her stillborn baby, but I remember how I felt. At first, it appeared like any other video of a woman holding a newborn. It was tightly wrapped in blankets while she cradled it in her arms. She was crying, but so are most of the women in these post-birth videos. It wasn’t until I read the caption that I realised what I was looking at. Her baby had been delivered at 23 weeks. I was 22 weeks pregnant. I felt doomed.My social media algorithms knew I was pregnant before family, friends or my GP. Within 24-hours, they were transforming my feeds. On Instagram and TikTok, I would scroll through videos of women recording themselves as they took pregnancy tests, just as I had done. I “liked”, “saved”, and “shared” the content, feeding the machine, showing it that this is how it could hold my attention, compelling it to send me more. So it did. But it wasn’t long before the joy of those early videos started to transform into something dark.The algorithm began to deliver content about the things you fear the most while pregnant: “storytimes” about miscarriages; people sharing what happened to them and, harrowingly, filming themselves as they received the news that their baby had no heartbeat. Next came videos about birth disfigurements, those found by medical professionals early on, and those that were missed until the baby’s birth.One night, after a before-bed scroll delivered me a video of a woman who filmed her near-death childbirth experience, I uninstalled the apps through tears. But they were soon reinstalled, when the needs of work, friendships and habit dictated they must be. I tried blocking the content I didn’t want to see, but it made little difference.On TikTok, there are more than 300,000 videos tagged under “miscarriage”, and a further 260,000 under “miscarriageawareness”. One video with the caption “live footage of me finding out I had miscarried” has almost half a million views. Another showing a woman giving birth to a stillborn baby has just under five million.In another context, before I was pregnant, I would have found the content barrier-breaking and important. I don’t think the individuals who share such vulnerable moments are doing anything wrong. For the right person, it could be a lifeline. But it didn’t feel right in the feed of someone who had inadvertently signalled to the algorithm that they were having a baby.View image in fullscreen‘I “liked”, “saved”, and “shared” the content, feeding the machine, compelling it to send me more’ … Wheeler, while pregnant.Photograph: Courtesy of Kathryn WheelerWhen I talk about this experience with others who were pregnant at the same time as me, I am met with knowing nods and stories that match my own. I hear about how they were also served up personalised doses of fear, and how the algorithms evolved to target the things specific to them. Our experiences feel like a radicalisation, as normal worries were driven to new heights by a barrage of content that became more and more extreme. This is pregnancy and motherhood in 2025.“There are supportive posts, and then there are things so extreme and distressing, I don’t want to repeat them,” says Cherelle Mukoko, who is eight months pregnant. Mukoko mostly sees this content on Facebook and Instagram. She used to see it on TikTok as well, before she deleted the app. “My eldest is four. During that pregnancy, I came across upsetting posts on social media, some of them quite close to home, but this time it seems worse. The content feels more graphic and harder to escape.”Mukoko, 35, who is a woman of colour, has found that she is specifically shown content around the treatment of Black women in pregnancy.An analysis of NHS data in 2024found that Black women are up to six times more likely to experience severe complications during a hospital delivery than their white counterparts. “That hasn’t been my reality, but it does make me go into every appointment more cautious and on edge, wondering how I’ll be treated,” she says.“They really do instil fear,” she continues. “You start thinking: ‘Could this happen to me? Will I be in that unlucky percentage?’ With the complications I’ve already had during this pregnancy, seeing such negative things makes my intrusive thoughts spiral. It can leave you feeling resentful – you’re enduring so much already, and then on top of that, your social media feed is fuelling more anxiety.”For Dr Alice Ashcroft, a 29-year-old researcher and consultant who analyses the impact of identity, gendered language and technology: “It first started when I was trying to conceive. Seeing pregnancy announcements was hard. I also started to get a lot of ads for vitamins that would increase the chances of conception, but the reason I was struggling was an underlying health issue (a very rare blood disorder), so this was really hard to stomach.”Social media makes me feel lazy, useless, and inferior – even though I am going through the toughest time of my lifeIt didn’t stop once she was pregnant. “Towards the end of my pregnancy, we had some worrying scans at about 36 weeks, and I was looking at the web links suggested to me by the midwives. I’m not sure if it was the cookies I generated (which work as a digital footprint) or simply that the platforms I was engaging with knew I was in late pregnancy, but I started to see a large amount of content about late-stage terminations and miscarriages.” Her baby is now six months old.The ability of algorithms to target our most sensitive and private fears is uncanny and cruel. “I’ve been convinced for years that social media is reading my mind,” says Jade Asha, 36, who had her second son in January. “With me, it was all about body image: showing women at nine months pregnant still in the gym, when I hadn’t been able to do a 10-minute walk in months.Pregnancymakes my arthritis flare up. Even now, there are some days I can barely leave the house because swollen knees make it so difficult to walk.”Bottle-feeding her baby became another source of anxiety, says Asha. “My feeds would come up with posts about how breast is the only way, and a thousand comments of women agreeing. The problem with social media is that everyone is an ‘expert’ and so strong in their opinions that it can suck many others in.Social mediamakes me feel lazy, useless, and inferior – even though I am going through the toughest time of my life.”For Dr Christina Inge, a researcher at Harvard University specialising in the ethics of technology, these experiences are not surprising. “Social media platforms are optimised for engagement, and fear is one of the most powerful drivers of attention,” she says. “Once the algorithm detects that a person is pregnant, or might be, it begins testing content – the same as it does with any other information about a user. If a user lingers on an alarming video on pregnancy, even if just for a second, that is interpreted as interest. The system then feeds you more of the same.View image in fullscreen‘In the months since my pregnancy ended, the content on my feeds has shifted to the new fears I could face.’Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian“Distressing content isn’t a glitch; it’s engagement, and engagement is revenue,” Inge continues. “Fear-based content keeps people hooked because it creates a sense of urgency; people feel they need to keep watching, even when it’s upsetting. The platforms benefit financially, even as the psychological toll grows.”The negative effect of social media on pregnant women has been widely researched. In August, a systematicreview into social media use during pregnancyconsidered studies from the US, the UK, Europe and Asia. It concluded that while social media can offer peer-to-peer advice, support and health education, “challenges such as misinformation, increased anxiety and excessive use persist”. The review’s author, Dr Nida Aftab, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, highlights the role healthcare professionals should play in helping women make informed decisions about their digital habits.Not only are pregnant women more vulnerable social media users, they may also be spending more time scrolling.A study published in Midwiferylast year found there was a significant change in time spent on social media, frequency of use, and problematic use during pregnancy, all of which peaked at week 20. Additionally, 10.5% of the women in the study had a possible addiction to social media as defined by the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, meaning that social media had a significantly negative effect on their daily lives.Looking at the wider picture, Inge suggests several ways forward. Design changes could mean that platforms deliberately use positive, evidence-based content in sensitive areas such as pregnancy, health and grief. There could be more transparency around why users are seeing certain content (with an option to recalibrate when needed), and policymakers could put stronger safeguarding measures in place on sensitive topics.“Helping users understand that their feeds are algorithmic constructions, not neutral mirrors of reality, can help them disengage from the spiral,” Inge says. “Pregnancy and early parenthood should be protected spaces online, but they’re treated as just another data point to monetise.”For Ashcroft, the answer to the problem is complex. “One of the issues across the board is that the technology is developing at such a rate that legislation is slow to catch up,” she says. “But in this instance, I’m not sure where the onus lies. It could be on governments to legislate for accurate information on social media, but that sounds scarily like censorship. Some social media platforms are incorporating factchecking into their platforms with AI, but these are sometimes inaccurate and hold certain biases.” Using the “I’m not interested in this” feature could help, she suggests, “but even this will not be entirely successful. The main advice I would give is to reduce your use of social media.”At the start of the year, my baby arrived. She was healthy, and I could finally take a breath. But the relief was short-lived. In the months since my pregnancy ended and motherhood began, the content on my feeds has shifted to the new fears I could face. When I open Instagram, the suggested reels that now appear include: A video on “What NOT to do when your baby wakes up 20 minutes into their nap”; another of a baby in a carrier overlaid with the text “THIS IS REALLY NOT SAFE”; and a clip of a toddler with a piece of Lego in its mouth with the warning: “This could happen to your child if you don’t know how to act.”Is there a chance that this content makes me a better, more diligent and informed parent? Perhaps some of it does. But at what cost? The recent Online Safety Act has forced us to face our societal responsibility to protect vulnerable groups when they browse online. But as long as the constant, lingering threat of doom, despair and misinformation haunts the smartphones of new and expectant mothers, while social media companies monetise their fears, we are failing in this duty.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

To my left, the view is not just clear but startlingly beautiful.I’m able to see back down to the tiny mountain hamlet of Gacaferi, where I’d slept the previous night, to look across the deep greenery of Deçan Gorge beyond, over dense pine forests and grasslands that pop with pink and yellow wildflowers, and gaze all the way to the 2,461m summit of Çfërla and the rugged peaks of western Kosovo’s Accursed mountains.Western Kosovo map showing areas near the routeWe are on stage nine of theVia Dinarica Kosovo, a 75-mile, 13-stage hiking trail through this storied country. The route links up to theVia Dinarica, a Balkan trail that runs from Slovenia through to Albania. The Kosovo section opened in 2015, but was recently remapped and relaunched as part of a three-year, £1.2m project funded by the Italian agencyAICS.There was a Yugoslav barracks in Gacaferi during the Kosovo war – the brutal conflict between the Kosovo Liberation Army (known locally as the UÇK) and Slobodan Milošević’s Yugoslavia, which ended with an aerial Nato bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999. UÇK fighters used to launch surprise attacks over the border ridge here, and arms were smuggled into Kosovo for use by liberation fighters.View image in fullscreenThe writer Stuart Kenny hiking near Milishevc.Photograph: Stuart KennyThe barracks is long gone. Today, the handful of locals in Gacaferi fly red Albanian flags outside their houses alongside Kosovo blue. They tend to their sheep and warmly welcome hikers, who trade travel stories while feasting on burek and Rugova cheese in the scenic guesthouse.“I wish the stones here could talk,” says Uta Ibrahimi, my mountain guide. Uta is the founder ofButterfly Outdoor Adventure, and was an integral part of the Via Dinarica Kosovo project. She also happens to be the first person from Kosovo to have climbed Mount Everest, having done so in 2017. And on 10 May 2025, when she stood on the 8,586-metre summit of Kanchenjunga in the Himalayas, Ibrahimi became the first woman from the Balkans to have climbed all 14 of the world’s 8,000-metre mountains. Uta returned to a hero’s welcome at Pristina airport. “I did it for myself, but also for my country,” Uta says. “Not just for the Himalayan views.”Descending into a meadow, we were engulfed in blueberry bushes; our boots brushing against wild strawberries and carrotsI had arrived in the capital of Pristina some days earlier. I walked past statues of Bill Clinton and Bob Dole; past new cathedrals and centuries-old mosques. Brilliant, bizarre brutalist architecture draws the gaze here – most notably theNational Library of Kosovo, formed of a cluster of exposed concrete blocks, caged in metal and topped by domes.View image in fullscreenThe National Library of Kosovo, Pristina.Photograph: Engin Korkmaz/AlamyThe Via Dinarica connects the municipalities of Peja, Deçan and Junik in western Kosovo. To start our adventure – hiking a 40-mile stint of the Via Dinarica – we drove to the city of Peja, behind which the Accursed mountains rise like fortress walls.We began on stage three, with sunny alpine views and green slopes rising to prominent peaks. Red and white waymarkers guided us up narrow trails to the 2,403-metre Hajla peak, on the border of Kosovo and Montenegro. On one side, the ridgeline slopes sharply down to the Balkan pines of Kosovo and across green valleys to the mountains of Albania. On the other side, there is a near vertical drop down to Montenegro, via rugged, exposed limestone cliff.I ate spinach burek for lunch on the summit of Hajla, sitting next to fuzzy, star-shaped edelweiss flowers, while alpine choughs circled above. We slept at ERA Lodge, a homely wooden mountain cabin run by Fatos Lajçi, a passionate conservationist. “Everything that’s in Europe, we have here,” he said; brown bears, wild boars, wolves and even the endangered Balkan lynx. This lynx is at serious risk of extinction, but has on occasion wandered by Lajçi’s camera traps.View image in fullscreen‘Locals in Gacaferi fly red Albanian flags alongside Kosovo blue.’Photograph: Stuart KennyAs we left the next morning, a shepherd sang songs of love and lost heroes to his flock, and we rejoined the Via Dinarica on a freshly built section of trail. Descending into a meadow, we were engulfed in blueberry bushes; our boots brushing against wild strawberries and carrots.It was not until a few days later, when we reachedKulla Guesthousein Milishevc, a building styled like an old stone tower, that we met another hiker.

We walked by memorials to fallen UÇK soldiers. Hard rain and mist clouded the view, but limestone monoliths poked through and wildflowers defied the clouds with sprinkles of colour. By the time we arrived in Gacaferi, the sun was shining on the tractors and goats of this remote hamlet.‘Reconnect with yourself and nature’: yoga and pristine scenery in MontenegroRead moreIn the evenings there was time for me to bug Uta for stories. She is full of tales; of crampons received as Valentine’s gifts; of poles perilously dropped at 8,000 metres; of loved ones lost on mountain faces, or to war; of emotional summit days and ecstatic nights dancing at festivals.Above the 2,400-metre mark, we hike on limestone slabs bright with lichenIbrahimi was 15 years old when war hit, but she speaks with a contagious positivity. “We had to stay inside for three months of bombing, and you never knew if it was the last day of your life,” she says. “We had to jump walls to run away from the police. That whole idea, of waiting for that moment they will come – and who knows what they will do to you – it just made us stronger and more willing to live. Then when you are free, you do not see any limits.”View image in fullscreenThe mountaineer and guide Uta Ibrahimi on the summit of Gjeravica.Photograph: Stuart KennyFrom Gacaferi, we set our sights on the 2,656-metre Gjeravica. It is a hulking peak surrounded by heart-shaped mountain lakes and patches of snow. This side of the Accursed mountains is more dramatic than the border with Montenegro, the gentle green replaced by fierce grey. Above the 2,400-metre mark, we hike on limestone slabs bright with lichen. On the summit, a Kosovo flag flies above a trig point bearing the double-headed eagle of Albania. There is a metal marker with a UÇK head, and a view over Kosovo’s flatland. Our descent is remarkably pretty, running along the secluded Gjeravica Lake, through fields of blueberry bushes, on to grassland peppered with yellow flowers.There is a soft beauty to this country; in the mint you smell in the meadows, in the sound of the whinchats on the hills, in the fluff of the edelweiss flowers on high ridges, and in the warmth of the guesthouses, where the burek is plentiful and the coffee strong.“People want somewhere quiet, super-wild, without any roads,” says Uta. “It’s here to explore.”The trip was provided byNaturKosovo.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If you grew up using a conventional toothbrush – essentially a stick with bristles on the end – you may be surprised to learn just how long the electric toothbrush has been around. The first was designed in the late 1930s, but that model was a long way from the sleek, feature-packed and Bluetooth-enabled beasts you can buy today.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There are now dozens of ultra-advanced versions on the market, but which ones are worth your cash? For the past two months, my teeth have become figurative guinea pigs to help you find the answer to that question. I put a bunch of electric toothbrushes from Oral-B, Philips, Suri, Ordo, Silk’n, Foreo and more through their paces to separate the best from the rest. Here are my conclusions.At a glanceBest electric toothbrush overall:Spotlight Sonic ProFrom £104.97 at Spotlight Oral CareBest value electric toothbrush:Icy Bear Next-Generation sonic toothbrush£64.99 at AmazonBest electric toothbrush for sustainability:Suri 2.0£105 at SuriBest premium electric toothbrush:Philips Sonicare Smart 9400£222.97 at AmazonBest oscillating toothbrush:Oral-B iO3£65 at BootsWhy you should trust meAs well as having the physical qualities required to test electric toothbrushes (my own teeth and a reliable toothpaste budget), I’ve been testing electronics – phones, drones and everything in between – for more than a decade.Also – and I’ll put this delicately to prevent you from closing the page in justified disgust – as someone who has to wear a retainer every night after Invisalign treatment, the toothbrushes weren’t short of nasties to clean during testing. They’ve seen things, man.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I appeared to undergo a Damascene conversion to good oral hygiene.’Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianI doubt many people include the four minutes spent brushing their teeth as a highlight of even the most tedious day, so spare a thought for the months when it became my life’s obsessive focus. Fortunately, and purely by chance, this coincided with a dentist’s visit in which I appeared to have undergone a Damascene conversion to good oral hygiene, so it did have its upside.Anyway, the process was actually pretty simple: brush, brush and brush again, taking note of mouthfeel, grip, cleanliness, the features that appealed and those little things that made me irrationally grumpy. I used plaque-disclosing tablets, which turn your teeth a charming shade of pink and blue to reveal areas where plaque resides. Even the cheapest brushes did a good job of removing the blue, though, even if they didn’tfeelas clean, so this test proved unhelpful.Ultimately, while each of the 21 brushes I tested was leagues ahead of manual toothbrushes, I ordered them based on performance, features, feel, stamina and – perhaps most importantly, given how close the final results were – value for money.A quick note on that: toothbrush recommended retail prices (RRPs) are often what you’d call “aspirational”. They’re frequently on offer, and even £500 models regularly go on sale for less than half price. It’s worth clicking through and checking what today’s price is on the off-chance.The best electric toothbrushes in 2025View image in fullscreenA dental hygiene lineup of some of the toothbrushes I tested.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianBest electric toothbrush overall:Spotlight Sonic ProView image in fullscreen£104.97 at Spotlight Oral CareFrom £112.50 at AmazonThe Spotlight Sonic Pro is a great all-rounder, with excellent features and a price that doesn’t verge on ridiculous. Founded by two sibling dentists, Spotlight has only two electric toothbrushes for adults at the moment, and the Pro model tested here delivers on every metric that counts.Why we love itFirst of all, the Spotlight Sonic Pro performs an impressive clean. Its four modes range from 30,000 (gentle) to 50,000 (polish) brush strokes a minute (BPM). That makes it the second most powerful sonic brush I tested, and the two that delivered more have RRPs starting at £400. While not completely necessary for a healthy mouth, such speeds help provide that “fresh from the hygienist” feeling, even when your teeth are crying out for a thorough clean after a day mainlining soft drinks.It also packs a pressure sensor to make sure you’re not brushing too hard and potentially damaging your gums, and there are four lights just below the head to show how far you are into your two-minute brushing cycle.Flip the heads over and you’ll find a tongue cleaner, plus it comes with a handy travel case too. While this doesn’t charge the brush, the magnetic USB-C charging base is pretty compact, and a single charge can last up to 70 days, which is above average for an electric toothbrush. Even at the higher speeds I was using it at, it didn’t show any signs of slowing down during the testing period, so that feels accurate.If you can do without the pressure sensor, progress lights, tongue cleaner and polish setting, you’re likely to be just as happy with thenon-Pro versionand can save a few quid.It’s a shame that …modes aren’t labelled on the brush itself, even if you can easily feel the difference.Type:sonicModes: four (gentle, clean, white and polish)Power: 50,000 BPMPressure sensor:yesBattery life: up to 70 daysApp: noBest value electric toothbrush:Icy Bear Next-Generation sonic toothbrushView image in fullscreen£64.99 at AmazonThere were three strong contenders in the £50-65 price bracket that I was considering for the best-value pick (the£59.99 Ordo Sonic+and the£50 Silk’n SonicSmile Pluswere the others), but I ultimately chose the £65 Icy Bear because it was the only one to come with a pressure sensor. In fact, this was the cheapest toothbrush I reviewed that had one.Why we love itOddly, the pressure sensor isn’t pitched as the main selling point, which is instead, rather confusingly, fingerprint recognition. This isn’t some kind of added dental security – it’s to prevent it from being activated in luggage without needing an extra case, and it works pretty well (with a perfectly angled edge and a lot of effort, I was able to turn it on without skin contact – but it’s not something you’ll do by accident).Otherwise, it ticks all the boxes. The top of the handle glows white when in use, and flashes ominously if you’re pushing too hard, and there are a generous five brushing modes. At its maximum power, it hits a very respectable 40,000 BPM for a solid clean, too.It’s a shame that …there’s no charging stand, and you’ll need to open up a flap on the base for USB-C charging.Type:sonicModes:five (clean, whiten, polish, massage and sensitive)Power: 40,000 BPMPressure sensor:yesBattery life: up to 45 daysApp: noBest electric toothbrush for sustainability:Suri 2.0View image in fullscreen£105 at Suri£105 at BootsTheoriginal Suri toothbrushwas not only solid, but also the only real choice for the climate-conscious in an industry that doesn’t seem to have taken much notice of the climate emergency.Unfortunately, it had a couple of issues that held it back: it lacked a pressure sensor, and the spring-pin charging system broke no fewer than three times on me. Both of these problems have been fixed in Suri 2.0, making it an easy recommendation.Why we love itIn short, you no longer need to feel like you’re missing out by opting for a green option. The Suri 2.0’s slim design is lightweight and better suited for trips away than ever, thanks to a new travel lock and plant-based head cover.Meanwhile, its unreliable spring-pin charger has been replaced by a wireless version (both in the bundled case and stand), and its new pressure sensor vibrates three times and pauses the brush if you push too hard.All of this builds on what made the original so good: its eco-friendly credentials. The company has been working with ClimatePartner to offset 100% of its emissions (including transport and manufacturing), and it provides a postage-paid compostable bag to send the used heads back for recycling. Theseheads (three for £14.99, or cheaper on a subscription), incidentally, are cornstarch, with the bristles made of castor oil.It’s a shame that …it’s a little lacking in the power department, with its 33,000 BPM vibration frequency feeling noticeably less thorough than its rivals.Type:sonicModes:two (clean and polish)Power:33,000 BPMPressure sensor:yesBattery life:1+ monthApp:noTo find out more, read our fullSuri 2.0 toothbrush reviewBest premiumelectric toothbrush:Philips Sonicare Smart 9400View image in fullscreen£399.99 at John Lewis£222.97 at AmazonIf you have a toothbrush budget most people could only dream of, then the Philips Sonicare Smart 9400 is the one to go for. I also tested theDiamondClean 9900, which retails for slightly more than the Amazon price, but I actually slightly prefer the way this one charges.Why we love itWhen I took the Sonicare 9400 out of the box, I thought they’d packed the wrong charger. It turns out that the handy rinse glass included in the packageishow it charges. You rest the charging puck underneath it, and the toothbrush charges through the glass when not in use. What a time to be alive.With up to 62,000 motions a minute, it’s the joint most powerful sonic brush I tested (tying with the aforementioned DiamondClean 9900), and you can really feel the results after use. It has four modes – clean (with three intensities), deep clean, gum health and white – feels comfortable in the hand, and comes with a charging case if you don’t want to take the magical glass charger on the road.It also connects to a rather excellent app to track your brushing habits. Unlike with the DiamondClean 9900, where it’s the only way to cycle between modes, you don’t have to use it. But if you do, you’ll receive guidance on your brushing, showing the areas you’ve missed and giving you the option to spend a bit longer on them if needed. It can be connected with Apple Health for iPhone data nerds, and it’ll even automatically reorder brush heads for you if you want, so you’re never caught short.It’s a shame that …it misses out on the sensitive mode of the DiamondClean 9900, so those with tooth pain may want to look elsewhere. Battery life is also rather stingy, thanks to the Bluetooth.Type:sonicModes:four (clean, deep clean+, gum health and white+)Power: 62,000 BPMPressure sensor:yesBattery life: up to 14 daysApp: yesBest oscillating toothbrush:Oral-B iO3View image in fullscreen£65 at Boots£65 at AmazonThis oscillating toothbrush (which moves the bristles in a circular motion, rather than vibrating like most other brushes here – see the buying guide below for more information) isn’t technically the best one you can buy, as you can probably tell from the fact that Oral-B’s iO line goes all the way up to the iO10. But because they all use the same motor and brush, and thus offer similar performance, this is the one I recommend: it jettisons unnecessary extras (like a connected app and screen) in order to simply deliver the features you need for a great clean.Why we love itIt boasts three modes – daily clean, sensitive and whiten – and its round heads are small enough to get into tight areas. Most importantly, its pressure sensor won’t only tell you when you’re applying too much pressure, but also when you’re applying too little, via an easy-to-understand white/green/red lighting system in a ring at the top of the handle.While it has fewer modes than the higher-numbered iOs, it delivers the same dentist-fresh-feeling performance, while retailing for a fraction of their optimistic RRPs.It’s a shame that …at £15 for two,replacement headsare a touch on the pricey side. And, like all the Oral-B brushes I tested, it made me oddly dribbly during the brushing, so stay near the sink.Type:oscillatingModes:three (daily clean, whitening and sensitive)Power: not disclosedPressure sensor:yesBattery life: up to 18 daysApp: noThe best water flossers, tested: seven models for that dentist-clean feelingRead moreThe best of the restForeo Issa 3View image in fullscreen£44.50 at Foreo£48.95 at AmazonBest for:sensitive teethIt may look like something more at home on the shelves of Ann Summers, but the Foreo Issa 3 is doing something a bit different, which makes it ideal for those with extra sensitive gnashers, or those loth to give up their manual toothbrush.The medical-grade silicone and PBT polymer bristles are designed for scrubbing away at your teeth like a traditional manual toothbrush as hard as you like, rather than purely relying on the sometimes overpowering buzz of the motor. The sonic vibrations are still present here – with 16 intensities – but they’re significantly more gentle than the other models, as they’re designed to be supplemented by traditional brushing motions.Foreo reckons that said bristles are up to 10,000 times more hygienic than their nylon counterparts, which means the head needs replacing only every six months. The company also says the brush will go for an entire year on a single charge. Naturally, it’s been impossible to emulate that much use during the testing period, but it’s certainly shown no signs of slowing down, and given a charge takes only two hours, it won’t be a big hardship if it falls a little short.It didn’t make the final cut because …for me, it simply didn’t remove plaque as effectively in two minutes as its more traditional rivals, even with the added push of manual scrubbing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

While my mouth didn’t feel as fresh as with more expensive models, bluntly, it didn’t feel like a quarter of the performance for a quarter of the price.It didn’t make the final cut because …while I had no issues with my test unit, Amazon’s AI analysis of its customer reviews found that “some customers report that it turns on randomly, doesn’t charge, and doesn’t retain any charge”. So there may be an element of getting what you pay for.Type:sonic;modes:five (white, clean, sensitive, polish and massage);power: 40,000 BPM;pressure sensor:no;battery life: up to 120 days;app: noOral-B iO9View image in fullscreen£200 at Boots£200 at Oral-BBest for:if money is no objectWith a crazy £500+ RRP, you may wonder what kind of black magic the Oral-B iO9 offers your daily brush. The answer is lots, but not enough to justify its price, hence the inclusion here.It comes with a whopping seven cleaning modes (daily clean, sensitive, gum care, intense, whiten, super sensitive and tongue clean), a colour screen to cycle through them, and built-in 3D teeth tracking that can detect 16 mouth zones to indicate how your technique is in the connected app. It charges quickly too – just three hours via the magnetic charging stand or the bundled snazzy charging case and proprietary cable with a plug.There is a middle ground between this and the recommended iO3 above, with theOral-B iO6offering a black-and-white screen and a connected app, albeit with slower charging, a non-charging case, weaker position tracking and fewer modes. If an app is important to you, but your money-to-sense ratio is still intact,that’s probably the one to go for.It didn’t make the final cut because …at RRP, it costs half a grand! You could buy 25 Coulax C8s for that.Type:oscillating;modes:seven (daily clean, sensitive, gum care, intense, whiten, super sensitive, tongue clean);power: not disclosed;pressure sensor:yes;battery life: up to 14 days;app: yesSilk’n SonicYouView image in fullscreen£89 at Boots£49 at AmazonBest for:battery lifeToothbrush battery life varies wildly because it depends on a host of factors: how often you brush, how long you spend doing so, and which modes you use. As such, plenty of people may find that manufacturers inadvertently (or, cynically, advertently) oversell their stamina.Still, if battery life is the be-all and end-all for you, you should give the Silk’n SonicYou a look. Although it is not as good as that of the Foreo, the manufacturer suggests you’ll get up to 300 days’ use with it, if you use the sensitive (30,000 strokes a minute) setting twice a day for a total of four minutes. That’ll obviously go down faster if you brush more often, for longer, or use the 37,000-stroke-a-minute whitening mode, but given most of the brushes I was testing were rated in the 14- to 90-day area, it’s still a stamina champion. It certainly didn’t need charging while I was using it.Infrequent charging can be a curse if you’re dealing with a bespoke charger that you can’t find when the time comes, but thankfully you just need to pop open the base and connect a common-or-garden USB-C cable to top it up.It didn’t make the final cut because …battery life is often directly linked to the power of the brush, and while 37,000 BPM is nothing to be sneezed at, you can get more power if you’re prepared to charge more often.Type:sonic;modes:three (sensitive, clean and white);power: 37,000 BPM;Pressure sensor:no;battery life: up to 300 days;app: noWhites Beaconsfield sonic LED toothbrushView image in fullscreen£49.99 at Superdrug£49.99 at AmazonBest for:whiteningWhile many toothbrushes (including this one) have a built-in whitening setting that adds time or alternates speeds to remove surface stains, the Whites Beaconsfield sonic LED toothbrush – with its terrifying picture of a toothy strawberry on the box – goes the extra mile by including blue light whitening technology. The company says this can whiten teeth by an average of 2.5 shades in three days.A week’s use did indeed appear to make my teeth appearslightlylighter in before-and-after shots, although you shouldn’t expect miracles.

Without them, “it’s harder to get the same result”, says Caitlin Miller, head of hygiene and therapy at Bupa Dental Care UK. “To get the same level of cleaning found with an electric toothbrush, you’d have to spend a lot longer than two minutes brushing with a manual.”The reasons are threefold, she explains: manual dexterity, people are more likely to use their expensive electric device properly and sheer power.“You don’t have to really do anything with it, and it does a better job,” Miller says. “That’s not to say that they suit everybody. There are people who can do a perfectly good job with a manual toothbrush, but for most of my patients, I will see improvements when people go on to an electric toothbrush.”How do you use an electric toothbrush?“You want to hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle – half on the gum, half on the tooth. You should just be holding it horizontally, sweeping across the tooth and gum margins,” says Miller, adding that you should move slowly, allocating a couple of seconds for each tooth.“You don’t move it up and down, you don’t need to move it round and round. That’s the beauty of the electric toothbrush: you can be pretty lazy with it and it still does a good job.”But a common mistake is to press too hard, which is why some of the brushes in our guide come with pressure sensors – something actively recommended by Miller. “If you’ve got too much pressure, you’re essentially dampening the vibrations and bristles.”The best mattresses: sleep better with our six rigorously tested picksRead moreHow often do you need to charge an electric toothbrush?This varies hugely between toothbrushes, and depends on how often you brush and the settings you use. The only certainty is that you need to charge them more often than a manual toothbrush – which is to say “at all”.According to Miller, plenty of patients fall back on inferior manual brushing because of this. “The number of people who say, ‘Oh, I do have an electric toothbrush, but I always forget to charge it, and then it takes three days, so I just use my manual toothbrush,’” she laments. “Keeping it charged is quite important.”The good news is that batteries now tend to be lithium-ion, meaning they charge quickly, and they last a decent amount of time, too.The ones I tested had manufacturer-quoted battery lives of between 14 and 365 days, which is an enormous gulf. Plenty of factors play into this, including power, connectivity and the size of the battery itself, but it’s also worth bearing in mind how this is measured. Generally, a manufacturer counts a day as four minutes of brushing over two sessions, but it might be more or less, so read the small print.You may instinctively be drawn to brushes with longer battery ratings, but convenience is also a factor. A proprietary charger might be more of a faff than a USB-C one, or a charging dock that sits neatly on the sink, especially if months go between charges and you forget where your cable lives.You may also want to charge more often than required. Anecdotally, I can easily feel the difference in strength between a toothbrush approaching the end of its battery and the same model fresh off the charger.How often do you need to replace your toothbrush head?As for replacing the heads, Miller suggests you do this every three months – or earlier if it looks splayed or frayed because its cleaning performance will suffer. “You can see it under a microscope: it gets really worn on top.”Beyond an electric toothbrush, Miller stresses the importance of cleaning between the teeth, and she has a clear order of preference: interdental brushes, then floss and finallywater flossers.“If I’ve got patients who won’t use anything often, if I can get them on a water flosser, then that’s better than nothing,” she says.The different types of electric toothbrush: oscillating v sonic toothbrushesThere are two main types of toothbrushes on the market: oscillating and sonic – with the latter seemingly dominating at the moment. “They work differently, but they’re both doing a similar sort of thing,” says Miller.In short, an oscillating toothbrush moves the bristles back and forth in a circular motion, while sonic brushes use vibrations to move the bristles in two directions to loosen plaque. The latter is measured in brush strokes per minute (BPM) and my selection was rated between 11,000 and 62,000 BPM. Miller says some of her clients find the sonic brushes a bit “ticklish” at first, but this is something you can get used to over time.Which is better? Asystematic review and meta-analysis of 38 comparison studiespublished in the International Journal of Dental Hygiene found a “small but clinically relevant advantage” for oscillating brushes. But it added that it’s “unlikely that dental care professionals in routine examination would be able to detect [the] small differences” between the two, meaning that personal preference should ultimately rule supreme.Alan Martin is awriterwhohas been putting products –including phones, gaming devices and wearables – through their paces formore than a decade.

Thompsonturned hers into a saladwith pepper, spring onion, tomatoes and cucumber. Inspired, I rushed out to buy a bag (yes, I see the irony, too) and made a salad using leftovers. And, of course, ended up with half a bag of orzo in my cupboard.Orzo salad: an anti-recipeI’ve called this an anti-recipe because I think recipes are often guilty of creating food waste by being too prescriptive. I want you to cook with love, confidence and creativity, using up whatever you can find. So, use orzo if you have it; if not, another pasta or even a grain can be quickly cooked up to create a satiating salad.Build an imaginative meal using leftovers saved from a previous lunch. Stale or out-of-date – but still safe to eat – nuts, seeds and spices. You can tell if they’re off by the rancid, oily smell and bitter taste. Other foods you can revive and reuse: wrinkly veg and wilted herbs from the crisper drawer (revived in ice water), tinned or frozen vegetables, and odds and ends of cheese.Serves2 as a main or 6 as a sideAll ingredients and quantities are optional and should be added to tasteFor the salad300-400g cooked orzo(from about 125-150g uncooked)130-260g cooked beans or pulses(eg ½-1 can drained cannellini, brown lentils or kidney beans)200-300g vegetables, cooked or raw (eg, frozen peas, diced boiled sweet potatoes, green peppers)100-200g cheese(eg, feta, parmesan, cheddar), sliced or crumbled50-100g toasted nuts and/or seeds(eg, cashews, almonds, peanuts, pumpkin or sesame seeds)50-100g other store cupboard ingredients(eg, sun-dried tomatoes, dried apricots, sultanas)30-50g fresh soft herbs(eg, parsley, coriander, mint), stalks finely chopped, leaves roughly choppedOther leftovers, to taste – I had a small amount of fennel frond pesto salad (recipe coming up in a couple of weeks), which I added to the mix.For the dressingLeftover salad dressings(eg, caesar, French, honey and mustard), or drizzle on 2–4 tbsp oil (eg, extra-virgin olive oil, avocado oil, hemp oil) and 1–2 tbsp lemon juice, wine vinegar or ume vinegar (seemy apricot umeboshi recipefor the latter)Tip the cooked and cooled pasta into a large bowl. Now build the salad like a buddha bowl, arranging each ingredient side by side, so you can see exactly what you’ve got before mixing.Add the beans or pulses, followed by the cooked and raw vegetables. Add the cheese, then sprinkle over the nuts and seeds.Top with anything else you have in the cupboard that’s packed with flavour, such as sun-dried tomatoes or dried fruit.Finish with the chopped soft herbs, then dress to taste (if you’ve got just a little dressing left in the bottle, bulk it out with a splash of oil and lemon juice or vinegar).

It’s very popular in southern Europe, where there are hundreds of recipes to choose from. The salting draws out some of the water and improves the fish’s flavour and texture, and it’s a method that pre-dates refrigeration, when salt was used to preserve food.Esqueixadais a Catalan salad of sorts that’s fresh, cooling and utterly delicious. The fried hake, meanwhile, is a little heavier, but addictive and perfect for sharing with a cold aperitif. Both are regulars on our summer menu, and we often flip between the two.Esqueixada (pictured top)Prep15 minCure30 minChill2 hr+Cook15 minServes4For the salted hake2 thick hakefillets(about 200g each), pin-boned50g coarse sea saltFor the esqueixada2salted hake fillets(see above and method)2very ripe large tomatoes, coarsely grated to a pulp and skins discarded2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus a little extra to finish2 tsptop-quality white-wine vinegar1 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsleySalt,to taste2 tbsp black olives, pitted1 tbsp salted capers, well rinsed2 small salad onions, tropea ideally, though spring onion whites will do, peeled if need be, trimmed and finely slicedTo make the salted hake, lay the fish in a dish or tray large enough to hold the fillets side by side without overlapping. Sprinkle evenly with the salt, turn to coat on all sides, then cover with clingfilm and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Wash the salt off the fish, pat dry on kitchen paper and return to the fridge to chill and firm up for at least two hours, and ideally overnight.Bring a large pan of salted water to a gentle simmer, then drop in the salted hake fillets, making sure they are submerged. Take the pan off the heat and leave the fish to poach in the residual heat for six to eight minutes, until the hake turns opaque and flakes easily. Transfer the fish to a plate and leave to cool at room temperature.Gently flake the hake into a large bowl and add the tomato pulp, olive oil, vinegar, parsley and a small pinch of salt. Fold gently, taking care not to break up the natural flakes of the fish, then taste and, if need be, adjust with more vinegar and a little salt to taste.Spoon the salad into four shallow bowls, garnish with the olives, capers and sliced onion, finish with a little extra-virgin olive oil and serve.Fried salted hake with aïoliView image in fullscreenWilliam Gleave’s fried salted hake with aïoli.Prep10 minCure30 minChill2 hr+Cook15 minServes4 as a snackFor the aïoli1 garlic clove, peeled and grated2 egg yolks30gdijon mustard30ml white-wine vinegar½ tsp fine salt200ml sunflower oil50ml extra-virgin olive oil5ml lemon juiceFor the fried fish125gplain flour, plus a little extra for coating the hake250ml sparkling mineral water750ml sunflower oil, for deep-frying2salted hake fillets(see recipe above), each cut into 4 piecesSalt, to taste1 lemon, cut into wedgesFirst make the aïoli. Put the grated garlic, egg yolks, mustard, vinegar and salt in a bowl, then whisk to combine. Now comes the crucial part: whisking continuously, very slowly start dribbling in the sunflower and olive oils in a very thin, steady stream until the mixture thickens and emulsifies. Once all the oil has been incorporated, add the lemon juice and whisk again. Cover and store in the fridge until needed; the aïoli will keep for three days.Now for the batter. In a large bowl, whisk the flour and sparkling water until well combined.Pour the sunflower oil into a deep-sided frying pan and heat to 175C (if you don’t have a probe, drop in a little blob of batter: it should sizzle and bubble, not burn and smoke). Coat the salted hake pieces in a light dusting of flour, then drop into the batter. Working in two batches, lift half the hake pieces out of the batter, let any excess batter drip back into the bowl, then carefully drop the fish into the hot oil and fry for four to five minutes, until golden brown and crisp. Lift out with a slotted spoon or spider, transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper (or a rack) to drain, then repeat with the rest of the battered hake.Very lightly season the fried fish with salt, then serve with the aïoli, lemon wedges and a cold beer or vermouth.William Gleave is chef/co-owner ofSargassoin Margate, KentExplore more on these topicsFoodFishSeafoodSaladSnacksStarterTomatoesrecipesShareReuse this content"

How to cut costs when you’re expecting a babyFrom free prescriptions and essential vitamins, to statutory maternity pay, a lot of assistance is availableMabel Banfield-NwachiWed 3 Sep 2025 09.21 EDTFirst published on Wed 3 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTShareGet free NHS prescriptionsPregnant women in England are entitled to free NHS prescriptions during pregnancy and for 12 months after giving birth, whether they are employed or not. (In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, they are free for everyone.) You need a maternity exemption certificate, which you can get from a midwife, doctor or health visitor.You are also entitled to free dental treatment during pregnancy and for 12 months after giving birth in all parts of the UK. You must have a maternity exemption certificate or equivalent.This is a digital or paper certificate, and you show it to the pharmacist when picking up prescriptions in England, or the dentist at your appointment.“When you’re pregnant or have a new baby, there can be extra costs that add up quickly. That’s why it’s vital to check you are getting all the help you’re entitled to,” says Lilly Aaron, the senior policy manager at the Money and Pensions Service.If you have paid for prescriptions while you are covered by the certificate, you may be entitled to a refund.Check grants and benefitsYou could be eligible for a one-off payment of £500 under the Sure Start Maternity Grant scheme if you live in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, you or your partner are on certain benefits and you are expecting your first baby.Kate Marsh, the midwifery manager at Tommy’s, the pregnancy and baby charity, says it is important to apply within the time limit. “You need to claim it within 11 weeks of the baby’s due date or within six months after your baby is born, [and] it doesn’t have to be repaid,” she said.She adds: “You’re also eligible for the scheme if you have refugee status or humanitarian protection, or you’ve left Ukraine or Afghanistan to come to the UK because of conflict and upheaval in those countries.”View image in fullscreenThere are various grants and benefits for mothers in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.Photograph: NineLives/Getty ImagesScotland has a similar scheme called thePregnancyand Baby Payment. “Anyone eligible – depending on income and benefit entitlement – will receive £767.50 for their first child, and £383.75 for babies born after that,” Marsh says.Forty-eight hours after you have registered the birth of your child, you are also entitled to claim child benefit. For the eldest child, you will get £26.05 a week. For the second, where you will meet the two-child cap, you get £17.25.However, you may have to pay the high income child benefit charge if you or your partner have an individual income that is over the threshold (more than £60,000 for the 2024-25 tax year).Take free vitaminsMaking sure you get the right nutrients is important for your baby’s growth and development. You will get most of the vitamins and minerals you need by eating a healthy, varied diet, but the NHS also advises you take folic acid, iron and vitamin D supplements.Some pregnant women are entitled to free vitamins containing folic acid, vitamin C and vitamin D under the Healthy Start scheme. “If you live in England, Wales or Northern Ireland and you qualify for the Healthy Start scheme, you can get free folic acid and vitamins C and D from 10 weeks of pregnancy onwards,” Marsh says.“However, it’s important to take folic acid and vitamin D even before conception and early in pregnancy, so if you can’t afford to buy them at that stage, ask your GP for help.”Marsh says that in Scotland, women are entitled to folic acid and vitamins C and D throughout their pregnancy.If you do have to pay for vitamins, you don’t need to buy expensive branded products, she adds. “Supermarket or pharmacy own-brand vitamin D and folic acid are fine.”You will need to show your NHS Healthy Start card when you collect your free vitamins.Your midwife or GP can provide information about local and national schemes and help you determine your eligibility. Healthy Start vitamins are available to breastfeeding mothers as well.Save on maternity clothesAs your baby bump grows, you are likely to increasingly struggle to fit into all of your old clothes. If you are not keen on the idea of forking out on a brand-new maternity wardrobe, a “closet audit” to identify your loosest and most flowing pieces is a good start.View image in fullscreenLooking to keep costs down? Pregnancy doesn’t have to mean an entirely new wardrobe.Photograph: SrdjanPav/Getty ImagesAnother great investment is a waistband extender. They usually cost less than £10 and mean you can carry on wearing your normal clothes for a bit longer.If you are keen to keep your normal wardrobe for as long as possible, you could buy some long vest tops, which you can tuck into trousers to stop your belly poking out.When you do need some new clothes, asking around or buying secondhand will help save money.“Online sites such as Vinted and Facebook Marketplace can be really useful if you’re looking for maternity clothes. You can find good-value bundles from people who know they won’t be needing them again,” Marsh says.Calculate your leaveAs a mum-to-be, you are entitled to a year of statutory maternity leave from your employer, no matter how long you have been in your job. However, the rules around statutory maternity pay have some stipulations.Your employer has to pay you for up to 39 weeks if you are working for it in the 15th week before your baby is due and have worked there for at least 26 weeks continuously before that, and you need to earn an average of at least £125 a week (before tax).Aaron says that the earliest your paid maternity leave can start is the 11th week before your baby is due. “If your baby is born early, your leave starts the day after the birth,” Aaron says.The five kinds of rest – and why they matter for new mothersRead moreIn terms of statutory maternity pay, you get 90% of your average weekly earnings before tax for the first six weeks. For the next 33 weeks, should you take them, you will be entitled to £187.18 a week or 90% of your average weekly earnings – whichever is lower.If you do not meet the requirements for maternity pay, you can apply for maternity allowance as soon as you have been pregnant for 26 weeks. If you are employed or have recently stopped working, you will get £187.18 a week or 90% of your average weekly earnings (whichever is less) for up to 39 weeks.If you are self-employed, you can get between £27 and £187.18 a week for up to 39 weeks.You can use thegovernment’s maternity entitlement calculatorto work it out.Get priorityTravelling on public transport while pregnant can be a challenge, and if your bump is small or you are earlier on in your pregnancy, people may feel awkward asking if you need a seat. If you are travelling in London and the south-east, the “baby on board” badge lets people know to offer you a seat or help. You canorder one onlineon the Transport for London website.Some shops will also let you go to the front of the line if you are pregnant and struggling. For instance, women on Reddit report that in some Primark stores, you can go to the accessible till if you are pregnant or have a double buggy.While stores may not have an official policy, it is a good idea to ask staff if you are finding it hard to stand in line.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsMoney hacksConsumer rightsPregnancyParents and parentingHealth & wellbeingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While going viral seems risky, some find it opens new doors ...Sammy GecsoylerWed 3 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 17.37 EDTShareIn 2011, Joey La Neve DeFrancesco had been working in room service at a luxury hotel in Providence, Rhode Island, for nearly four years, whisking delicacies on demand to guests’ rooms, when he reached breaking point. He was paid a measly $5.50 (£4) an hour, made to work punishingly long shifts and, to top it off, had managers taking a cut of his hard-earned tips.The poor treatment ratcheted up after DeFrancesco and colleagues tried to unionise workers at the hotel. In response, managers would berate those involved for making tiny mistakes. Things got so petty that workers on shift who had to take calls from guests were banned from sitting down.DeFrancesco decided to call it quits. On the day he finally bid farewell, he snuck into the hotel’s employee quarters with a seven-strong marching band and surprised his boss with a musical ambush. “I’m here to tell you that I’m quitting,” he said, before walking out to the triumphant soundtrack of his band in full swing and chanting “Joey quits”.DeFrancesco, who was 22 years old at the time, hastily organised a friend to film the encounter. After sitting on the video for a few days, he uploaded it to YouTube where it quickly went viral. Thirteen years on, thevideohas amassed nearly 10m views.View image in fullscreenBrassed off … Joey La Neve DeFrancesco quits his low-paid hotel job in 2011.Photograph: Youtube“We really didn’t think it was going to get much attention,” says DeFrancesco. The 36-year-old labour organiser and musician, who lives in New York, says he felt “liberated” after he quit and turned the tables on his managers. “Now I’m going to embarrass you for treating everyone terribly here,” he says.Did leaving in a viral blaze of glory hamper his ability to get another job? Not in the slightest. Soon after leaving, DeFrancesco began working in a museum. He says the incident has “honestly never come up” in job interviews since. In fact, he says it might be something to “put on the résumé”.While DeFrancesco’s tale holds a strong position in the job resignation hall of fame, it faces increasing competition from a new generation of workers leaving their jobs with viral aplomb. The phenomenon of revenge quitting, where frustrated or unhappy employees show how they really feel about their workplaces, is on the rise. Even clergymen are not immune to such temptations: in July, Father Pat Brennanprovideda “parting gift” to his congregation in the form of a poem that doubled up as a resignation letter, where he took aim at “disgruntled, unlikable” parishioners who spread “gossip” from their “holy lips”.View image in fullscreenParting gift … Father Pat Brennan’s resignation letter.Photograph: FacebookTheemployer-rating site Glassdoorwarnedlate last year that “a wave of revenge quitting [is] on the horizon” in 2025 amid falling employee satisfaction. In the UK, a survey of 2,008 workers released in July by the recruitment company Reed found that 15% of British employees had revenge quit their jobs. The firm’s chair, James Reed reckons thatsocial media was accelerating the trendafter a flurry of revenge quitters shared their stories online. Brianna Slaughter was one of them, with their video ending with the rallying cry: “These corporations will fire you in one day and leave you with nothing. If you want to leave, leave babe.”The 26-year-old American, who lives in Kyoto, Japan, was two hours away from teaching their next English class when they quit on the spot. For a while, things had been manageable, but everything changed with the arrival of a meddling new manager. “If I finished a lesson one minute early or one minute late, she would reprimand me,” Slaughter says.When Slaughter started the job, they had plenty of free time and their colleagues were mostly “chill”, but the cracks soon began to appear. They were paid 2,000 yen (£10) per class, instead of an hourly wage, which meant having to stick around unpaid for hours between classes for a paltry paycheck. Schedules weren’t handed out until the day before, making planning almost impossible. And the job was sedentary, which took a toll. “I went to the doctor and they said, because you’re sitting all the time, you have inflammation in your neck,” Slaughter says.Slaughter’s breaking point came with the arrival of the new manager. She told Slaughter to wear long-sleeved tops to hide their apparently “offensive tattoos” and often sat in on classes, which, they say, made everyone feel “awkward”. It got to a point where Slaughter was crying every night. Last May, after receiving a measly paycheck of 100,000 yen (£500) for a month of “hardcore classroom teaching”, enough was enough.View image in fullscreen‘If you want to leave, leave babe’ … Brianna Slaughter on TikTok.Photograph: TikTokSlaughter sent a resignation letter to a higher-up, who “begged” them to stay, before swiftly reminding them of the two-month notice period. In their TikTokvideo, which has 1.2m views, Slaughter says they told their manager: “Two months? You’re lucky if I give you fucking two weeks. I gave you two hours, babe. I’m leaving now.”Far from stalling their career, their tale going viral opened up new possibilities. “I made $7,000 onTikTokthe month I quit,” says Slaughter, who has since made a living as a content creator, advising people interested in moving to Japan. Some even got in touch and said the video inspired them to say goodbye to their own toxic workplaces. “They said: I think I’m going to quit my job too. This was my sign.” For those still on the fence, Slaughter says: “You should have left yesterday.”Young people are more likely to revenge quit. Reedsaid26% of 18- to 34-year-olds and 22% of 35- to 44-year-olds in the UK admitted to doing it, compared with just 8% of people aged 45 to 54. In June, a survey by business research group the Conference Room found a 15% gap in job satisfaction between the youngest and oldest workers in the US, with 57% of under-25s saying they were satisfied with their jobs, compared with 72% of over-55s.Four years ago, 25-year-old Carly, who lives in Alabama, US, was unemployed, “kind of broke and willing to take anything”. After contacting a temp agency, she was quickly offered a job as a receptionist, based on her CV alone, and she was asked to start the next day. “That was the first sign that this might not be the best place to work but I was desperate, so I took it,” she says.The first three months were “fine” and she got a promotion to HR payroll manager, but things soon went south. A new colleague, who was related to the bosses, started badmouthing her and spread a false rumour that she was an alcoholic because she used a lamp in her office instead of the overhead light. “I just like ambience,” says Carly.She was soon given an additional role on top of her current one: accounts payable manager. “It was just too much for one 21-year-old to manage by herself,” she says. The firm briefly hired a man (who was paid $10 an hour more than her) to take over her role as HR payroll manager but he was swiftly fired after messing up the company’s paychecks. She was forced back into doing both roles again.“I was constantly stressed, upset, and crying,” she says. Things came to a head when Carly’s problem colleague called for her to attend a manager-wide meeting so he could “air out his frustrations” with her. “It was a ridiculous request,” she says. “He basically wanted to bully me in front of everyone.” She agreed to the meeting but, little did they know, she had other plans.On the morning of the meeting, Carly woke up early, drove to the office and scheduled an email to all the managers “letting them know how fucked up their business was,” she says. It began fairly graciously. “I have decided that it is time to move on to a different venture,” it said, but soon ramped up. She took aim at her short-lived replacement, calling him “literally dumb as a rock” and said her heavy workload led to “daily stress that often built up into anxiety attacks and tearful nights”. Signing off, it said: “My laptop and keys are on my desk.”After the email was sent, her boss tried to call her. She didn’t pick up the phone. “I never heard from them again,” she says. After Carly left the office for the final time, she felt euphoric. “I could have stripped my clothes off and run naked all the way home. The anxiety and stress I had been feeling all vanished,” she says.She secured another job shortly afterwards, but she has some concerns about applying for future work. “If they ask, I’ll just be honest and say, if you treat me good, I will not do that to you,” she says.While most people revenge quit to stick the middle finger to their bad bosses, warning off prospective new employees can also be a motivation. Katie Ostler had been working in a supermarket in Melbourne, Australia for two years when the time came to call it quits. She had started doing the job at 16 years old. “It was a really toxic, high-paced work environment and there was a lot of turnover,” she says.Ostler, who is now 29, and lives in Manchester, UK, said her bosses had not bothered to learn her name for the first six months. “It wasn’t a great place to be but I just kind of kept my head down and did what I needed to do,” she says.As she approached 18, a whole new set of job opportunities were opening up, specifically bar work. She was already handing her CV out to local pubs when an incident at the supermarket tipped her over the edge. One day, a customer began shouting at one of Ostler’s 15-year-old colleagues over a refund. Instead of backing up the young female employee, their manager took the side of the customer and joined in on the yelling. “I thought it was a good time to go,” she says.Soon after, she was offered a job behind a bar and went to the supermarket to hand in her resignation with the one-week obligatory notice. She tried to give the letter to a supervisor, who said it needed to be handed directly to her manager. Ostler asked where he was, but was told that he was in the middle of an interview. They let slip where it was being held. She barged into the interview, handed her manager the letter and said aloud: “Don’t work here – here’s my resignation.” The room went silent and the interviewee gave her a confused expression. “It took a lot of bravery. I walked out before [my manager] could say anything,” she says.It wasn’t the last she heard from him. She was on her way to start her new job when he called her and told her not to finish her final week because he “didn’t want my toxic energy” around the team. “I remember thinking, have you looked in the mirror?” she says. She did have to nip back to the supermarket for some groceries a few times afterwards. “I avoided it when I could, but people would recognise me and say hello. Unfortunately, no one was cheering when I came in,” she says. Still, resigning had felt triumphant enough. “I felt like a boss. It was a very empowering moment.”Explore more on these topicsWork & careersTikTokUS work & careersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As an older college student, responses from teachers and younger classmates surprised meSara PepitoneWed 3 Sep 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 16.03 EDTShareA year ago, on my first day of graduate school, the lecture hall filled up around me – and I plotted revenge on the friend who’d persuaded me to enroll.To cure a thousand days of malaise, loneliness and brain fog, she’d suggested I apply to Columbia’s journalism school. So there I was, back in New York after two years in California, armed with 13 books about words and writing, every item of clothing I owned that looked like something my teenage nephews would wear, plus dried persimmons, avocados and walnuts from local farmers markets, the thing I’d miss about LA.I did not pack hair dye.But as I looked out over the shiny heads – brown, black, blond and red – I started wishing I had.Ihad dyed my hair for so long I had no idea what was underneath – I was functionally a brunette. But I stopped coloring during the Covid lockdown. I despised the roots as they muscled their way through. After the ugly misery of growing it out, I expected never to think about it again.Gray is a lack of pigment we have been programmed to mistrust, to interpret as slovenly and unfashionable. Major beauty brands bolstered this idea with effective advertisingas far back as the 1930s, then aresurgence in the 1950s, selling an at-home way to hide your real looks and discreetly preserve the status derived from youthfulness.Three-quarters of a century later, it’s typical for women to use hair dye to disguise age andavoid being stigmatized as “old”.Ask Ugly: all of the ‘iffy’ comments about my gray hair bother me. Should I start dyeing it again?Read moreAgeism in the workforce has proliferated since mass media, literacy and technology devalued the accumulated wisdom and skills of elders. Such discrimination against older people is well-documented in recruiting, according tostudiesand stereotypes about older workers limit their professional opportunities.The effects of this prejudiceagainst the “feared future self”are insidious. Looking back, I inherently knew this when I went on job interviews – or dates – and did not want to admit my age to anyone.I look a lot younger than I am – and that helps. Society confers advantages on those who successfully pass for younger, according toa studyby researchers in the UK and US. Many people “have no idea how much variation there is and probably no idea that many women are walking around without their natural hair color”, said Jessica Salvatore, professor of psychology at James Madison University, one of the researchers.There are no specific studies on the topic, but according to dermatological, cancer and other health research, along with manufacturer surveys,up to 80%of women dye their hair, with most aiming to cover this “deficiency”. Salvatore looks into questions like why womendecide not to dyein the face of age discrimination. At school, I wondered the same. How different would my experience have been if it didn’t matter to be gray? And how could I ever have thought it wouldn’t?I’d brace myself as I approached the campus security line, nearing my school building, before going into every classroom and coffee shop. The Look came from everyone: student, staff, faculty. First, there’d be a beat, then people would stare, unsure they were seeing right.I spoke with a professor about my continuing surprise when I look in the mirror. He equated natural gray to letting my freak flag fly, meaning it likeJimi Hendrix: celebrate individuality and be your own true self. But my gray wasn’t meant to be a statement. It was inertia; resistance to hassle, cost, time.There are few studies about age and its implications for older degree seekers, especially at graduate school. But 20% of college graduates in the US obtain undergraduate degrees in their 30s or later, according toa 2023 studyby the National Bureau of Economic Research. And in 2021, 11% of full-time graduate students – and 29% of part-timers – were 40 or older,according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Hand raised.View image in fullscreenThe author at a photography workshop, August 2025.Photograph: Courtesy Zoe A MillánContinued education into one’s 50s is a robust, persistent and widespread phenomenon, said Pauline Corblet, assistant professor of economics, New York University in Abu Dhabi, and coauthor ofa 2023 studyabout students who wait to attend college and the consequences of delay: more diversity in class and lower wages than peers who graduated “on time”.Corblet joked I could be her subject. Actually, other researchers I spoke to made similar jokes; that’s how little data there is on going back to school later in life.On day two, I took the aisle in an empty row of four seats towards the back. Looking around, I thought: someone in this room will be my boss one day.One of my new classmates stood next to me, figuring out where to sit.Typically, someone in that situation makes eye contact and smiles, says “excuse me” as they pass.That did not happen.I started to get up, but stopped when I saw how much he was ignoring me. It’s a superpower I’ve acquired: invisibility. Once, I could get a beer from a bartender faster than a speeding bullet. Now my new classmate looked past me like I wasn’t there.After some agitated pacing, he stepped over me. His pants skimmed my skirt.Two seats away, he whined to some students a few rows ahead: “I have to be by myself.”I was surprised by how horrible this made me feel.Later, I tell this story, and friends are aghast. Women have an easier time grasping it than men. Older women feel simultaneously hyper-visible, because of manifestations of ageing like gray hair and wrinkles, and socially invisible, because they have been devalued and discredited, according toa 2021 study.I recall something I saw on an Oprahrerun. Tina Fey, the guest, was pregnant.“Let’s hear it for 40,” she laughed as the audience applauded.“Remember when that used to be old?” Winfrey asked (perhaps referencingNora Ephron). “I think what changed is hair color – single greatest invention of our time.”“Yes. I would be gray now,” Fey said.“I am,” Winfrey admitted.Over time, lecturers understood I belonged and called on me when I raised my hand. My classmates smiled at me in the stairwell. Sometimes they spotted me across a lawn and waved. Invigorating! Sometimes professors outed me, dragging me into outdated references: “I’m sure Sara knows what a cash register sounds like.” (I do.) “Sara is smiling, she knows the Brat Pack.” (Yup.)Sometimes classmates complimented my pants. Or they’d say the inky ballpoint pens I used reminded them of their moms and I’d laugh.At a workshop, way more advanced than advertised, classmates looked to each other, including me, for help.Intergenerational learning:proven benefitsfor both elders and youth,studiessay.I think about anarticle I readthat said feeling gray, being seen as gray, is the fault of the gray person and their self-perception.

It is functional; from an evolutionary standpoint it makes sense to be vigilant to negative or diminished attention from others.“Part of me feels crappy about internalizing,” I told her. “Like it’s a sign that I’m vain.”“No,” she said. “It’s part of the social narrative for women, that aesthetic choices are trivial. It’s a justifying story about gender differences. It excuses a lot of core treatment of women.”In spring I conducted a poll, asking classmates if they ever colored their hair (73% yes) and if they would color their hair if it was gray (51% yes, which makes me want to re-poll in 10 years when the majority are over age 39).They also said: “I didn’t see your gray hair – I saw your colorful glasses.”“Gray is sick.”“All the women in my family dye.”“I dye.”We go to baseball games, drink dirty chai lattes, vent about roommates and professors.Remember the classmate who stepped over me? “I hate to tell you this,” I admitted to friends. “Stepover Boy is smart.”“No!” they protested.“Yeah, and worse – he’s a good writer.”“F him.”We laughed and I felt safe.So safe, I guess, that I wrote about our encounter – or lack thereof – for an assignment.One evening we were in the same bar near campus. He’d read my story.“Is it me?” he asked.We both knew it was and wished it wasn’t.“I’m sorry,” he said. “I’m truly sorry.” It was a genuine apology, the kind you feel.He said his heart sank when he read it.“In another version of the story we were simply nervous,” I said, “trying to find our place that day, and it wasn’t about excluding me, or about me at all.”‘Old people are capable of more’: meet the female weightlifters in their 70s and 80sRead moreHe nodded but didn’t take the chance for an excuse.“In this other version,” I said, “the way it ends is we meet up and have coffee or get drunk and hug it out.”Without hesitation he opened his arms and leaned in and hugged me.We smiled and he apologized again. I said this would ruin the villainous character he’d played with my friends.He told me his mom is an anti-ageism activist and she would kill him if she knew.At a pizza event, a gorgeous classmate in a silky dress gives me some spot-on advice on finding a source for a story. She asks me to help her with a different request. There’s no pandering or differentiation, just talk between peers. I walk home glowing. My phone is full of messages from smart, talented, funny, caring people I can legitimately call friends.You’re fine, I say to myself.But 90% of my class graduated last May.

Sign up hereNesrine MalikWed 3 Sep 2025 07.15 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 07.32 EDTShareThere are times on The Long Wave desk when a conversation sparks a sort of group therapy session. A few weeks ago, Jason came back from areporting trip to Barbadosand made a comment about how some Bajans thought he was from the Caribbean, because his accent changed when he was there. This was fascinating to me. The ensuing discussion made me realise that all of us had shifted our accents at various times, which got me thinking about all theunconscious ways in which we “code switch”, alternating between different identities.Linguistic shapeshifting across the diasporaView image in fullscreenChanging dials and dialects … learning a foreign language via broadcast media can shape accents.Photograph: Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi/APIn thelaunch editionof The Long Wave, I wrote about how when I was growing up I consumed all my world news and cultural influences through the radio, and so my accent is a direct reflection of that. It is a little bit Voice of America, a little bit Christian Science Monitor and a whole lot of BBC. Add to that my British schooling in parts of Africa where there were still some stubborn colonial tendencies that focused on elocution and even inflection (never intone upwards when asking a question, we were taught, to maintain status in a conversation). The outcome has been a weirdly anachronistic British accent, one that was then undercut by consumption of American pop culture. The final result is a transatlantic mishmash.A lot of people I meet for the first time give up on trying to identify my accent and straight-up ask me where it’s from, a sort of frequency scrambling that underlines how important accents are in helping us place who we’re speaking to. What I never quite realised until our Long Wave chat is how much of that accent is not just an organic mixture of influences but a way of expression unconsciously adjusted in certain situations.You are what you speakView image in fullscreenFrom Patois to ‘posh’ … the boxer Chris Eubank perfected his cut-glass accent by watching English period dramas.Photograph: Robert Doyle/OSD/RexAn accent is an identifier, especially when you’re from an ethnic minority. And particularly in Britain, where accents fall along class lines, how one sounds can be a way to signal authority and credibility. There’s a phenomenon called “phone voice” in which we sound more “cut glass” and formal than we would in person, and that is because of its fundamentally remote nature. Phone voice accents become the load-bearing of our efforts to assert ourselves. It is, in effect, an attempt to ward off any bias or discrimination, to neutralise identity and its associated prejudices.Broadly, what became apparent during our conversation is that these are accents that choose us, rather than us choosing them. Different ways of speaking often present themselves involuntarily – clipped and sort of broadcast-y in work scenarios; softer and, in my case, more American among friends and loved ones yet downright Victorian when dealing with bureaucracies. I had come to think of my changing accent as related to the fact that English is not my first language, and so a clear and uniform accent had never fully bedded in – it was still malleable and easily influenced. But the truth is that it changes because there is a lurking sense of not quite belonging.Severing the mother tongueView image in fullscreen‘I’ve been working here for seven years and no one, absolutely no one, knows I’m Black. And I’d like to keep it that way’ … Little Miss Jocelyn.Photograph: BBCAll sorts of things bear down on our accents, regardless of race. In England, the southern accent isconsidered the neutral and aspirational default, and research shows that when people with regional accents move to the south of the country and do not sand away their original speaking identity, they are sometimessubject to accent discrimination, which affects their professional and academic experiences due to a hierarchy of accent prestige.But race and immigrant extraction bring their own legacies to Black people’s expression. The Long Wave production editor, Janise Elie, said: “Many Caribbean people, including some family members, were forbidden from speaking or learning their ‘mother’ tongue and dialect in case it diluted their English accent. As a result, an important link to our roots and identity has been lost.” She is now teaching herself that mother tongue, Dominican Kwéyòl.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was assumed that it was the key to unlocking aspirations in an English-dominated world, and I suppose perfecting it was a way to erase or dilute our identity, as if perfectly enunciated English would somehow disguise our Blackness. It’s a preposterous notion but draws on awareness of the risks of being too “other” and thus unfamiliar, and maybe even evoking suspicion. It reminds me of a sketch from the British TV showLittle Miss Jocelyn(so good, too short-lived), where a Black character working in an office of white people panics when a new Black colleague joins the team, and furiously warns him not to be overly familiar, because no one knows she’s Black.Shame and acceptanceView image in fullscreenShared experience … many of us are navigating systemic forces beyond our control.Photograph: MTreasure/Getty/iStockphotoWhat struck me about our accent conversation was that rush of familiarity; that sense of having something that had always been lurking in the back of your mind being given expression. There was something a bit giddy about the “Oh my God, same!” aspect of it. And I think that was because there was, perhaps, a little knot of shame or embarrassment about our changing accents; one that dissolved among the self-recognition, self-deprecation and universalism of our experiences.Our changing accents were simply a testament to how racialised minorities from all over the world instinctively pick up the same threads. We were all merely navigating gigantic social, class and racial forces that were beyond our control. And so, over the course of a spontaneous team conversation, something that was gnawingly cringe transformed into a warm, enveloping comfort.To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsSocietyThe Long WaveSocial trendsAfricaCaribbeanBlack British cultureLinguisticsnewslettersShareReuse this content"

France’s National Rally and Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) each have significant representation in their country’s legislatures, meanwhile the UK’s Reform party is topping the polls.But the rise of the far-right could speed up the population decline of Europe, projections show, creating economic shocks including slower growth and soaring costs from pensions and elderly care.Those wanting to shut Europe’s borders must contend with a stark demographic reality: the continent’s native population is expected to fall sharply over the next century in an era of low birth rates.Experts warn that European societies will age more quickly without immigration, bringing forward a host of economic challenges as workforces shrink and care burdens grow.“Most politicians on the centre-left and centre-right recognise that immigration is needed to ease demographic pressures,” said John Springford, an associate fellow at the Centre for European Reform thinktank. “They have sought to focus on tougher – and often inhumane – asylum rules in the hope that stricter border enforcement will provide political cover for higher regular immigration.“But radical right parties are increasingly challenging the mainstream consensus. Those countries that manage to hold the line against demands to cut working-age immigration will be in a stronger position economically in the long run.”The latest projections produced byEurostat, the EU’s official statistics agency, suggest that the bloc’s population will be 6% smaller by 2100 based on current trends – falling to 419 million, from 447 million today.But that decline pales in comparison with Eurostat’s scenario without immigration. The agency projects a population decline of more than a third, to 295 million by 2100, when it excludes immigration from its modelling.Eurostat’s baseline projections assume countries will maintain their average net migration levels from the past 20 years, but the Guardian has examined figures also published by the agency with this assumption left out.Likewise, the UK’s Office for National Statistics publishes population projections that include a zero net migration scenario.Italy, France and Germany, where anti-immigration politicians have recently made inroads, would face big population declines in a zero-immigration scenario.Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has made cracking down on migration a priority in her first term, but her country has one of the lowest fertility rates in Europe and its population would more than halve by the end of the century under zero immigration.In Germany, where the anti-immigration AfD came second in this year’s federal election, the population could shrink from 83 million to 53 million over the next 80 years if its borders were completely closed.And in France, where the National Rally won the first round of legislative elections last summer after campaigning for restrictions on incoming people, a zero-immigration scenario would mean a population fall from 68 million to 59 million.Only a handful of EU states would notice little difference from closed borders: Romania, Latvia and Lithuania, all countries that have experienced a net outflow of people.Instead, in most of Europe, populations would not only shrink in the absence of current immigration levels, but also become older as the number of working-age people fall relative to elderly people.View image in fullscreenGiorgia Meloni, Italy’s prime minister, has cracked down on immigration – despite the country having one of the lowest fertility rates in Europe.Photograph: Antonio Masiello/Getty ImagesToday, 21% of the EU population is aged 65 or over. In Eurostat’s baseline scenario, this proportion will rise to 32% by 2100, but in the agency’s zero-immigration scenario, it will increase further, to 36%.Those studying Europe’s changing age pyramid say this will put countries under increasing economic pressure.“The main consequences will be slower growth because the labour force will shrink, and higher tax burdens, because pension spending and the demand for health and elderly care will rise,” said Springford.Indeed, much of the EU is already seeing this, with tax burdens – as expressed through tax revenue as a percentage of GDP – climbing in counties such as France, Italy, Germany and Spain in recent decades.The health and social care industries will become increasingly important for managing an ageing Europe, and many health systems in the EU are already dependent on immigrant doctors or nurses.“More people are going to require care, though that does depend on how healthy people are in old age, and how much care they need,” said Alan Manning, a professor of economics at the London School of Economics.“You also have the other side of the equation that because of fewer children, because of low fertility rates, you need fewer people in education and childcare. So what we need to be doing, in some sense, is redistributing people who were caring for children to caring for old people.”At the same time, experts stress that immigration is not a silver bullet for Europe’s demographic challenges, instead suggesting it is one of many solutions, or at least a way to ease the transition to an older society.“Increasing immigration levels will not solve these demographic problems on their own – the levels required to do so would be very large, and there are only so many migrants who are willing to move,” said Springford.“But they would help, as would raising employment rates of working-age people, pushing back the age of retirement, reforming pensions and shifting the burden of taxation from labour income to wealth, especially property.”Manning added: “For immigration to help, it’s got to be that immigrants are actually in work, and many European countries have quite low employment rates among a lot of immigrants. So you can’t take that as a given. If you had an immigrant who came in and didn’t work and then needed support, for welfare, that wouldn’t make things better, that would make things worse. So it’s really important that they’re going to be in work, and that has been problematic in some cases.”Within national borders, rural areas will bear the brunt of the EU’s coming population decline. Over the next 80 years, more villages could suffer the same fate as Camini in southern Italy.The village is one of many in the Calabria region where the population declined sharply later in the 20th century as younger residents moved elsewhere for opportunities.Camini has recently become the site of a project that is resettling refugees, in an attempt to bring the community back from extinction. It was cited ina recent Council of Europe report written by the Labour MP Kate Osamorthat examined the potential of immigration to alleviate the challenges of an ageing population.“I was watching the place slowly dying. The houses were just falling down because no one was living in them,” said Rosario Zurzolo, who was born in Camini and is now the president of the cooperative running the resettlement project,Eurocoop Servizi.So far, 50 refugees have settled permanently in Camini under the scheme, bringing the village population to 350, while a further 118 refugees are being temporarily hosted. A symbolic achievement for the scheme was the recent re-opening of the local school.Zurzolo says Camini can act as a model to help revitalise other European regions experiencing population decline.Serena Franco, who is also part of the Camini project and presented evidence to the Council of Europe for its report, added: “They’re bringing knowledge, and now we are starting to grow with them and to make new things, new processes, new jobs as well that would be impossible without them.”"

It focuses on the first 100 days after Pepfar-funded programmes wereinstructed to stop workas part of a US government freeze on foreign aid.Health workers reported shortages of drugs to control the virus, resulting in increased serious infections in people living with HIV and children being born with the virus because mothers could not get medication to prevent it being passed on. Clinics have closed, and people are skipping vital doses to eke out their supply of medication, raising the risk of drug-resistance.Some programmes have been able to resume activities in the months since the interviews, saidEmily Bass, one of the report’s authors, offering “temporary mitigation” of the harms, but there exists a “narrow window” for the US Congress to act to secure resources that will stabilise remaining services and prevent the loss of decades of progress.The Trump administration isreportedly refusing to releaseabout half of the $6bn (£4.5bn) funding allocated by Congress for Pepfar in the 2025 fiscal year.InTanzaniaand Uganda, HIV prevention and treatment programmes were reliant on Pepfar. The stop work order meant clinics were unable to dispense drugs bought with US money for several days, before a waiver came through allowing treatment to continue.Even then, disruption to supply chains meant doctors could not dispense as many drugs as usual, they said, perhaps giving patients supplies for a few weeks rather than months. Rumours spread that normal access was unlikely to return.A mental health project research coordinator told PHR: “Someone did an abortion because of that rumour [that antiretrovirals were no longer available]. She said, ‘Oh well, I don’t want to have a baby who is HIV positive. I will be blamed myself, so I don’t want.’”By late April, one clinic reported that 25% of the pregnant women living with HIV that it supported had given birth to a child with HIV. Its clinician said drugs had not been delivered and existing stocks would not stretch far enough.South Africa is at the heart of the HIV pandemic. What happens now the money has been cut?Read moreThe US government waiver allowed HIV prevention programmes to continue only for pregnant or breastfeeding women. It left key at-risk groups unprotected – in Tanzania andUganda, LGBTQ+ people, sex workers and people who use drugs face criminalisation and stigma.Specialist services making it easier for them to access care have been hardest hit, the report found, warning of worsening discrimination when those people sought help from mainstream government clinics.The report also found that people’s trust in domestic government, US foreign aid and antiretroviral medications had been damaged. Many said they feared a “dark” future, anticipating increased costs for care and opportunists pushing fake cures.The US government must “immediately restore, renew, preserve and protect global health funding for essential HIV services, including full funding commensurate with need for global HIV programs in the FY 2026 budget, and subsequently reauthorise the Pepfar program”, the authors concluded, so that there can be “a planned, feasible, and transparent transition to country leadership and ownership of programs”.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentAids and HIVUSAIDAfricaDonald TrumpGlobal healthTanzanianewsShareReuse this content"

Asked if the administration was seeking regime change in Venezuela, Hegseth said that was a decision for the president, but added: “We are prepared with every asset that the American military has.”Speaking to the Guardian, Juan González, the national security council’s senior director for the western hemisphere during the Biden administration, called Trump’s naval deployment “a lot of political theatre”. But he cautioned: “[There is a] very high risk of military confrontation.”“I increasingly fear that theTrump administrationmay stumble into an intervention scenario in Venezuela, which would be frankly disastrous,” said Biden’s former aide, who believed US Venezuela policy was now largely being dictated by hardline members of the Venezuelan opposition who had the ear of Trump’s secretary of state, Marco Rubio, a longtime Venezuela hawk.“I think they ultimately want to try to get the US in a situation where there’s a conflict withVenezuela. I think that’s the goal,” said González, who also served in the Obama administration.González said there would be huge risks in any US attempt to militarily remove Hugo Chávez’s authoritarian heir, who has governed since being elected in 2013 and was accused of stealing last year’s election. “After a quarter century of Chavismo, the idea that you replace the president and all of a sudden you have a Jeffersonian democracy is a little bit naive,” he said.Instead,González feared South America’s sixth largest country could become the stage for “a protracted internal conflict” involving a variety of armed groups including government-linked paramilitary forces, criminal organizations andColombian rebels of the National Liberation Army (ELN), whose reach stretches from Venezuela’s western border hundreds of miles into the interior.“It’ll become the cause celebre for every kind of criminal or illegal armed group in theAmericas… You’ll end up having people going to Venezuela to fight the Yankees and I think it’ll get messy,” González predicted.“I think the United States traditionally is able to fight head-on wars very effectively. But we’re not very good at guerrilla war – and that’s kind of what a lot of these groups have been doing for over half a century.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Thousands of US troops were required and hundreds of lives lost when George HW Bush ordered his 1989 operation to topple Manuel Noriega, the Central American country’s dictator.“Venezuela just is far bigger, far more complex and does have the seeds of an insurgency,” Isacson said. “The idea of guerrilla warfare and chipping away and carrying out terrorist attacks and just making the cost too high for the US occupiers is a very likely scenario,” he added.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaUS militaryTrump administrationDonald TrumpCaribbeanAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Last year, the country’s anti-corruption body,the Integrity Commission, issued a report raising concerns about Holness’s income and assets declarations and recommended further investigation by theFinancial Investigations Division, a specialized unit within the Ministry of Finance.The prime minister has denied any wrongdoing, gaining permission fromthe supreme court to challenge the report, which he branded unlawful and unfair.“It’s a distraction for the government because the government has built its election campaign on the idea that it has delivered for Jamaicans in an unprecedented way,” Gordon said.The World Bank has praised Jamaica for making“significant strides” in reducing public debt, from more than 140% of GDP in 2013 to 73.4% in the financial year 2023-2024, and its economy is expected to grow by 1.7% this year.There has also been a drastic reduction in crime under the JLP, with official figures showinga 40% drop in murdersin May, compared to the same period last year.But during a recent debate between Holness and the opposition leader, Mark Golding, the prime minister was forced to focus on defending himself against allegations rather than just defending his achievements in office.View image in fullscreenThe Jamaican People’s National party leader, Mark Golding, center, holds the lists of its voters in Kingston on 18 August 2025.Photograph: Rudolph Brown/EPAHe said: “I have been investigated, for a year, with an expert forensic auditor. The findings of that report have suggested no corruption. There have been no charges. Every aspect of my report, every aspect of my personal life and my personal financial details are in the public domain.”Golding told the Guardian that the investigation into the prime minister was a valid concern for voters.He said: “Other issues are often on the top of people’s minds, especially the cost of living and crime and violence and so on. But I think the consciousness of the nation has been sufficiently stirred around this issue that it is going to be an issue that will impact the outcome of the election.”He added: “We don’t see how a country like Jamaica can do with a prime minister who has that cloud hanging over him.”Golding, who previously held dual Jamaican and British citizenship, himself came under pressure during the campaign over concerns over his “Jamaican-ness”.“I am born in Jamaica. I grew up here, I’ve only ever worked here … And the fact that my father was British meant that I did inherit citizenship by descent. So I was a dual national, which is allowed by our constitution as long as the other nationality is a Commonwealth nationality, which obviously Britain is part of the commonwealth.”Golding said he decided to give up his British citizenship after polls indicated that voters didn’t think a leader should have dual citizenship. He has allowed a journalist to examine his citizenship renunciation documents and displayed his birth certificate to voters.For many voters, however, the main concern is the economic progress Jamaica has seen in recent years. “I’ve seen growth,” said business owner, Shana Kay Henry, 30. “JLP is for everybody, poor and rich.”One PNP supporter, an accountant who did not want to give her name, said that people in her constituency were not being listened to and their needs were not being addressed. She said: “We need somebody who will represent us. They need to hear our voices … do what needs to be done.”The outcome of the election will come down to how parties mobilise their bases, Gordon said. With the JLP’s strong performance in key areas during their tenure and with Golding offering a credible alternative, it is too close to call.“Both political parties appear very confident, but I am of the view the election will be won on the day,” he said.Explore more on these topicsJamaicaAmericasCaribbeannewsShareReuse this content"

Video images show Purba’s wife at his side before he was taken to hospital where he later died.The public prosecutor’s office and the police homicide squad were investigating the crime. Police said they were examining footage that shows the motorbike and suspects loitering around Purba’s residence, apparently waiting for the victim before the crime and during previous days.Archaeologists in Peru discover 3D mural that could date back 4,000 yearsRead moreThe murder has shocked and angered Peruvians. While the country has seen a rise in extortion and contract killings, foreigners are rarely targeted. More than 1,500 homicides have been recorded so far in 2025, according to Peru’s public deaths registry, Sinadef, an increase of more than 20% compared with the same period the year before.The interior minister, Carlos Malaver, described the incident as a contract killing.“Nothing was stolen from him, they were waiting for him and the bullets hit him in the head … We are not ruling anything out,” he said on Tuesday while addressing Peru’s congress on rising crime figures.“There are criminal acts that cannot always be prevented.”Peru’s foreign ministry expressed “heartfelt condolences and condemnation of this despicable act”. It added in its statement that the Peruvian foreign minister, Elmer Schialer, had on Monday night attended the hospital where Purba died and had offered to “double police protection” for the staff at the Indonesian embassy.Indonesia’s foreign minister, Sugiono, confirmed in Jakarta that Purba was a chancery officer at the embassy in Lima and had been working in Peru for five months. He described the victim as a “highly dedicated employee”. Purba leaves behind a wife and three young children.“I expressed my deepest condolences,” Sugiono said. He added that he was communicating with Schialer and had requested that “the investigation be conducted thoroughly, transparently and quickly, as well as ensuring the best possible protection for diplomatic personnel and Indonesian citizens in Peru”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It is believed to be the first time the three leaders have been in the same place together.In a bilateral meeting of more than two hours, Kim told Putin: “If there’s anything I can do for you and the people ofRussia, I will consider it as a fraternal duty, an obligation we need to bear, and will be prepared to do everything possible to help.”Afterwards, Kim said “see you soon” and hugged Putin goodbye. “We are waiting for you. Come visit us,” Putin replied.A visit to Russia would be just the third time Kim has travelled abroad in six years. The first was to the far east of Russia in 2023, and the second this week’s visit to Beijing, arriving on anarmoured train.North Korea has become a key Russian ally since the country invadedUkrainein 2022. Pyongyang sent weapons including artillery shells and missiles to Russia for the war and thousands of troops to fight in Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces had made a cross-border incursion, although the deployment was initially denied.Russia and North Korea last year signed an agreement that mutually obliges them to provide “military and other assistance” in the event the other is attacked.Chinese leader Xi Jinping, flanked by Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un leads a group of state leaders and officials on the red carpet in Beijing on WednesdayThe Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, flanked by Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un, leads a group of state leaders and officials on the red carpet in Beijing on Wednesday.On Wednesday, Putin thanked North Korea for sending troops to his aid, describing them as fighting “courageously” when helping Russia oust Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region.View image in fullscreenXi Jinping (centre) with Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un at China’s military parade.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesPutin’s visit to Beijing, which followed theShanghai Cooperation Summit in Tianjinon Sunday and a bilateral meeting with Xi, came as Russia launched a sweeping overnight attack on Ukraine.An estimated 500 drones and two dozen missiles were fired at western and central Ukraine, targeting civilian infrastructure, especially energy facilities. The attack also prompted Poland to scramble defence aircraft.Donald Trump met both his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts last month, but efforts by the US president to end the war have stalled.On Wednesday, Zelenskyy said Putin was “showing his impunity”, urging tougher sanctions on Moscow. “This undoubtedly requires a response from the world. It is only due to the lack of sufficient pressure, primarily on Russia’s war economy, that this aggression continues,” Zelenskyy said ahead of meetings with officials from Baltic and Nordic countries in Denmark.In Beijing, Putin said Russian forces were advancing on “all fronts” but said there was a chance for peace negotiations “if common sense prevails“. However, he said such a meeting should be held in Moscow, a venue swiftly dismissed by Ukraine’s foreign minister Andrii Sybiha as “unacceptable”.0:42‘He should come to Moscow,’ Putin says about peace talks with Zelenskyy – videoPutin is wanted by the international criminal court over alleged war crimes in Ukraine, and there are calls by some international law experts foran arrest warrant to be issued against Kimfor aiding Russia’s war.There has been no announcement of a formal trilateral meeting between Kim, Putin and Xi in Beijing.While Xi and Putin have declareda “limitless” partnership, analysts say Beijing is rankled by Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine and North Korea’s direct support of it. Xi is striving to balance his alliance with both nations, while at the same time avoiding further sanctions from the US and other allies of Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsVladimir PutinKim Jong-unRussiaNorth KoreaVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It was unclear if they were armed. These were the “main surprise” for western analysts, according to Hans Kristensen, of the Federation of American Scientists.The newly presented missile’s range was roughly estimated at 7,500 miles based on its predecessor, the DL-41 – enough to reach Washington from Beijing. It is one of eight or nine Chinese ballistic missiles with an intercontinental range, raising questions of overkill. “How many ways do they have to be able to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile to deter?” Kristensen said.Trundling along with it were new JL-3 ballistics for China’s six Jin-class submarines with a range of 6,200 miles or more. And, to complete the triad, China’s first-ever air-launched nuclear weapon, the JL-1, meaning Beijing joins a nuclear club composed of the US, Russia, India and probably Israel.View image in fullscreenChina’s JL-3 submarine-launched ICBMs alongside the land-based DF-61s.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenThe air-launched JL-1 long-range missile on parade in Beijing.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesChina’s nuclear arsenal is growing faster than any other country’s: it has an estimated 600 warheads, which is increasing at a rate of 100 a year, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.Its goal is to reach 1,500 by 2035, according to Washington, though even at that point Beijing’s arsenal would be smaller than that of the US or Russia, both of which have more than 5,000 warheads in their stocks. However, such is the destructive power of nuclear weapons that a handful of warheads could kill hundreds of thousands, or more.Other novel weapons shown off included two models of extra-large underwater drones, measuring 18 to 20 metres, including the AJX002, carried on specially elongated eight-wheeled trucks, part of a strategic weapons programme.Their size means they are vastly different to the small sea drones that Ukraine has used in swarms to knock out vessels in Russia’s Black Sea fleet, and their capabilities are less than clear. But the intention is to pose a threat, and to be seen to be posing a threat, to the traditional US dominance of the Pacific.Two types of laser air defence weapons were displayed, one for ships and one based on land, a cheaper means of fending off drones that western militaries are already hoping to use. Britain plans to fit four warships with a DragonFire laser from 2027, to better protect the vessels from drones used by the Houthi rebels in Yemen.View image in fullscreenShip-based laser weapons in the parade.Photograph: Maxim Shemetov/ReutersA handful of spindly four-legged land drones called robot wolves also attracted attention. However, if they could march, they were not allowed to, and instead were mounted on the back of other moving vehicles.At a glance they appeared no more sophisticated than the growing number of land drones appearing on the battlefields of Ukraine, as remotely controlled fighters or trucks to rescue the wounded, though China’s industrial capacity is such that a viable product could probably be made in vast numbers and possibly supplied to Russia.Explore more on these topicsChinaWeapons technologyAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

The years-long campaign has been aided by US president Donald Trump’s trade tariffs and volatile policymaking, which has strained its relations with allies and rivals alike.But it was the unprecedented image of the three autocratic strongmen chatting and shaking hands as they walked along the red carpet in Tiananmen Square on Wednesday,thatsent the strongest message of defiance to the west.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin arriving for the military parade.Photograph: Sergey Bobylev/AFP/Getty ImagesChina has touted the parade as ashow of unity with other countries, and Kim’s attendance is the first time he has been seen with Xi and Putin at the same event. It is only Kim’s second reported trip abroad in six years. The event drew an almost immediate reaction from Trump.“May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration,” Trump posted on his Truth Social account. “Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, andKim Jong-un, as you conspire against the United States of America.”Responding to Trump’s comments, the Kremlin said that “no one is plotting anything”.The EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, described the meeting of the three leaders as a “direct challenge to the international system built on rules … It’s not just symbolic. Russia’s war in Ukraine is being sustained by Chinese support.”0:42‘He should come to Moscow,’ Putin says about peace talks with Zelenskyy – videoThe analyst Wen-Ti Sung, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, said: “Beijing is sending a message … that even if western countries continue to sanction Russia over the Russia-Ukraine war, Beijing will not be afraid to stand by its friend.”Just hours after the parade, officials reported that Kim and Putin had held a formal meeting, in which Kim said he was willing to do “everything I can to assist” Russia, describing it as a “fraternal duty”, Russian state media reported.According to South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent about 15,000troops to Russiasince they signed an agreement last year. Putin reportedly thanked Kim for the bravery and heroism of North Korean soldiers who fought alongside Russian troops.Group shot of delegates walkingPutin’s appearance in Beijing came as Russia launched a sweeping overnight air attack on Ukraine, injuring at least four railway workers and prompting Poland to scramble defence aircraft.Among the other guests in China are the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, and the Myanmar junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing. No major western leaders are attending. Kim has been accompanied by his daughter Kim Ju-ae, images released by North Korean state news showed.The office of Indonesia’s president, Prabowo Subianto, said he had met Putin on the sidelines of the parade on Wednesday. Prabowo defied large protests at home to travel to Beijing for the military celebrations.Prabowo also met Xi on Wednesday. Chinese state media said Xi had expressed his support for Prabowo in restoring stability to Indonesia as soon as possible.View image in fullscreenArmoured vehicles and troops during the parade.Photograph: Lintao Zhang/Getty ImagesAnalysts made much of the military hardware on display; from tanks and drones to long-range and nuclear capable missiles, fighter jets and stealth aircraft, with several newly developed assets unveiled.The hardware is intended to “give the United States, Europe and China’s neighbours pause should they consider challenging China’s core national interests”, said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in SingaporeSome of the weaponry being shown to the public for the first time included hypersonic missiles designed to take out ships at sea, according to Chinese military officials. These weapons are of particular concern to the US navy, which patrols the western Pacific.Also on display were underwater drones, including the AJX002, and a new intercontinental ballistic missile, the DF-61, which China says could carry nuclear warheads to distant targets.Jennifer Parker, adjunct fellow in naval studies at UNSW Canberra, said the parade was more about China sending a specific message than signalling new capabilities. “You don’t do a parade like this to commemorate the end of world war two. You do a parade like this to show force, and you are choosing the capabilities that you put into that parade to send a specific message,” she said.Xi’s speech contained several references to the “rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” – a common phrase for Xi’s overarching plan for China’s future, which hinges on annexing Taiwan as Chinese territory.Xi and the Chinese Communist party claim Taiwan is a Chinese province, currently run by illegal separatists. Taiwan’s government and people are opposed to this.The People’s Liberation Army has been undergoing large-scale modernisation and advancement under Xi, but it has also been beset by corruption issues, and in the past few years therehave been purges of officials and personnelat levels not seen since the Mao Zedong era.Additional reporting by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu and Daisy DumasExplore more on these topicsChinaRussiaNorth KoreaKim Jong-unVladimir PutinXi JinpingAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

While they made their way towards a raised platform in Tiananmen Square, Putin’s interpreter could be heard saying in Chinese: “Biotechnology is continuously developing.”After a brief inaudible passage, the interpreter added: “Human organs can be continuously transplanted. The longer you live, the younger you become, and [you can] even achieve immortality.”Xi, who was off camera, could be heard responding in Chinese: “Some predict that in this century humans may live to 150 years old.”Putin confirmed later to reporters he had discussed prospects for significantly increasing human life expectancy with Xi.Both leaders have shown little intention of relinquishing power in their lifetimes. In 2018, Xiabolished presidential term limits, paving the way for him to rule indefinitely. Putin has also changed Russian law to allow him to remain in high office.Military reveals and bold messaging: five key takeaways from China’s big paradeRead moreSections of Russia’s elite, including Putin, have long been fascinated with longevity and the science of extending life.In 2024, Putin instructed lawmakers to establish a research centre called New Health Preservation Technologies, dedicated to combating ageing. The project focuses on developing “technologies that prevent cellular aging, neurotechnologies, and other innovations aimed at ensuring longevity”.According to an earlierinvestigationby the independent Russian outlet Meduza, Mikhail Kovalchuk, a longtime family confidant of Vladimir Putin, is leading Russia’s research into immortality, a subject that he and other influential figures close to the Kremlin are reportedly “obsessed” with. Meduza reported that Kovalchuk has invested in organ-printing technology that uses lab-grown cells to produce replacement organs.Putin’s eldest daughter, the endocrinologist Maria Vorontsova, has received multimillion-dollar Russian government grants to study cell renewal and ways to extend human health and longevity and is involved in a genetic research programme linked to Kovalchuk. When sanctions were passed on her by the US in 2022, the State Department said she was leading Kremlin-funded genetics programmes worth billions.Putin and Xi walked alongside the North Korean dictator,Kim Jong-un, during their conversation, who was smiling and looking in the direction of Putin and Xi. It was not clear if their chat was being translated for him.Later footage showed the three leaders walking up the steps towards the viewing platform for the parade.The moment was carried on the livestream provided by the state broadcaster CCTV to other media, including the international newswires AP and Reuters.China’s largest-ever military parade included 50,000 spectators and a big display of military hardware, from tanks and drones to nuclear-capable missiles, fighter jets and stealth aircraft.The performance was seen as a show of defiance to the west. Other attenders included the president ofBelarus, Aleksander Lukashenko, the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, and Myanmar’s junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing.In his formal address, Xi told the crowd that the Chinese people stood firmly “on the right side of history”. He saidChinawas a great nation that was “never intimidated by any bullies” – in an apparent veiled reference to the US and its allies – and added that China was “unstoppable”.Explore more on these topicsChinaXi JinpingVladimir PutinAsia PacificRussiaNorth KoreaKim Jong-unnewsShareReuse this content"

Russia is refusing to take steps to end its war with Ukraine that has been raging – with mounting losses on both sides – for more than three years.Annotated pic from the Beijing parade.While North Korea’s economy grew at its fastest pace in eight years in 2024, according to South Korea’s central bank, the uptick was not down to a shift in Kim’s approach but a knock-on effect of his decision tosell huge quantities of missiles and ammunition to Russia. While Kim sizes up the prospects for more engagement with theSouth’s new liberal president, Lee Jae-myung, his country’s economic prospects are heavily dependent on the course of an unpredictable conflict taking place thousands of kilometres away.While Xi and Putin have declareda “limitless” partnership, analysts say Beijing is rankled by Russia’s ongoing war on Ukraine, and North Korea’s direct support of it. Xi is striving to balance his alliance with both nations, while at the same time avoiding further sanctions from the US and other allies of Ukraine.There is a chance, of course, that Wednesday’s optics will focus the minds of Trump and other western leaders. While he was not on the guest list, the US president indicated he was following events in the Chinese capital.In a barbed post on Truth Social, Trump reminded Xi of the US’s role in defeating Japan 80 years ago, adding: “May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards toVladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.”View image in fullscreenMilitary personnel take part in China’s military parade to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Japan’s second world war surrender.Photograph: Ng Han Guan/APSuch was the potent symbolism attached to the first-ever meeting between Xi, Putin and Kim that it threatened to overshadow the huge military parade snaking through the streets of the Chinese capital.The images coming out of Beijing prove that the “axis of upheaval”, with Xi forming its nucleus, has moved beyond hypothesis and into the messy realm of realpolitik.Just how a striking photo op will translate into action remains to be seen, but the leaders in capitals from Washington and London to Tokyo and Seoul must surely be looking on with a mixture of curiosity and alarm.Explore more on these topicsChinaRussiaNorth KoreaAsia PacificVladimir PutinKim Jong-unXi JinpinganalysisShareReuse this content"

It was the 16th or so stop (he can’t quite remember) of a remarkable airborne odyssey that he hopes will make him the youngest supported pilot to fly around the world.The adventurebegan at his home in Brisbane, Australia, four weeks ago and has taken the teenager across the Indian Ocean and through the Middle East to Europe, from where he will venture around the other half of the globe back home. Though he is accompanied by an instructor – global aviation rules not easily permitting children to fly around the world on their own – Byron does all the flying of their tiny single-engined Sling TSi aircraft.They spend the flights – the longest of which so far was a 10-hour stretch from Singapore to Sri Lanka – chatting, calling family or occasionally listening to music, if he can get it to work, the teenager told the Guardian.What’s on the playlist? “Normally a good bit of Top Gun towards the start of the cruise, and then go into something else. I like to have it quiet for takeoff and landing, just so you can hear air traffic control and stuff.”It may not be how a typical teenager will spend September, but little about Byron’s life so far has been typical. Very unwell almost from birth, he spent his childhood in and out of hospital – “sometimes it was weekly, sometimes it was daily, sometimes it was monthly” – before finally being diagnosed with the bowel conditionCrohn’s diseaseaged 14. “It took a big toll on my life,” he said. “I missed birthday parties, missed school, missed, like, just normal school sports and all that sort of stuff.”Despite this, or perhaps because of it, he caught the flying bug young, thanks to a Scouts activity day that involved a trip in a small plane when he was just four. “That was the start of it, and from there it was like a fire lighting. It just kept sparking.”View image in fullscreenByron is making the journey in a single-engined Sling TSi aircraft.His had his first flying lesson at 13 and obsessively loved it. “It was like a new beginning, really. It gave me motivation to keep going and get out of the hospital.” The following year, finally in remission, “I thought: how do I raise awareness for Crohn’s and the Queensland children’s hospital, which I’d spent most of my life in? And I thought I’d fly around Australia.” That mission having beencompleted last year, the world was next.What do his parents make of it? “Yeah, I had to persuade them a little bit. At first they were a bit worried, but they’ve seen how safe it actually is and how we’ve put in the correct strategies to make sure the trips are as safe as possible. They were a little bit worried, but now they’re fine with it.” They are all in constant contact, often during flights, he said, with his mother, Jeni Langdon, acting as his manager, fixer and publicist back home inBrisbane.Apart from the personal challenge, he hopes his story will inspire other young people. “People just don’t have the right motivation. They’re all on their devices. They just don’t have the motivation to overcome barriers. And I thought: why not try make a global mission of showing people that they can achieve their dreams, they can overcome their obstacles?”After a brief touchdown at theInternational Ayr Showin Glasgow this weekend, Byron’s next stop will be Iceland, then Greenland, then onwards. He hopes to land back home on 13 October, his birthday, where he is looking forward to seeing his family and his dog – and to turning 16, when he can finally apply for arecreational pilot’s licence, allowing him to fly a single-engine plane without supervision.“I might have a week off flying, and then I’ll get into it again,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAir transportBrisbaneQueenslandnewsShareReuse this content"

A lot of people were warned about that,” Husic told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing program.“I’m not in the business of doing the [there are] ‘good people on both sides’ argument. I think a lot of people in the Australian public would have been extremely unsettled by what they had seen, the way in which people had been targeted, the way in which specifically Indian Australians have been targeted. I don’t think there’s any place for that.”The former industry minister, who made history as the first Muslim to be elected to Australian federal parliament in 2010 and later federal cabinet in 2022, concluded his response to the question by saying: “I haven’t seen a good fascist yet.”The comments are the first public display of the unease felt by some Labor MPs about Albanese’s characterisation of crowds at the March for Australia rallies.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailGuardian Australiathis week revealed the Labor MP for the Melbourne-based seat of Aston, Mary Doyle, sought to clarify Albanese’s language during a closed-door caucus meeting on Tuesday morning.Speaking up in the meeting, Doyle used words to the effect of “bad things did happen at the rally, where do we draw the line?”, according to one Labor MP’s recollection of the question.One Labor source said several other MPs also felt uneasy about Albanese’s language but chose not to speak up.In his remarks to the meeting, Albanese reiterated to Labor MPs that not all of the protesters were associated with neo-Nazis as he warned against tarring all those who attended with the same brush.In an interview with the ABC on Monday, Albanese criticised the rallies for giving a platform to neo-Nazis who sought to exploit grievances about immigration to sow public division.The prime minister also said there was “no doubt” that “good people” would have been among the crowds at the nationwide events, which called for an end to “mass migration”.“There’s always good people will turn up to demonstrate their views about particular issues. But what we have here is neo-Nazis being given a platform,” Albanese said.At Tuesday’s caucus meeting, Albanese said he was shocked to see far-right activists “openly in uniform” and said it needed to be called out.He also addressed the apparent recruiting that neo-Nazi groups were conducting.“We have to make sure we give people space to move away and to not push them further down that rabbit hole,” Albanese told the meeting.Husic has broken ranks several times since being his dumped to the backbench in a post-election reshuffle, including to criticise the government’s initial response toIsrael’s blockade of aid into Gaza.Separately on Wednesday, LiberalJacinta Nampijinpa Pricesought to walk back inflammatory claims she made on ABC TV that federal Labor was promoting migration by specific ethnic groups, including Indians, to grow its electoral support.Singling out Indians coming to Australia, the outspoken Northern Territory senator said sections of the community were concerned at “the core number, or the type of migrants that are coming in”.“I think Labor like to be able to ensure that they’re going to allow those in that would ultimately support their policies, their views, and vote for them as well,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Suggestions otherwise are a mistake,” she said.“My remarks were made in a wide-ranging interview on ABC where I sought to highlight issues of uncontrolled mass migration and ruptures to social cohesion.”Later on Wednesday night, Nationals shadow ministers Bridget McKenzie and Ross Cadell, and the Liberal backbencher Sarah Henderson, crossed the floor on a Senate vote about immigration levels.Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party attempted to establish a parliamentary inquiry into “the impact of high immigration on the Australian economy.”The Coalition opposed the motion but McKenzie and Cadell, both members of the opposition frontbench, and Henderson, voted with conservative Coalition senators Alex Antic and Matt Canavan in favour of the inquiry.Liberal frontbencher Anne Ruston was heard appealing across the chamber to McKenzie to vote with the rest of the Coalition against the motion.The motion was ultimately defeated 37 votes to 9.Explore more on these topicsAustralian immigration and asylumAustralian politicsLabor partyJacinta Nampijinpa PricenewsShareReuse this content"

In one alleged incident, two NSN members held down a Camp Sovereignty occupant while another two members hit the victim.Sewell allegedly punched and kicked a Camp Sovereignty occupant, Pascoe said.Pascoe said Sewell was the leader of the NSN and had “complete control”.“The applicant has at his disposal a large group of followers who will attack, on his instruction, without hesitation,” he said.Sewell’s defence lawyer, Matthew Hopkins, said the prosecution’s case that granting his client bail posed an unacceptable risk “didn’t come anywhere close to the threshold” and was “loaded with subjective, almost political commentary”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Both were bailed to appeal at the Melbourne magistrates court on 10 December.Magistrate Donna Bakos will hand down her bail decision for Sewell on Friday morning.Explore more on these topicsVictoriaFar rightAustralian immigration and asylumProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

We must confront this crisis with urgency, compassion and an unwavering commitment to accountability.”After urging the UK government to support the genocide case against Israel at the international court of justice, Swinney said his devolved government in Edinburgh had decided to change its rules on financial support for defence companies.Scottish first minister calls Israel’s actions in Gaza ‘genocide’ for first timeRead moreIt would now pause any new grants or financing for products going to countries justifiably accused of genocide, he said. Swinney had told his officials, the business agency Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish National Investment Bank not to offer any new financial support to non-compliant firms, starting with those that supply Israel.Researchby the Ferret websitehas found that since January 2022, Scottish Enterprise has given at least £2.75m to the defence firms Raytheon, Thales and Leonardo, all of which have products used by the IDF, including drones, the F-35 fighter and guided missiles.Scottish Enterprise had also been told not to facilitate any new non-military export deals with Israel by companies based inScotland, Swinney said, before urging the UK government to abandon its trade pact with Israel.However, UK government sources accused Swinney of being “all over the place” after he also announced Scotland would drop an effective ban on financing defence contractors who suppliedUkrainewith munitions.A source said defence firms could have contracts to supply Ukraine and make equipment which was used by the IDF, includingBAE Systems, which employs thousands of people on British military equipment. “Trying to do two different things at once is foolish,” they said.On Sunday, the UK government announced BAE’s shipyards on the River Clyde would play a key role ina record £10bn deal with Norwayto build at least five new Type 26 frigates, securing 2,000 jobs in Scotland.In June, Kate Forbes, the deputy first minister, announced Scottish Enterprise would give BAE Systems £9.22m for a new skills and training academy being set up as part ofa new shipbuilding facility on the Clyde, which would help create 300 new jobs.BAE Systems has been criticised by pro-Palestinian activists because it supplies parts for the F-35 fighter programme from its plants in other parts of the UK.Swinney appeared to accept there were tensions within this new policy by also pledging none of the Scottish government-funded apprenticeship programmes at defence firms would be affected.His announcement was intended to placate critics on the left including the Scottish Green party, which has urged Scottish ministers to boycott firms supplying the IDF.Jamie Livingston, the head of the anti-poverty charity Oxfam, said the UK government should follow Swinney’s lead.“Gaza is being turned into a graveyard before our eyes: history will ask if leaders did everything they could to stop it. The first minister has committed to act; Westminster must do the same,” Livingston said.A UK government spokesperson said: “We have suspended licences for exports of military equipment to the IDF that might be used in operations in Gaza, subject to the special measures in place for exports to the global F-35 programme, based on our assessment that these could be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian law.“We will work with our allies and those in the region on a meaningful process towards a two-state solution and continue to do what we can to support the foundations of Palestinian statehood.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandJohn SwinneyArms tradeMilitaryDefence policyBAE SystemsIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

He later went further by saying the US “never even thought in terms of removing soldiers from Poland”, even as he confirmed there were discussions “about it with regard to other countries.”“We are with Poland all the way and we will help Poland protect itself,” he said, praising Warsaw’s defence spending, the highest withinNato.Trump was also asked about the lack of progress in Russia-Ukraine talks on ending the war, saying Vladimir Putin would have to make a decision on next steps and “if we are unhappy about it, you will see things happen”.Just hours before Trump and Nawrocki were to meet, Poland was forced to scramble its own and allied aircraftto monitor its airspaceduring another night attack on Ukraine, with more than 500 strikes across the country.Before travelling to Washington – his first overseas trip sincetaking office last monthNawrocki hosted a summit in Warsaw last week involving the leaders of Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine. He also spoke with other EU leaders by phone to prepare for the meeting, as he wants Poland to play a broader role in representing the region’s interests.But the visit has exacerbated tensions withDonald Tusk, Poland’s centrist prime minister, who was formerly president of the European Council.Nawrocki, a fierce critic of Tusk who has pledged to continue supporting Kyivbut opposes Ukraine’s membership in Natoand pushed fortightening the benefits paid out to Ukrainian refugeesin Poland, signalled his intention to pursue a foreign policyindependently of the government.View image in fullscreenKarol Nawrocki, before being elected president of Poland, with Donald Trump at the White House.Photograph: The Whitehouse/XShortly before the Alaska summit between Trump and Putin, he joined a leaders’ phone call with the US president sidelining Tusk, who had previously represented Poland in similar discussions. Presidential aides said Nawrocki had got involved at Trump’s personal invitation.The move locked Tusk out of a prestigious call, reducing his role to participating in preparatory and debriefing calls with other European leaders instead.Poland subsequently skipped the high-level Zelenskyy-Trump meeting altogether, sending no representative to join the Ukrainian president and a group of European leaders at the White House, with both camps trading blame for the absence.The turf war between the Polish president and prime minister was brought back to the spotlight before the White House visit, after ministers repeatedly asked Nawrocki to toe the government’s line in his talks with Trump.The president’s aides responded by insisting the visit could instead be an opportunity for “a new opening” in relations, which they argued had been damaged by Tusk and his ministers’ past critical comments on Trump.As the row deepened, a one-page memo outlining the government’s advice for the president was leaked to the media. Presidential aides publicly ridiculed the document, describing it as “resembling a college essay”, and rejected the ministerial insistence on following their instructions as “impertinent”.Nawrocki also did not invite any government officials to join his delegation, breaking with a tradition that a junior minister would sit in the president’s meetings overseas. His chief foreign policy adviser, Marcin Przydacz, said Nawrocki would instead send a memo to inform the government of any developments.Despite Nawrocki’s meeting with Trump on Wednesday, Tusk said he would be representing Poland during a hybrid meeting of the “coalition of the willing” on Thursday.The internal divisions could weaken the country’s influential role in shaping Europe’s response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, after it welcomed more than a million Ukrainian refugees and turned into a major logistics hub for military and humanitarian aid deliveries for the war-torn neighbour.Explore more on these topicsPolandDonald TuskKarol NawrockiDonald TrumpEuropeNatoUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

As a frontier state, long viewed as a gateway toEurope, Greece has had a surge in migrant arrivals this year.“We are accountable to Greek citizens, and Greek citizens want to be protected,” the migration minister, Thanos Plevris, told MPs ahead of voting. “The message is clear [for migrants]: if your asylum request is rejected, you have two choices. Either you go to jail or return to your homeland. The Greek state does not accept you … You are not welcome.”An unabashed rightwinger whose stance has caused ripples among the more moderate members of Greece’s centre-right government, Plevris insisted asylum would continue to be granted to applicants who fulfilled the need for international protection.But under the new law, asylum seekers who have their claims rejected and do not leave the country within 14 days face prison terms of two to five years. Deterrence measures will also be toughened: people who arrive without the proper paperwork will be detained for 24 months, up from the current 18 months, while unregulated migrants who have been in Greece for seven years will no longer have the right to legalise their status. Those found guilty of illegal entry will be fined €10,000.The measures come barely two months after the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, announced a controversial 90-day pause on asylum applications amid a rise in arrivals on the islands of Crete and Gavdos from Libya. In the first week of July, more than 2,000 people successfully made the crossing – a significant increase in a country where migrant numbers have fallen dramatically since 2015, when more than 850,000 people arrived at the height of the refugee crisis.Mitsotakis insisted the suspension was aimed at sending smuggling rings a resounding message that “the passage to Greece is closed”, though it was condemned by human rights groups as a grave violation of international law.In power since 2019, the government describes its migration policies as “tough but fair”, denying allegations of illegal pushbacks to keep asylum seekers at bay.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With this openly racist law, he is clearly trying to enlarge his voter pool by appealing to the far right.”Explore more on these topicsGreeceMigrationEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The state department has not published details of its grant to the GHF, an omission that the senators said violates US law. Nearly 1,000 Palestinians have died near GHF sites since its operations began in May, the UN reported in mid-August.Leaked ‘Gaza Riviera’ plan dismissed as ‘insane’ attempt to cover ethnic cleansingRead moreThe new concerns come as the agency was mentioned in a draft plan for a “Gaza riviera” that critics have said would provide cover for the large-scale ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian territory’s population and was reportedly developed by those close to the GHF. The 38-page prospectus, which has not been formally adopted as US policy, nonetheless would be one way to fulfill Donald Trump’s calls for a “takeover” of theGazaStrip.The plan, which was first revealed by the Washington Post, also relied on consultants from the Boston Consulting Group (BCG has said that work was not approved and that it had fired two senior partners who led the financial modeling for the plan).In their letter, the Democratic senators also attacked the GHF for its connections to the Israeli government and the use of private military contractors that have reportedly conducted intelligence operations. “The provision of humanitarian aid to starving populations should not be a pretext for military intelligence operations,” they wrote.In the letter, the senators also demanded copies of award documents, internal reviews, export licenses for military services and other vetting that is legally required for GHF operations but have not yet been made public.The Guardian has approached the state department and the GHF for comment.Explore more on these topicsGazaTrump administrationElizabeth WarrenMarco RubioDemocratsUS foreign policyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was “one of the most serious attacks on Unifil personnel and assets” since theNovember ceasefirethat ended the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah war, the force said.Peacekeepers were working to clear roadblocks preventing access to a UN position south-east of the village of Marwahin when an Israeli drone dropped one grenade 20 metres away and three more 100 metres away from UN personnel and vehicles. After the attack, Israeli drones were seen returning towardsIsrael.The force stopped the work “out of concern for the safety of peacekeepers following the incident”, Unifil said. It added that any attack on peacekeepers or interference with its mission was a serious violation of international law and that it was the responsibility of the Israeli military to ensure the safety of UN forces in south Lebanon.The attack came days after the UN security council ordered thewithdrawal of the peacekeeping missionat the end of next year after nearly half a century, following intense US and Israeli pressure.The peacekeeping force was first established in 1978 to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon, but after the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war was tasked with monitoring violations of UN resolution 1701, which acted as a ceasefire. Unifil cannot use force except in cases of self-defence, but instead notifies the Lebanese army of ceasefire violations.Israeli forces attacked Unifil peacekeepers more than two dozen times during the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah war that ended in November, while Hezbollah also hit the peacekeeping mission on several occasions. Peacekeepers are considered civilians under international law and intentional targeting of them is illegal.Israel has long accused Unifil of being lax on Hezbollah, a claim the force rebuffs. The US in recent months has drawn closer to Israel’s position and backed the ending of the mission – a move it styled as boosting the sovereignty of the Lebanese army over its own country.The peacekeeping force has also come under pressure from Hezbollah, with patrols frequently blocked by local residents, due to a popular perception that Unifil is serving Israeli interests in the area.The government of Lebanon, for its part, relies on Unifil as a buffer with Israel and as support for its underequipped and understaffed army.What is Unifil and why has Israel been firing on its positions in Lebanon?Read moreThe government is drafting a plan to take concrete steps to disarm Hezbollah and other armed non-state groups in the country, with the Lebanese army tasked with carrying out the plan. The Hezbollah-Israel war severely weakened the group, and in combination with the ousting of its longtime ally, the former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, loosened the militia’s tight grip on the country.Unifil has helped the army in its disarmament of south Lebanon, which is part of the Novemberceasefire agreement. Israel was also meant to fully withdraw from south Lebanon under the terms of the ceasefire, but has said it will not do so until Hezbollah is fully disarmed.The Lebanese government has condemned Israel’s continued presence in Lebanon post-ceasefire, as well as its near daily airstrikes on the country, which it says are aimed at preventing Hezbollah from reconstituting itself.The continued airstrikes have bolstered Hezbollah in its narrative that the militia is needed to defend the country – a narrative the Lebanese government has rejected as it seeks to restore its monopoly on violence.Explore more on these topicsLebanonIsraelUnited NationsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

We think that there’s a public mood out there for a grown up conversation about what that means. And the crucial thing is that those with the broader shoulders are asked to pay a fairer share.”Polling for the TUC found that a 2% annual wealth tax paid by individuals with assets worth more than £10m would be supported by 68% of people, with 22% against. This rose to 75% among 2024Labourvoters now leaning towards Reform.The poll also found that increasing capital gains tax to the same level as income tax was supported by 51% of people, with 34% against. This rose to 57% among Labour backers now tempted to vote for Farage’s party.There was even greater support for a package of tax rises including wealth taxes, higher taxes on gambling firms and a windfall tax on the profits of banks and other financial institutions, with 68% supporting the proposals as a whole, while just 23% opposed to them.TheTUCcalculated that the wealth taxes could raise an extra £36bn a year, while a gambling tax could bring in £3bn more and a bank surcharge could raise between £20bn and £50bn over the next four years depending on the level it was set at, between 16% and 35%.“The government’s got to stay the course. A little bit of economic left-wing populism would go a long way, because clearly that’s where the public mood is. On tax, on workers rights, people want to see change,” Nowak said.“For far too many people, ‘change’ still feels like a slogan and not actually their lived reality. They’re still in the midst of a cost of living crisis. They still haven’t seen the improvements come through in public services.“Every decision the government takes to demonstrate it’s on the side of working people is the right thing to do … No one thought the economy was going to be fixed overnight. But the worst thing the chancellor could do, having made that big upfront investment in the budget last year, is to pull back from that.“I don’t think the balance is right at the moment. I think we’ve got a tax system that’s very good at taxing work, less effective at taxing wealth. That’s really the big inequality that we’ve seen opening up.“That doesn’t take away from the fact we know we need to get growth into the economy, growth that makes a difference in people’s pockets. But this budget, if the choice is between fair taxes and cuts to the public services, we know whose side the chancellor should be on.”Nowak, who haspreviously called Farage a “political fraud and hypocrite”who was “cosplaying” as a working-class champion in order to win votes, doubled down on his view that the Reform UK leader was a political opportunist.“Nigel Farage is, as always, talking up whose side he is on. [But] he’s a political snake oil salesman. The gap between the rhetoric and what he’s actually prepared to deliver is massive. We have got a job to do, to show the gap between the rhetoric and reality,” he said.“The way that we challenge Reform, and the way that a Labour government challenges it, is by demonstrating that they genuinely are on the side of working people.”However, in a warning to the left, he said: “Frankly, I don’t think the alternative is Jeremy Corbyn in No 10. It’s Nigel Farage or Kemi Badenoch in No 10. And that should fill anybody who cares about the rights of working people, about our public services with absolute dread.”Explore more on these topicsTax and spendingTUCRachel ReevesLabourBudgetNigel FarageReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not what Reform have suggested, which is cabins with a fence around them.”He also attacked Reform for indicating that their measures would focus on deporting undocumented males rather than women and children. Farage rolled back on his initial pledge to deport “absolutely anyone” 24 hours afterhe unveiled his immigration measureslast week.Jenrick appeared to suggest the Conservative party should outflank Farage on immigration as he criticised the policy. “The people-smuggling gangs would exploit women and girls, and it would encourage even more young men to pose as 15-, 16-, 17-year-olds,” he said.Asked about a “moment of radicalisation”, he reflected on his visit to a protest outside the Bell hotel in Epping.“I met a single mum who had three teenage daughters,” he said. “The oldest daughter, who was about to go to university, had bought some workmen’s boots and put them outside because she wanted the illegal migrants to think there was a man in the house.”Jenrick said another turning point had been a visit to Dover with the former MP Natalie Elphicke, where he described migrants walking straight into residents’ gardens and kitchens to steal food, a moment he said convinced him Westminster was “totally out of touch”.“Damaging though illegal migration is, legal migration is even more harmful to the country because of the sheer eye-watering numbers of people who have been coming across in recent years perfectly legally – it’s putting immense pressure on public services,” he said.Jenrick added: “I think the country now needs breathing space after this period of mass migration. The age of being open to the world and his wife who are low-wage, low-skilled individuals and their dependents has come to an end.“Reversing recent low-skilled migration will likely mean a sustained period of net emigration. I would support that.”Justice secretary suggests Jenrick risked collapse of murder trial with tweetRead moreHe said Britain was a net emigration country in the 1960s to 1980s, and more than half a million people left the UK last year. The goal, he argued, was not to “close the border entirely” but to stay open to “coders, doctors and serial entrepreneurs”.Jenrick, still widely seen as promoting himself for a future leadership contest, denied trying to steal Kemi Badenoch’s thunder.“I fully support Kemi’s approach which is to develop serious policies with detailed substantive basis behind them. That’s the way we can begin to rebuild public trust,” he said.But his intervention comes before Tory party conference where Badenoch is expected to set out her own immigration plan.Jenrick did not shy away from criticising his shadow cabinet colleague Priti Patel. During the interview, he said the points-based system created by Conservative ministers “was the worst policy mistake in my lifetime”. The system came in when Patel was home secretary during Boris Johnson’s time as prime minister.Explore more on these topicsConservativesRobert JenrickImmigration and asylumNigel FarageKemi BadenochnewsShareReuse this content"

Government sources suggested the ethics inquiry could be completed within days.Thecontroversycomes as the prime minister faces a turbulent autumn, with tax rises expected to be announced in the 26 November budget, which will arrive against a difficult economic backdrop.Rayner, who is also the housing secretary, has faced charges of hypocrisy as tax rises could include those on property. She has alsopreviously called for wealth taxesto help ease the UK’s strained public finances, including targeting people who used companies to avoid stamp duty.After referring herself to the ethics adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, Rayner said she had received inaccurate legal advice that led her to underpay stamp duty. She confirmed she will have to pay more as a result of incorrectly paying the lower rate on the flat in Hove, East Sussex. Experts have said the bill could run to as much as an extra £40,000.In ahighly personal statementto the Guardian, she said she “deeply regretted” that the error had been made, after classifying the flat as her only property, despite spending much of her time with her children at the family house in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester.Rayner’s fate, as deputy prime minister and as a cabinet minister, could come down to whether she can prove that she was given the wrong advice by her lawyers, as she has claimed, when she bought the Hove flat in May.In an early sign of support for Rayner, Starmer told MPs he was “very proud to sit alongside” her in the Commons. The prime minister, who patted her shoulder when he arrived for PMQs, said referring herself was the “right thing to do”.“She has explained her personal circumstances in detail. She has gone over and above in setting out the details, including asking the court to lift a confidentiality order in relation to her own son,” he added.“I know from speaking at length to the deputy prime minister just how difficult that decision was for her and her family, but she did it. She did it to ensure that all information is in the public domain.”But his spokesperson refused to say when Rayner received new advice that she had underpaid. No 10 also declined to confirm when Starmer was told. As recently as Monday, he said she was the victim of “people briefing against her and talking her down over and over again”.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer told MPs he was ‘very proud to sit alongside’ Angela Rayner in the Commons.Photograph: PRU/AFP/Getty ImagesStarmer has a track record of ruthlessness when it comes to firing errant ministers, but while Rayner faces a moment of great uncertainty, shecould yet be protected by her relatively powerful positionwithin the Labour party, as a standard bearer of the left and working-class voice.Months before the purchase of her Hove flat, Rayner had put her stake in her constituency home in Ashton into a trust, which was originally set up in 2020 to manage a payment to one of her sons, who, after a “deeply personal and distressing incident” as a premature baby, had been left with lifelong disabilities.In May 2025, when she bought the south coast property, she said she was advised by lawyers over the level of stamp duty required. Subsequently, tax experts had told her that the flat could not be treated as her only residence because of the provisions of the trust.Tax experts saythat, even though she gave up her financial stake in the Ashton house after her divorce, Rayner would be regarded as still owning it if she or her children were a beneficiary under the trust and entitled to occupy the dwelling for life.As the flat was an additional dwelling, she would be expected to pay the higher stamp duty rate of £70,000, rather than the £30,000 she actually paid. She is now working with HM Revenue and Customs to establish exactly how much extra tax is owed.Regardless of ownership, the Ashton property remains her family home and where she is registered for most official and financial purposes, including council tax and the electoral roll. It is where her children live full-time, while she and her former husband take turns living at the house.In her statement, Rayner said: “When purchasing the property, my understanding, on advice from lawyers, was that my circumstances meant I was liable for the standard rate of stamp duty.“However, given the recent allegations in the press, I have subsequently sought further advice from a leading tax counsel to review that position and to ensure I am fully compliant with all tax provisions.“I have now been advised that although I did not own any other property at the time of the purchase, the application of complex deeming provisions which relate to my son’s trust gives rise to additional stamp duty liabilities.“I acknowledge that due to my reliance on advice from lawyers which did not properly take account of these provisions, I did not pay the appropriate stamp duty at the time of the purchase. I am working with expert lawyers and with HMRC to resolve the matter and pay what is due”.While Starmer awaits the ethics adviser’s conclusions, he will face pressure over Rayner’s position.Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative party leader, said: “If he had a backbone he would sack her.” The Tories published multiple old tweets from Rayner in opposition decrying “one rule for them, one rule for everybody else”.The Reform UK deputy leader, Richard Tice, said: “She was so vocal in attacking opposing politicians when she was in opposition that she can’t stand up and say: ‘I’m the biggest hypocrite in the land.’ She has to offer her resignation.”Angela Rayner is a picture of misery but Dr Kemi passes up open goal | John CraceRead moreHowever, Rayner received unexpected support fromEd Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, who refused to join the chorus of critics calling for her to go. “Obviously if the ethics adviser says Angela Rayner has broken the rules, her position may well become untenable,” he said.“But as a parent of a disabled child, I know the thing my wife and I worry most about is our son’s care after we have gone, so I can completely understand and trust that the deputy prime minister was thinking about the same thing here.”In her statement, Rayner added: “While I do not find it easy to publicly discuss personal and sometimes distressing family matters, I have always taken my responsibility as an MP and deputy prime minister seriously and tried to be as open as possible while protecting my family.“To address the allegations made against me, I have now taken the difficult decision to explain why my arrangements are as they are.”Downing Street hadrevealed on Mondaythat Rayner was prevented from publicising all of the details about her property ownership by a court order. In the interests of transparency, she applied to the court and was given permission to discuss them publicly on Tuesday night.Explore more on these topicsAngela RaynerLabourKeir StarmerKemi BadenochEd DaveyStamp dutyTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

The public has a right to know | Jeremy CorbynRead moreA former Foreign Office whistleblower,Mark Smith, will give evidence, as well as the UN special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied territories,Francesca Albanese.Other witnesses will be a lawyer for the family ofJim Henderson, a World Food Kitchen aid worker killed on 1 April 2024; Prof Nick Maynard, an Oxford University surgeon who has been given a humanitarian award for his work in Gaza; and Palestinian journalists including Abubaker Abed and Yousef Alhelou.An Israeli historian, Dr Raz Segal, has been asked to explain why many scholars regard Israel’s handling ofGazaand the West Bank as “a textbook case of genocide”, a view he took in late 2023.UK ministers have defended their stance on Gaza, saying they rapidly imposed a ban on all arms sales to Israel, exceptfor F-35 partsthat were sold on to Israel,suspended talkson a new partnership agreement and imposedsanctions on two ministersin Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.One of the points of the inquiry will be the degree to whichRAF surveillance planeshave slipped from looking for hostages held by Hamas into aiding the wider Israeli military campaign inside Gaza. It may also look at the intersection between the Ministry of Defence and the Israeli arms industry.Separately, Dr Husam Zomlot, the head of the Palestinian mission to the UK, speaking at the Chatham House thinktank on Tuesday, said a de facto annexationof the West Bankwas happening and the UK should ban the import of all products fromillegal settlementsin Palestine.He said a long list of settler products being imported into the UK had been provided to the Foreign Office. “Be real, don’t be half-committed and don’t zigzag and dance around the issues. Illegalities must be marked,” he said.Zomlot also called for UK visa waivers to be withdrawn from Israeli settlers living illegally in the West Bank and any UK dual citizens serving in the Israeli army.He welcomed the UK steps taken so far but described “most of them as half measures not designed to create real leverage”. He said: “The UK had a legal obligation to stop the genocide in Gaza, to stop the annexation and to recognise the state of Palestine.”The UK plansto recognise a Palestinian stateat a UN conference in New York on 22 September.Along with Corbyn, the Gaza tribunal is chaired by Neve Gordon, a professor of human rights law at Queen Mary University of London and vice-president of the British Society for Middle East Studies, and Dr Shahd Hammouri, a lecturer in international law at Kent University.Tribunal organisers say they hope their unofficial and necessarily limited inquiry will stir public demands for an official state-funded inquiry into the British government’s handling of the Gaza crisis under Labour and the Conservatives.The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has described the west’s handling of the Gaza crisis as thedarkest moment in diplomacyin the 21st century, but there is little UK government appetite to review the lessons of that failure.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyJeremy CorbynForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warWar crimesnewsShareReuse this content"

Herbody was recovered from the River Derwenton 22 October after an extensive search.The inquest into her death in Northallerton heard that Taylor struggled with alcohol and mental health problems related to a childhood trauma.Coroner Catherine Cundy said the trauma left “an indelible mark” on Taylor’s life “in the form of depression, anxiety and chronic feelings of worthlessness”. Recording a narrative verdict, Cundy said she could not be sure of Taylor’s intentions when she went into the river.In a statement issued afterwards, Taylor’s sister, Emma Worden, said she hoped the inquest would be a turning point. She said: “Vixx was a devoted mother, a loving fiancee and a fiercely loyal sister. She showed up for those she loved with warmth, humour and a deep sense of care.“Her relationships were central to her identity, and she gave everything she had to protect and support the people around her. She also lived with challenges, these were not hidden.“She reached out for help. She made herself visible to services. And yet, time and again, she was failed and left without the support she needed. The failures in her care were not isolated incidents. They were part of a wider pattern of systemic neglect and under-resourcing in mental health services.“Vixx deserved better. She deserved to be seen, heard and supported. Instead, she was left to carry burdens alone. Her death is a tragedy, but it must also be a turning point. Let this inquest be a step toward accountability, learning and change.”During the daylong inquest Worden turned to representatives of Tees, Esk and Wear ValleysNHSfoundation trust (TEWV) saying they were going “round in circles”. She said: “Nobody looked her in the eye and said: ‘We will help you,’ and she’s not here now because you failed her.”The coroner said she would be writing to TEWV and a number of other agencies with her concerns over the support Taylor was given.She said she found it “difficult to understand” why community mental health services repeatedly declined to offer Taylor support as her situation deteriorated during 2024.Cundy said she believed this was partly because Taylor was treated as an alcoholic when she was not dependent on alcohol, instead being someone who binged on wine when her emotions relating to her traumatic past overwhelmed her.Elspeth Devanney, the group director for nursing and quality at TEWV, said: “Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with Victoria’s family and friends during this incredibly difficult time.“Following Victoria’s tragic death, we completed a review and have made changes to improve our services. We will respond to the coroner’s report and take action to continue to improve and provide high-quality care to the people in our communities.”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

As he made his way up the aisle, he spun around and danced without music, leaving the room in an awkward silence. Some attendees looked away while others buried their faces in their hands.Around 40 seconds into his performance, Thilly reached the podium, let out a sigh before jogging back to grab a bottle of water and some papers. The room remained silent until he spoke. “How was everyone’s weekend?” he asked, before adding that he had just returned from Monterrey, Mexico.Man dancing“There’s no pizza there … [but] it’s a beautiful town with lots of history,” Thilly said. He then asked: “Anyone here afraid of flying?”Breakdancing for Trump and the Mud Olympics: photos of the weekendRead moreThilly proceeded to ask if anyone wanted to see him perform a backspin. When no one responded, he laid on the ground, lifted his feet and spun several times. As he danced, the crowd stayed silent, with some attendees looking uncomfortable. When he finished, Thilly gestured for applause but received none.He then asked: “Why did our taxes go up so much?”Thilly went on to reference a previous local referendum, questioning why the tax increase was apparently higher than anticipated. He said: “We were told the referendum was going to bring [taxes] up for an average household [by] around $400 … and mine went up like 900 bucks … We were told like that was from the schools or something? But the school referendum said it would only go up … like 400 bucks on an average assessed home … So I wanted to know why it went up, if it did that and what extra expenses were incurred by the schools that weren’t told to the public when we voted on that referendum?”Following his remarks, Thilly gathered his papers and water bottle and moon-walked away from the podium, again in silence.Thilly appears to have a track record of unconventional town hall appearances, frequently posting videos of them on Instagram in recent months. In these videos, he makes various calls for change.At some town hall meetings, he urges wealthy developers to pay their own taxes rather than shifting the burden to residents. In others, he encourages residents to be friends with each other. And sometimes he stands at the podium saying nothing at all.Currently, Thilly is running as an independent candidate for the Cranford township committee.On his campaign website, he says: “I want to be elected to stop the resident-funded overdevelopment of Cranford … Our township meetings need to be about getting residents what they want, by offering clear answers to their questions, encouraging open discussion and dialogue, and ultimately working together for consensus and compromise. I will lead this effort.”Thilly explained his dance, saying: “The dance was basically improv[,] decided almost on the spot. The main goal is to have our local government lighten up and look at the residence [sic] as friends and equals. The division and lack of community decision-making is what seems to be our biggest problem. Not to mention people are overly stressed and taking stuff too seriously and are not feeling free to speak and express themselves as they might wish.”Citing his frustrations with tax breaks for wealthy developers, he added: “If elected, we would hope to change how our committee does business by making sure decisions are made by the residents as a community and not by three committee members who appear to be too overly influenced by their political party higher-ups.“Possibly even more important than helping our town make wise financial decisions that the residents are aware and approve of; I hope to bring a friendly, stress-free way of our committee when dealing with the public. The more friends we become with each other, the better happier and less lonely all of us will be,” Thilly explained.Explore more on these topicsNew JerseyDanceTax and spendingUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The same judge had ruled in favor of US prosecutors nearly a year ago, finding that Google built and maintained an illegal monopoly with its namesake search engine.Groups critical of Google’s dominance in theinternetsearch and onlineadvertisingindustry are furious. They contend the judge missed an opportunity to enact meaningful change in an industry that has suffocated under the crushing weight of its heaviest player. Tech industry groups and investors, by contrast, are thrilled. Shares inAlphabet, Google’s parent company, have risen 9% since Tuesday afternoon.Judge Amit Mehta did order Google to share data from its search engine with its rivals. He also enjoined the company from entering or maintaining exclusive contracts relating to the distribution of its products includingChrome, Google Assistant and the Gemini app. That penalty will not, however, prevent it from paying distributors such as Apple and Mozilla, which use Google as the default search engine for their respective browsers. Google faces a separate hearing later this year on its monopoly over online advertising technology.The Department of Justice celebrated the ruling in a Tuesdaypress releasethat called Mehta’s proposed remedies “significant”.“The court’s ruling today recognizes the need for remedies that will pry open the market for general search services, which has been frozen in place for over a decade,” the announcement reads.It’s not enough, say free market advocates.Critics say judge handed Google a lenient winMehta’s decision resulted in an immediate wave of backlash from big tech critics who have been closely following the antitrust case for years. Many of these thinktanks and advocacy groups hadlong calledfor Google to be broken up for its monopolistic tactics, arguing that forceful action was needed to restore meaningful competition.Google will not be forced to sell Chrome, federal judge rulesRead moreInstead of opening up the online search industry, however, critics of the ruling allege that it will now retrench Google’s dominance while setting a precedent that big tech need not fear serious consequences for breaking the law.“Google for years has wielded its vast power over all layers of the digital economy to crush competitors, halt innovation and rob Americans of their right to read, watch and buy what they want without being manipulated by one of the most powerful corporations in human history,” Barry Lynn, executive director at the Open Markets Institute thinktank, said. “Judge Mehta’s order that Google share search data with competitors and cease entering into exclusive contracts does nothing to right those wrongs. Instead, it lets Google and every other monopolist know that even the most egregious violation of law will be met with a slap on the wrist.”Some groups and experts took issue with how Mehta’s ruling that Google hadillegally maintained a monopolycould result in the more lenient decision handed down this week.“You don’t find someone guilty of robbing a bank and then sentence him to writing a thank you note for the loot,” said Nidhi Hegde, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project non-profit.Several tech leaders, including the CEOs of Yelp, search engine DuckDuckGo and Epic Games, additionally condemned the decision for failing to adequately level the playing field for competitors. Yelp and Epic Games have both sued Google over antitrust issues, while DuckDuckGo’s CEO testified in the government’s antitrust trial against the search giant.“It’s like a defendant robbed a series of banks and the court verdict found them guilty, then sentenced them to probation under which they may continue robbing banks but must share data on how they rob banks with competing bank robbers,” Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, posted on X in yet another use of a bank robbing analogy.Democratic lawmakers who have urged for stronger regulations on big tech similarly denounced the ruling, in some cases calling for the justice department to appeal the decision.“The court previously ruled that Google’s search business is an illegal monopoly, but now the judge’s remedies fail to hold Google accountable for breaking the law,” the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said ina statement. “Instead of restoring competition and ending Google’s dominance, this ruling is a slap on the wrist for unlawful behavior that warranted the breakup of this tech giant.”The chairs of the Monopoly Busters caucus – US representatives Chris Deluzio, Pramila Jayapal, Pat Ryan and Angie Craig – also issued a statement calling the decision a “slap on the wrist” and alleging it undermines bipartisan efforts to rein in tech monopolies.“In practice, this ruling allows Google to stay a monopoly. Despite finding Google guilty of search monopolization, the court is allowing the company to retain Chrome andAndroid, key tools that Google uses to dominate the market,” the caucus said.The decision also drew the ire of human rights group Amnesty International, which said that Google’s business model is built on“pervasive surveillance” and that Chrome is an important tool used for harvesting the personal data of Google users.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Industry groups weighed in saying Mehta’s decision avoided calamitous results forSilicon Valley. The Developers Alliance, a tech industry group, said it was pleased that the judge “rejected the draconian structural remedies” that the justice department had requested in the case.“Divesting Chrome and Android would have had disastrous consequences for web and app developers and the broader digital ecosystem,” the group said in a statement. “Developers are relieved that the political theater of this trial has ended.”Another industry group, the Consumer Choice Center, invoked Google’s arguments from the trial in which the search engine giant said it had the best product and that is why it dominates the market. Stephen Kent, the group’s media director, said the justice department’s “politicized case” held “larger players in contempt for having superior products that people freely use instead of rival apps and services”.Many of these groups cited Mehta’s argument that in the year or so since he originally ruled that Google’s search business was monopolistic, the burgeoning AI space has produced both financially and technologically viable competitors to Chrome for the first time in years. “These new realities give the court hope that Google will not simply outbid competitors for distribution if superior competitors emerge,” Mehta’s ruling read.“Arguing about search engine market share when dramatic and remarkable advances in AI were upending the industry was head-scratching at best,” the Developers Alliance said.Jennifer Huddleston, senior fellow at libertarian thinktank the Cato Institute, said the courts should proceed with caution and “recognize that innovation often remains our best competition policy” when attempting to rule on antitrust cases.“The months that have passed between the initial ruling and the remedies decision have shown how rapidly markets in the tech sector can change,” Hiddleston said in a statement. “This is particularly true in the present, given the disruptive nature of AI products in search. As Judge Mehta’s decision notes, such cases ask courts to predict the future of a rapidly changing market rather than merely look at historical facts, as it typically does, and that doing such is not a judge’s forte.”As Google’s stock bounced on the news of Mehta’s ruling, Apple also saw a boost. The iPhone maker historically received billions of dollars from Google annually to make Google Search the default engine on its phones and tablets. The deal between the two companies amounted to about 15% of Apple’s operating income. Its shares rose nearly 4% since Tuesday.“Apple also gets a nice win because the ruling forces Google to renegotiate the search deal annually,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, wroteon X.Critics of the remedies ruling were not surprised by Wall Street heralding Mehta’s decision as a win. “There’s a reason Google’s stock jumped after this ruling was released,” saidChristo Wilson, a Northeastern University computer science professor who has conductedresearchon Google’s monopoly. “It is a historic misfire that fails to meet the enormity of the finding that Google is a monopolist in online search.”Explore more on these topicsGoogleAlphabetAndroidChromeSearch enginesInternetSilicon ValleynewsShareReuse this content"

But he says: ‘We haven’t seen a single cent’Politicians have long promised the critical metal will rescue the economy but Indigenous locals say the push to exploit vast reserves threatens the ecosystem and their livelihoodsPhotographs by Sara Aliaga TiconaByBenjamin Swift in Río Grande, BoliviaSupported byAbout this contentWed 3 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTShareGrowing up nearBolivia’s Uyuni salt flats, Franz Alí Ramos remembers playing in the high-altitude wetlands near his home during the rainy season. “It was a beautiful recreation area for us and for animals,” he says.Now, the wetlands have given way to cracked, sunbaked earth – a change that Alí Ramos blames on nearby operations by Bolivia’s state lithium corporation, Yacimientos de Litio Bolivianos (YLB). The government has recentlysigned lithium mining contractswith two foreign companies – one Russian and the other Chinese – and residents fear more serious damage is yet to come.“Our communities are in a state of emergency,” says Alí Ramos, who lives in Río Grande, a small town on the southern edge of the Uyuni salt flats 18 miles (30km) away from YLB’s Llipi lithium plant.View image in fullscreenFranz Alí Ramos says the people of Río Grande, near the salt flats, feel powerlessLithium industrialisation in Bolivia began in 2008, when the then president Evo Morales announced aplan to nationalise the country’s reservesconcentrated in the Uyuni salt flats.It took until2023 for the first plant to open, however, after claims ofmismanagementby YLB and the2019 political crisis– when Morales was forced to resign by the military over allegations of election fraud – brought delays.Map of Uyuni salt flats in BoliviaSince the plant’s inauguration, output has fallen far short of targets: in 2024, it produced only2,000 tonnesof lithium carbonate, far below itsestimated annual capacityof 15,000 tonnes.Frustrated by the slow progress, YLB signed contracts worth $2bn (£1.49bn) with Russia’sUranium One Groupand the Chinese consortiumCBClast year.We’ve never had much water here. If it runs out, we’ll have to migrate to the citiesIván CalcinaThat meant a change in strategy to unlock the underexploited metal’s potential using a new extractiontechnology that enables faster lithium processingthan traditional methods, supposedly using less fresh water – although critics dispute this, noting it increases the amount of waste brine.AUS Geological Survey reportthis year estimated Bolivia’s lithium reserves to be 23m tonnes, 20% of the global total. Advocates hope the metal – a crucial ingredient in electric-car batteries – can provide a path out of the country’sworst economic crisisin decades.The contracts have been approved by aneconomic commission of deputiesbut await signoff from the full legislature before they take effect.View image in fullscreenYLB says it will conduct environmental impact studies on the Uyuni salt flats – but only after mining contracts are approvedHowever, Bolivia is in the middle of a presidential election. In thefirst roundof voting on 17 August, a conservative and a centre-right candidate emerged as frontrunners and will face each other again in a runoff in October.Protesters want MPs to delay ratifying the dealuntil after the new government takes office in November.Their concerns go beyond the timing of the elections. YLB has beencriticised for the opacity of the contractsand it failed toconsult Indigenous communitiesor conduct an environmental impact study, as required under Bolivian and international law.The company maintains that consent from communities near the mine is unnecessary because the salt flats fall under national jurisdiction.But Gonzalo Mondaca, of the environmental organisationCedib, argues that it is very much a local issue because the high desert ecosystem relies on fragile, nonrenewable aquifers andlithium mining is water-intensive, extracting from below ground 15 times what is naturally replenished by rain.View image in fullscreenA well installed by YLB. Locals say the wetlands where vicuñas grazed have dried up“Any exploitation, even at the lowest level, could alter the system,” he says, pointing to the International Labour Organization’sIndigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, to which Bolivia is a signatory. “It does not just refer to territories, but to the possibility of being affected. That’s why communities are demanding consultation.”Heavier water use would be felt acutely by the majority Quechua population in theNor Lípez Indigenous territoryjust south of the salt flats, says Iván Calcina, secretary general of the Provincial Central Union of Indigenous Communities of Nor Lípez (Cupconl), which represents local Indigenous people.Groundwater sustains llama herding and quinoa farming, which are essential to local livelihoods but could become unviable if lithium mining expands. “We’ve never had much water here,” Calcina says. “If it runs out, we’ll have to migrate to the cities.”View image in fullscreenIván Calcina at the base of Cerro Llipi. YLB has restricted access to the mountain, where local people perform rituals for rainMany from his community of Culpina K have already moved to Chile in search of work. “Prior consultation is important so that the state can tell us how we’ll be affected, and what they’ll provide in return,” says Calcina.Although it has rejected the need for community consultation, YLB has stated that it will conduct environmental impact studies – but only after the legislature approves the two contracts.“If they say the project isn’t viable, the money will already be there,” Calcina says. “It’s like putting on your shoes before your socks – it makes no sense.”So far, YLB’s mining have been a relatively small-scale operation, but residents worry that existing problems will be intensified if the contracts are approved – and have little hope for the promised economic benefits. “There isn’t even a law regulating lithium,” Calcina points out.Most residents of Río Grande work in agriculture or in nearby zinc and lead mines. “We were very hopeful when they announced the industrialisation project in 2008,” recalls Donny Alí, a former president of the town’s civic committee and a former general director of lithium at the energy ministry. “They made us believe we’d become the Dubai of South America.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Vicuñas – wild camelids whose wool fetches a better price than alpacas’ fleece – are an essential source of income for local people who shear them. But after YLB installed more than 20 wells near the town, residents claim that the high-altitude wetlands where the animals congregated have dried up.“The vicuñas have had to migrate to other areas where there aren’t humans,” Alí says, making them harder to corral. “It’s a financial loss, and no one’s making up for it.”If the new contracts are approved, he fears that increased industrial water use could worsen the problem. “There aren’t any technical reports that guarantee we will continue to have water,” he says.Alí Ramos, a member of Río Grande’s civic committee, says the community feels powerless, adding: “We’re the ones who will be affected.”View image in fullscreenLlama herding, which depends on groundwater supplies, could become unviable if lithium mining expandsTourism has also suffered. Residents say YLB prohibits traffic across the salt flats near Río Grande, so anyone wanting to visit them has to make a 60-mile (100km) journey east to the main entrance near the town of Uyuni. The company has also reportedly restricted access to Cerro Llipi, a mountain where residents perform traditional rituals for rain.“We fought to at least be able to access our mountain without permission, but they denied us that as well,” says Alí Ramos.José Valda Belén, a tour operator based in Uyuni, believes the same could happen to the tourism industry if the contracts are approved. “They might impose visiting restrictions,” he says, fearing problems for one of Bolivia’s top destinations.God willing, the next government has the environment on its agendaAlí RamosDespite repeated requests for comment, YLB declined to respond directly, citing administrative reasons.In October, thecentre-right senator Rodrigo Paz Pereira, son of a former president, and the rightwingformer president Jorge “Tuto” Quirogawill face off in the presidential election, which willend nearly 20 years of leftwing governments. Both candidates say the “white gold” will revive Bolivia’s struggling economy.Quiroga has promisedto manufacture batteries domestically, which the environmentalist Mondaca says isunfeasibledue to Bolivia’s distance from major markets and lack of other battery materials.View image in fullscreenJosé Valda Belén, who runs tours of the salt flats, pictured in Uyuni’s ‘train cemetery’. He worries that restrictions could damage tourismPaz Pereira has pledged to process magnesium byproducts as well as lithium carbonate to create more products for export. This proposal “is more realistic”, says Mondaca. “But the truth is that even if the work started in earnest today, there wouldn’t be results for years.”Meanwhile, lithium priceshave declined by 90%over the past two years, despite growing demand for the metal, due to oversupply by China.In May, the local Indigenous organisation Cupconlfiled a lawsuit, alleging that YLB had failed to consult the community, as required under the constitution buta judge dismissed the caseon the grounds that a class-action suit was not appropriate. Calcina says the group plans to appeal against the decision and take the case to theInter-American Commission on Human Rightsif necessary.Battle lines redrawn as Argentina’s lithium mines ramp up to meet electric car demandRead moreOn 20 August,a judge ordereda temporary pause in the contract approval process until YLB conducts an environmental impact study and obtains consent from the affected communities.Opponents of the mines are now waiting to see what the new government will do, amid disillusion with the previous leftwing government. Mondaca notes that the Movement Towards Socialism (Mas) party, which wasin power since 2006, talked about Indigenous rights but often failed to translate the rhetoric into action.Though the results of the election’s first round mark theend of Mas’s grip on power, critics say that the rightwing parties’bet on lithiumas an economic saviour for Bolivia’s problemscontinues an extractive modelthat has caused environmental destruction and violated Indigenous rights since colonisation.Alí Ramos in Río Grande is one of those who has lost faith in Mas. “God willing,” he says, “the next government has the environment on its agenda.”Explore more on these topicsSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanBoliviaConservation and indigenous peopleEmploymentAccess to waterConservationMining (Environment)featuresShareReuse this content"

In April, he pleaded not guilty to all federal counts, including murder and stalking, and awaits trial. Prosecutors have announced they will pursue the death penalty if he is found guilty.After the killing, some people opposed to the US healthcare systemframed Mangioneas a folk hero, with some rallying outside the courthouse during his appearances and contributing thousands of dollars to Mangione’s defense fund. Others have condemned the glorifying of violence and vigilantism.Some online retailers, including Etsy, saw a wave of merchandise using his name. Amazon said it hadremovedany such products from its site.Shein, founded in China, has built its global reputation on inexpensive, fast-moving fashion trends that attract gen Zers and younger millennials.

We are conducting a thorough investigation, strengthening our monitoring processes, and will take appropriate action against the vendor in line with our policies.”The latest incident comes as the EU justice commissioner, Michael McGrath,vowed to crack downon the sale of goods that break the law. He expressed shock at the dangers of some goods being sold by China-linked online marketplaces such as Shein and its main rival, Temu.Shein said at the time that it was “fully committed to ensuring the products we offer are safe and compliant”, while Temu said it had a “system of seller vetting, proactive monitoring and responsive takedowns to prevent, detect and remove unsafe products”.Meanwhile, the UK is reviewing rules that allow goods worth less than £135 and sent direct to a buyer to enter the UK without paying customs duty. The US recently scrapped its version of the “de minimis” rules, which allowed goods worth less than $800 and sent direct to American shoppers to escape customs duty and some checks.Shein hadhoped to list on the London Stock Exchangethis year, valued at as much as £50bn ($67bn).However, it is now thought to be pursuing a listing in Hong Kong after failing to win approval from Chinese authorities for a listing in the UK.

Less than eight weeks after she had been double-bagelled by the Polish star in the final at the All England Club, the 24-year-old American struck back with fearless ball-striking and nerveless resolve to reach her first US Open semi-final.Swiatek, a six-time major champion and the 2022 US Open winner, looked intent on reprising the script when she broke immediately to extend her personal run to 13 consecutive games in the rivalry. But the eighth-seeded Anisimova struck back on her third break point, finishing with a thumping forehand overhead that drew a roar from the Arthur Ashe crowd and ensured this would bear no resemblance to the rout in July. “Honestly, when I wasn’t able to hold in that first game, I was really, like, OK, here we go,” Anisimova admitted afterwards. “Winning that first game kind of took some stress off my shoulders. Once I got it, I was easing into the match.”Djokovic unsure if he’ll be fit enough to beat Alcaraz in US Open semi-finalsRead moreThe opening set was tightly wound and fiercely contested, Anisimova fending off break point with a crisp backhand down the line at 2-2 and Swiatek producing her best point of the match, a 17-shot exchange capped with a forehand overhead, to keep pace at 3-4.With Swiatek serving at 4-5, Anisimova forced two set points and converted the second when her rival sprayed a forehand long. In 50 minutes she had pocketed the opener, winning 12 of 17 points on her opponent’s second serve with the kind of incendiary hitting and baseline aggression that have long been her trademarks.Swiatek, whose summer haul already included titles at Wimbledon and Cincinnati, tried to reassert herself at the start of the second, breaking for 2-0 as the crowd stirred uneasily. Anisimova refused to retreat, holding firm from 15-30 and then lashing a forehand return winner to create double break point in the fourth game. A ballistic backhand sealed the break back and from there the American never let go of the initiative.Swiatek’s usually impenetrable composure began to crack as her first-serve percentage dipped and the intensity of the duress mounted. Serving at 3-4 she faltered again, coughing up the decisive break with her third double fault of the set. Moments later Anisimova secured her place in the last four with a backhand winner that clipped the net cord and tumbled over.“Today was definitely different than any other match I’ve played because of the circumstances,” said Anisimova, who was born in central New Jersey and grew up in Florida. “I really tried to prepare myself mentally over the last 24 hours, more than physically. I came out there with not an ounce of fear. I was constantly moving and trying to pump myself up, which is not something I usually do. I felt like I was really supporting myself, and that helped me play better.”She also revealed she had revisited the trauma of Wimbledon the night before. “Nobody told me to, but I watched it back, as painful as it was, just to see what I can avoid or what went wrong,” she said. “Then I had to watch some good highlights to remove that from my brain. I think it was important for me to see what happened last night going into today’s match. I realised I was so slow in that final. But it happens, I’m human. Some people freeze sometimes.”View image in fullscreenAnisimova and Iga Swiatek embrace at the net.Photograph: Cristóbal Herrera/EPASwiatek, candid in defeat, pointed to her serving struggles. “From the baseline I felt it was good, but the serve made the difference,” she said. “Amanda was winning more points from her serve, and I struggled to make first serves in. She returned the ball so well from my second serve. That made the difference.”She stressed that Wimbledon hadn’t given her a false sense of security: “It didn’t matter to me. Everybody knows how Amanda can play. She didn’t play well at Wimbledon, but it’s not like she’s always going to make the same mistakes. Today everything was different.”For Anisimova, who took a mental-health hiatus in 2023 and only last year clawed her way back into the top 50, the win was both cathartic and historic. Already a finalist at Wimbledon this summer and a semi-finalist at Roland Garros in 2019, she has now delivered her breakthrough on home soil. She is also the first American woman since Serena and Venus Williams in 2002 to reach the semi-finals on all three surfaces at grand slam events.She crunched nearly twice as many winners (23) as unforced errors (12) and controlled the tempo throughout, rushing Swiatek with the depth of her groundstrokes and holding her nerve in the biggest moments. “Today is definitely the most meaningful victory I’ve had in my life,” she said. “It’s the farthest I’ve ever gone at the US Open and it feels surreal. I feel like I’ve proved to myself that I can really go head-to-head with the top players.”On Thursday she will face either Naomi Osaka or Karolína Muchová for a place in the final. “Both are incredibly tough opponents,” she said. “Naomi has won four grand slams and she looks like she’s really found her groove. Karolina is so crafty and I love watching her play. Either way it will be really difficult, but I’m looking forward to it.”As will the Ashe stadium crowd that will firmly be in her corner. Fifty-three days after her Wimbledon heartbreak, she has given New York a comeback story to savour.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Iga SwiatekUS Open tennisTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The system was also used for this year’s Club World Cup and, in the UK,drew widespread complaintsfrom fans buying tickets for Oasis’s comeback tour.The use of dynamic pricing was one of a few new details Fifa officials discussed around ticketing for theWorld Cupone week before sales open, including the first collection of prices. The cheapest tickets will start at $60 (£44), with the most expensive, for a prime spot at the final, starting at $6,730 (£5,760). Fifa did not provide any price points in between those two.Dynamic pricing means that those starting prices can, and probably will, rise significantly. This will be the first men’s World Cup to use the scheme, in which the ticket prices are adjusted by the seller to reflect demand – ­similar to the way surge pricing works for .‘Happy hour in reverse’: where dynamic pricing may creep furtherRead moreTicket companies have benefited significantly from dynamic pricing as its usage has risen over the last ­decade . Ticketmaster parent company LiveNationbroke its record for revenue in 2024, with dynamic pricing thought to be a significant factor. The practice has also attracted complaints from fans priced out of events – including in high-profile cases surroundingOasis’s tourandlast season’s FA Cup final.Fifa officials justified the use of dynamic pricing by saying it was the organization’s way of adapting to the domestic market in the United States and Canada, where the practice is common, and where it says the public already accepts that event tickets will be priced according to demand. One official added thatFifacouldn’t pass up the additional revenue that would be generated by dynamic pricing, citing the 211 Fifa member nations that could benefit from a more profitable World Cup. According to the officials, Fifa never ran a baseline study to determine how much revenue could be generated from 2026 World Cup ticket sales without dynamic pricing – suggesting the topic was never really up for debate.The pricing structure is expected to be put into place immediately for the first phase of ticket sales, which begins on 10 September. Prices will fluctuate based on demand from that point on, meaning that some matches will have higher minimum price points than others before the World Cup draw has even begun.Fifa used dynamic pricing at the 2025 Club World Cup, with mixed results. Prices for those games initially rose sharply, only to drop – in some cases as low as $13.40 (£10) – just before kickoff as stadiums remains only partially full. However, demand at the World Cup is almost certain to be significantly higher than at the Club World Cup, and a Fifa official said that this time around prices would not go lower than $60.Changes to ticket categoriesAnother significant change described by Fifa officials comes in the way tickets are categorized for the World Cup. In past tournaments, Fifa has broken down seats into a category system, with Category 1 generally considered to be the best seats, Category 2 the next best, and so on until Category 4. It had been standard practice for a seat’s placement in relation to the pitch to affect its categorization: a seat along the sideline, for example, was far more likely to be considered Category 1, while a seat at the same level but located behind the goal might be Category 2 or lower.That approach is no longer in use. In 2026, seat categories will in most cases correspond to the level of the stadium the seat is located. At the World Cup final, for example, the entire lower level of MetLife Stadium is expected to count as Category 1, with the suite level in the middle counting as Category 2, and then the upper bowl making up Categories 3 and 4.Once again, Fifa officials said that the change was made to bring the organization in line with perceived cultural norms in the host countries. The officials said that according to their research, North American fans place a higher emphasis on proximity to the field than they do having a certain type of view of the match.Where and when tickets will go on saleView image in fullscreenThe ticket sales process for the 2026 World Cup starts on 10 September for Visa cardholders.Photograph: FifaFifa and longtime financial partner Visa announced in late July the details of the first phase of ticket sales, and those remain largely the same. From 10-19 September, Visa cardholders worldwide may submit an application on Fifa’s website, and by 29 September the randomly accepted applicants will be notified and given a date and time window in October, during which they can buy tickets. A Fifa official said that application data would be screened to prevent the influence of bots, and that the randomized draw would be made in the presence of a public notary in Zurich.As in past World Cups, fans may buy single-game tickets, or packages that give access to every game at a certain venue, or every game played by a specific team. Tickets will only be sold by category, with seats assigned at random within those categories until the final phase of sales, in which fans can buy specific seats on a first-come, first-served basis, many months after dynamic pricing has gone into effect.Fans can buy a maximum of four tickets per match, for a maximum of 10 matches during the tournament. Fifa said it would operate a resale marketplace in an effort to avoid scalping.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World CupFifanewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a story of how Jerry Jones built a brand that thrives on drama but not titlesBryan Armen GrahamWed 3 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 12.07 EDTShareOn Thursday night in Philadelphia, the Dallas Cowboys will stand on the sideline, helmets under their arms, while the Eagles raise a championship banner for the second time in seven years. It will be a ritual drenched in green and silver, an occasion of sweeping civic pride for one of the Cowboys’ fiercest rivals. For Dallas, it will be a reminder in 50ft letters: three decades have passedsince America’s Team last won a Super Bowl.And the contrast could not be sharper. For while the Eagles bask in another triumph and project the stability of an organization built for long-term success, the Cowboys stumble into the season diminished – having just traded away the one player who seemed capable of bridging the chasm between their glorious past and uncertain present.Micah Parsons was not just Dallas’s best defensive player; he was one of the league’s few genuine game-wreckers, a two-time All-Pro edge who made quarterbacks rethink plays before the snap. Yet after a contract dispute spiraled into acrimony and commanded the pre-season news cycle, Jerry Jonestraded Parsons to Green Baylast Thursday for two future first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark, a 29-year-old considered on the downside from his Pro Bowl peak.Parsons immediately signed a four-year, $188m extension with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Jones insisted he’d offered even more guaranteed money – andParsons’s agent, David Mulugheta, saysthe player’s first-choice was to stay in Dallas – but the squabble appears to have never really been about dollars. Jones had bypassed Mulugheta, trying to broker the deal one-on-one, as if his name and the star on the helmet were leverage enough. It wasn’t hardball so much as hubris:I’m Jerry, we’re the Cowboys, what more do you need?Parsons didn’t buy it, and now he’s gone.“FLEECED” trended on X within minutes of the news. Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst called it “a big swing”, likening it to Green Bay’s historic free-agent coup of Reggie White. In Dallas, the shock was more existential. Parsons had been the most dynamic Cowboy since DeMarcus Ware; now he was playing for another NFC contender, the collateral damage in a beef between Jones and Mulugheta.“I never wanted this chapter to end, but not everything was in my control,” Parsonswrote in a farewell message. “My heart has always been here, and still is.”View image in fullscreenMicah Parsons’ acrimonious holdout included the All-Pro edge rusher slumped on a training table behind the team bench during a preseason game while the team was on offense.Photograph: Sam Hodde/Getty ImagesJones, as ever, offered his own spin. He insisted Clark answered a “big concern” on run defense and compared the move to the Herschel Walker trade that had kickstarted the last Dallas dynasty in 1989. But the pitch didn’t land. Clark had been part of a Packers unit that finished in the bottom half of the league against the run last season. Dallas, with Parsons, had finished 28th in defense last year. Without him, they may soon redefine the floor.It was, in other words, the Cowboys distilled: a headline-grabbing transaction with no clear path to a championship. Jerry called it progress. The rest of the NFL chalked it up as another episode in the longest-running soap opera inUS sports.That has been the Cowboys’ pattern ever since their last title. From 1970 to 1995 they were the NFL’s dominant force, appearing in 14 NFC Championship Games and winning five Lombardi Trophies. Since then? Not one return trip to the last four, marking thelongest drought in the conference. They’ve had stars, hype and stretches of regular-season success, but every January ends the same way: with someone else lifting the trophy.Over that span, there have always been whispers that Jones, the omnipresent owner and self-appointed general manager, prized the headlines as much as the wins. In the early years, he at least denied it. But last month, at a premiere event in Los Angeles fora Netflix docuseries about the Cowboys, the 82-year-old seemed to give away the game.“I do believe if we’re not being looked at, then I’ll do my part to get us looked at,” Jonessaid. “The Cowboys are a soap opera 365 days a year. When it gets slow, I’ll stir it up. Oh, it’s wonderful to have the great athletes, have the great players, but there’s something more there: there’s sizzle, there’s emotion, and, if you will, there’s controversy. That controversy is good stuff in terms of keeping and having people’s attention.”For the NFL’s broadcast partners, that may read like a mission statement. For Cowboys fans who have waited since Biggie and Tupac were still alive for another parade, it felt more like saying the quiet part out loud.The last ride of the dynastyWhen Jones bought the Cowboys in 1989, the Arkansas oil wildcatter wasted no time making himself the story. He fired Tom Landry, the stoic fedora-wearing icon who had coached the team since its inception, and replaced him with University of Miami wunderkind Jimmy Johnson. Together they pulled offthe Herschel Walker trade: flipping their best player to Minnesota for a haul of draft picks that would become Emmitt Smith, Darren Woodson, Russell Maryland and other franchise cornerstones.Those Cowboys were an irresistible blend of talent and swagger. Quarterback Troy Aikman was a surgeon in shoulder pads, Smith the metronomic back pounding out yards with mechanical certainty with wideout Michael Irvin turning every catch into a street fight. From 1992 to 1995, they won three Super Bowls in four years, a volume of dominance unseen since Lombardi’s Packers.But even amid the confetti, there were cracks. Jones wanted his props not just as an owner but as a football architect. Johnson, who was doing much of the actual roster-building, bristled at the limelight-chasing owner elbowing in on the credit. After the 1993 season, Jones said that 500 coaches could have won with those players. Less than a year later, Johnson was gone.Smith’s contract squabble that same year also offered an early glimpse of Jones’s approach to standoffs with stars. Coming off consecutive rushing titles, Smith sat out the first two games of the 1993 season while seeking a new deal. The Cowboys lost both of thembefore Jones caved, signing Smith to what was then the richest running back contract in league history. Smith returned, was named the NFL’s Most Valuable Player that year and powered Dallas to two more Super Bowl titles. Jones has since pointed to that episode, and later holdouts by Zack Martin, CeeDee Lamb and Dak Prescott, as proof he can outwait any player at the bargaining table. The difference in 2025 is that his hard line with Parsons didn’t end with deescalation and resolution, but a trade that shipped the team’s best player to Green Bay.View image in fullscreenCowboys owner Jerry Jones, left, holds the Super Bowl trophy as he makes a comment to then-US president Bill Clinton during a 1996 ceremony for their Super Bowl XXX win.Photograph: Joyce Naltchayan/AFP/Getty ImagesMike Tirico, the veteran commentator who will call Thursday’s season opener in Philadelphia for NBC, was in his first year covering the NFL as a host or play-by-play man when Smith’s saga unfolded. “It was 32 years ago we did the first NFL Monday night pregame show on ESPN, and that was the Emmitt Smith holdout season,” Tirico said last week. “The Cowboys opened that season on Monday night, got blown out, lost the second game, and then Emmitt came back, and they were the first 0-2 starter to go win a Super Bowl. We’ve been down this road before [with Dallas]. But with Micah, it just feels like it has reached an even different level – with some direct animosity here.”Barry Switzer, Johnson’s old college rival, took over and immediately benefited from the roster he inherited. Dallas won again in 1995. It would be their last. The exit of Johnson wasn’t just the end of a partnership; it was the beginning of a demolition of a structure in which football decisions were made without Jones’s hand on every lever. The dynasty had been built on clear roles; from here on, it would run on Jerry’s terms.Cris Collinsworth, who will join Tirico in the booth on Thursday, reflected on the shift: “You look back on this team and where they were after winning those two Super Bowls, and obviously, the whole Jimmy and Jerry thing has been discussed for a long, long time. But it was really a unique opportunity for a lot of young talent, including young ownership, including a young head coach that could have gone on for a long, long time after that. They’ve been so close since – Parcells had them a fumbled snap away – but it doesn’t feel like they’ve ever quite recaptured the raw emotion of those early 90s teams.”Which is why the Parsons trade landed with such bitter irony. In 1989, Jones had traded a superstar and built a dynasty. In 2025, he traded a superstar and convinced no one that another was coming.From contenders to content millThe years after the last Super Bowl were messy on and off the field. The roster aged, the depth evaporated and the headlines got louder. In 1996,Irvin was arrestedfor cocaine possession in a hotel room with “two self-employed models”, a case that produced more tabloid column-inches than touchdowns. Switzer resigned a year later after being caught with a loaded .38-caliber revolver at an airport and overseeing a dismal 1997 campaign.Jones’s coaching hires shrank in stature. Chan Gailey, the former Steelers offensive coordinator, made the playoffs twice but left after two seasons. His most famous moment might behis reluctance to draft Randy Mossin 1998, a decision that haunted Dallas for years.Next came Dave Campo, a likeable defensive coordinator who had never been a head coach. Under him, the Cowboys went 5-11 three straight seasons, cycled through Quincy Carter, Chad Hutchinson and Ryan Leaf at quarterback, and traded two first-round picks for receiver Joey Galloway – a costly deal thathelped push Deion Sanders out the door.View image in fullscreenThe Cowboys’ extended slide from the NFL’s elite class to also-rans began under Chan Gailey …Photograph: Paul K Buck/AFP/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreen… and then Dave Campo.Photograph: Ronald Martinez/Getty ImagesBy the early 2000s, Dallas were stuck in an identity crisis. They still called themselves America’s Team, but the on-field product was unremarkable. What did sell, however, were stories: thechaos of the late-90s locker room, the nostalgia for past stars and Jones’s constant presence in front of a microphone. The Cowboys were drifting toward the “365 days a year” model before he’d ever put it in those words.The arrival of Bill Parcells in 2003 briefly changed the tone. Parcells, a Hall of Famer, reintroduced discipline – rookieshad to “earn the star”on their helmets – and constructed a top-10 defense. But quarterback instability hobbled the project. Carter was dismissed after failing multiple drug tests, quadragenarian Vinny Testaverde had a stopgap year under center, and a faded Drew Bledsoe couldn’t stop the slide.Then came Tony Romo. An undrafted free agent from Eastern Illinois, Romo seized the job in 2006 and immediately became one of the NFL’s most exciting quarterbacks. But his defining moment came that same season in a wildcard playoff game at Seattle: serving as the holder on a short field goal to win the game, he fumbled the snap and was tackled just shy of the goalline. The fiascowas replayed endlessly. It was the kind of viral heartbreak that keeps a team in the national conversation long after the final whistle – exactly the kind of drama Jones celebrates.View image in fullscreenTony Romo laments his fumble that cost the Cowboys a playoff win in a 2006 wildcard contest in Seattle.Photograph: Jonathan Ferrey/Getty ImagesJones doubled down by signing Terrell Owens, the league’s most combustible star fresh off a messy divorce with archrivals Philadelphia, in 2006. It made for gripping TV – sideline blow-ups,misty-eyed press scrums– but not sustained playoff success. A 13-3 season in 2007 ended with a home loss to the New York Giants, who went on to win the Super Bowl. In 2008, the regular season came down to a single game in Philadelphia where the winner advanced to the playoffs and the loser went home. The Eagles didn’t just win; theyobliterated Dallas 44-6, a stomping so memorable in Philly that it was scripted into the climax of Silver Linings Playbook.All of it was the kind of humiliation that, in the Cowboys’ universe, doubled as a content bonanza: shame on the scoreboard, saturation on the airwaves.By 2009, Jones had given his worldview physical form. AT&T Stadium – instantly christened Jerry World – opened in Arlington as the largest, most expensive football venue on earth, crowned by twin video boards the size of city blocks. A $1.3bn monument to the belief that sizzle matters as much as silverware, it was able to attract a Super Bowl, wrangle major prizefights away from Las Vegas, and even came within a hair of landing the 2026 World Cup final. The Cowboys have yet to reach a conference championship under its retractable roof, but that’s almost beside the point. With 100,000 fans crammed in and replays flashing in Imax scale, the building itself became the attraction: another reminder that for Jones, the spectacle has always been the product.But over the next decade, Manny Pacquiaowon more fightsin Jones’s personal coliseum than Dallas won playoff games. Jason Garrett took over midway through 2010, and the Cowboys entered a stretch of football purgatory: 8-8 in 2011, 2012 and 2013, each year losing a de facto playoff game in Week 17. They had talent – Dez Bryant was emerging as one of the league’s best receivers – but the defense lagged behind, and the January glory never arrived.The McCarthy era and the Netflix truthIn 2014, everything seemed to align. The offensive line was the league’s best, DeMarco Murray led the NFL in rushing, while the defense climbed into the middle of the pack. Dallas went 12-4, won a playoff game over Detroit and had a shot in Green Bay. On fourth down late in the game, Bryant made a spectacular leaping grab inside the Packers’ five-yard line – or so it seemed. After review, officialsruled it incomplete. “Dez caught it” became a rallying cry, a grievance, and another off-season content cycle.Injuries wrecked 2015, but in 2016 Romo’s back injury cleared the way for rookie Dak Prescott. Alongside fellow rookie Ezekiel Elliott, Prescott led Dallas to a 13-3 record and the NFC’s No 1 seed. Once again, it ended at hometo Aaron Rodgers and the underdog Packers, on a pinpoint sideline throw that set up a game-winning field goal.Garrett’s teams remained competitive but couldn’t cross the divisional-round barrier. In 2019, they outscored opponents by 113 points yet missed the playoffs entirely, a statistical anomaly tailor-made for sports radio fodder.View image in fullscreenThree of the Cowboys’ most brutal playoff losses in recent years have come against the Green Bay Packers, including twice at heavy favorites at home.Photograph: Michael Owens/Getty ImagesMike McCarthy replaced Garrett in 2020, bringing a Super Bowl ring from Green Bay and, briefly, an offensive renaissance. From 2021 to 2023, Dallas won 12 games each year, ranked among the league’s best defenses and saw Prescott post career numbers. But the endings were familiar: abotched quarterback drawwith no time left against San Francisco, another playoff loss to the 49ers, and finallya 48-32 home humiliationby Jordan Love’s Packers.Through it all, Jones never stopped feeding the content machine. Every draft pick, every coaching rumor, every sideline shot was part of the reality show. This year, hehired Brian Schottenheimerafter a conspicuously long search, a first-time head coach whose main qualification seemed to be keeping Jones’s power intact.Collinsworth, now in his 17th year as NBC’s analyst, sees a familiar ceiling: “I think about Mike McCarthy. Out of the five years, Dak Prescott has played three of them, and they won 12 games all three times. Dak was second in MVP balloting just a couple of years ago. If he’s right physically, if George Pickens offsets a little for CeeDee Lamb, and if that rebuilt offensive line with three No 1 draft choices can stay healthy, there’s an upside. But defensively, with the injuries and now without Micah, they’ll have to outscore people. The pressure is on the offense to carry this team.”The Jones ceilingThe drought in north Texas is no ordinary dry spell. The NFL is designed to pull everyone back toward the middle: the draft steers the best prospects to the worst teams, the schedule softens for those who struggle, the hard salary cap is built to prevent runaway dynasties and a system of revenue sharing fills everybody’s coffers. It’s baked into league’s business model: a kind of gridiron socialism meant to guarantee every city a turn at hope, keeping fans engaged, loyal and spending. In a system where even basket-case franchises usually cycle back into contention within a decade, the Cowboys’ 30-year exile from the NFC title game is less a slump than a defiance of elemental forces.The Cowboys’ problems go beyond the schematic. Former NFL guard Uche Nwaneri, who had a brief stint in Dallas, described a “circus environment” inside the facility: slogans about prestige on every wall, players treated as if they were defending champions in “an alternate universe”, even as the rest of the league saw a team with one playoff win in a decade.The Parsons debacle followed a familiar script: Jones overestimating his leverage, dragging out negotiations and miscalculating the market. He’d played the brinksmanship game before – with Elliott, Lamb, Prescott and others – only this time, the player walked.Jones even bragged to Irvin on a podcast that Parsons’s agent had told him to “stick it up [his] ass.” He insisted fans should “not lose any sleep” over a trade request. But in the end, it was Jones who flinched, sending away the Cowboys’ best player at the worst possible time. The hard, cold truth: for all the Netflix myth-making and “365 days a year” tabloid fodder, the Cowboys went to bed last Thursday farther from ending their 30-year Super Bowl drought than when they woke up.And yet, for all the stagnation, the Cowboys remain the NFL’s biggest draw. The America’s Team nickname, coined in 1978, has survived slumps, scandals and serial underachievement. The Thanksgiving tradition, the colossal screens at AT&T Stadium, the cheerleaders (afranchisein their own right), the coast-to-coast fan base – all of it feeds into the brand.View image in fullscreenCowboys owner Jerry Jones attends the premiere of Netflix’s America’s Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys at the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles this month.Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesAre they still America’s Team? Perhaps now more than ever. They’ve become the emblem of a fading empire, equal parts spectacle and self-delusion, the clearest distillation of US sports culture: a league where the scoreboard matters less than the stagecraft, whereForbes valuationsare bandied about unironically like championships, and where myth endures even when the trophy case gathers dust. The Cowboys are living proof that in American sport, myth can subsume commerce and culture can overwhelm competition. The dumbest timeline, rendered in silver and blue.Jones is both the architect and the ceiling of the Cowboys. His early gamble on Johnson produced a dynasty; his refusal to relinquish control has produced nearly three decades of almosts. The Parsons trade sharpened the paradox. It wasn’t a master class in negotiation but a reminder of Jones’s worldview: that being Jerry, and being the Cowboys, ought to be enough. For 30 years it hasn’t been.And as Thursday night will remind everyone, one of Dallas’s greatest rivals is now the one raising banners. For Eagles fans, it’s schadenfreude beyond a city’s wildest dreams; for Cowboys fans, it’s torment. For Jones, it’s another night in the spotlight, win or lose. The soap opera goes on. The sizzle remains. The silverware, not so much.Explore more on these topicsDallas CowboysNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Torre, citing legal documents, claims Ballmer employed Leonard for a non-existent role in one of his companies to circumvent the NBA salary cap, which punishes teams for spending too much on player salaries.Torre claims that Ballmer partially funded a now defunct tree-planting company called Aspiration. That company then allegedly entered into a $28m agreement with KL2 Aspire, LLC, a company owned by Leonard.Torre says he could find no evidence that Leonard had ever performed any work for Aspiration, and there was a clause in the contract between KL2 Aspire and Aspiration effectively allowed Leonard to be paid even if he did no work. Another clause said the deal would be voided if Leonard left the Clippers. One former employee of Aspiration told Torre he had heard the deal with Leonard had been set up to “circumvent the salary cap.”The Clippers and Ballmer denied the allegations in a statement released to Torre. “Neither Mr Ballmer nor the Clippers circumvented the salary cap or engaged in any misconduct related to Aspiration,” the statement said. “Any contrary assertion is provably false.”TheNBAinvestigated Leonard’s advisor, Dennis Robertson, in 2019 and found the Clippers had not granted the player any impermissible benefits when they pursued him in free agency. Leonard, a six-time All-Star, joined the Clippers in July 2019 after leading the Toronto Raptors to the NBA title.The NBA is yet to comment on Torre’s story, but has said in the past it would reopen the investigation into Robertson if new evidence emerged.Under the terms of the NBA collective bargaining agreement, the Clippers could be fined up to $4.5m for a first offense if they attempted to circumvent the salary cap. They could also be docked a first-round draft pick.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles ClippersNBABasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Fair to say the opening line of Three Lions ’98 hits a little differently in 2025. The crosses of St George are being daubed on an Islamic centre in Basildon. The crosses of St George are being used to deface a Chinese takeaway in York. The crosses of St George are draped over men shouting at a three-star hotel from a mini-roundabout. The crosses of St George are retailing for about £2.36 on Temu, depending on whether you want them car-window sized, or big enough to write the words “GET OFF MY LAND” in the white spaces.Keir Starmer has declared that he is “a supporter of flags”. Alas, at the time of writing the prime minister’s position on other items of tactile fabric remains unclear. What does he think about blankets? Does he endorse or condemn the dishcloth? Not to be outdone, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, disclosed that she has St George’s bunting on display at home. “I would put them up anywhere,” she confirmed, which – anatomically speaking – is not an image any of us needed right now.Tantrum transfers, hysteria and endless cash – but who won the transfer window? | Barney RonayRead moreNaturally it barely requires saying at this point that the recent wave of flag onanism is a thinly disguised trap laid by the resurgent far-right, a way of sneaking its toxic politics into our shared public spaces under the guise of broad-church patriotism. It’s just a flag. How can you get triggered by a flag? How can any right-thinking citizen possibly object to this most simple expression of collective pride? Albeit an expression largely being expressed by a few lone individuals in the dead of night, which is when all great expressions of collective pride traditionally occur.Into this stinking cheese dream of contested symbolisms, amateur semiotics and flag enemas stepThomas Tuchel’s England: refreshed and rebooted after their summer slump, facing games against Andorra this Saturday and Serbia next Tuesday.There are, of course, more banal sporting issues under scrutiny here. Can Elliot Anderson stake a claim in midfield? Can Tuchel find a less soporific way of breaking down a low block? And yet, at the same time, this is simply a very interesting moment for anEnglandteam to be taking the field under the England flag, with all its attached mythologies and meanings.Football has always been a reluctant participant in these conversations, and in particular English football, with its proud anti‑intellectual streak and reverence of the bottom line. After all, there are vibes to be maintained, disposable barbecues to be sold, pub gardens to be filled, Club Wembley corporate packages to be shifted. Far better to retreat into the usual bromides: no greater honour, play for the shirt, honestly thought it was a wind-up when I saw the number on my phone, and so on.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel (left) has suggested he would like to depoliticise the England team.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesTuchel, for his part, has made no secret of the extent to which questions of identity and symbolism and nationalism concern him, which is to say not in the slightest. On his unveiling he affirmed that he was a “head coach, not a manager”, signalled his distaste for “sport-politics”, even admitting that he could use his foreignness as a kind of impregnability cloak on such matters.And, you know, fair enough. Seen through Tuchel’s eyes, football – even international football – probably does feel like an entirely neutral space, a hermetically sealed world where the borders are fluid and the dressing rooms are polyglot, where everyone is rich and talented, where all the football pitches are the same and all the football pitches are good.But at the same time it is important to be clear what Tuchel is really saying here. What he is saying is that his England team will stand for nothing outside itself. It will play football, and you will watch, and it will try to win, and you will be happy or sad, and these alone are the ceiling and four walls of its ambition. Whatever you think of that as an ambition it is also a desperately tricky line to maintain, and not simply because, in football, politics has a habit of finding a path through even the most impermeable cracks.View image in fullscreenEngland flags adorn lampposts in Sheerness, Kent.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesFor if Barthes – Roland, not Fabien – teaches us anything, it is that the very act of trying to mean nothing is in itself a form of meaning. Perhaps this is doubly true in a pursuit as mass-cultural as football, a sport utterly in thrall to its mythologies, its symbols, a phenomenon being constantly shattered and re‑shattered in the sheer heat of its collective gaze. However thoroughly you try to strip it of meaning – the pointless friendly, the infinite content scroll, games slopped upon games – meaning finds a way.

Who gets to caption an England flag? The fan painting it on her cheek? The players walking out underneath it? The neo-Nazi plastering it on a zebra crossing at 3am? Certainly not the tortured and grimacing Starmer, a man who has outsourced his dinner to a focus group and is now being forced to eat the results, mumbling “I get it, I really do” as he chews unhappily on his meal of roast chicken, custard and Haribo bhuna.However reticent they may be to admit it, the England team that take the field on Saturday are not simply athletes with a goal but bearers of an idea. The flag under which they play is freighted with connotations and mythologies they did not author and in which they probably have no interest. Perhaps this has always been England’s original sin: the absence of that idea, empty and unfocused fervour as a substitute for thought.But the more we recoil from defining these symbols, the more vulnerable we are to having them defined for us. As the Lionessesdemonstrated so stirringly over the summer, Englishness as a trait need not be expressed in photographic negative. Like the Palestinian or Ukrainian or Pride flag, the England flag can be a reclamation of agency, a reassertion of our unity, diversity and shared values, a champion of the vulnerable, a rejection rather than an embrace of intolerance.And yes: it is tiring to have to keep having these arguments. It should feel depressing to have to restate the basic principles of our humanity, to debate those with no intention of listening, to be reminded over and over that international football is political by its very nature.To an extent this is simply a measure of the moment in which we find ourselves: a society stripped to a husk, hollowed and directionless, reduced to howling at symbols. But when the symbols are all that remain, they matter a great deal.Explore more on these topicsEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

After Aryna Sabalenk’s singles match ended in a walkover on Tuesday, Williams’s doubles quarter-final was bumped into primetime on Louis Armstrong Stadium to fill the hole in the schedule. And when Williams took the court with partner Leylah Fernandez in her black pleated dress and matching visor as the sun dipped toward the horizon, she looked for all the world like a woman determined to turn back time. Unfortunately for her, Fernandez and the throng that gathered to cheer them on, their opponents were keen to skip forward.Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend didn’t just cut the nostalgia trip short. Quite emphatically, they illustrated the difference between Williams and Fernandez, the doubles pairing out there for funsies, and themselves – the team that’s truly in it to win it. The top seeds’ beat Williams-Fernandez 6-2, 6-1 in just under just an hour. Siniakova and Townsend won all their service games, controlled the net and broke Williams and Fernandez at will – they beat ‘em up so bad they practically apologized for it afterward.In the post-match interview, Siniakova called it a “privilege” to play Williams, “a legend” she last played in 2017 – a second-round loss at the Canadian Open. “I remember I loved her back-out Reebok dress,” Townsend added. “That was what drew me to tennis. It was the cute outfits. Growing up watching Venus and Serena, [they] had always been, for me and my sister, an inspiration and we really wanted to be like them when we grew up.”Novak Djokovic sets up Alcaraz showdown after reaching 14th US Open semi-finalRead moreThere were no hard feelings on the other side. There never are with Williams, a trailblazer who still radiates with class and grace even at this intriguing late career stage. For hardcore fans who have been following the 21-time grand slam champion since the mid-1990s, the bonus time with Williams is something to savor because we don’t know how much longer it will last. Personally, I can remember covering this tournament 20 years ago when Williams used to talk about watching DVDs of the Fresh Prince to break up the monotony between practices and weather-induced match delays. “DVD?” she joked when I brought this up on Tuesday night. “I don’t know what he’s talking about. He’s older than me.”But she remembered. “My dad only let us watch educational programs growing up, so I never really got to see The Fresh Prince until I grew up. It was, like, major for me as a 20-year-old to watch that, but it never gets old.”No one could have known that that same Fresh Prince actor would play her father someday. “Will Smith is a legend,” she continued.” The fact that he did such an honor to play my dad, and he took it – you can’t understand how seriously he took it. He really put his whole life into it, and he got rewarded for it too. In turn, we all got rewarded for it. I have so much respect for him.”As for the casual fans born inthiscentury? Most have gone their entire life without seeing Williams make history at Wimbledon, grab the No 1 ranking and dominate the sport until her younger sister Serena snatched the baton. That Venus is even still out here grinding on the women’s tour at age 45 while Serena has settled into retired life as a mother of two and aSuper Bowl pop-outis striking. Big sister wasn’t supposed to be the one who switched off the lights.Venus’s unconventional relationship with tennis always made it seem as if she could take or leave the sport at any moment. She didn’t play juniors before turning pro at 14 and played the women’s tour at her own pace instead of to protect her ranking. Amid years of injury struggles, she has had to further contend withSjögren’s syndrome– a chronic autoimmune disorder known for its energy-sapping qualities.View image in fullscreenFans show their appreciation at Flushing Meadows.Photograph: Elsa/Getty ImagesThese days the ferocious power and court-covering elasticity are diminished to the point of leaving her struggling to survive the early rounds of tournaments. For this year’s US Open, she was lucky to receive a wildcard. (“I’m so thankful to the USTA for supporting me and my effort here,” she said after Tuesday’s match. “It would have not been possible without them and them believing in me to be out here.”) Ten, 15 years ago? She could have easily called time on her career with public support on her side. And had she done so, you can imagine the USTA struggling to choose between honoring her or Althea Gibson at this year’s US Open.Instead, Williams effectively kicked off the festivities on Arthur Ashe Stadium, the center court that has long beenhermain stage. She played mixed doubles with fellow American Reilly Opelka and hung with 11th-seeded Karolina Muchová for two hours until she lost that first-round singles match in three sets. Despite her impressive resume, Williams has never been a natural doubles player. As long as her sister was with her on court, she only had to cover the alleys, watch Serena serve and let their awesome tandem power take care of the rest.Leading up to the US Open, there wassome wishful thinkingthat Serena might come out of retirement to help a sister out. But ultimately it was Fernandez, the 2021 US Open finalist, who came to the rescue after the Canadian beat Townsend in July’s DC Open final – a victory that Williams says made her feel “so inspired”. It went both ways. “Seeing Venus playing on court for joy just kind of brought me back as to why I started playing tennis,” Fernandez said. ”It’s probably the most important thing is that I started playing tennis for the love of the game and for bringing joy on court, not only for myself but also for the fans.”At times, the contrast of Williams’s venerable eminence and Fernandez’s youthful exuberance made Williams look less like a peer to the 22-year-old than the rich auntie priming her for a high school tryout. But ultimately, they proved a formidable team on their own while vibing their way through the first three rounds of the doubles without dropping a set.Against Siniakova and Townsend, however, they were overwhelmed from the off and down 0-4 in 16 minutes. A 97 mph service winner from Williams stopped the bleeding for a moment and brought back memories of days when she could hit shots like that at will. ”I’m very proud that I stayed myself,” she said. “I didn’t try to play another game. I didn’t try to play it safe. I went for it, and that’s who I am. I go for it.” But for the most part, Williams and Fernandez’s stiff hands were no match for Siniakova and Townsend’s sharp-angled volleys.Afterward, Williams and Fernandez were first to concede that they weren’t in their element. “Leylah and I, we kept telling each other to be the best singles player we could be,” Williams said. “So our focus will always be singles. I’m not going to suddenly become a doubles player. I never did; I never will. It’s the singles for me.”When Serena neared the end of her incredible run, it took for ever for her to explicitly say the r-word – retired – much less concede she was no longer at her peak. But in Williams’s case, thethoughtof retirement doesn’t even seem like it’s entered her mind. If she has her druthers, you reckon she’ll keep showing up at tournaments and partnering with any top player who’ll have her – much like Martina Navratilova towards the end of her career – until, suddenly, she doesn’t.The real satisfaction in watching her now comes not in seeing if she can turn back time, but in how much longer she can stretch it. “I was never out of love with the game,” she said on Tuesday. “I never had to think about if I loved the game. I was always playing, so it’s part of my DNA. But clearly, like, to be out here grinding at this point, there has to be a little love, right?”Explore more on these topicsVenus WilliamsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After the start of the Vuelta a España’s 11th stage was the latest major cycling race to be disrupted by pro-Palestinian human rights protesters, race organisers took the decision to neutralise the finish as it became clear the finish line in Bilbao could be targeted.It was a call made to protect the safety of the cyclists but it also potentially denied a visibly frustrated Tom Pidcock a first stage win at the Spanish Grand Tour. The Briton attacked on the final climb and achieved the rare feat of troubling Jonas Vingegaard, the man in the leader’s red jersey, but the battle was not allowed to reach a proper conclusion.Jay Vine takes Vuelta stage 10 as Juan Ayuso attacks UAE team ‘dictatorship’Read moreThe Dane did get back in touch with Pidcock on Alto de Pike and the pair were pulling away from the other general classification favourites on the run into Bilbao when the stage was waved off.The riders were informed just after passing the point with 20km to go about the decision to halt the stage 3km out from the original finish line, but Pidcock was not aware of where that point was on the course and was still in race mode when the marshals flagged the leaders off.The Q36.5 ProCyclingrider gave a measured interview after the race, stressing that he “didn’t want to say anything political” but, having had to duck under a protester’s banner on the penultimate climb, he was keen to make the point about rider safety.“It’s hard to describe the disappointment,” Pidcock said. “I felt like today was my day. I feel like there should always be a finish line, we’re not riding a fucking sportive, are we? It’s not easy, the Vuelta did what they could to keep us safe.“A lot of people have held back from talking about it publicly but it is a bit scary sometimes in the peloton. I think as long as our safety is first then we can continue racing and that’s what we’re here to do. I think bike racing has got nothing to do with what is happening in other … yeah.”Asked if he had a message for the protestors, he said: “I think putting us in danger isn’t going to help your cause, that simply isn’t going to help what they’re protesting for. Everyone has the right to protest whatever they want – putting us in danger is not the way forward.”The main target of protest is the Israel-Premier Tech team, who were stopped last week during the time trial by activists holding Palestinian flags. A stage held in the fiercely independent Basque region ofSpainwas always going to be a potential flashpoint, with the local political party EH Bildu calling for Israel‑Premier Tech’s withdrawal from the Vuelta in the buildup.View image in fullscreenTom Pidcock  broke away in the final kilometres to come to the premature finish first.Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty ImagesThere have been reports that riders want Israel-Premier Tech to withdraw amid concerns over their safety, but no one has gone on the record with that demand. The Professional Cyclists’ Association released a statement after the disruption at the start of the stage, saying: “Everyone has the right to protest but this cannot be done at the expense of athletes who are doing their job.”Calling on the Spanish security services to do “everything in their power” to ensure rider safety, the CPA statement also said: “It is unacceptable that associations, whatever their nature or motivations, should allow themselves to compromise the safety and physical integrity of athletes on the road.“Cycling is a demanding sport that requires total dedication and superhuman effort from riders. They face extreme physical challenges on a daily basis, and it is unacceptable that external threats should add to these difficulties. The CPA will never tolerate irresponsible and dangerous actions by a minority that endanger the lives of our members.”GC times were taken at 3km from the finish and Pidcock did take two seconds off Vingegaard by coming over the top of Alto de Pike first. The British rider moved into the podium places as Norway’s Torstein Træen (Bahrain-Victorious), who started the day second, had been dropped earlier in the stage.Amid a week of brutal climbing for the peloton, the famous L’Angliru climb awaits the riders on stage 13 but before then Thursday features two categorised climbs, including the Collada de Brenes, a 7.7km drag at an average gradient of nearly 8%.Explore more on these topicsVuelta a EspañaCyclingSpainnewsShareReuse this content"

He’s been the best at handling that,” said McIlroy, who won his only Irish Open title nine years ago on this course. “He’s had to deal with it his whole life, whether it’s playing against an American in New York or playing against Roger [Federer] or Rafa [Nadal].“He came and spoke to us a little bit about that stuff last time in Rome, so maybe [it’s about] taking a leaf out of his book and channelling that energy the right way. All we can do is control our reaction and our emotions to it. I think the less we play into it, the better it is for us.”After Luke Donald made his six captain’s picks on Monday, meaning an unprecedented 11 of the 12 players victorious in Rome will head to the US, McIlroy said it was the “right 12 players”. And following a landmark year personally when he completed the career grand slam by winning the Masters, he is looking to surpass his own expectations.“Obviously I’d love to win this week, I’d love to win next week at Wentworth [the BMW Championship],” said McIlroy, who has signed up to captain a four-man team against the world No 1 Scottie Scheffler in theGolfChannel Games in December at Trump National Golf Club in Florida.“But if we were to win an awayRyder Cupwith everything else that I’ve been through this year, 2025 would be the best year of my career.”Explore more on these topicsRyder CupRory McIlroyNovak DjokovicGolfTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Spence was also loaned out at Middlesbrough in 2021 by Warnock, who warned him he could be playing non‑league football in five years unless his dedication improved.Ruben Loftus-Cheek ‘at peace with the past’ and savouring England comebackRead moreDoubts have fuelled the 25‑year‑old defender’s recovery. He would take added pride in becoming the first Muslim to play for the senior England team should he feature in the World Cup qualifiers against Andorra on Saturday or in Serbia next Tuesday.“I wouldn’t say I particularly have a list but I do have a mental note of people who doubted me, for sure, and it does feel good to prove them wrong,” Spence said.“I’ve always had that from a young age, from grassroots football to academy – if you’re going to stay on or get released or get your scholar [contract] – to being a professional. I’ve always had to fight for my position and deal with disappointment.”Spence had fun on social media with Warnock after winning promotion to the Premier League with Nottingham Forest, whom he had joined on loan from Middlesbrough, tweeting a photo of himself with the playoff trophy, smoking a cigar and tagging Warnock. He reprised the image after winning the Europa League last season.View image in fullscreenThe defender has now established himself in the Premier League but was sent on loan by Antonio Conte after joining Spurs.Photograph: Shaun Brooks/CameraSport/Getty ImagesBut there is no love lost between Spence and Conte. In 2022the then Spurs head coach head coach distanced himself from Spencewhen the defender arrived from Middlesbrough, calling him “an investment of the club” and someone “the club decided to buy”. Spence ended his first season as a Spurs player on loan at Rennes, his confidence shattered.He also spent his first season under Ange Postecoglou on loan at Leeds and Genoa, though insists he will always be grateful to Postecoglou because “he made me a champion” withthe Europa League triumph.“The biggest hurdle is when I signed for Tottenham and I didn’t necessarily feel the love straight away,” Spence said. His mum, Aisha, is an avid Spurs fan. “I was on such a high going into the club. I’d done really well, got promoted with Nottingham Forest. I am buzzing, I am going to sign for Tottenham. So to hear comments like that wasn’t nice. It does shatter your confidence a bit. I almost came crashing down because of comments from the manager and not playing. I was in a difficult space.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then I had the Euros that year [2023] with England Under-21s but got injured right before. I couldn’t make it to the Euros, which was obviously another disappointment because I would have loved to have gone and the boys ended up winning as well. Sometimes, in football when things go bad, they go really bad. That was a point in my career where it was really tough. But I am fighter. Fast forward, I am here now, so I am happy.”Spence’s faith has been important throughout the toughest moments in his career. His pride at being called up by Thomas Tuchel is matched by his amazement when informed he could become the first Muslim to play for the England senior team. “I did see something about that,” he said.“It’s a blessing, it’s amazing. I was surprised, really, first ever. If I can do it, you can do it. It’s [important] not just for Muslim kids but for any child of any faith.

The 2018‑19 season had been very good for him. The midfielder scored 10 goals for Chelsea and there was one game to come:the Europa League final against Arsenal. Beyond that, he had an eye on the Nations League finals with England and the chance to add to his 10 caps. Four of them had come at the 2018 World Cup in Russia; memories that will never fade. He was only 23. He was about to take the next step. And then it all fell apart.Loftus-Cheek is addressing the media at St George’s Park. He could be forgiven for pinching himself after being given an England recall on Tuesday as a late replacement for the injured Adam Wharton. Did anyone expect Thomas Tuchel to turn to him for the World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia? Did Loftus-Cheek dare to dream himself? His previous call-up had been in March 2019 when he was forced to withdraw through injury. The last of his capswas against USA in November 2018.‘I have a mental note of the doubters’: Djed Spence takes aim at Conte and WarnockRead moreLoftus-Cheek’s excitement is palpable. He has a new manager in Max Allegri at Milan, where he has played sincehis £15m move from Chelseain the summer of 2023, and plenty of new teammates after a busy transfer window including Luka Modric, Adrien Rabiot and Christopher Nkunku. Now this. But as Loftus-Cheek looks forward, it is inevitable that he also goes back – to the fateful game when everything changed.It haunted Loftus-Cheek for some time that it was essentially a nothing match, a post-season filler before the Europa League showpiece.Chelseahad travelled to the US for a charity engagement against the New England Revolution and it was there that Loftus-Cheek ruptured an achilles tendon. Physically, he says it took him between 18 months and two years to feel OK. Mentally, it was a nightmare.“It was definitely in my mind [that it was only a friendly],” Loftus‑Cheek says. “We had a European final a week and a half later and I’d played in the competition all the way through. It was very strange because I was feeling so good and so that stuff was playing in my mind about why it happened … why it happened at such a good point in my career. It did take a while to process, to get those feelings out. It was a very hard time.”Loftus-Cheek describes himself as being “at peace with the past”. He is calmer these days, more experienced. But it was certainly not easy to recast himself as anEnglandfan during his exile, following the team from afar as they reached the finals of Euro 2020 and 2024.“Being away from the squad for so long, you kind of get used to not going, even if you still want to push in club football to hopefully get a sniff,” Loftus-Cheek says. “I watched the finals at home with my family. It’s almost more nerve-racking watching on the telly than playing in those games for England so I hope I’m not watching another one.”Loftus-Cheek started to pick up the pieces after his achilles injury with a loan at Fulham in 2020-21, even if it was a struggle. When he returned to Chelsea, he ran into Tuchel, who managed him until the German’s sacking by the club in September 2022. While Loftus‑Cheek has played well for Milan, it is hard not to link his England recall to the connection he enjoyed with Tuchel at Stamford Bridge.View image in fullscreenLoftus-Cheek takes part in training at St George’s Park this week.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images“I remember when I went back to Chelsea, he spoke to me about playing right wing-back,” Loftus-Cheek says. “I said: ‘No, no, no.’ But I played there anyway.

Tuchel prizes Loftus-Cheek’s physicality but he also recognises the purity of his technique, the skills that Loftus‑Cheek honed playing in the cages of Catford, the south-east London neighbourhood where he grew up.“I’d never played that kind of wide position before,” Loftus‑Cheek says. “But he suggested that I’m a powerful runner and had the pace to play there [at right wing-back], the physicality to get up and down at speed. I ended up playing there quite a lot that season. I was happy to play the role and I actually started to do quite well in it. It was just the shock of the suggestion that was the funny part.“Since I’ve been at Milan, I’ve played a lot higher, closer to the striker. But under Thomas I played a lot more deeper, so I’m able to do that. With things that can happen in a tournament, being versatile is a good thing. I’m happy to play anywhere for the team.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersChelseafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Put simply, the head coach has too few homegrown squad members and too many who have come from elsewhere. He was always going to have to exclude six players from his 25-man “A” list.FA criticised for ‘obvious flaw’ in spot-fixing case of West Ham’s Lucas PaquetáRead moreThe others to miss out are James Maddison, who will be unavailable for the entire league phase of the competition with an anterior cruciate ligament rupture, the new signing Kota Takai and Yves Bissouma,who is out of favourand linked with a move to Turkey, where the transfer window will remain open until Friday of next week.It would have been a particularly difficult conversation for Frank to have had with Tel, who joined from Bayern Munich only in January, initially on loan – for which Spurs paid a fee of £8.7m.They paid a further £30m to make the deal permanent during the summer.The 20-year-old winger appears to have been a casualty ofthe deadline day loan signing of Randal Kolo Muanifrom Paris Saint-Germain, another non-locally trained player, who has been named in the squad.The Guardian reported last monththat Kulusevski was expected to be out until around the turn of the year after undergoing knee surgery in mid-May.

Its case centred on connections between the Brazilian and 27 of the 253 individuals who placed apparently suspicious bets on him to be booked in one or more of the four games, with combined bets of £47,000 bringing a profit of £167,000.The commission concluded there was no evidence of corruption and that the unusual betting patterns were more likely explained by the “rather random passing of ‘hot tips’ or perceived ‘inside information’ within Brazil than a spot-fix”.The three-person panel accepted Paquetá’s testimony that there was frequently talk of betting, including on the player himself, among his family and friends, and that it would defy logic for individuals involved in a spot-fix to be so “loose” with relevant information and tips. It also noted that the FA failed to find any mention of the case or any discussion of betting on two mobile phones belonging to Paquetá which it seized as evidence.View image in fullscreenLucas Paquetá (centre) training with Brazil this week ahead of their World Cup qualifiers.Photograph: Ricardo Moraes/ReutersThe commission’s report is particularly damning of the FA betting integrity investigator, Tom Astley, who was also the governing body’s chief witness. The failure to produce an independent assessment of the betting data is described as “surprising” and the commission noted that the FA appeared to contradict the statements of its main witness.Jonathan Laidlaw KC, the FA’s main prosecutor, disagreed with Astley’s description of the betting patterns as “highly orchestrated”, a difference of interpretation the commission concluded was concerning. “The clear appearance given to the commission was that the FA was not altogether certain what case it was presenting against the player,” it said.The commission reviewed bet‑by‑bet data for 33 individuals and concluded there was no evidence of a spot-fix. The report notes that the bettors did not place the maximum stake permitted, which would be expected if there were a spot-fix, and the fluctuating number of bets on each of the four matches was also interpreted as the bettors acting on tips rather than attempting a fix.Paquetá’s on-field performance was also analysed by the commission, with his former manager at West Ham, David Moyes, and the former referee Mark Clattenburg giving evidence on his behalf. Clattenburg described Paquetá’s on-field actions during the four matches as “entirely within the normal range of actions for this player”, and the defence team also produced evidence showing that the rate at which he received yellow cards remained consistent before, during and after the games in question, which took place in the 2022-23 season and at the start of the 2023-24 campaign.The commission also questioned the independence of the FA’s expert witness on performance, Jack Johnson of Stats Perform Integrity Services, because it has a commercial relationship with the governing body. Johnson was accused of “confirmation bias” for failing to consider Paquetá’s conduct in isolation from what he had been told about suspicious betting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The commission’s report reveals that Paquetá subsequently offered to answer any questions from the FA, only for it to decline to ask any.“The commission wishes to record its surprise that at the investigation stage of what were clearly serious matters … the FA were apparently not interested in what the player had to say, notwithstanding his stance, taken on advice, in the first interview,” the report says. Paquetá gave evidence at the hearing.View image in fullscreenLucas Paquetá has been one of West Ham’s key players during his time under investigation.Photograph: Dan Istitene/Getty ImagesThe FA has no plans to appeal. “The FA is committed to ensuring that the integrity of football is maintained, and full and thorough investigations will always be conducted into serious allegations of rule breaches,” it said in a statement.Alastair Campbell, a partner at the law firm Level and the head of Paquetá’s legal team, said on Wednesday: “The evidence not only showed he has no interest in gambling whatsoever, but confirmed that his integrity as both a player and a person is beyond doubt.“We are still making submissions in relation to the non-cooperation charge.

I wasn’t in a good place. It was about more than what happened in that match. There’s a lot that people didn’t and don’t know about.”Shaw is speaking for the first time about her decision towithdraw from Manchester City’s League Cup semi-final against Arsenalin February, four days after she hadsuffered horrific racist abusefollowing a4-3 loss against the same sidein the Women’s Super League. Manchester City said they were “appalled” and reported the matter to the police.“It was pretty scary to some extent,” adds Shaw, the WSL top scorer in the past two seasons. “But I’m lucky enough to have my family, my friends and those that care about me close. They’ve been there and supported me and helped me throughout that tough period.”The Jamaica international wants to see more done to protect players, particularly female players, who don’t have the same levels of security or representatives to run social media accounts for them as male players do.“There needs to be a lot more accountability as well because we can only talk for so much,” says Shaw. “We can do our actions on the pitch but if it’s the same cycle of abuse over and over again then they’ll feel they can always get away with it. We need the higher-ups to do something about it because otherwise year on year on year we’re going to see more of the same.”View image in fullscreenThe striker says ‘there was more to the abuse than what the majority knew’, but that the time does not yet feel right to reveal the details.Photograph: Andrea Southam/WSL/FA/Getty ImagesShaw, the human at the centre of the storm, is not ready to talk about the details of what she faced or where her head was at, and there should be no pressure on her to ever have to do so. Sitting at a table set up on the astro of City’s indoor pitch, Shaw shares the frustration that the onus is on her, orJess Carter, or other Black players, to speak up on racism. “It’s not right,” she says. “There was more to it all than what the vast majority knew and, when I have time and when it’s right, I’m definitely going to speak on it. For now I just want to focus on the season and the first game.”Ambitions for the new season are high. Last campaign, with a disappointing City side crippled by injuries and a little rudderless, Gareth Taylor was sacked on the eve of four back-to-back games against the eventual treble winners, Chelsea. City’s former manager Nick Cushing stepped in but they finished trophyless and fourth in the WSL table, one point behind Manchester United, missing out on Champions League qualification.View image in fullscreenShaw says the mood at City has been transformed by Andrée Jeglertz’s arrival as head coach.Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty ImagesAndrée Jeglertz, who was in charge of Denmark at the Euros, is the coach charged with guiding them through their next phase. Sometimes change, regardless of what it is, is needed. “100%,” says Shaw. “You find that we have energy we didn’t have before. For whatever reason, I don’t understand why. The energy has definitely been different and definitely been better, possibly because it’s new and we don’t know what to expect. That drives the training more every day.”The Swedish coach has been clear about what he wants to see. “He’s made it known from the get-go exactly what he wants from this group,” says Shaw. “He told us that he’s not trying to change us dramatically as players. We’re just trying to grasp the information and implement it as best as possible on the pitch to ensure when the first game comes, we are at least at a level to go out and perform at our best.”Shaw was one of the many City players sidelined last season, with a foot injury meaning she started only 10 league games. Despite that she shared the golden boot with Arsenal’s Alessia Russo, having scored 12 goals before her injury.“It was definitely my weakest season,” she says. “I started the season really well and unfortunately I had an injury that was out of my control, a fractured foot. Can’t really do much with that. I didn’t know I’d won the golden boot until the last day, on the pitch when they announced it, because that was nowhere in my thought. I was mentally not in a good place because I knew I couldn’t help the team the way I wanted to; as a player that’s what you want to be able to do, to be available for every game.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was tired. Come November I’d played every game, I was definitely tired. Physically and mentally it can be a lot.”Now, though, the 28-year-old is feeling refreshed going into the new campaign. “Body’s feeling good, I feel positive and mentally I’m in a good place,” she says. She is also looking forward to developing her on-pitch relationship with Vivianne Miedema, which was only glimpsed last season.“We spoke about it and I think we only played three full games together, which is crazy,” says Shaw. “We’re both in a good place at the moment, so it’s just about building now and then coming into the season, hopefully we’re ready.”The pair will strike fear into the heart of every defence in the league, starting with Chelsea in the WSL opener at Stamford Bridge on Friday. Shaw is dismissive of the narrative last summer that questioned whether they could play together. “I definitely say we can play together, I don’t know why people questioned who will start. Viv is not just a goalscorer, she can also assist goals, she likes playing in the No 10.”The goal this season could not be clearer: win the league. “It’s City we’re talking about,” says Shaw. “The ambition has to be there. It’s always fine margins. Two years ago we lost the league on goal difference. So it’s not like we’re far off.“No Champions League is the reality. We’re in this position, we have a game every Sunday and that game should be the most important and that’s how we’re going to attack each game. Ultimately we have no excuse to not go and win the league.”Explore more on these topicsManchester City WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballRaceinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Many supporters were resigned to at least one season in the cold after no arrangement to continue in amateur football could be reached, but they will now be able to watch their team again after a shock turnaround on Wednesday.The Arnhem-Leeuwarden court of appeal heard Vitesse’s case on Monday, with some experts suggesting the club had no more than a 1% chance of success. But it has suspended the decision of the KNVB’s licensing committee and appeals committee to withdraw the licence and ordered the governing body “to immediately re-admit Vitesse to professional competitions”.The ruling sparked wild celebration in the centre of Arnhem and at the club’s training ground. “I’m completely flabbergasted,” Susanne Wichhart, chair of the Vitesse supporters’ association, told the Guardian. “And happy of course. What a rollercoaster.”It is the latest astonishing twist in a long, complex saga that led to Vitesse losing their licence last month over what the KNVB’s appeals committee called “a multi-year pattern of deception, circumvention, and undermining of the licensing system, as well as a lack of transparency”. Vitesse had been docked 18 points during the 2023-24 season and wererelegated to the second tier. Further deductions meant they also finished bottom of that division last season.Vitesse may be best known to British fans through their previous close association with Chelsea, from whom they took a number of loanees in the 2010s. Mason Mount and Armando Broja are among those to have made the move. The KNVB began its latest investigation into Vitesse after reporting by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism in 2023, in which leaked documents appeared to show Roman Abramovich hadsecretly bankrolled the clubfor years while owning Chelsea.A subsequent attempted takeover by the American businessman Coley Parry was blocked by the KNVB. A local consortium named the Sterkhouders agreed a plan to save the club this year but it was viewed by the KNVB as insufficient to save them from being thrown out into the cold.Now Vitesse will plot their return to a second division that is already four games old. The logistics for their reinsertion remain unclear; in theory they may restart on 12 or 13 September, when the next round of matches takes place, but the task of raising a team looks severe. Many senior players departed amid the uncertainty, although their captain, the former Manchester United defender Alexander Büttner, is among those to have stayed on.“I have goose bumps all over,” Büttner told the local newspaper De Gelderlander. “People have worked so hard for this. I’ve seen so much pain in recent weeks. I always said I wasn’t leaving Vitesse. I could have gone to 10 other clubs, which were concrete. But I thought: ‘I’d rather quit football than leave now.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sign up now!Barry GlendenningWed 3 Sep 2025 11.07 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 11.48 EDTShareTHE LONG AND WINDING ROADConsidering Cymru head coach Craig Bellamy is so patriotic that he lives in a house constructed entirely of Fragrant Spring daffodil bulbs, thinks the long-running BBC soap opera Pobol y Cwm is a documentary and has Dafydd Iwan’s stirring anthem Yma o Hyd as his ringtone, it was no surprise he was impressed by thejourney undertakenby Wales fan John McAllister to get to his nation’s World Cup qualifier in Kazakhstan. Currently sitting second in Group J, a point behind North Macedonia but with Belgium three points further back with two games in hand, Wednesday afternoon’s match in Astana is a fairly must-win one for Wales. Anything less than three points would prove a crushing disappointment for McAllister, who set off for the Kazakh capital from Barry five weeks ago and has taken in 11 football matches, no end of foreign boozers, a heavy metal gig and some Irish stranger’s stag do as he travelled around 5,000 kilometres east across four time zones and 12 countries on a series of 17 trains, 11 buses and one plane (a flight he’d rather have not taken but was unable to avoid).“We’ve got to see him, because it means so much to us,” said Bellamy of McAllister’s bonkers odyssey. “I’m beyond proud of that fact.” While super-fan McAllister may kick himself when he discovers he could have just taken a direct flight from Cardiff to Astana like the Wales team, he is likely to receive a hero’s welcome from around 1,000 fellow supporters who took a far less circuitous and comparatively unadventurous route to Astana. “To see how they all get on with each other as well,” said Bellamy, beaming with pride at the devotion of his bucket hat-wearing brethren. “They look after each other, they’re well behaved but they enjoy themselves. We want to be like that, we want to play like that.” While Celtic’s Bigger Cup exit at the hands of Kairat Almaty last week proved that teams from far-flung European outposts don’t always have it their own way when they visit Astana, the current incarnation of Wales should realistically expect to beat a team 83 places below them in the Fifa rankings and one who they have already seen off in Cardiff. For the first time in 15 years, the Welsh team is also likely to be boosted by the rare inclusion of representation from Hollywood FC.“I think we’re all captivated by the journey of Wrexham,” trilled Bellamy of the plucky rag-tag assortment of churchmice and underdogs from the Racecourse Ground who spent over £30m on 13 players in the recent transfer window. “It’s been amazing for Welsh football and hopefully now in a number of years we’ll see young players coming through. Surely, whether it’s Swansea, Newport, Cardiff, Wrexham, the better they do the better chance we have of being a stronger nation in football.” While Danny Ward and Nathan Broadhead will miss out against Kazakhstan with knack, along with Leeds defender Joe Rodon, the in-form Wrexham striker Kieffer Moore is likely to feature and it is to be hoped the 6ft 5in target man was afforded plenty of leg-room on the eight-hour flight over.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although Djokovic found himself under constant pressure in his service games and at times was outplayed by his American opponent, he showed his peerless mental toughness by saving his best level for the most important moments as he eked out a victory in four sets.Auger-Aliassime comes from set down to beat De Minaur and make US Open last fourRead moreThe win set up another meeting with Alcaraz, the second seed and French Open champion, who eased into the semi-finals with a straight-sets win over Jiri Lehecka.“It’s not going to get easier. I tell you that,” said Djokovic, smiling. “Look, I’m going to try to take one day at a time. Really take care of my body. Try to relax and recover. The next couple of days is really key for me to really get my body in shape and ready to battle five sets if it’s needed. I just would really love that. Would love to be fit enough to play and to play potentially five sets with Carlos. I know that my best tennis is going to be required, but I’d rise to the occasion.“Normally I like to play the big matches on a big stage. It’s just that I’m not really sure how the body is going to feel in the next few days.“ But I’m going to do my very best with my team to be fit. There’s going to be a lot of running involved, that’s for sure. It’s not going to be short points.”At the age of 38 , Djokovic’s body has been a significant barrier to further success during an incredibly impressive season in which he has become the oldest man in the open era to reach the semi-finals of all four grand slam tournaments in a calendar year.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic had to call on the trainer during his defeat by Jannik Sinner in straight sets in the Wimbledon semi-finals.Photograph: Fred Mullane/ISI Photos/Getty ImagesThe Serb has struggled physically towards the end of each of his runs this year. At the Australian Open he was forced to retire from his semi-final match against Alexander Zverev because of injury and then he was clearly struggling throughout his straight-sets loss at Wimbledon to Jannik Sinner.On this occasion, Djokovic will at least have two days to recover before the semi-final. On Wednesday, while Alcaraz worked through a light, leisurely practice at around midday with his brother, Alvaro, as his hitting partner, Djokovic opted against taking the long trip to Flushing as he prioritised recovery over the benefits of another day on site.“The good thing about the schedule is I have two days without a match, so that helps a lot,” he said. “I don’t feel very fresh at the moment, but hopefully in two days it will be different.”With his win over Fritz, Djokovic has now registered three top five wins at the grand slam tournaments this year alone, also beating the No 3 Zverev at Roland Garros, and Alcaraz himself at the Australian Open, when the Spaniard was also ranked No 3, an immense achievement that underlines his status as the third best player in the world. Alcaraz, however, is now playing some of the best tennis of his career and he will be attempting to reach his third consecutive grand slam final and seventh grand slam final overall.After his defeat, Fritz noted that Djokovic will probably relish the challenge of facing Alcaraz and then potentially Sinner as he tries to win his record-extending 25th grand slam singles title.“I think it just depends how much this one took out of him,” Fritz said. “I really can’t speak for him. I’m not sure. But, I mean, I was really excited at the fact. I was looking at the draw like: ‘Oh, I will have the opportunity to do the coolest thing ever, play Novak, potentially try to go through Novak, Carlos and Sinner.’ I liked the challenge. I’m sure he – being the competitor he is – is very excited for that challenge.”Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Novak DjokovicUS Open tennisTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

In the model discussed on Wednesday, a 12-team County Championship Division One would be split into two pools of six, with the remaining six clubs in Division Two.At least 12 out of 18 counties must vote in favour to alter the structure of the Championship, which has led to a standoff. Surrey, Yorkshire, Middlesex, Essex and Somerset have publicly stated they will oppose any reduction to the 14-game season, while Derbyshire, Sussex and Kent are also yet to be convinced by the various alternatives offered to the status quo.The 10-strong advocates of a restructure are equally reluctant to back down, however, which led to more informal discussions between the counties on Wednesday over whether any of the previously rejected models can be revived. Those include three conferences of six, a single 18-team league with a Champions League-style Swiss-model fixture list, a midseason split similar to that of the Scottish Premier League, as well as several different variants of the current 10/8 divisional makeup.With 83% of players in a survey last year expressing concern over their physical wellbeing because of the volume of domestic cricket played, the PCA will continue to lobby hard for a cut. The possibility of a players’ strike has been mooted by some of the unhappy county executives, although that dramatic course of action has yet to be discussed in any detail.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For Clinton, personal terms are still to be finalised but she is scheduled to have a medical on Thursday.Both players were part of the Lionesses squadthat won Euro 2025in Switzerland this summer. Clinton, who has 16 senior England caps, was likely to leave United for free next summer if this move could not be agreed but the club have been keen to learn lessons from the past – the England stars Alessia Russo and Mary Earps left on free transfers in 2023 and 2024 respectively – and do a deal that appears to please all parties.Park has been with City for eight years, has 20 England caps and has scored three international goals, including the winner against the world champions, Spain, in a Nations League fixture at Wembley in February.The Women’s Super League transfer window closes at 11pm on Thursday and a large number of deals are being worked on, including several high‑profile and potentially big-money moves.View image in fullscreenJess Park played in 21 of Manchester City’s 22 Women’s Super League games last season.Photograph: Nick Potts/PALondon City Lionessesare understood to be close to signing the Spain youth international Lucía Corrales from Barcelona, after meeting her release clause of about €500,000 (£435,000).

While he’s beginning to catch up with Bolt’s times, the teenager is also catching up to the towering Jamaican in height.Gout’s running style has an uncanny resemblance to Bolt’s, with long strides and an upright stance supporting his ability to reach a high top speed, even if he continues to work on his starts.Gout Gout headlines record Australian athletics squad for world championshipsRead moreThere has always been a large difference between the pair’s heights, however. Bolt is 1.95m – or 6ft 5in – and had reached that mark by the age of 15. Gout has been slower to grow, but could still add more height to his gangly frame.The year 12 Ipswich Grammar student was measured at 180.3cm at the end of last year, but as he prepares to race at the World Championships in Tokyo he is now close to 183cm.His coach, Di Sheppard, had noticed the change earlier this year when returning from the Stawell Gift.“When we got out of the car and were walking in the airport, I turned around and I felt like I had to look up more. I looked at him and went, ‘you’ve grown’. He looked at me like, ‘yeah, right’,” the longtime junior athletics coach said.“I’ve never been wrong yet – even when mothers tell me they haven’t, I tell them to go home and measure their kid.”Sheppard wonders whether her star student can grow more, given his father, Bona, is still taller than him and he has unusually long arms.Sheppard has been cautious not to overload Gout’s growing body with too much strength work too soon, even if stronger legs will eventually mean faster starts.“We’ll move into that when we can add that with some power, so it’s not about really trying to force it, because, I mean, he’s 17 and he’s still growing,” she said.“It’s a step-by-step-by-step process, so when you hit one mark, [you say] ‘OK, we’ve got those, we can get out of the blocks in our first two steps’. We know his top end speed’s there, but you don’t drop that to work on this, you gradually improve this [his start] to match that [his speed].”Gout will make his debut for Australia’s senior national team at the 2025 World Championships, starting next week in Tokyo.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsGout GoutWorld Athletics ChampionshipsAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

We announced it in May. And for us, everyone is equal. Every woman here has to submit several documents, including the sex testing.”The World Boxing Championships get under way in Liverpool on Thursday and when asked if Khelif would have failed the test, Van der Vorst said: “It’s too early to draw conclusions. She has simply not entered on behalf of her own federation here in Liverpool.”The Algerian Boxing Federation has not responded to a request for commentOn Tuesday, World Boxing confirmed Taiwan’s Lin would not be competing at the world championships either. “I know that she also is not part of the entry list of the National Federation,” Van der Vorst added.The Dutchman had apologised in June when World Boxing specifically named Khelif in their announcement on mandatory sex testing. However, he defended the decision for such tests to ensure they had “safe and fair competitions”.“We are speaking not only about amateur boxing, but Olympic boxing. For us, that’s our brand, because that’s the ‘why’ of World Boxing. We established World Boxing in order to save the Olympic dream,” he said. “Boxing is a combat sport and it is important to have safe and fair competitions. So, for us, it’s really crucial to introduce this kind of testing. I think it’s an important step that we show that we want to protect female boxing.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingGendernewsShareReuse this content"

Four years ago, it feels like more, honestly,” he said. “It was a tough couple of years but it feels even better now to be back in the semi-finals.”US Open tennis 2025: Anisimova v Swiatek, Auger-Aliassime beats De Minaur on day 11 – liveRead moreHaving scaled as high as No 6 in 2022, Auger-Aliassime has struggled in recent years with a number of injuries and confidence issues, those difficulties underlined by his ATP ranking of No 27. This year, he could not find his level at the biggest tournaments, losing before the third round of the first three grand slams of this year. His final match before the US Open was a 6-0, 6-2 battering by Jannik Sinner in Cincinnati, a defeat that could have hurt his confidence.In New York, however, everything has fallen into place for the Canadian. Auger-Aliassime had followed up his excellent four-set victory against the No 3 seed Alexander Zverev with a dominant performance in his straight sets win against Andrey Rublev, the 15th seed. He has been playing great tennis, pairing his devastating serve, forehand and athleticism with greater patience and intelligence around the court.However, even when confidence is high, the stratospheric stakes of grand slam tennis mean it is not always possible to play well. Sometimes it is important just to survive. The two players entered Arthur Ashe Stadium fully conscious of the massive opportunity ahead. While this match-up presented De Minaur with his best opportunity to finally break new ground and reach his first grand slam semi-final on his sixth attempt, Auger-Aliassime is trying to find his way back after a turbulent few years with injuries and faltering confidence.View image in fullscreenAlex de Minaur has now gone out in the quarter-finals in five of his past seven grand slam tournaments.Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPAThis occasion made for a tense, tumultuous tussle where neither could summon their best level for sustained periods and momentum constantly shifted. De Minaur led by a break in the second set before immediately losing serve for the first time in the match, then Auger‑Aliassime failed to serve out the third set. It seemed like a fifth set was on the cards as De Minaur served for the fourth, but Auger-Aliassime instead dragged himself back into the match and closed it out in four.By the final stages of each set, with the pressure at its highest, it was Auger-Aliassime who served well under pressure and was determined to take control of the points against a struggling De Minaur.“Just a lot of nerves today through the whole match,” Auger-Aliassime said after the match. “It wasn’t pretty at all times but that’s what grand slam matches are. Sometimes, some days you won’t feel your best but I was willing to dig really deep and do everything I can to stay here, right now.”It has now been a full decade since Auger-Aliassime first showed his promise reaching the quarter‑final of an ATP Challenger event at 14 years old. As the first of the 2000s generation to make his move on the professional circuit, the hype was deafening. His career has undoubtedly been a massive success, and he has established himself as one of the best players in the world, but he wants more. This week represents a step towards the 25‑year-old living up to his enormous ambitions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Despite his growing frustration with his inability to reach a major semi-final, four of his previous quarter-final opponents were established top five players, with the No 1 Jannik Sinner most recently dismantling him at the Australian Open in January. The only anomaly, Jack Draper here last year, has since reached those heights himself.In contrast to the dominant performances he faced in his previous encounters, this time he found himself against a lower-ranked opponent who was unable to find his best tennis under such pressure. This time, he simply could not handle the pressure.“It is very tough when you have worked so hard for something and you constantly are putting yourself in positions to, in a way, prove people wrong, right? But yet again, you kind of fall, and especially this time, it’s a tough one to take,” said de Minaur.“There is no beating around the bush. It’s one of those matches that I would love to play again. There are other times that the opponent has a lot to say, and I have played quarterfinals where I played Jannik, and he was just too good, right, and there’s not really much I could have done. But I feel like this one was on my racket, and it is a shame. I don’t know how I’ll handle it. I’m definitely, as of right now, seeing red, but yeah, I’ll get over it. It’s just tennis, right?”Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Alex de MinaurUS Open tennisTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Wednesday marks the release of a new documentary podcast aimed at unpacking his remarkable ordeal.The Quarterback and the Con Artistrevisits Kramer’s victimization at the hands of Cortney Baird and also revives questions about the toll taken on the bodies and minds of American football players. Those renewed questions come after a man whoblamedfootball for giving him the incurable brain illness CTE fatally shot four people at the office tower which houses the NFL’s headquarters before killing himself on 28 July.‘On call for brain retrievals’: the man who gets American football players examined for CTE after deathRead moreThe 10-episode series alludes to neurological research establishing a link between the sport and the disease that can only be diagnosed posthumously. And at one point, the podcast host, Johnathan Walton, asks Kramer’s son, Dillon, “Do you blame CTE for what happened to your dad?”Dillon replies: “I definitely think CTE is the biggest contributor by far. I don’t think that he was aware of what was going on.”Kramer, 60,playedQB in the NFL in 10 different seasons mostly from 1991 to 1999 for the Atlanta Falcons, Detroit Lions, Chicago Bears and what were then the San Diego Chargers. TheLos Angelesnative is perhaps best known for teaming with the hall of fame runner Barry Sanders to produce the Lions’ only playoff win from 1957 through 2023. And in 1995 he also set single-season records for most passing yards and passing touchdowns for the Bears.Throughout those exploits, Kramer suffered from depression. And his condition took a turn for the worse when his 18-year-old son, Griffen, who grappled with substance abuse,diedunexpectedly in 2011. Things then darkened even more when – months later – Erik’s mother died from uterine cancer and his father was diagnosed with terminal, esophageal cancer.Kramer finally brought a gun to a southern California motel room and used it to shoot himself, thinking in his ill mind – as his essay put it – “all my problems would be over”. Miraculously, hesurvivedand had enough money from his NFL career to pay for the medical treatment he subsequently required. The self-inflicted wound left him with the mental capacity “of a six-year-old boy”, he wrote. He added: “I could not process complex concepts or decisions.”It was then that Baird reinserted herself into his life after the two had previously dated and broken up.What started with borrowing Kramer’s credit card for grocery runs while purportedly presenting herself as “a doting caregiver” steadily escalated into taking up to $700 from him for herself daily, costing him as much as $15,000 monthly, he wrote.Baird ultimately was brought to legal account after a childhood friend of Kramer’s became suspicious upon seeing packages from the online marketplace Amazon piling up outside his home. They were all addressed to Baird and paid for with Kramer’s credit cards.The friend, Anna Dergan, checked Kramer’s bank records and noticed daily ATM withdrawals totaling thousands of dollars, excessive credit card transactions and cash advances and forged checks, all of which thrusted Baird under suspicion. Kramer wrote there was evidence Baird had even drained Griffen’s memorial account.As Dergan called for authorities to investigate Baird criminally, the latter managed to marry Kramer in a courthouse ceremony to which none of his friends or family were invited. Kramer wrote that maneuver was a “checkmate move”, and the podcast explores how it hindered efforts to prosecute Baird for years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kramer says she alleged to authorities he had subjected her to domestic violence the same day he informed her of his desire to divorce, prompting news coverage about him that he condemns as “defamatory”. He has been fighting to correct the record ever since.Kramer finally succeeded in having Baird charged with a dozen felonies in 2020. She eventually pleaded guilty to theft, identity theft, forgery and dependent adult abuse – but only after Kramer was set back about $700,000. That figure also includes the court-related costs incurred as a result of his time with Baird and his push to get his marriage to her annulled.At an August 2024 sentencing hearing, Baird, 52, only received six months in prison followed by probation, partly because she came up with $170,000 in cash as restitution for Kramer, he wrote.Kramer said he dedicates most of his days since having wrested himself “from the clutches of a conniving con artist” to giving talks to various groups about mental health and the warning signs of depression. He said he grasps that he defied grim odds, with self-inflicted gunshot wounds making up only 1% of attempted, not completed, suicide attempts.So he said he has chosen not to be bitter about – and instead derive inspiration from – the events recounted on The Quarterback and the Con Artist, which is available on all major podcast platforms.“All of this made me realize the truth.

Bayern Munich’s opening weekend win over RB Leipzig raised the curtain on the new deal, with nearly 500,000 viewers watching along with Goldbridge.Luis Suárez spits on opposing staffer after Seattle beat Miami 3-0 in Leagues Cup finalRead moreMajor League Soccer is in the middle of its own streaming deal, but the league probably isn’t reaching such numbers for a single-game broadcast onMLSSeason Pass. While the league has been coy on viewership since saddling up with Apple TV two years ago, Don Garber recently put the average number of viewers per match at 120,000, considerably lower than the 343,000 average viewers MLS was reportedly getting per match on ESPN in 2022.Garber would, and has, argued MLS is now judging its viewership numbers differently. “The media and pundits just don’t get it yet,” the commissioner told Front Office Sports. MLS was on linear TV for years and was never able to leverage that exposure into anything meaningful. While MLS attendance figures are among the strongest in the world, the league has long struggled as a TV product. The 10-year, $2.5bn Apple TV deal was an opportunity to move the goalposts.In the time since MLS Season Pass launched, though, the broadcast landscape has shifted. Leagues are increasingly focused on drawing as many eyeballs as possible, wary of how disappearing behind a paywall can put them out of sight, out of mind. The Bundesliga clearly just wants to be seen, hence its deal with the (red) devil.Son Heung-min fever mounts in LA’s Koreatown as home debut approachesRead moreOf course, the Bundesliga’s hiring of a chuntering rage baiter is controversial, especially when the rage baiter in question once said “the German league is shit.” However, his audience of young, Gen Z fans is clearly hard to ignore, as is the fact YouTube boasts over 122 million daily active users. Unlike MLS, the Bundesliga has gone to where the audience already is; it hasn’t asked fans to come with them to a new (and niche) streaming service.The Apple TV deal has had some benefits for MLS. The league has, in a literal sense, never looked better. The Athletic reported that last season, no match was broadcast using fewer than 10 cameras. Whereas previously it wasn’t even a guarantee that matches would be broadcast in 1080p, now all games are bright and beautiful, albeit dependent on the strength of your wifi connection.For the fan who wants a broad view of the league, it’s handy to have everything all in one place. Gone are the days of frantically searching for a game before kick-off only to find coverage had been delayed due to a college basketball game that had overrun. MLS’s RedZone-style whiparound offering – MLS 360 – is also an entertaining, if slightly anxiety-inducing, watch every Saturday evening.In many other ways, though, MLS is handcuffed by Apple. Could MLS 360 ever be broadcast on YouTube, where so many live streams have found success? As long as Google is a direct competitor to Apple, it seems unlikely (even if highlights are currently uploaded to YouTube).Other leagues that have launched a streaming service of their own like MLS Season Pass have enjoyed some success. Most notably, Ligue 1’s new Ligue 1+ service attracted 600,000 subscribers in its first week, going a long way to reaching its target of one million by the end of the 2025-26 season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The English Football League operated a centralised streaming platform called iFollow for a number of seasons until Sky Sports took over rights last year.These, however, are leagues in countries where soccer is an easier sell, where the sports landscape isn’t as competitive as it is in the US. MLS isn’t just up against the Premier League and Liga MX and every other soccer league around the world, but the NFL, NBA, WNBA, MLB and NHL too – all of which have more linear TV exposure than MLS, and by a lot.The docuseries Onside: Major League Soccer was the league’s attempt at replicating Drive To Survive, which has been transformational for the fortunes of Formula 1. The eight-episode first season was interesting enough, providing a glimpse behind the scenes that did something to round out the likes of Riqui Puig and Pat Noonan as personalities.But with this too, MLS missed the boat. There’s a golf Drive To Survive. There was a tennis one too. Amazon’s All Or Nothing series has focused on several teams from the Dallas Cowboys to Manchester City and the Brazilian national team. Welcome To Wrexham has made an impact, turning a lower league Welsh club into a global brand, but countless other teams and leagues have chased the Drive To Survive effect without much success.While MLS’s deal with Apple TV once felt admirably radical, it has since fallen behind the curve. MLS Season Pass is essentially the same product now in its third season as it was on the day it launched, the only major differences being that some commentary is now done remotely (a downgrade) and the creation of Sunday Night Soccer (a welcome development).Some MLS clubs are so desperate to be back in the public eye that they have struck agreements with local networks to show matches on a tape delay. The league still has some linear TV exposure through a sub-licensing arrangement with Fox, but those matches often feel like an afterthought.Will we ever see, say, Soccerwise broadcast a live MLS match on YouTube like Goldbridge will for the Bundesliga 19 more times this season? Could MLS do anything more to plug itself into the vibrant online community around American soccer? Could it go where the fans already are?Maybe, but MLS needs Tim Cook’s permission first.Explore more on these topicsMLSBundesligaEuropean club footballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

When the matter returned to court the lawyer confirmed that the list had been prepared using legal software that utilised AI.He acknowledged he did not verify the accuracy of the information before submitting it to the court.The lawyer offered an “unconditional apology” to the court and said he would “take the lessons learned to heart” and asked not to be referred for investigation.He said he did not fully understand how the software worked, and acknowledged the need to verify AI-assisted research for accuracy. He made a payment to the solicitors for the other party for the costs of the thrown away hearing.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailHumphreys said she accepted the apology and acknowledged the stress it caused meant it was unlikely to be repeated, but a referral for investigation was important given it was in the public interest for the Victorian Legal Services Board and Commissioner to examine professional conduct issues, given the increasing use of AI tools in law.The lawyer was referred to the Victorian Legal Services Board for investigation, in what was one of the first reported cases in Australia of a lawyer being caught out using AI in court that generated false citations.The Victorian Legal Services Board confirmed on Tuesday that the lawyer had his practising certificate varied on 19 August as a result of the investigation, meaning he was no longer entitled to practise as a principal lawyer, not authorised to handle trust money, would no longer operate his own law practice, and would only practise as an employee solicitor.The lawyer will undertake supervised legal practice for a period of two years, with the lawyer and his supervisor reporting to the board on a quarterly basis in that time.“The board’s regulatory action in this matter demonstrates our commitment to ensuring legal practitioners who choose to use AI in their legal practice do so in a responsible way that is consistent with their obligations,” a spokesperson said.Since this case, there have been more than 20 other reported cases in Australian courts where lawyers or self-represented litigants have been found to have used artificial intelligence in the preparation of court documents that led to those documents containing fake citations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At first, I was served up joyful videos. Then the tone became much darker ...Kathryn WheelerWed 3 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTShareIdon’t remember where I was when myTikTokfeed showed me a video of a woman holding her stillborn baby, but I remember how I felt. At first, it appeared like any other video of a woman holding a newborn. It was tightly wrapped in blankets while she cradled it in her arms. She was crying, but so are most of the women in these post-birth videos. It wasn’t until I read the caption that I realised what I was looking at. Her baby had been delivered at 23 weeks. I was 22 weeks pregnant. I felt doomed.My social media algorithms knew I was pregnant before family, friends or my GP. Within 24-hours, they were transforming my feeds. On Instagram and TikTok, I would scroll through videos of women recording themselves as they took pregnancy tests, just as I had done. I “liked”, “saved”, and “shared” the content, feeding the machine, showing it that this is how it could hold my attention, compelling it to send me more. So it did. But it wasn’t long before the joy of those early videos started to transform into something dark.The algorithm began to deliver content about the things you fear the most while pregnant: “storytimes” about miscarriages; people sharing what happened to them and, harrowingly, filming themselves as they received the news that their baby had no heartbeat. Next came videos about birth disfigurements, those found by medical professionals early on, and those that were missed until the baby’s birth.One night, after a before-bed scroll delivered me a video of a woman who filmed her near-death childbirth experience, I uninstalled the apps through tears. But they were soon reinstalled, when the needs of work, friendships and habit dictated they must be. I tried blocking the content I didn’t want to see, but it made little difference.On TikTok, there are more than 300,000 videos tagged under “miscarriage”, and a further 260,000 under “miscarriageawareness”. One video with the caption “live footage of me finding out I had miscarried” has almost half a million views. Another showing a woman giving birth to a stillborn baby has just under five million.In another context, before I was pregnant, I would have found the content barrier-breaking and important. I don’t think the individuals who share such vulnerable moments are doing anything wrong. For the right person, it could be a lifeline. But it didn’t feel right in the feed of someone who had inadvertently signalled to the algorithm that they were having a baby.View image in fullscreen‘I “liked”, “saved”, and “shared” the content, feeding the machine, compelling it to send me more’ … Wheeler, while pregnant.Photograph: Courtesy of Kathryn WheelerWhen I talk about this experience with others who were pregnant at the same time as me, I am met with knowing nods and stories that match my own. I hear about how they were also served up personalised doses of fear, and how the algorithms evolved to target the things specific to them. Our experiences feel like a radicalisation, as normal worries were driven to new heights by a barrage of content that became more and more extreme. This is pregnancy and motherhood in 2025.“There are supportive posts, and then there are things so extreme and distressing, I don’t want to repeat them,” says Cherelle Mukoko, who is eight months pregnant. Mukoko mostly sees this content on Facebook and Instagram. She used to see it on TikTok as well, before she deleted the app. “My eldest is four. During that pregnancy, I came across upsetting posts on social media, some of them quite close to home, but this time it seems worse. The content feels more graphic and harder to escape.”Mukoko, 35, who is a woman of colour, has found that she is specifically shown content around the treatment of Black women in pregnancy.An analysis of NHS data in 2024found that Black women are up to six times more likely to experience severe complications during a hospital delivery than their white counterparts. “That hasn’t been my reality, but it does make me go into every appointment more cautious and on edge, wondering how I’ll be treated,” she says.“They really do instil fear,” she continues. “You start thinking: ‘Could this happen to me? Will I be in that unlucky percentage?’ With the complications I’ve already had during this pregnancy, seeing such negative things makes my intrusive thoughts spiral. It can leave you feeling resentful – you’re enduring so much already, and then on top of that, your social media feed is fuelling more anxiety.”For Dr Alice Ashcroft, a 29-year-old researcher and consultant who analyses the impact of identity, gendered language and technology: “It first started when I was trying to conceive. Seeing pregnancy announcements was hard. I also started to get a lot of ads for vitamins that would increase the chances of conception, but the reason I was struggling was an underlying health issue (a very rare blood disorder), so this was really hard to stomach.”Social media makes me feel lazy, useless, and inferior – even though I am going through the toughest time of my lifeIt didn’t stop once she was pregnant. “Towards the end of my pregnancy, we had some worrying scans at about 36 weeks, and I was looking at the web links suggested to me by the midwives. I’m not sure if it was the cookies I generated (which work as a digital footprint) or simply that the platforms I was engaging with knew I was in late pregnancy, but I started to see a large amount of content about late-stage terminations and miscarriages.” Her baby is now six months old.The ability of algorithms to target our most sensitive and private fears is uncanny and cruel. “I’ve been convinced for years that social media is reading my mind,” says Jade Asha, 36, who had her second son in January. “With me, it was all about body image: showing women at nine months pregnant still in the gym, when I hadn’t been able to do a 10-minute walk in months.Pregnancymakes my arthritis flare up. Even now, there are some days I can barely leave the house because swollen knees make it so difficult to walk.”Bottle-feeding her baby became another source of anxiety, says Asha. “My feeds would come up with posts about how breast is the only way, and a thousand comments of women agreeing. The problem with social media is that everyone is an ‘expert’ and so strong in their opinions that it can suck many others in.Social mediamakes me feel lazy, useless, and inferior – even though I am going through the toughest time of my life.”For Dr Christina Inge, a researcher at Harvard University specialising in the ethics of technology, these experiences are not surprising. “Social media platforms are optimised for engagement, and fear is one of the most powerful drivers of attention,” she says. “Once the algorithm detects that a person is pregnant, or might be, it begins testing content – the same as it does with any other information about a user. If a user lingers on an alarming video on pregnancy, even if just for a second, that is interpreted as interest. The system then feeds you more of the same.View image in fullscreen‘In the months since my pregnancy ended, the content on my feeds has shifted to the new fears I could face.’Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian“Distressing content isn’t a glitch; it’s engagement, and engagement is revenue,” Inge continues. “Fear-based content keeps people hooked because it creates a sense of urgency; people feel they need to keep watching, even when it’s upsetting. The platforms benefit financially, even as the psychological toll grows.”The negative effect of social media on pregnant women has been widely researched. In August, a systematicreview into social media use during pregnancyconsidered studies from the US, the UK, Europe and Asia. It concluded that while social media can offer peer-to-peer advice, support and health education, “challenges such as misinformation, increased anxiety and excessive use persist”. The review’s author, Dr Nida Aftab, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, highlights the role healthcare professionals should play in helping women make informed decisions about their digital habits.Not only are pregnant women more vulnerable social media users, they may also be spending more time scrolling.A study published in Midwiferylast year found there was a significant change in time spent on social media, frequency of use, and problematic use during pregnancy, all of which peaked at week 20. Additionally, 10.5% of the women in the study had a possible addiction to social media as defined by the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, meaning that social media had a significantly negative effect on their daily lives.Looking at the wider picture, Inge suggests several ways forward. Design changes could mean that platforms deliberately use positive, evidence-based content in sensitive areas such as pregnancy, health and grief. There could be more transparency around why users are seeing certain content (with an option to recalibrate when needed), and policymakers could put stronger safeguarding measures in place on sensitive topics.“Helping users understand that their feeds are algorithmic constructions, not neutral mirrors of reality, can help them disengage from the spiral,” Inge says. “Pregnancy and early parenthood should be protected spaces online, but they’re treated as just another data point to monetise.”For Ashcroft, the answer to the problem is complex. “One of the issues across the board is that the technology is developing at such a rate that legislation is slow to catch up,” she says. “But in this instance, I’m not sure where the onus lies. It could be on governments to legislate for accurate information on social media, but that sounds scarily like censorship. Some social media platforms are incorporating factchecking into their platforms with AI, but these are sometimes inaccurate and hold certain biases.” Using the “I’m not interested in this” feature could help, she suggests, “but even this will not be entirely successful. The main advice I would give is to reduce your use of social media.”At the start of the year, my baby arrived. She was healthy, and I could finally take a breath. But the relief was short-lived. In the months since my pregnancy ended and motherhood began, the content on my feeds has shifted to the new fears I could face. When I open Instagram, the suggested reels that now appear include: A video on “What NOT to do when your baby wakes up 20 minutes into their nap”; another of a baby in a carrier overlaid with the text “THIS IS REALLY NOT SAFE”; and a clip of a toddler with a piece of Lego in its mouth with the warning: “This could happen to your child if you don’t know how to act.”Is there a chance that this content makes me a better, more diligent and informed parent? Perhaps some of it does. But at what cost? The recent Online Safety Act has forced us to face our societal responsibility to protect vulnerable groups when they browse online. But as long as the constant, lingering threat of doom, despair and misinformation haunts the smartphones of new and expectant mothers, while social media companies monetise their fears, we are failing in this duty.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

While going viral seems risky, some find it opens new doors ...Sammy GecsoylerWed 3 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 17.37 EDTShareIn 2011, Joey La Neve DeFrancesco had been working in room service at a luxury hotel in Providence, Rhode Island, for nearly four years, whisking delicacies on demand to guests’ rooms, when he reached breaking point. He was paid a measly $5.50 (£4) an hour, made to work punishingly long shifts and, to top it off, had managers taking a cut of his hard-earned tips.The poor treatment ratcheted up after DeFrancesco and colleagues tried to unionise workers at the hotel. In response, managers would berate those involved for making tiny mistakes. Things got so petty that workers on shift who had to take calls from guests were banned from sitting down.DeFrancesco decided to call it quits. On the day he finally bid farewell, he snuck into the hotel’s employee quarters with a seven-strong marching band and surprised his boss with a musical ambush. “I’m here to tell you that I’m quitting,” he said, before walking out to the triumphant soundtrack of his band in full swing and chanting “Joey quits”.DeFrancesco, who was 22 years old at the time, hastily organised a friend to film the encounter. After sitting on the video for a few days, he uploaded it to YouTube where it quickly went viral. Thirteen years on, thevideohas amassed nearly 10m views.View image in fullscreenBrassed off … Joey La Neve DeFrancesco quits his low-paid hotel job in 2011.Photograph: Youtube“We really didn’t think it was going to get much attention,” says DeFrancesco. The 36-year-old labour organiser and musician, who lives in New York, says he felt “liberated” after he quit and turned the tables on his managers. “Now I’m going to embarrass you for treating everyone terribly here,” he says.Did leaving in a viral blaze of glory hamper his ability to get another job? Not in the slightest. Soon after leaving, DeFrancesco began working in a museum. He says the incident has “honestly never come up” in job interviews since. In fact, he says it might be something to “put on the résumé”.While DeFrancesco’s tale holds a strong position in the job resignation hall of fame, it faces increasing competition from a new generation of workers leaving their jobs with viral aplomb. The phenomenon of revenge quitting, where frustrated or unhappy employees show how they really feel about their workplaces, is on the rise. Even clergymen are not immune to such temptations: in July, Father Pat Brennanprovideda “parting gift” to his congregation in the form of a poem that doubled up as a resignation letter, where he took aim at “disgruntled, unlikable” parishioners who spread “gossip” from their “holy lips”.View image in fullscreenParting gift … Father Pat Brennan’s resignation letter.Photograph: FacebookTheemployer-rating site Glassdoorwarnedlate last year that “a wave of revenge quitting [is] on the horizon” in 2025 amid falling employee satisfaction. In the UK, a survey of 2,008 workers released in July by the recruitment company Reed found that 15% of British employees had revenge quit their jobs. The firm’s chair, James Reed reckons thatsocial media was accelerating the trendafter a flurry of revenge quitters shared their stories online. Brianna Slaughter was one of them, with their video ending with the rallying cry: “These corporations will fire you in one day and leave you with nothing. If you want to leave, leave babe.”The 26-year-old American, who lives in Kyoto, Japan, was two hours away from teaching their next English class when they quit on the spot. For a while, things had been manageable, but everything changed with the arrival of a meddling new manager. “If I finished a lesson one minute early or one minute late, she would reprimand me,” Slaughter says.When Slaughter started the job, they had plenty of free time and their colleagues were mostly “chill”, but the cracks soon began to appear. They were paid 2,000 yen (£10) per class, instead of an hourly wage, which meant having to stick around unpaid for hours between classes for a paltry paycheck. Schedules weren’t handed out until the day before, making planning almost impossible. And the job was sedentary, which took a toll. “I went to the doctor and they said, because you’re sitting all the time, you have inflammation in your neck,” Slaughter says.Slaughter’s breaking point came with the arrival of the new manager. She told Slaughter to wear long-sleeved tops to hide their apparently “offensive tattoos” and often sat in on classes, which, they say, made everyone feel “awkward”. It got to a point where Slaughter was crying every night. Last May, after receiving a measly paycheck of 100,000 yen (£500) for a month of “hardcore classroom teaching”, enough was enough.View image in fullscreen‘If you want to leave, leave babe’ … Brianna Slaughter on TikTok.Photograph: TikTokSlaughter sent a resignation letter to a higher-up, who “begged” them to stay, before swiftly reminding them of the two-month notice period. In their TikTokvideo, which has 1.2m views, Slaughter says they told their manager: “Two months? You’re lucky if I give you fucking two weeks. I gave you two hours, babe. I’m leaving now.”Far from stalling their career, their tale going viral opened up new possibilities. “I made $7,000 onTikTokthe month I quit,” says Slaughter, who has since made a living as a content creator, advising people interested in moving to Japan. Some even got in touch and said the video inspired them to say goodbye to their own toxic workplaces. “They said: I think I’m going to quit my job too. This was my sign.” For those still on the fence, Slaughter says: “You should have left yesterday.”Young people are more likely to revenge quit. Reedsaid26% of 18- to 34-year-olds and 22% of 35- to 44-year-olds in the UK admitted to doing it, compared with just 8% of people aged 45 to 54. In June, a survey by business research group the Conference Room found a 15% gap in job satisfaction between the youngest and oldest workers in the US, with 57% of under-25s saying they were satisfied with their jobs, compared with 72% of over-55s.Four years ago, 25-year-old Carly, who lives in Alabama, US, was unemployed, “kind of broke and willing to take anything”. After contacting a temp agency, she was quickly offered a job as a receptionist, based on her CV alone, and she was asked to start the next day. “That was the first sign that this might not be the best place to work but I was desperate, so I took it,” she says.The first three months were “fine” and she got a promotion to HR payroll manager, but things soon went south. A new colleague, who was related to the bosses, started badmouthing her and spread a false rumour that she was an alcoholic because she used a lamp in her office instead of the overhead light. “I just like ambience,” says Carly.She was soon given an additional role on top of her current one: accounts payable manager. “It was just too much for one 21-year-old to manage by herself,” she says. The firm briefly hired a man (who was paid $10 an hour more than her) to take over her role as HR payroll manager but he was swiftly fired after messing up the company’s paychecks. She was forced back into doing both roles again.“I was constantly stressed, upset, and crying,” she says. Things came to a head when Carly’s problem colleague called for her to attend a manager-wide meeting so he could “air out his frustrations” with her. “It was a ridiculous request,” she says. “He basically wanted to bully me in front of everyone.” She agreed to the meeting but, little did they know, she had other plans.On the morning of the meeting, Carly woke up early, drove to the office and scheduled an email to all the managers “letting them know how fucked up their business was,” she says. It began fairly graciously. “I have decided that it is time to move on to a different venture,” it said, but soon ramped up. She took aim at her short-lived replacement, calling him “literally dumb as a rock” and said her heavy workload led to “daily stress that often built up into anxiety attacks and tearful nights”. Signing off, it said: “My laptop and keys are on my desk.”After the email was sent, her boss tried to call her. She didn’t pick up the phone. “I never heard from them again,” she says. After Carly left the office for the final time, she felt euphoric. “I could have stripped my clothes off and run naked all the way home. The anxiety and stress I had been feeling all vanished,” she says.She secured another job shortly afterwards, but she has some concerns about applying for future work. “If they ask, I’ll just be honest and say, if you treat me good, I will not do that to you,” she says.While most people revenge quit to stick the middle finger to their bad bosses, warning off prospective new employees can also be a motivation. Katie Ostler had been working in a supermarket in Melbourne, Australia for two years when the time came to call it quits. She had started doing the job at 16 years old. “It was a really toxic, high-paced work environment and there was a lot of turnover,” she says.Ostler, who is now 29, and lives in Manchester, UK, said her bosses had not bothered to learn her name for the first six months. “It wasn’t a great place to be but I just kind of kept my head down and did what I needed to do,” she says.As she approached 18, a whole new set of job opportunities were opening up, specifically bar work. She was already handing her CV out to local pubs when an incident at the supermarket tipped her over the edge. One day, a customer began shouting at one of Ostler’s 15-year-old colleagues over a refund. Instead of backing up the young female employee, their manager took the side of the customer and joined in on the yelling. “I thought it was a good time to go,” she says.Soon after, she was offered a job behind a bar and went to the supermarket to hand in her resignation with the one-week obligatory notice. She tried to give the letter to a supervisor, who said it needed to be handed directly to her manager. Ostler asked where he was, but was told that he was in the middle of an interview. They let slip where it was being held. She barged into the interview, handed her manager the letter and said aloud: “Don’t work here – here’s my resignation.” The room went silent and the interviewee gave her a confused expression. “It took a lot of bravery. I walked out before [my manager] could say anything,” she says.It wasn’t the last she heard from him. She was on her way to start her new job when he called her and told her not to finish her final week because he “didn’t want my toxic energy” around the team. “I remember thinking, have you looked in the mirror?” she says. She did have to nip back to the supermarket for some groceries a few times afterwards. “I avoided it when I could, but people would recognise me and say hello. Unfortunately, no one was cheering when I came in,” she says. Still, resigning had felt triumphant enough. “I felt like a boss. It was a very empowering moment.”Explore more on these topicsWork & careersTikTokUS work & careersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A cooperative multiplayer adventure where players are let loose to explore an open world, I’m interested to see what emergent gameplay comes out of it. Could Big Walk allow for a kind of community archaeology with friends? I certainly hope so.When games use environmental storytelling in their design – from the positioning of objects to audio recordings or graffiti – they invite players to role play as archaeologists. Game designer Ben Espositoinfamously jokedback in 2016 that environmental storytelling is the “art of placing skulls near a toilet”–which might have been a jab at the tropes of games like the Fallout series, but his quip demonstrates how archaeological gaming narratives can be. After all, the incongruity of skulls and toilets is likely to lead to many questions and interpretations about the past in that game world, however ridiculous.I used to work as an archaeologist in the analogue world, where my work consisted of excavations, fieldworks and assessment of potential development sites across the UK. Now I’m doing a computer science PhD focusing in video game archaeology, where I get tocome up with novel ways to record gameplay experiences, like doing in-game walking interviews with players in the MMO Wurm Online, or recording the location of player messages in Elden Ring.Because I know what being an archaeologist entails, I often find myself thinking about games that just have you play as a person with that job title, such as Tomb Raider or Uncharted, versus those that have you engage in work similar to what we do in the field. Walking sims like Gone Home and What Remains of Edith Finch invite you to explore a space and interpret what all of the objects left behind in the landscape mean. Dr Melissa Kagen, assistant teaching professor in interactive media and game development at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, refers to this interpretive gameplay in walking simulators as “archival adventuring”.View image in fullscreenReady for role play … Outer Wilds: Archeologist Edition.Photograph: Nintendo SwitchIt’s not just walking sims though. There is a growing genre of puzzle games that I would argue also puts you in the role of an archaeologist, piecing together clues about the past from material remains and archival material. Some people refer to these games as “Metroidbranias”, but I’m personally quite fond of them. Essentially, “information games” (as developer Tom Francis calls them) require players to come up with theories based on the information they have, to in turn use those theories to acquire more knowledge. With its central mechanic of deciphering an ancient language, Heaven’s Vault is an obvious candidate, but I would argue that other information games like Return of the Obra Dinn, Her Story and Outer Wilds (which literally has a special “archaeologist edition”) also encourage you to role play as an archaeologist, searching for clues in the environment and past records.In my own work I investigate how to preserve contemporary games, as carefully as you would an ancient artefact. SoI’ve been thinking a lot about parallels in the game world too: how players record their own experiences through screenshots, map-making and diaries, and these are also methods used by real world archaeologists. Some games use these recording methods as central game mechanics. A great example is Season: A Letter to the Future, in which you document the world on the eve of its destruction in your journal.Gamesthat inspire you to take notes also arguably result in a record of the gameplay experience – a good example is 2025’s puzzle sensation Blue Prince, which explicitly encourages players to record anything interesting they see in each of the clue-filled rooms as they explore an ever-shifting estate.Rather than raiding tombs, if you want to be a video game archaeologist, look out for those skulls next to toilets. Better yet, record them. A future games archaeologist will thank you!What to playView image in fullscreenCompulsive and stylish … Shinobi: Art of Vengeance.Photograph: SegaWe’re seeing a lot of classic 80s arcade games being rediscovered at the moment, with Gradius Origins pleasing shoot-em-’up purists and Bandai Namco’s Shadow Labyrinth thrillingly reimagining Pac-Man.Next, here comes Sega withShinobi: Art of Vengeance, a compulsive and stylish adventure platformer based on its classic series of ninja brawlers.

In February, Xbox chief, Phil Spencer,told XboxErathat he was no longer looking to take gamers from PlayStation or PC. Three months later, the previously exclusive title Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was released on PS5, and Gears of War: Reloaded is also bound for Sony’s platform. Meanwhile, Sony has brought Helldivers 2 to Xbox and more titles are likely to follow, if arecently spotted Sony job advertis to be believed.Of course, cross play – the feature of online games such as Fortnite and Apex Legends which allows people to compete against each other whatever machine they’re using – started us off in this direction. Now, in an industry where smartphone gaming is dominating (figures by NewZoo indicate mobile games were worth $92.5bn to the global economy in 2024, compared to $50.3bn for console), and the idea of two games hardware titans expensively competing on proprietary tech and software exclusives seems increasingly anachronistic.And yet … Gamers are intrinsically territorial and always have been, while brand loyalty is a key facet of fandom (and, let’s face it, capitalism) – see also Nikon v Canon, Nike v Reebok or Android v iPhone. Tech specs are only ever part of these conflicts – style, image and identity come into play too. So don’t expect Xbox and PlayStation to, in the near future, become mere apps on a multitude of faceless platforms. Several battles may be over, but the war lumbers on.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterArchaeologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The lead character in Ghost of Yōtei is a wandering sellsword from a lowly family. Her sex and lack of status mean that, following the murders of her family, she has no fixed place in 17th-century Japanese society, and there is no permitted path for her to tread if she is to get revenge on the Yōtei Six, the men who killed her loved ones. As the game’s co-director Nate Fox puts it, “Atsu is not somebody who walks in to a room and people pay respect to.”Yōtei’s predecessor, Sucker Punch Productions’ 2020 sprawling open-world gameGhost of Tsushima, is the story of a samurai, Jin Sakai, who shreds his honour to defend his homeland. Jin can’t repel the Mongols attacking Tsushima as a noble warrior, but as “the Ghost”, a fear-inspiring legend willing to use any dirty tactic to gain the upper hand, he can. If Ghost of Tsushima is about a man grappling with the trade of one kind of power for another, Yōtei sees Atsu seize the only power she can with both hands.View image in fullscreenPeak of achievement … Ghost of Yōtei.Photograph: Sony Interactive EntertainmentAtsu adopts the mantle of anonryō, a revenge spirit from Japanese folklore. By embracing this legend, she becomes a figure of fear to her enemies. While the resulting game is similar to Tsushima – in Ghost of Yōtei you also travel across a romanticised open-world recreation of feudal Japan on horseback, carving up your enemies with precise strokes of your katana – the shift from high-class samurai to vagrant sellsword shows itself in unexpected ways.“She has a different life than Jin, and we want to bring that out through interactivity,” Fox says. That means removing Ghost of Tsushima’s contemplative moments, such as those during which Jin would meditate on his surroundings and transform his struggle into haiku. “Jin was a scholarly samurai; he would pause to reflect and take in the beauty of nature. Atsu is not that person.” Those moments softened the rough edges of Tsushima, a mellowing that Sucker Punch doesn’t want to apply to the feral world of Yōtei. Atsu doesn’t write poems; she collects bounties as she hunts down the warriors that stalk Hokkaido.Sucker Punch also expresses the difference in protagonists with a subtle innovation for open-world games: a movable campsite. “We like creating features that are tonally supportive,” Yōtei’s other game director, Jason Connell, says. “Camping is something you would expect in a world like this.” And Fox adds, “Atsu’s a sellsword used to sleeping rough”.Ghost of Tsushima review – Kurosawa-inspired samurai showdownsRead moreAs game worlds have expanded and the numbers of questlines and upgrade trees have multiplied, it has created a barrier of administration between players and the worlds they’re exploring. Instead of moving on foot, they use fast travel to warp between markers on the map. “It’s discordant,” Connell says. One moment you might be in a tropical forest fighting mercenaries, the next you’re on a mountaintop upgrading a weapon before hopping to a beach to deliver a quest item. Atsu’s camp is Sucker Punch’s attempt to redress this disruption and wrap the world around the player. Quest givers, shopkeepers and key characters will now visit you, providing a way to continue your journey without interrupting the flow of the story. “It’s a convenience,” Connell says, “and a more diegetic experience.”In this way, Yōtei is set to be both an evolution of Ghost of Tsushima and an inversion. Set 300 years after the first game and on the other side of Japan, with the player wearing the sandals of a character from the opposite end of society, it promises to be a familiar world filled with unexpected change.Ghost of Yōtei is released onPlayStation 5, on 2 OctoberExplore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsPlayStation 5PlayStationAction gamesAdventure gamesFighting gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Good news if he used his influence with Trump to terminate this obscenity. Dreadful news if he were to be party to it.The plan itself wasfirst outlinedto an incredulous world by Trump in February. The details havenow emerged. It involves the expulsion – the de facto imprisonment – of 2 million Palestinians, while the US administers the exclave for 10 years. Each Palestinian would bepaid $5,000 each plus four years’ rentsomewhere else and one year’s supply of food. Gaza is then rebuilt as a skyscraper wonderland of artificial intelligence investment and tourism. It would be a second Dubaiyielding up to $400bnfor developers.The scheme’s private contractors would be the same “humanitarian” trustnow supplying foodto the famine-hit territory. Trump said that the Palestinians would be better off “living beautifully in another location”. The Americans might one day see a “reformed and deradicalised Palestinian polity … ready to step in its shoes.” It is inconceivable that the plan would be deemed acceptable anywhere, apart from in Israel.All parties to any war have a moral obligation to plan for its aftermath. As the principal sponsor of Israel’s reaction to the Hamas atrocities of October 2023, the US is now party to the destruction ofover 90% of Gaza’s built environmentandthe killing of 63,000 of its inhabitants. As moral obligations go this must border on unprecedented. But when Israel eventually occupies all of Gaza, it and the US will doubtless claim victors’ rights to do as they please.If morality might have been off the agenda at Blair’s White House meeting, the question is: was reality present? There are plenty of possible futures already being mooted for Gaza. They includeone backed by Egypt and the Arab League statesfor its $53bn reconstruction. Another might be a reversion to the 1993 Oslo settlement, which has been periodically undermined by Hamas and Israel. Another might conceivably include some coalition of Palestinian and Israeli development interests under Israeli control.No realisable plan can involve the mass clearing of any land of its historical population and its theft for colonisation by an alien power.Gazacould never be a second Dubai. It would be an embattled ruin plagued by factionalism and terror. For 10 years Washington would be responsible for an embattled building site, until it got bored and left it to its fate, as it did Saigon, Baghdad and Kabul.The United States may be the world’s most successful state but its attempts at imperialism have been dismal. The first was in the 1900s when Teddy Roosevelt approved the takeover of the Philippines andcoveted parts of the Caribbean and Latin America. Attempts to police the world have constantly led to mission creep into prolonged bouts of intervention. General MacArthur almost succeeded in invading China during the Korean war. Having a global presence went to the head of George HW Bush in Kuwait, when he declared a‘new world order’under American control. He generally acted in keeping with his army chief, Colin Powell’s, later warning that “if you break it, you own it” but he still invaded Somalia.His son, George W Bush, followed his foreign policy adviser Condoleezza Rice’s plea that America’s armed forces not be used as “a global police force. They are not the world’s 911 [call centre]”. Bush agreed until al-Qaida’s 9/11 attacks had him and his neocon colleagues itching for war and nation-building. In Iraq he promised to deliver a democratic Iraq, greater American influence in the Middle East and settlement of the Israel-Palestine conflict. America for a while “owned” south Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq and, for a brief while, Lebanon, all at horrendous cost and loss of life. In every case, the gulf between the stated goal and its realisation was enormous.Noninterventionism has a long and respectable history in the US. Every president toys with it until the trumpets of glory and the sheer power at their disposal summons them to war. The most recent and near hysterical anti-interventionist was none other thanDonald Trump. His hostility to Nato collectivism, his tariff wars and turning against Ukraine, demonstrated a near-obsession with detaching the US from the world’s ills. Not for him the Kennedy/Johnson mission to liberate the world and bring “freedom”.As recently as last May in Saudi Arabia, Trump excoriated “so-called nation-builders [who] wrecked far more nations than they built … intervening in complex societies thatthey did not even understand themselves.”He told his Arab audience that the Middle East had been created “by the people of the region themselves … pursuing your own unique visions and charting your own destinies.” At the time he was arming Benjamin Netanyahu to the teeth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We all deserve betterWed 3 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 07.18 EDTShareIn a recent podcast conversation, the former spokesperson for Jeb Bush sat down with the leader of the HouseDemocrats. Guess which one of them endorsed the Democratic candidate for mayor of New York?“I was a Republican up until two minutes ago and I’m a capitalist, and I had Zohran on … it’s not really a close call, is it?” Tim Miller said toHakeem Jeffrieson hisBulwark podcast, to which a defensive-sounding House Minority leader replied: “What I can say is that he’s the only one I’m scheduled to talk to.”Timeandtimeagain, Jeffries has refused to endorse his own party’s official candidate for mayor in his own city, two months afterZohran Mamdaniwon the Democratic mayoral primary in New York bydouble digits– including Jeffries’ own congressional district byeight points.This is the same Democratic party leader who has insisted in the past that progressives should “vote BLUE (no matter who)”. But centrists? Apparently, they’re under no such obligation.Jeffries is not alone in his brazen hypocrisy.Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader who represents the state of New York and lives in the city of New York, has alsorefused to endorsehis own party’s official candidate for mayor of New York.If you want to understand why the Democrats are polling at theirlowest pointfor more than three decades, look no further than these two uninspiring Democratic leaders in Congress.If you want to understand why 62% of Democratic voterssay“the leadership of the Democratic party should be replaced with new people,” again, look no further than Jeffries and Schumer.Democrats can win in 2028. But we need to oust corporate candidates first | Alexandra RojasRead moreWeek after week, month after month, they embarrass themselves, undermine their colleagues and demoralize their voters. Theirs is a record of cowardice and capitulation.Let’s start with Jeffries. In February, the hapless House minority leaderwondered aloud: “I’m trying to figure out what leverage we actually have. They control the House, the Senate. And the presidency. It’s their government. What leverage do we have?” It was a shrug of impotence; a sign of pre-emptive submission only weeks after Trump’s inauguration.That same month, just days before Bernie Sanders began his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour in front of packed arenas across the country, Jeffries “quietly met with more than 150 Silicon Valley-based donors … in tony Los Altos Hills”, reportedPolitico, in order to “mend fences” with the billionaire big tech bosses.In April, when Democratic members of Congress such as Senator Chris Van Hollen and Representative Maxwell Frost were visiting El Salvador and raising the issue ofKilmar Ábrego García’s detention, theBulwarkreported: “The minority leader has discouraged further excursions to the country” (reporting that Jeffrieslater denied).Subsequent pollingsuggests those trips helped change public opinion on immigration and, especially, on the fate of Ábrego. Jeffries, though, can claim no credit for that shift in American sentiment.In June, in the wake of the Trump administration’s decision to file ludicrouscharges of assaultagainst the Democratic congresswoman LaMonica McIver after a protest outside an immigration detention center, the dead-eyed Jeffriesappeared on CNNwith host Dana Bash.BASH: You previously warned that the administration charging members of Congress was a, quote, ‘red line’. What are you doing now that the red line you talked about has apparently been crossed?JEFFRIES: We will make that decision in a time, place and manner of our choosing. But the response will be continuous, and it will meet the moment that is required.BASH: What exactly does that mean? Have you not decided how to respond?JEFFRIES: We will respond in a time, place, and manner of our choosing if this continues to happen.Bash looked bewildered. And we’re now coming up to three months since Jeffries made those bizarre, tone-deaf remarks. Has the time not arrived yet? Has he still not found the place?Last month, Jeffries refused, again, to endorse Mamdani but then went further,telling CNBCthat Andrew Cuomo’s baseless attack on Mamdani’s rent-stabilized apartment was a “legitimate issue” and that his campaign was “going to have to address it”. Can you imagine a Republican leader in Congress going on live television to throw their party’s mayoral candidate under the bus in this way?Jeffries has become almost a parody of a weak, spineless Democratic leader. When he was asked recently about Trump’s fascistic deployment of troops to the streets of Washington DC, his response was to praise the DC attorney general’s “strongly worded letter”.Jeffries has become almost a parody of a weak, spineless Democratic leaderWell, you know who else likes to bring a “strongly worded letter” to a gunfight with Republicans? Yep. You guessed it. Chuck Schumer. The Senate minority leaderbragged to CNNearlier this year about how he had reacted to Donald Trump’s attack on US universities by sending him “a very strong letter just the other day”.To be clear: Schumer’s record on resisting Trump and fighting back against his authoritarian takeover of the US government has been as feeble and feckless as Jeffries’.Remember thatcringe chantof ‘We will win’ and ‘We won’t rest’ that he led outside the Treasury building in February, as Elon Musk’s Doge teams rampaged through the federal government?Or when he shamefullybacked downfrom a confrontation with Trump over a government shutdown in March and earned the scathing soubriquet “Surrender Schumer”? (One anonymous House Democratjoked at the timethat the Senate minority leader’s popularity was “hovering somewhere between Elon Musk and the Ebola virus”.)How about when hetold NPRthat same month that accusing Israel of genocide – now the view of77%of Democratic voters – was antisemitic, or when hedeclaredto the neoconservative Brett Stephens that his job was “to keep the left pro-Israel”?Who can forget also hishawkish denunciationof “Taco Trump” in June for not being “tough” enough on the “terrorist government” of Iran, just weeks before Trump illegally bombed Iran?Step back and take it in: the US is entering full authoritarian mode | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreIt makes no sense to me that Schumer is still the leader of the Democrats in the Senate. The partylost the upper chamberon his watch, under his leadership, but Schumer chose to stay on and his colleagues let him. But when you lead your party to defeat in an election, shouldn’t you …lose your job?As for Jeffries, the Democrats may win back the House of Representatives next November on the back of an anti-Trump wave, but what then? What vision will aSpeakerJeffries offer? What resistance will he provide to the wannabe dictator in the White House? What actual plan does he have to preserve and protect democracy in 2028?Since Trump was inaugurated for a second time in January, Jeffries and Schumer have demonstrated time and again that they are not built for this particular moment. While Trump seeds the ground for an American dictatorship, these two top Demspine for bipartisanship. While millions of rank-and-file Democrats across the country say they want leaders who will fight, Jeffries and Schumer fold. While younger Democrats like Mamdani and AOC offer energy and charisma, these two lackluster leaders in the House and Senate offer cringe chants and evencringier photo ops.It is past time for both Jeffries and Schumer to step down and step aside. This fascist moment, this age of Trump, demands outspoken, unrelenting and fearless opposition.

This outcome was better than expected by most economists and, if you’re a glass half-full type of person, you would have been happy to see that the economy has picked up its pace from a very lacklustre performance in 2024.However, while we economists may be very excited to dig down into the “national accounts” stats on such thrilling concepts as per capita gross domestic product (GDP), the implicit price deflators and fixed capital formation, you may well be asking yourself what on earth does any of this have to do with me?Sign up: AU Breaking News emailWell, quite a lot, as it happens. These figures not only tell us how well, or otherwise, we are doing as a nation, they also point to the quality of that growth. Are we growing just because there are more people buyingmore Labubus? Or are we creating greater national worth for each of us (as measured by per capita GDP) because more of us are being more productive?A new report highlights the staggering truth about wage inequality in Australia. Here’s what we need to do better | Nicki HutleyRead moreWhen growth is purely population-driven, it’s like an empty sugar hit from a soft drink. We use up precious resources without making anyone better off.The latest figures tell us that the economy may be growing, and at a faster pace in nearly two years, but that is largely because population growth means more people are buying stuff. Put another way, the economic pie is growing, but so too is the number of people who need to share it. Our living standards, as measured by per capita GDP, did creep up a teeny bit in the June quarter, but we are still worse off on this measure than we were in June 2022.There will be some people who will tell you that no growth is in fact the best thing for our planet. There’s no doubt that it would be far better if statisticians could incorporate measures such as environmental health, carbon pollution and wellbeing into our economic report cards. But it is naive to think that zero growth wouldn’t have dire consequences, particularly for the most vulnerable in our society who rely on government spending. When the economy stands still, or even shrinks, so do government coffers and their ability to fund support programs and infrastructure.You can see how economists have a way of turning good news into bad – no wonder economics is known as the dismal science.But back to this week’s news. The national accounts also give us the valuable information on how our economy is shaping up in response to international and domestic trends. This, in turn, has potentially important ramifications for monetary policy, that is, how theReserve Bank of Australiasets interest rates. And, let’s face it, we are all pretty obsessed with interest rates these days.In the case of international trends, Donald Trump’s tariffs haven’t marred our export performance, at least for the moment. And in the case of domestic trends, the RBA’s first two interest rate cuts in this cycle have seen households more willing to open their wallets than they have been for a long time. With more recent data showing that consumers are becomingless pessimistic, if not yet optimistic, the RBA will be watching this space closely. Should consumers lift spending too rapidly in coming months, this could put upward pressure on prices, limiting the potential for further interest rate cuts. You can see how economists have a way of turning good news into bad – no wonder economics is known as the dismal science.Over the past year or so, the government has been the main driver of economic activity. Indeed, Australia would have beenin a recessionlast year had the government not jumped in to support the economy with a wide range of additional spending measures including on health, energy supports, and childcare. However, that level of spending was never going to be sustainable, and we are now seeing state and federal governments investing less in major projects as well as pulling back on their regular spending.6:19Rare earths: how these critical minerals impact Australian industry and global politics – videoBut we need more business investment, not just consumer spending, to really lift our longer-term living standards. When measured as a share of the overall economy, business investment accounts for a little less than 12%, and it has been inching lower over the past 18 months. Back in 2012, that figure was 30% higher. Not exactly a recipe for the productivity and “growth mindset” that the government warns we desperately need, but at least the latest figures show productivity moving in the right direction.Overall, I would give Australia’s latest economic report card a score of B-. It tells us that spending is shifting from the public to the private sector, which is good news but, even as growth picks up, we are falling short on business investment and productivity growth. We certainly warrant an “improved performance” stamp on the card, but we are still a good way off from “excellent”.Nicki Hutley is a consulting economistExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyOpinionBusinessReserve Bank of AustraliaCost-of-living crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

Voters have more enthusiasm for radical policies than we give them credit forWed 3 Sep 2025 12.05 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 12.09 EDTShareWhat risk could the election ofZack Polanskias leader pose for the Green party? That’s what journalists wondered aloud on one current affairs format after another, on Tuesday evening. Would he alienate the party’s new-found Tory switchers, conservationists who’d given the party a chance after a decade of disaffection with their tribe? Surely, by peeling off the leftwing elements of the Labour party, Polanski was simply strengthening Reform, whose path to victory through this division would be assured?Polanski is sometimes described, per his own self-fashioning, as an “eco-populist”, but more often called the “left” or “hard-left” candidate, which I don’t think anyone would quibble with, though the fact that hisvictory Instagram postlanded as soon as he won points to a new kind of hard-left, one that has its shit together. I use that, rather than a milder phrase, to echo Polanski himself – whether he’s talking about sewage in the waterways, the cost of living crisis that hasn’t gone away, or British arms sales to Israel, he doesn’t say “parlous”, he says this is “shit”. Sometimes the mystery of why party members vote for the values candidate over the putatively electable one is not that mysterious: maybe rightwingers aren’t the only people yearning for someone to stand up and talk normally.Straight talking is valorised on the right, and generally deplored on the left. A hardline anti-immigration candidate is “charismatic”, a hardline anti-corporate one is “divisive”. It makes no sense at the level of the vocabulary – very few of us feel an emotional allegiance to corporations. It would be extremely hard to divide a community by slagging off Thames Water. Of immigrants, the opposite is true. Communities, even individual families, are riven when human beings are spoken about with contempt, and yet somehow that’s charisma, fun, music-hall politics. Stick around, folks, and see what Richard Tice will say next: he might do it in song. The double standards in reporting on the left and right are so well-worn it’s a bit tedious to mention. It’s also deeply understandable. The foundational assumptions about the British electorate are so far off-base, the fallacies can only be upheld by language that says the opposite of what it means.TheGreen partydid not win those Tory defectors by feinting to the right. Its 2024 manifesto, complete with wealth taxes, rent controls and multiple, radical proposals about the decent treatment of refugees, was easily as leftwing as Jeremy Corbyn’s 2019 equivalent. And even if the Greens had been going for a coalition in the last election, between the humane, Caroline-Lucas left and the tribal but bee-loving right, four MPs is probably just about all such a fragile alliance would ever yield.Reform, meanwhile, does not draw its strength from infighting between the centre and the left; rather, it’s maximising the opportunities presented by a centre that promises a better, fairer Britain and then spends its entire first year drawing up austerity 3.0. This is unfolding before our eyes; all we talk about is how high Nigel Farage is riding, and this is after five years of the Labour party expelling its left wing members and the Greens keeping their heads down. Exactly how quiet does the left have to be before this infighting theory can be laid to rest?Even if that classicWest Wingargument – pipe down, idealists, in case the electorate hears you and the bad guys seize the advantage – still worked, having been superseded by 30 years of events and never having worked in the first place, I’d still be a bit hazy on its directives. I’ve never seen it on any political hero’s tombstone: “First you say nothing, then you compromise, then you continue to say nothing, then you win.”Responses to Polanski’s leadership campaign showed just how much even those on the left had internalised these impossibilist arguments. I heard disaffected Labour members wondering whether to join the Greens to get him over the line; post-match analysis about where he’d gone wrong before the match had even taken place; people bemoaning the timing, relative to Corbyn and Zarah Sultana’s launch of Your Party, fearing that the two projects would somehow suck the energy from one another, having duplicated their offer without thinking through the electoral consequences. It’s a sidebar to Polanski’s success, but relevant, that Your Party seems to be working on the basis that the groundswell of radical energy during Corbyn’s first tenure was an event so freakish that it could only be replicated by the same conditions: Corbyn, his exact same team and his magic beans.Even people who solidly shared Polanski’s politics were preemptively dismissing him because of his colourful past as a hypnotherapist – detailed ina story from the 2010sin which he was apparently touting hypnotherapy as a useful tool in breast enlargement. Even though I have heard first-hand how that story came about – a Sun journalist fishing for a silly season story, a possibly too polite and definitely too gullible Polanski going along with it – I accepted it as a block to his political ambition. All the talk – which was not off the record, exactly, except insofar as there is almost no mainstream record of where leftwing people talk to each other – was of how he might possibly edge a win over his more plausible opponents, as if Green members were broadly similar to BBC commentators, pragmatists with a sprinkling of extra climate anxiety.In the event, of course, he won the leadership by a landslide. What it means for the Greens, electorally, is probably not the doom-loop pollsters predict; and what it means for the left more broadly is that it might be time to have more confidence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another the flank, and thinks of pillows and comfort. Another the tusk, and perceives danger.The March for Australia’s racism can’t just be blamed on far-right ‘extremists’ - it has been enabled by the mainstream | Liam GillespieRead moreWhen they compare notes, they can’t believe the other’s account to be genuine. They suspect the others of delusion, or even of lying.Some of the obvious signs and symptoms of racism are a subjective experience, so we often find it hard to agree on the nature of the problem, let alone tackle it.This might go some way to explaining why, after the disturbinganti-immigration protests on the weekend, we can’t agree on what they mean and whether racism was at their core.In this age of misinformation, even the numbers of protesters are not agreed. Elon Musk, a metaphorical blind man if ever there was one,shared a post on Xwhich claimed it was 150,000 in Sydney and Brisbane. Police say it was closer to 21,000.Evenimmigration numbershave been misreported. The spurious claim that 1,500 migrants arrive every day in Australia was used by 2GB Radio host Ben Fordham, among others, to suggest the “March for Australia” protests were being held as a response to legitimate concerns about housing, rather than motivated by racism. But the figure he used is wrong, as the Australian Bureau of Statistics has beentrying to make clear.Meanwhile,Andrew Bolt on Sky News Australiabangs the same drum. He asserted that while there were a minority of racist “morons and thugs” at the protests, it was “defaming some good people” to claim that racism was the prime motivation.Australia has a long history of this kind of defensiveness and denial.When ABC journalist Laura Tingle stated at the Sydney writers’ festival that Australia was a racist country, it caused an outrage. The Australian newspapereditorialisedthat she had demonstrated “loathing for the country the ABC is funded to serve”.I never thought my race would be under scrutiny here. After the March for Australia protests, how do I feel safe? | Jafrin KabirRead moreBefore that, Stan Grant got into trouble for commenting, during the ABC’s coverage of King Charles’s coronation, that the crown represents the invasion and theft of land from Indigenous Australians.For this he was mocked and abused. And yet,as he pointed out, Australia is the only Commonwealth country not to have signed treaties with First Nations people. “We cannot live in the fantasy Australia that pretends we have transcended this history,” he said.Further back, there were the 2005 Cronulla riots, which radio shock jock Alan Jones helped to incite by describing Lebanese Muslims as “vermin” who “rape and pillage a nation that’s taken them in”.The then prime minister, John Howard, declined to describe the Cronulla riots as racist, and has more recently held to his assertion that there is “no underlying racism in Australia”.How can it be that we have such different understandings of our nation? What hope is there of improving when we can’t even acknowledge verifiable facts, such as statistics, let alone more rubbery concepts such as the boundary between xenophobia (fear of difference and of strangers) and racism, or the boundary between criticism of Israel and antisemitism?Racism is defined by the Australian Human Rights Commission as “the process by which systems and policies, actions and attitudes createinequitable opportunities and outcomes for people based on race”.On that definition it is surely impossible not to recognise that Australia has underlying issues with racism. Yet, many things can be true at once. Australia was founded on racist assumptions. Yet it is also held up as a successful multicultural society.Those facts sit together, and in tension.Insurveys of nationsaimed at discovering which are most racist, Australia usually comes upcomparatively well– not that there is any room for pride or complacency.We don’t have a legal system of apartheid, yet race is embedded into the constitution in section 51, which gives parliament the power to make laws for “the people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws”. This clause is the legacy of a perceived need to protect the white population from low-wage labourers from south-east Asia.Pastsurveysshow that about 41% of us believe Australia is weakened by people of different ethnicities “sticking to their old ways”. About 20% believe African refugees increase crime in Australia. About 54% of those who speak a language other than English at home report workplace racism.I have a friend, born in India, who is a medical professional in a public hospital. Almost daily, she finds patients reluctant to be treated by her, because of her race.Anti-immigration rallies and the rise of neo-Nazis - podcastRead moreIs this xenophobia, or racism, or is it a distinction we should not worry about, rather focusing on the experience of the victim and the impact on the prejudiced patient and the system as a whole?The eminent sociologist Andrew Jakubowicz has answered the question about whether Australia is racist by saying we are a country with a racist history, endeavouring in many ways not to have a racist future.It is an optimistic take. It is certainly true that racism in Australia is hardly new. To that extent, the weekend marches should not surprise us.But optimism for the future can’t be justified if we flinch and defend every time someone points out the problem.It would be great to think we had a media and a politics capable of navigating and illuminating these complexities and ambiguities. The likes of Bolt and Fordham make us weaker.

This show of solidarity and strength, he complained, was nothing less than an attempt to “conspire” against the United States. Trump likes military parades – his own, that is. Even more, he likes to be on the podium, at the centre of attention. He casts himself as world number one. The images coming out of the Chinese capital this week challenged him on all three counts.This puncturing of Trump’s insecure ego, and the striking feebleness of his response, will greatly gratify Xi. Trump’s behaviour towards China since taking office in January has been aggressive, vindictive and patronising by turns. Hispunitive trade tariffs, in particular, have caused unprecedented disruption. Though the worst of the levies are paused until November, they help explain Xi’s repeated insistence China is a proud nation that will not be bullied. At the same time, Trump has talked vaguely about offering a face-to-face summit, as if bestowing a great gift. Parading the Beijing triumvirate was Xi’s pointed riposte.Even by Red Square standards, the Chinese president’sostentatious displayof military might was impressive. The pageantry, anthems, immaculately synchronised, goose-stepping soldiers, tanks, artillery pieces – and even the release of 80,000 bewildered doves – all spoke to China’s rapid advance towards global military parity with Washington. Most worrying for the US navy patrolling the western Pacific was the unveiling of hypersonic, nuclear-capable, long-range missiles and underwater drones. China was “unstoppable,” Xi declared. In marking the end of the second world war, “humanity is again faced with the choice of peace or war, dialogue or confrontation, win-win or zero-sum,” he said. This, too, was an unmistakeable warning aimed at Trump. Whether he heeds it is another matter entirely.For all the trumpets and bayonets, Xi’s overall purpose in orchestrating this grand political and diplomatic, as well as martial, performance was to project China’s future global leadership role, as envisioned and shaped by himself. This is what Xi has been working towards ever since he rose to the top of the Communist party pile in 2012. He hascentralised controlto a greater degree than any leader since Mao Zedong, whose often disastrous leadership he reveres. Criticism of Xi’s missteps – and there have been many, over economic management, jobs, a property crisis and corruption – has brought ever tighter restrictions on corporate, media and personal freedoms. As a surveillance state, China is unquestionably world number one. Xi’s foreign policy, notably towards Taiwan and across the South China Sea region, is fiercely expansionist.By gathering dozens of national leaders, first at last weekend’s biggest-ever annual conference of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) – a potential Eurasian EU equivalent – and then in Beijing, Xi set down a marker whose significance will reverberate far beyond the White House.By their presence, the leaders of Turkey, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Iran and many other actual or would-be rising powers kowtowed to Chinese power. Even India’s leader, Narendra Modi,alienated by Trump’s tariffs, played along, minimising longstanding rivalries with China. The SCO’sjoint declarationin effect endorsed a new, emerging global security and economic order that challenges the post-1945 settlement, directed and dominated by Beijing. It was the latest, triumphalist assertion of Xi’s vision of China as pre-eminent 21st-century power.Little wonder Trump was put out. Yet who would seriously disagree that it is his foolish, provocative antagonising of friends and foes alike with his refurbished, multifaceted brand of neo-imperial US overreach that has induced so many countries to throw in their lot with China? That said, the assumption that the Beijing alliance, with the Xi-Putin-Kim triumvirate at its heart,can hold together long-term, and find constructive, nonmilitary ways to cooperate, is highly questionable.Putin needs Xi’s help right now with Ukraine, but Russia has a historical, visceral fear of Chinese expansionism. North Korea’s Kim – whose regionally destabilising behaviour and perpetual impecuniousness worry Beijing – likewise fears Chinese domination. Or look it another way: both Putin and Xi are in their 70s. They will not be in charge for ever. Their rule is highly personalised. Absent them, in both countries, vacuums beckon. The potential forexplosions of dissent, currently repressed, is massive.Theirs is a three-way partnership of expediency, lacking ideological, intellectual or moral underpinning. They are united in opposition to American hegemony, to a western-dominated financial system based on the dollar, to what they regard as noisome universal standards of human and civil rights. They are all antidemocratic authoritarians to their very marrow. In other words, like hard-right populist demagogues in the US andEurope, they know what they don’t like.Whether they know how to replace that which they would destroy, whether they have any viable, credible idea of alternative global structures that reaches beyond mere national self-interest and political, personal advantage is doubtful. Given the choice, many middle-ranking countriesmight well driftback into the US orbit, if it were led by a more rational, less confrontational president.In 1945, when the UN and the present world order came into being, a shared determination, primarily among western powers, that the catastrophes of two world wars should never be repeated, was central to their decision-making, however imperfect. Any similar sense of altruism is wholly absent today from the pragmatic, performative calculations of the Beijing triumvirate. All of which, it must be said, bodes ill for the world. Looking at Xi, Putin and Kim, plus the isolationist-nihilist Trump, biblical scholars might be forgiven for recalling the four horsemen of the apocalypse: conquest, war, famine and death.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But with the far right looming, we need action not despairJohn McDonnell is the MP for Hayes and Harlington. He was shadow chancellor for Labour from 2015 to 2020Wed 3 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 07.30 EDTShareThe Labour party is facing one of the most dangerous moments in its history, possibly an existential threat. Not only is it adrift in the polls, losing one council byelection after another, and with a leader whose popularity has plummeted; but the main threat comes from the xenophobic hard right in the shape ofReform UK.Labour has to wake up to this threat and seize the moment. It must take five basic steps to recovery:1. Stop diggingMost of Labour’s woes are of its own making. Thewinter fuel allowance debacle, thedisability benefits cuts rebellion, the refusal to scrap thetwo-child limiton benefits and, of course, Gaza. Continuing tosend arms to Israelthat are used to murder children, refusing to break the aid blockade and deploying a contorted logic todelay recognition of the Palestinian state, merely compound things.Then to cap it all theproscription of Palestine Actionresulted in the bizarre sight of an 83-year-old priestbeing arrestedalongside hundreds of others – with more to come.So step one is to stop making ludicrous political decisions that are systematically alienating section after section of our core support, and masking much of the good work being undertaken by ministers in their departments.2. ListenStep two is to simply listen to your supporters, party members, councillors and MPs.MPs are coming back from their constituencies with honest warnings of the anger at some of Labour’s policies and the behaviour of senior politicians, including the acceptance of tacky giftsand freebies. They have not only been ignored but have been met with threats of disciplinary action and even loss of the whip.The forcing of Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana out of the Labour party could have immense electoral consequences, which my colleague Richard Burgon has described as Labour losing votes to the left but, as a result, losing seats to the right.The complacent response from party strategists that Labour voters have nowhere else to go is no longer accurate as our supporters stay at home, vote Green or vote independent – or now could vote for thenew leftwing party.This can be avoided by remaking our party as a truly representative broad church, where differences of view are not just allowed but welcomed for strengthening the process in which our decisions are made.View image in fullscreenA rally against planned disability benefit cuts in Parliament Square, London, 30 June 2025.Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/Reuters3. Stop mimicking FarageStep three has to be: stop dancing to Farage’s tune, stop aping his policies. Public understanding of asylum is largely shaped bythe media coverageof the dinghies landing on our shores and the xenophobic rantings of Farage.Those images can be erased by swift decision-making and by establishing safe routes and returns, re-engaging with our European partners to create a Europe-wide strategy.Hotels would become unnecessary if asylum decisions are made swiftly and people are allowed to work, settle and contribute to our economy and society. After Brexit – and with an ageing population – our economy needs a wide range of skills to achieve the government’s growth objectives.To immediately reduce the numbers of those trapped in hotels waiting for a decision at present, the Refugee Council has proposed that we introduce a temporary amnesty for refugeesfrom places such as Sudan, Syria and Eritrea, which are the countries from which asylum seekers are almost automatically given status at the moment.4. Go big this autumnAlthough the asylum issuehas risen in prevalence in the polls, I doubt if many people have had much direct engagement with asylum seekers. But they do have a daily engagement with the cost of living, balancing their income with their outgoings, dealing with ever-rising food and energy bills, their rent and mortgages, and frequently accessing local public services. The forthcoming budget could be a turning point on the issues that really shape people’s lives.We need a big budget.So step four is introducing a huge agenda-setting budget in which we begin to transform people’s lives by tackling the cost of living. A cost-of-living budget would use fair taxation of wealth and excess profits to address the grotesque levels of inequality in our society and the 14.3 million now living in poverty,including 4.3 million children.That could mean redistributing wealth by equalising capital gains tax with income tax and levying a windfall tax on the recent massive profits of the banking and finance sector. Likewise bringing forward a financial transaction tax to correct the anomalies of stamp duty on share sales, introducing a wealth tax on multimillionaires and developing a land value tax.Alongside measures to reduce costs such as rent controls, a fair taxation system would provide the resources to boost the rebuilding of our public services after 14 years of austerity cuts, and to overcome the years of public sector pay cuts and benefit freezes.The very best way of securing the growth the government is crying out for is to put money in people’s pockets, especially the people on low and average incomes who will spend, not hoard like the rich. But all of this will be to no avail without step five.5. The spirit of LabourWe desperately need a Labour government that behaves like Labour. That lives up to its traditions. That truly reflects the best of our country’s culture.It must be a Labour party that advocates for a caring society, where we aim to manage the economy and society in the interests of the many, and where we always live up to our international and humanitarian responsibilities and values.These are core requirements. If the current leadership are not capable of playing this role, then the question has to be asked about whether there is an alternative.For some, this will mean chancing support for the new leftwing party. For others, fearful of splitting the vote and opening the door for Reform, the alternative is a change of Labour leadership and a reclaiming of the party as what it should and must be: a truly democratic broad church of socialist and progressive opinion.John McDonnell is the MP for Hayes and Harlington.

We will not be pushed to the marginsWed 3 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 05.19 EDTShareMy sister is an amazing aunty to my baby son. She is obsessed with him. So much so, she recently used some of her annual leave to take him on a day out. She was excited to show him off, proud to push him in his buggy and have people assume he was hers for a few hours. She never expected to be met with hostility and suspicion.Like me, my sister is a Black mixed-race woman. My son is, at a glance, “white-presenting”, with blond hair and blue eyes. As they travelled together on the London underground, a woman looked at my son, looked at my sister and asked coldly: “Are you child-minding?” It was humiliating and invalidating. My sister scrambled to answer, not knowing what would happen if her status as blood relative wasn’t believed. Later, she told me she wished she hadn’t answered – why does a stranger have the right to question her in this way? – but in the moment, she felt rattled.I know this feeling well. I have experienced it myself. Surprised looks, invasive questioning. In the 14 months since he was born, I have been asked: “Is he yours?” a number of times. Sometimes, I am tempted to reply: “No, I kidnapped him and strapped him to my chest”, just to see what would happen.It isn’t the question itself that’s an issue. I am not against having a conversation about heritage approached in the right way. But it’s the presumption that strangers are entitled to know anything about me, my family and our background, simply because we don’t look how they expect us to. And, lying just beneath innocent curiosity, there is often something much darker – the implication that a family that looks like mine is inherently suspect, questionable. That we don’t automatically belong.Flags as symbols of prejudice, not pride – and a distinct air of menace. Welcome to England 2025 | John HarrisRead moreOf course, extremists have always felt this way, but it’s an ideology that no longer feels confined to the extreme fringes of society. Incidents like these are indicative of a broader social shift, a gradual normalisation of the hateful, bigoted rhetoric that ultimately emboldens members of the public to interrogate Black and brown people on the street if they feel threatened.Recently, I was sickened to read the story ofthe Black man vilified and houndedby death threats after far-right activist Tommy Robinson shared a video of him playing with his white grandchildren. I couldn’t help but think of my late father and how he would have adored spending time with his grandson. It breaks my heart that we might have had to worry about the optics of their relationship every time they were out together.I hoped we were far beyond this, that I was bringing my son up in an increasingly tolerant world. But these recent experiences remind me of the things my parents went through in the early 1990s when my sister and I were babies – the hostility and judgment, the overt racism.My mum, who was white, always described it as viscerally painful when people didn’t see her as our mother. This should be a thing of the past. After all, the 2021 UK census showed the number of people identifying as being from “mixed/multiple ethnic groups”increased 40% in the preceding decade.I didn’t expect that now, I would feel a similar pain as my mother did.But this is the direct result of a social rhetoric that has carefully cultivated a fear of the other. Nigel Farage is weaponising this fear, and the disproportionate airtime he is receiving is helping to normalise it. The Reform UK leader has dominated headlines and news programmes,describing illegal immigration as a “scourge”, and floating chilling proposals for themass deportation of children. At the same time, the “raise the colours” movementhas spread St George’s flagsacross motorway bridges and middle England town centres, not as a celebration of heritage but as a warning that Britain is not for everyone. Just a few miles from where we live in east London, the Bell hotel in Epping has been a target forweekly far-right proteststhroughout the summer, with groups of men with megaphones shouting abuse at desperate families seeking refuge.View image in fullscreenA multicultural crowd of shoppers in Oxford Street, London, 10 October 2017.Photograph: Janine Wiedel Photolibrary/AlamyThese are not isolated incidents. They are the inevitable outcome of the drip-feeding of cruelty and intolerance into the public psyche.

A world in which a St George’s flag fluttering from a lamp-post wouldn’t send a shiver down my spine and make me quicken my pace. But that world is drifting further away.This country is changing. The far right now represents a real threat and the polls suggest a Reform UK prime minister is increasingly possible. We should think hard about that. We can’t let their language of division and fear take hold, dictate our cultural identity, or decide who gets to feel at home here.

Blackberries? Picnics? Festivals?Ticks? This summer has been thehottest on record in the UK. As human-caused climate breakdown intensifies, the outdoor areas we spend time in are changing – and so, too, are our relationships with the land and the ecosystems we live in.My home is in the south of England, near beautiful woodlands. Since moving there in 2016, the number of ticks my family has picked up in the woods has increased each year, but this summer has been astonishing. For a few weeks, our four-year-old came home from nursery with a tick almost every day. I’ve had many: some tiny nymphal ones that could be easily missed. We spend time in Scotland, too, and find ticks often when we go there now.We’ve become adept at removing the blighters with a special tool, protecting ourselves and checking the kids – but there are dangers.Lyme disease is increasing, and the potentially deadlytick-borne encephalitishas also been found in the UK. In the US, there are 500,000 new cases ofLyme diseaseper year. Sometimes I wonder if it’s only a matter of time before the risks of spending time in these woods – beloved spaces, like a second home – could outweigh the benefits.Last week, we went down toKimmeridge Bayin Dorset. The weather was glorious, we saw pale bluecushion starfishand crabs, shrimps and fossils, but the surrounding yellowed, parched fields were eerie, and a reminder of the uncanniness of this moment. I felt a jolt ofsolastalgia, a word coined by the Australian philosopher Glenn Albrecht to describe the “distress that is produced by environmental change impacting on people while they are directly connected to their home environment”.It’s a complex experience, living in this time of climate crisis, with a human brain that is short-termist, generally optimistic and present-oriented. Maybe the fields were as yellow and dead at the end of August when I was a child? Maybe I imagine that we used to see more swifts? Or butterflies? Or hedgehogs? (This isshifting baseline syndrome, and the statistics show both consistent declines of species and hotter summers.)Day to day, our summer has been good because we’ve been able to be outside and enjoy the sunshine. Yes, a tree in our garden has died, drought possibly a factor. The frogs didn’t survive, perhaps because the pond dried up. I don’t swim as much in the local rivers – an activity I have found highly therapeutic – because of pollution levels. I’m getting used to the feeling of solastalgia.But it’s become harder to get used to how very hot it has been in the past few years. I hated the extremeheatwave of 2022, where temperatures reached 40C for the first time (since records began) in the UK. With a baby and young children at home, we simply couldn’t go outside. And when we could, everything was dead and quiet. It was depressing and frightening.With the extreme heat projected in the coming decades, going outside in the summer will be harder: festivals and outdoor sports events will betoo dangerous; opportunities for people to unwind and relax in nature may decrease.The impacts of climate change on the British summerwill be unequalacross class, race and socioeconomic lines. Moredeprived areasare less likely to have tree cover for shade. The homes of lower-income families, renters, those with children and ethnic minority households are more likely to overheat.View image in fullscreenA common swift at the entrance to a human-made nest box in Norfolk.Photograph: Kevin Elsby/AlamyAnd the countries most vulnerable to severe climate-related breakdown – those in the global south, who are not responsible for climate change caused by human activity – are facing summers projected to be much more deadly and violent than those in thenorthern hemisphere.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trees may die; plants may reduce flowering and seed production. Without food plants caterpillars can’t survive, which means fewer butterflies and moths. If fruit ripens early, it may not be around for winter migrants such as fieldfares or redwings, or for hibernating species such as dormice. High temperatures and falling water levels threaten freshwater ecosystems by shrinking habitats and concentrating levels of pollutants and sewage.When I approached our wildlife and nature NGOs about how the British summertime is playing out with the living world, they were keen to tell me what we can do to help our non-human neighbours. Suggestions included: increasing moisture-retaining wildflowers in public spaces and road verges; watering trees; keeping ponds topped up; leaving out shallow dishes of water with pebbles in them so bees and butterflies can safely drink too; letting areas of grass grow long; creating shade with log piles.We know what the government and business need to do. Stop burning fossil fuels. Our leaders are going for economic growth at any cost, even if any cost means the collapse of the precious web of life on Earth as we know it.

A poll by the research group Persuasion UK, testing various messages, found that by far the most effective line of attack ishighlighting his complicity with corporate interests. The message that hit hardest was that Farage’s real loyalties lie with “the rich, the powerful, his mates in big business”, and his “party” (actually a businesscalled Reform 2025 Ltd) “has takenover £2mfrom fossil fuel lobbyists, polluters, and climate change deniers … He’s not smashing the system. He and his rich friends basically are the system.”But this is a string Labour cannot yank, as it would pull its own roof down. If there is a defining mark of Keir Starmer’s administration, it isimmediate capitulationto powerful lobby groups, especially corporations and billionaires. This is what explains the otherwise inexplicable:its planning policy, tax policy,competition policy,deregulation policy, AI policy,food policy, its plans toreboot private partnershipsin the NHS, itsbanning of Palestine Action.Nor can the government point out the blindingly obvious: that it is not asylum seekers who jack up rents, undermine the NHS, hold down wages and keep people insecure, but capital. It cannot tell us that the role of the hard right is to shift the blame for decades of economic attacks by the rich and powerful on to powerless people who have only just arrived here. This would mean mentioning capital, wealth and power: topics it avoids like the plague.In other words, the government has flunked the simplest test for a Labour administration: how to respond to an insurgent hard right. Alarge trancheofevidencefrom Europeand around the world shows that if you seek to compete with it on harshness and cruelty, obsess over its themes and adopt its rhetoric, youmerely legitimiseandempower it. But, tragically and incomprehensibly, Keir Starmer’s government hasdone all this, andkeeps doing it, despite repeated warnings.People who approve of Farage will vote for him, emboldened by a Labour party that has told them, in effect, thathe is right. People who hate Farage will vote not only against him, but also against a government seen to be handing the country on a plate to him. Unless its MPs rebel and defenestrate Starmer and Rachel Reeves, it is hard to see any trajectory for Labour now, other than electoral wipeout.All this presents voters with a massive problem. When a dominant party opposes the principles and people it once existed to serve, we are left reeling, disoriented, lost. But it also presents an equally large opening. Farage remainsdeeply unpopularin the UK; he has merely stepped into a gaping vacuum of disillusionment and despair. The opportunities for progressive politicians to seize this moment, toeven greater effect, are simply waiting to be taken.I have no party loyalties: as a journalist, I feel I should stand apart, and as a pragmatist I’m happy to go with whatever works. But I’m happy to see the election, on a huge majority, of Zack Polanski as Green party leader. This is not because I disrespect the other leadership candidates, who have their own great strengths (though they are somewhat undermined, I feel, by risk aversion). It is because I believe that his style and emphasis meet the challenge of the moment. His campaign videocalling out the scapegoatingof asylum seekers for political failure was the film I’ve wanted to see for a long time. Hecorrectly identifiesReform UK as “a party of millionaires representing the interests of billionaires, but claiming to be the voice of the working class”. Labour can’t talk about that either, as it cannot bring itself to say “billionaire”.He isloud and confrontationalat a time when nothing else will do. He does not fear controversy – a useful lesson any politician can learn from Farage. He understands the need both for clear and simple policy messaging – on corporate and billionaire power, exclusion and environmental collapse – and for fighting the radical right with unapologetic rhetoric. He ismuch harderthan his opponents for the media to ignore.Hecalls his approach“eco-populism”, but I feel this is not a wholly accurate description. His communication style might be fierce and direct, but it is layered on top of the party’s deep and thoughtful agenda,embodied in its manifesto: for example, bringing the railways, water companies and big five energy companies back into public ownership; guaranteeing access to an NHS dentist for all; greatly expanding the provision of mental healthcare; abolishing the Malthusian two-child benefit cap and scrapping the bedroom tax; repealing anti-union legislation and introducing a charter for workers’ rights; pressing for a maximum pay ratio within any organisation of 10:1; enabling local authorities to introduce rent controls; replacing the House of Lords with an elected chamber and introducing a fairer voting and party funding system, alongside the far-sighted environmental policies we would expect, all funded by a much fairer and more redistributive tax settlement. None of this changes as a result of Polanski’s win, as Green party policy is established democratically.Importantly, he seemsprepared to strike dealswith political rivals such as Your Party, which might help to prevent the traditional fragmentation of the left vote. It seems plausible to me, through a combination of mass disillusionment with Labour, strategic targeting and much greater visibility for Polanski’s party (whose policies already represent everything a modern Labour party should stand for, but doesn’t) that the Greens could take several dozen seats at the next election, and end up holding the balance of power.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But is the move upmarket working?Wed 3 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 12.48 EDTShareLast summer, Spain’s Balearic Islands launched one of Europe’s toughest crackdowns on alcohol-fuelled party tourism. In popular resorts such as Magaluf in Mallorca and Sant Antoni in Ibiza, tourists spilled out of bars at dawn, clutched cheap bottles from late-night shops, and treated entire neighbourhoods as giant open-air nightclubs.Local people were fed up. Noise complaints, violent brawls and clashes between residents and intoxicated tourists became routine. Rents rose while longstandingneighbourhoods became hollowed out into seasonal party zones. Pilar Hernando, from Palma, Mallorca told Reuters in 2024: “Prices go up, rents go up,everything goes up … except salaries.” Hernando had to move into a caravan owing to the lack of affordable housing. Average rents have risen 158% over the past decade in the Balearics, with Palma now among the most expensive cities in Spain.Last summer, the Balearic authorities finally said: enough. The regional government, led by Marga Prohens of the People’s party (PP), formally extended a 2020 law and introduced stricter alcohol controls. Drinking on public streets was banned in designated “excess tourism zones”, including Palma, Llucmajor, Calvià and Sant Antoni. Fines of up to €3,000 were introduced for violations. Retail alcohol sales were restricted after 9.30pm, and all-inclusive hotels could serve only six drinks per guest per day. Party boats were pushed further offshore. Crucially, local police forces were authorised to forward fine notices to consulates – to ensure accountability and discourage repeat offences.As wide-ranging as these new measures were, it wasn’t just about law enforcement. It was a declaration: the islands no longer wanted to be Europe’s cheap, consequence-free party playground. “Nineteen million tourists in a territory of 1.3 million inhabitants is unacceptable,”Prohens said, stressing the need for “a change of course” toward sustainable tourism growth – underlining a pivot toward attracting more family-friendly and cultural tourism, rather than sun, sex and sangria excess.So has it worked? One year on, local authorities claim the measures have delivered positive change. Studies show that serious incidents in destinations such as Magaluf and Sant Antoni havedroppeddramatically since 2018: by approximately 90% and 87.5%, respectively. While it’s too early to isolate the effects of the recent crackdown, these figures reflect the outcome of sustained efforts and policy changes to promote responsible tourism. Residents have cautiously welcomed the calmer summer nights: many say this is the first summer season in years when they could sleep undisturbed by drunken shouting.These changes follow some of the biggest protests against overtourism in Spain’s history. In July 2024 an estimated10,000 people marched in Palmaalone, demanding action on housing shortages and quality of life.And while initial signs are positive, the transformation is far from complete. Enforcement of the new rules has been patchy. While big resorts such as Magaluf and Sant Antoni saw heavy policing, quieter towns and historical centres like Sóller and Alcúdia did not, and continued to play host to antisocial behaviour and public drinking. Tourists were often confused about what exactly was banned and where.Meanwhile, local nightlife businesses – especially small bars and convenience shops – argue the crackdown hurts them unfairly. They warn that cutting off cheap, high-volume drinking reduces footfall and threatens jobs. Some fear party tourism will be pushed into illegal rentals or unregulated venues that are even harder to police. Hotel groups, while broadly supportive of the policy’s goals, have called for clearer communication to visitors through improved signage and visitor education. “Guests are often unaware of the rules before they arrive,” said Gabriel Llobera, vice-president of Mallorca’s Confederation of Business Associations. They want consistent, fair enforcement so that responsible businesses don’t lose out to those ignoring the rules.What’s happening in the Balearics isn’t just a local story. From Amsterdam to Venice to Barcelona, European destinations are grappling with the consequences of overtourism. How do you preserve local communities, culture and affordability while also keeping the economic lifeblood that tourism brings?The Balearics’ crackdown is one of the clearest attempts to say: some kinds of tourism are simply not welcome any more. But making that sustainable means not just punishing bad behaviour but offering better alternatives. Authorities will need to keep investing in clear, multilingual information campaigns so visitors know the rules before they land. They’ll need to help small businesses shift toward higher quality offerings so they aren’t left behind. They’ll need consistent enforcement across municipalities to prevent simply displacing the problem.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A visitor economy that alienates local people is living on borrowed time. The Balearic Islands’ experiment shows that change is possible – but it also shows that it is hard work that doesn’t stop with the passing of a law. As another summer season winds down, the real test is whether the islands can turn these first-year gains into lasting, fair and sustainable tourism.Dr Dimah Ajeeb is senior lecturer in architecture, urban design, regional planning and tourism at the University of WestminsterExplore more on these topicsOvertourismOpinionSpainBalearic Islands holidaysMallorca holidaysIbiza holidaysEuropeEurope holidayscommentShareReuse this content"

Geographically, though, they are conspicuously less disparate, with four schemes in London, one in Hastings and one in Cambridge, which begs the question: is there really no noteworthy new architecture north of the Fens?View image in fullscreenCare, shelter and connection … Appleby Blue Almshouse.Photograph: Philip Vile/Royal Institute of British Architects/PAHistorically associated with pastoral benevolence and distressed gentlefolk, the almshouse gets a modern reboot by architects Witherford Watson Mann. TheirAppleby Bluedevelopment in Bermondsey, London, is a place of care and shelter, but above all, social connection. The human theatre of residents in its voluminous garden room can be appreciated from the street through a glazed walkway projecting out along the main facade like a shop window. “The idea was to build right in the heart of the community, not to hide people away,” says project architect Stephen Witherford. Both in its architecture and operation, Appleby Blue is a consciously extroverted presence and a retort to the notion that older people (especially poorer older people) should be shunted to the margins, with adverse effects on their mental and physical health.Swiss practice Herzog and de Meuron’s forte is devising statement buildings for institutional clients, exemplified by the mammoth crystalline doughnut of theDiscovery Centre, designed with BDP for pharma titan AstraZeneca. Being in Cambridge, albeit on a peripheral biomedical campus near Addenbrooke’s hospital, there are nods to the archetype of the college court (quads being the preserve of Oxford), with a lawn-lined central enclave. Wrapped in faceted glazing, which, through cunning flexes of geometry, becomes a sawtooth roof, it’s a classic object building in a landscape, executed with enviable precision, a piece of architectural haute couture that puts its dowdier campus neighbours in the shade.View image in fullscreenEnviable precision … the Discovery Centre.Photograph: Hufton and Crow/Royal Institute of British Architects/PAFormerly based in Oxford Street next to the John Lewis flagship store, the London College of Fashion (LCF) and its attendant satellites have now consolidated and decamped toAllies and Morrison’s “vertical campus”in the expanding cultural quarter of Stratford, London’s East Bank. While its 5,500 students may hanker for John Lewis’s legendary haberdashery department, they have the compensation of soaring atriums, Escher-esque staircases and panoramic views from the LCF’s whopping 17 storeys. Billed as the highest higher education building in the UK, the LCF forms a muscular armature for a teeming anthill of creative endeavour.View image in fullscreenEscher-esque … London College of Fashion.Photograph: Simon Menges/Royal Institute of British Architects/PAThe two houses on the shortlist,Hastings House by Hugh StrangeandNiwa House by Takero Shimazaki, are elegant exercises in how to create atypical, modern domestic spaces. Elevating an otherwise quotidian domestic refurbishment, Hugh Strange augments a floridly eccentric Victorian dwelling – all stained glass, fretted barge boards and decorative clay tiles – with a series of simple, interlocking timber-framed rooms.Niwa House transforms a derelict site at the back of a terrace in Southwark, London. The Japanese inflected design emphasises the relationship between house and garden (niwa), exploring the concept ofengawa, a covered corridor running along the perimeter of traditional Japanese dwellings. Conceived as a modest, lightweight pavilion, the house is a continuous series of fluid, open-plan spaces, with sliding doors and glazed walls that open up to unify its interior with gardens and courtyards.And finally, after five years shrouded in Christo-like wrappings, the Palace of Westminster’s gleamingly restoredElizabeth Tower and the bongs of Big Benwithin it resume their place at the heart of national life, courtesy of conservation specialists Purcell and a battalion of craftspeople. The most comprehensive repair programme in its 160 years restores Pugin’s original Victorian colour scheme of Prussian blue and gold for the four clock faces, strips away the bodges of previous restoration cycles and adds a new visitor lift, eliminating the ordeal of having to wheeze up 334 steps to the top of the tower.While the project represents a singular triumph of conservation, existential issues continue to assail the rotting, neo-gothic wedding cake of the Palace of Westminster, with its 1,100 rooms, 100 staircases, 31 lifts and three miles of corridors.The story so faris of rising costs as political and public debate grinds on about how to make it remotely fit for purpose.View image in fullscreenFluid and open … Niwa House.Photograph: Felix Koch/Royal Institute of British Architects/PAPredictions about a likely Stirling winner are always a hostage to fortune, but whoever scoops the tiara should know that the Stirling imprimatur is no guarantee of architectural immortality. Earlier this year,demolition was due to beginon Hodder Associates’ Centenary Building at the University of Salford, the very first winner of the prize in 1996. Lauded at the time as a “dynamic, modern and sophisticated exercise in steel, glass and concrete”, it stood empty for eight years, failed to be listed and will soon be razed to make way for new housing.The winner of the RIBA Stirling prize 2025 will be announced live at London’s Roundhouse on 16 OctoberExplore more on these topicsArchitecturePalace of WestminsterDesignfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Oh please. Let’s get real; there is no reason why this particular brand of gibbering, wittering, blithering and surreally enjoyable nonsense shouldn’t go on for ever, like Frank Sinatra’s farewell tour or shortbread manufacture in the Scottish Highlands. Both of the previous Downton films had a sentimental last-hurrah message that didn’t preclude another one dropping off the production line. We could make the next film Downton Abbey: The Royal Finale and the one after that Downton Abbey: The Imperial Finale.Thelast but onefilm finished on a funereal drone shot of Downton Abbey at sunset and the one after that was subtitled“A New Era”– but this one, it seems, has taken us back to the very end of the old era, inviting us to swoon loyally at the passing of something special and yet also at the same time doff our caps at the bluebloods’ insouciant gift for survival. There is something entertainingly outrageous in the pure tongue-in-cheek craziness of this new film’s opening sequence; it could almost count as a dadaist dream sequence. I don’t think anything in the TV show or the movies had anything as mickey-takingly bizarre.The scene is London in 1930 and Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) is at a grand society occasion with her parents, the Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) and the Countess of Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern), when the rumour runs round the assembled company that – gasp! – Lady Mary is technically adivorced womanand so has to be expelled from the party before the royals turn up. The shock of Lady Mary being divorced is presented with impeccable seriousness, like news of a terrorist bomb. Julian Fellowes is, of course, sporting with us, and yet you can’t help smiling along. Fellowes also once again cheekily recycles an idea fromhis country-house screenplay Gosford Park from 2001, directed by Robert Altman; in that film he had Ivor Novello turning up as a guest, now it’s Noël Coward (Arty Froushan), whose celebrity presence at Downton convinces all the local nobility to accept Lady Mary’s status as a divorcee.‘I knew my job was to fulfil a man’s fantasy’: Elizabeth McGovern on Downton, early fame and co-starring with Brad PittRead moreLife at Downton is as eventful as ever, with Lord G brooding on whether to accept Lady Mary’s succession as the mistress of the house, and graciously retreat with his wife to the “Dower House” occupied by his late mother. A rather gruesome Hammer horror portrait of the late Maggie Smith now dominates the building. Lady Grantham’s sheepish American brother Harold (Paul Giamatti) comes to stay with his smoothie financial adviser Gus Sambrook (Alessandro Nivola); the latter gives Lady Mary the eye. And below stairs, housekeeper Elsie Hughes (Phyllis Logan) calms the premarital nerves of Mrs Patmore (Lesley Nicol), assuring her that conjugal responsibilities are in fact “terrific fun!” (The film should get an 18 certificate for this line alone.)The film is very silly and always watchable in its weird way, with those eccentrically emphasised shots of characters thanking each other for their thoughtfulness. The next Downton Abbey film will surely have to make these characters absorb the rise of fascism and the stormclouds of war. It promises to be a diverting spectacle.Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale is out on 11 September in Australia, and on 12 September in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmPeriod and historical filmsDrama filmsDownton Abbey (Film)Julian FellowesDownton Abbey (Television & radio)Michelle DockeryreviewsShareReuse this content"

How refreshingLucy ManganWed 3 Sep 2025 17.00 EDTShareAre there hundreds of contestants and are they virtually indistinguishable from each other at first sight? Yes! Is it noisy? Yes! Can you feel it encouraging appetites and urges – voyeurism, schadenfreude, extreme emotional investment in strangers – that a responsible citizen and society should strive neither to serve nor encourage? Oh yes! Is that done by forcing relationships then putting them under outre stressors, including unexpected toilet conditions, on an otherwise paradisiacal island? Yes! And is it at least nominally presented byDavina McCall, though actual sight of her is limited to a few opening minutes of the first episode and it is increasingly cheeky to bill her as a presence? Yes, yes to all of the above. Welcome to your next addictive reality show, 12 hour-long episodes designed to transition you comfortably into the autumn schedules – Stranded on Honeymoon Island.It is Love Island meets Married at First Sight, if – and you will have to strain your imaginations here – the contestants on Love Island weren’t often instantly awful. This lot are, in the main, rather gorgeously endearing. I hadn’t realised how ready I was for a show that didn’t require me to bring my best loathing game. I find I have so much energy for the rest of the day.Like all good reality TV shows (take note, Destination X), the setup is as stupid as it is simple and as simple as it is stupid. Eight kabillion single people who are ready to find lurve speed-date, fill in feedback forms, and from them a dozen are paired up by matchmakers. They then get hitched in the Philippines by celebrant Wenly (“Although this marriage is not legally binding, you are making a meaningful commitment to someone”, which is true as long as you realise that someone is the production company). The couples then get left on a nearby island for three weeks. There is a double bed, rudimentary shelter, a row of tinned foodstuffs and a loo that is maybe a notch and a half better than a bucket. We are promised that “mystery crates” containing items and challenges designed to test the honeymooners’ compatibility will arrive in later episodes. Good times!View image in fullscreen‘Little sister vibes’ … Mae (left) in Stranded on Honeymoon Island on BBC One.Photograph: BBC/CPL ProductionsYou find yourself rooting for an unusually high proportion of the couples. I wish for no one to dim the light of effervescent party girl Hannah and I very much feel that lovely suit designer Sam is the man to allow her to shine. When they hit the first bump in the road, I find myself pressing my fists to my face, begging her not to let her past bad experiences distort it into something it is not. “He is not your ex!” I plead to the screen. “Look at his eyes! Look at the way he recut your wedding dress into something playful yet provocative yet island-chores-ready. Come on! The past is not your future.”I am also fully in favour of Helen (“Essex girl and raging lesbian – that’s how I introduce myself!”) and Abby making a go of things. What can I tell you? They’re just right together. I bet Davina agrees with me. If we ever see her again, maybe she’ll say so.Oh, and the two devout Christians, David and Ini! He used to sleep around but it wasn’t making him happy so he “cried to God” for help and it was given. Now he is ready to settle down, start a family, give his children the love he didn’t experience at boarding school and I just know that Ini is the one for him. Sure, it might have been better if he hadn’t mentioned at the altar that there was another woman on the speed dates he would have been equally happy to find coming down the aisle towards him, but every non-marriage has its teething troubles, amirite? I mean, just ask Moray (another boarding-school boy) and Mae (who is single after her ex had a terrible accident “and fell into his colleague’s vagina” and cannot date anyone who drives a manual car because it makes their heads move like chickens’ and makes her feel sick – I pledge undying allegiance to this woman). He tells her on the second day of their honeymoon that she reminds him of his cousin and he’s also getting “little sister vibes”. O tempora, o Moray.It’s a lot of fun, fuelled by optimism instead of despair and populated by people who genuinely seem to like each other and who are frequently funny. It’s a rare beast. Not quite as rare as actual sightings of Davina, but there are several episodes to go. Maybe she’ll be in a mystery crate, along with some pointers for boarding-school boys looking for love.Stranded on Honeymoon Island aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDavina McCallReality TVMarriageDatingRelationshipsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Eight of the authors are British.The Revolutionists: The Story of the Extremists Who Hijacked the 1970s by Burke, which draws on his lifetime of reporting for the Guardian as a foreign correspondent, is up against The Finest Hotel in Kabul: A People’s History of Afghanistan by Doucet, which weaves together the experiences of Afghans who have kept the Hotel Intercontinental running since 1969.Judges commended Daughters of the Bamboo Grove by Demick, a previous winner of the prize, for “humanising” the effects of China’s one-child policy by exposing the families torn apart by its implementation.

Frances Wilson makes her third appearance on the prize’s longlist for Electric Spark: The Enigma of Muriel Spark, which the judges hailed as a “dazzling biography” of the novelist’s mind and character, alongside twice shortlisted Richard Holmes for The Boundless Deep: Young Tennyson, Science and the Crisis of Belief. This book, which focuses on the poet’s early years and his immersion in scientific thought, is a masterful look at “how poets respond to the faith-quaking challenge of science”, Millen said.The third biography on the list, John & Paul: A Love Story in Songs by Ian Leslie, is an account of the love and jealousy between the Beatles which judges found “deeply entertaining and enjoyable”.Europe is a focus for three of the other longlisted authors. Between the Waves: The Hidden History of a Very British Revolution 1945-2016 by New Statesman journalist Tom McTague is a “gripping exploration of Euroscepticism in Britain”, according to the judges. The Last Days of Budapest: Spies, Nazis, Rescuers and Resistance by Adam LeBor “skilfully” recreates life and death in Budapest during the second world war, while Adam Weymouth’s Lone Wolf: Walking the Faultlines of Europe – which documents an epic walk by a wolf from Slovenia through the Alps to Italy – was praised by the judges for its discussion of conservation and rewilding.The remaining book on the longlist is Captives and Companions, which judges described as a “thoroughly investigated” book on slavery in the Muslim world, by Justin Marozzi, winner of the Royal Society of Literature Ondaatje prize.The investment management firm Baillie Gifford has sponsored the prize since 2016. Last year’s winner, Richard Flanagan, delayed accepting the £50,000 prize money for his book Question 7. In his acceptance speech, he said that he would not accept the reward until the fund manager shares a plan to reduce its investment in fossil fuel extraction and increase investments in renewables. “As each of us is guilty,” the 63-year-old concluded, “each of us too bears a responsibility to act: a writer, a fund manager.”Last year,a campaign by Fossil Free Books (FFB)highlighted Baillie Gifford’s investments in businesses connected to fossil fuels and Israel, leading to its sponsorships of nine UK literary festivals coming to an end in June 2024.Baillie Gifford continues to sponsor the nonfiction prize, however. Previous winners of the prize have included Antony Beevor, Jonathan Coe, Serhii Plokhy, Hallie Rubenhold and Katherine Rundell.Browse all the novels on the Baillie Gifford 2025 longlist atguardianbookshop.com.

More than a century after audiences were taught to fall silent as standard, most concerts continue to begin emphatically, with the musical equivalent of a teacher calling a new reception class to order. But theBBC Symphony Orchestra’s 10th outing this Proms season – this time under composer-conductorThomas Adès– was an altogether subtler affair.Sibelius’s tone poem The Swan of Tuonela provided that beguilingly unhurried start. The strings settled, featherlike, into a light, luminous backdrop over which the cor anglais twisted and soared. Reaching forwards and upwards, hands outstretched, Adès held the orchestra as if under a spell: the brass, seeming to float from a great distance, the strings’ eventual unison melody calm and spacious.The UK premiere of Breathing Forests, an organ concerto by California composerGabriella Smithburst into life in a colourful splash of tremolo and repetitions, the strings and upper woodwind in near-constant motion while sustained notes from organistJames McVinnieand the BBCSO brass provided some sense of larger-scale shape. Amid periodic swathes ofPhilip Glass-style arpeggios, there were more intriguing details: strange squeals and pitch bends, brashly tonal chords that disintegrated on landing, the glacial creaking of bows pressed into strings, cluster chords as if a toddler had been let loose on the organ manuals. Much of the work was densely orchestrated, Smith generating a kind of ecosystem-in-motion – more persuasive as a vivid soundscape than as a finite structure.After the interval came two musical responses to Shakespeare’s The Tempest. Adès’s own Five Spells from The Tempest ran the gamut from the storm’s seething, noisy swerves and lurches via Ariel’s mercurial, angular woodwind to hints of elegant courtly dances for Ferdinand and Miranda. Sibelius’s The Tempest – Suite No 1 (among his last completed works) featured still more radical switches of atmosphere, between bland folksiness and a remarkably lean, bold modernism. Adès presided like Prospero himself, relentlessly engaging as he conjured evanescent woodwind solos and symphonic textures of fearless, squally aggression.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

At a timewhen America’s president shows more admirationfor autocratic Russia than for Nato-allied countries in Europe, are we witnessing the end of thewest as an idea?I certainly wouldn’t write off the west. What we are seeing is a challenge to a version of the west that had America as its leader. But it doesn’t have to signal the end. The west is crucial to Europeans, and they have been the core of it. America joined at some point as an offshoot; it has been isolationist before, and it may become isolationist again. So we may see a different version of the west for a while, with its core inEurope, as it historically has mostly been. But America will surely return sooner or later.Awest without America is hard to getone’s head around. When we use that term, most people think of thecoldwar, and awestern alliance led by the Anglosphere …Of course. One common view is that the notion of the west gains traction with the foundation ofNatoin 1949 and the cold war. At the other extreme there’s the “from Plato to Nato” idea, which says the west started with ancient Greeks when they fought off the Persians. Meanwhile, among historians, there has been a boringly universal consensus that the west as a self-conscious idea begins in the 1880s or 90s, and is due primarily to the needs of British imperialism: it was invented to justify imperialism, to demarcate the oriental east of Asia and Arab peoples as an “other”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: book jacketBut I disagree. In my research I found it was French writers who first started using the word in the 1820s, and they did so because they realised the term “Europe” was no longer fit for purpose.What was wrong with “Europe”?The problem was that geographically and politically, from the time of Peter the Great in the early 18th century, it included Russia. Later, Russia’s Tsar Alexander I came to dominate the 1815 Congress of Vienna and the Holy Alliance that he established subsequently. More and more western Europeans began to worry about Russia’s inevitable domination of Europe. It was a large and expansionist monolith. The 1820s saw the Greek war of independence against the Ottoman empire, but for a lot of French commentators the real danger was that Russia could take Constantinople after an Ottoman collapse they saw as imminent. They began to see the Greeks as a kind of rampart of the west.In the 1830s, talk of “the west” and a “western alliance” became more acute, because by then Alexander I had died and Nicholas II was very despotic. There was an anxiety that Russia was not on the margins anymore and could be about to dominate Europe. Crucially, France had become a constitutional monarchy as of 1830 with the July Revolution. Suddenly an Anglo-French “western” alliance of constitutional regimes made sense in a way it didn’t before with the absolutist Bourbons. And so more and more you had speeches by French members of parliament proposingune alliance européenne ou plutôt occidentale.View image in fullscreenA battle scene from the Greek war of independence.Photograph: piemags/AlamyGeographically, where did this original version of the west start andend?This is where Auguste Comte comes in, perhaps the most neglected philosopher of the modern world. These days he is mostly remembered for inspiring the motto “Ordem e Progresso” (Order and Progress) on the Brazilian flag, and for being cited in practically every novel by the controversial French novelistMichel Houellebecq. But in the 19th century, Comte’s philosophy of positivism was immensely influential, comparable in impact only to Hegel. And Comte endlessly banged on about the importance of speaking about the west and not Europe, and defined and analysed what he meant by “the west” in many voluminous writings and in great detail.View image in fullscreenFrench philosopher Auguste Comte.Photograph: The Granger Collection/AlamyComte insisted the west needs to include what he called the five great nations, by which he meant linguistic groups: German (which for him included the Scandinavians and the Dutch), French, Italian, Iberian and English – plus the descendants of their settler colonies in the Americas, Australia and New Zealand.He tried to make “the west” as non-religious a unit as possible. It was not the same as “Christendom” – unlike more modern “western civilisation” advocates such as Samuel Huntington, Comte didn’t believe that your religion is your destiny. So he included Greece, in spite of its Orthodox religion and its being located on the edge of the Balkans, because of the importance of ancient Greek culture for Rome. And he didn’t want the west to be an ethnic unit either, so he also included Poland even though it was Slavic, because it had been Catholic for 1,000 years. So from the beginning the west went with an open-ended vision of a membership not based on genetic or religious origins, and thus allowing the possibility of expansion or enlargement of membership.That does make it sound a bit like an imperial project, though…On the contrary. Comte’s vision was that the west would one day come to include the whole world – but never through the means of conquest. He insisted empires should be abolished: Algeria should be given independence, the English should leave India, and each large country should split into smaller republics so they could be better governed.Comte included both South and North America in the supranational unit he called the west, orRépublique Occidentale. But America only signed up to the idea of the west belatedly, towards the end of the 19th century and more decisively during the first world war. Even then it did so reluctantly, mainly due to the influence of academics who had studied at German universities and German migrants. Americans in the early decades of their country’s existence had fair reasons to be sceptical, since the last thing they wanted, as the world’s first postcolonial nation, was to be associated in some cultural or political unit with the imperialist and semi-aristocratic Europeans.As the idea of the west has evolved over time, various states and regions have been added on or taken away. During the cold war, Japan was seen as part of the west – albeit mostly politically, militarily and technologically, and less so culturally. Westernisation and modernisation are not the same thing. Turkey was – and in a sense remains – part of the west because it is in Nato, even though Mr Erdoğan would hate to hear Turkey described as part of the west. The vision of the founder of the Turkish Republic, Kemal Atatürk, and of a major ideologist of Turkish nationalism, Ziya Gökalp, was for Turkey to join “western civilisation”. But currently Erdoğan seems to have different plans.View image in fullscreenTurkish soldiers on parade during Republic Day, 2015.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesWouldUkrainehave fit into this original version, into the West 1.0?Ukraine’s situation in the 2020s is comparable to that of Greece in the 1820s, in that both countries’ cultures have been shaped by Orthodox Christianity. Religion is important, but people also make their own history. I challenge anybody to explain to me how you can tell the Ukrainians they are not western if they decide to be, and if they fight as hard as they do to prevent their conversion into a satellite of Russia. The way Europeans talk about Ukraine now is very similar to how French commentators spoke of Greece exactly 200 years ago. The Franco-Swiss writer Benjamin Constant wrote that Europeans had become used to their luxuries and their peace, and in Greece he saw a people willing to fight for freedom and to be the rampart of the west, as he explicitly put it in 1825. Thus Ukraine is an additional new member, as the west is once again being redefined.View image in fullscreenZelensky meeting with Trump and European leaders in Washington, USA, this year.Photograph: White House/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockIf the idea of the west is so malleable, are there any common denominators at all?If you are asking if there is a common denominator among the widely different definitions of what distinguishes the west from other cultures, I would say there is. Thinkers ranging from the Trotskyite anticapitalist Cornelius Castoriadis to conservative liberal Raymond Aron agreed that what distinguishes the west is its capacity for self-criticism and self-correction. In the course of history you have governments that do terrible things, but then you have regenerative and corrective movements that come as a reaction to previous injustices. It seems to be ingrained in the value system of the west to be self-critical. Most criticism of the west, such as anti-colonialism, has emerged from within its own value system. Some of the most fascinating criticisms of the policies of its governments, such as by the African American novelist Richard Wright, were asking the west to do the “western” thing, to live up to its principles more consistently.View image in fullscreenProtesters demanding a ceasefire in Gaza near Place de la Nation in Paris, 2023.Photograph: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty ImagesThat sounds less like a value and more like a habit.You are right. It’s a predicament, a historical accident. The French Protestant historian François Guizot argued in the 1820s that the reason western Europe’s civilisation had not stagnated since the fall of the Roman Empire was conflict and plurality. It’s not that the Catholics didn’t want to abolish the Protestants, that the Germans didn’t want to abolish the French or the French didn’t want to abolish the Germans, the aristocrats, the democrats, and so on: it’s that nobody prevailed. So people learned to live with disagreement and conflict, and learned how to put up with each other. Not because they have any genetic or inherent superiority but just because they had to.I’m against the use of the term “western values”, because if you call something western you can’t hope for others to consider adopting it. Calling liberal democracy, constitutional guarantees, freedom of speech, freedom of sexual orientation, justice, equality of treatment, and so on, “western values” plays into the hands of Putin and every dictator. It is probably wiser to call such values by universal names if they are to have a chance to be attractive to people from other cultures. That a number of values, institutions and principles that many of us today cherish came to be combined in the west is a historical reality. But they do not need to be called “western values” because nobody has ownership of cultural productions.But I also think if we resign to abolishing the west, or allowing it to auto-destruct, many progressives will end up badly missing it. If we throw the baby out along with the bathwater, as Richard Wright put it in 1956, “the precious heritage – the freedom of speech, the secular state, the independent personality, the autonomy of science – which is not western or eastern, but human, will be snuffed out of the minds of men.”Explore more on these topicsHistory booksNatoUkraineEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

From mega-basement spa to gaudy rooftop bar, our writer takes a tourOliver WainwrightWed 3 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 10.54 EDTShareRumours have long swirled about what lies beneath the great 1960s fortress of the former US embassy on Grosvenor Square. There have been lurid fables of cold war bunkers, secret service shooting ranges, CIA interrogation chambers and even escape tunnels to Hyde Park. But none of these fictional fantasies quite compare to the underground lair that has now been excavated below the imposing block, in its new incarnation as one of the fanciest hotels inLondon.Owned by the royal family of Qatar, and operated by an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands, belonging to one of Hong Kong’s wealthiest dynasties, this former outpost of US imperialism has become a gilded temple to the new global order. Reborn asthe Chancery Rosewood, it is a beacon of luxury designed to attract the cream of the world’s ultra-high net worth individuals, so it is only fitting that it should boastthe mega-basement to end all mega-basements.Descending a grand ceremonial staircase, you find yourself in a colossal marble-lined antechamber, a four-storey volume dripping with chandeliers and veneers, reflected in a mirror-polished black ceiling. It feels like the entrance to Kim Il Sung’s mausoleum, but it is the prelude to a gigantic ballroom (serviced by its own car elevator) which sits atop a subterranean spa complex, with swimming pool, saunas and therapy rooms, dug 20 metres below the ground. Long off-limits to the public, access to the building is now limited only by the size of your chequebook. The entry-level “junior suites” start at £1,400 per night.View image in fullscreenPublic ire … protesters outside the American Embassy in 1965.Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty ImagesFor the architects, however, the ambition was to open up a building that had long been sealed off. “We really wanted to make it feel as public as possible,” says Julia Loughnane, director atDavid Chipperfield Architects, the firm responsible for this somewhat sisyphean task. “It was about stripping away all the barriers and restoring a sense of openness.”When the Finnish-American architectEero Saarinendesigned the building in the 1950s, as the first purpose-built embassy in London, it was intended as an image of open, easy-going America. It featureda public librarynext to the visa office on its raised ground floor, flooded with a sense of airy transparency and framed by a striking “diagrid” ceiling of intersecting concrete beams. But the blocky form and chequerboard facade, with windows surrounded by big picture frames of Portland stone, wasn’t to everyone’s taste. Critic Reyner Banham called it “monumental in bulk, frilly in detail,” while others compared it to a cigarette factory.Public ire against the hulk only increased in the following years, when it became the focus of Vietnam war protests and other demonstrations against American might, which in turn prompted the construction of ever more defensive barriers and security pavilions. By the 2000s, the perceived terror threat was so great, and Mayfair neighbours so irate, that the mission fled across the river to Nine Elms, retreating insidea plastic-clad castle on a hill, surrounded by a moat.View image in fullscreenMarble for days … Chancery Rosewood Jacqueline BoudoirPhotograph: Ben AndersIn many ways, Saarinen’s building is therefore more open and accessible than it has ever been in living memory. Not that much of the structure is actually still there. In order to accommodate the services required by the hotel, practically everything behind the facade has been demolished and rebuilt. The original U-shaped block has been given a fourth side in order to fit 144 suites, with an atrium in the middle. It has grown vertically too, not that you might realise at first.“Typically,” says David Chipperfield, “the conservation lobby wants to see a very clear distinction between what was there and what has been added. But we’ve developed a different strategy on a number of projects, from theNeues Museum[in Berlin] onwards, where the difference isn’t so obvious.”In the case of Grosvenor Square, his team has “stretched” Saarinen’s facade, adding a much taller sixth storey, in the same manner as the original, with an additional two storeys set back as a golden rooftop pavilion, housing a bar and two humungous penthouse suites. The move is deft and precisely executed, and justified on heritage grounds thanks to one of Saarinen’s own sketches. He came up with his competition-winning design while on his three-week honeymoon in London, where he covered the walls and mirrors of his hotel room with sketches – one of which, to the Qataris’ joy, depicted a much bigger version of the building.View image in fullscreenOriginal details … the exposed ‘diagrid’ ceiling.Photograph: Ben Anders“It was a very helpful discovery,” says Chipperfield. “I suspect Saarinen wanted a taller building, but there wasn’t the need for it, once he had laid out the functions across the full width of the square.” He’s right: the inflated version actually feels better suited to its context than the original. The removal of the defensive sloping stone bank, or glacis, that used to ring the building is a welcome change too, making the ground floor open to the pavement for the first time.The Qataris have also been lucky in that the Finn had a penchant for bling. Visit the building today and you will find the ends of the beams, which project through the facade, clad in gold-anodised aluminium, along with further gilded adornments around the windows, and a frilly gold crown along the roof. They look like the tacky trappings of a luxury hotel (or something a modernist Trump might add to his Oval Office), but these are in fact original. They were intended, Saarinen said, to “add sparkle to the facade”. (Not so the new gilded entrance canopies, which bear the gaudy hand of the Rosewood takeover.)We used up the world’s last remaining green Indian marble. It took one mason six years to cutSaarinen’s gold cruciform columns extend into the lobby too, although that’s pretty much all that’s left of his interior. Chipperfield’s team have done their best to restore and extended the diagrid ceiling, as well as preserve the light fittings and various bits of balustrade, but any sense of the original scheme has been entirely drowned out by Rosewood’s interior designers, who have cranked up the sparkle setting to the max.Masterminded by French designerJoseph Dirand, it is a fever dream of opulence, every surface writhing with exotic stones, woods and fabrics, a plush palette that looks plucked from an oligarch’s luxury yacht. There have been some attempts to riff off the original building. The new atrium, for example, is lined with giant square O-rings like the facade, but covered in dark wood. “We inspected 1.4m square metres of walnut,” a Rosewood spokesperson tells me, “in order to use 600 sq m, because we wanted it without the knots.”View image in fullscreenBald statement … the rooftop eagle, made from bits of B-52 bombers.Photograph: Oliver WainwrightSuch lengths of profligate perfectionism extend to every detail. The bathrooms in the junior suites are entirely smothered in green Indian marble (“We used up the world’s last remaining marble of that type,” they tell me proudly), which they say took one mason in Carrara, Italy, six years to cut. Another marble apparently comes from the same quarry as the Pantheon. “We have 100 types of stone from all across the world,” the rep continues, “and we are slated to be the first five-star hotel to be rated Breeam Outstanding for sustainability”. That will be some feat, if theembodied carbon footprintof crushing an existing concrete building and shipping countless tonnes of stone across the globe are factored in to the assessment.The suites swell in size as we rise through the hotel, progressively expanding to include offices, private kitchens, steam rooms and two-person bathtubs. The rooms are also configured with little lobbies, so they can be rented together for extended family and staff. One future guest recently visited with his entourage, with the intention of “taking a couple of floors,” with enough space for his doctor, chiropractor, chef and security detail. Ironically, guests here are likely to come with bigger retinues than even the ambassador would have had.The maximalism reaches an absurdist conclusion on the roof, home to a pair of 350 sq m penthouses, named Elizabeth and Charles, with rates topping £20,000 a night. “We’ve included subtle touches that reflect the royals’ interests,” the stylist tells me, as she curates a cluster of ornaments. “We have artwork relating to the queen’s brooches and love of dogs, while Charles House had nods to polo and Highgrove.” Sadly missing is a framed2009 letter from Charles to the Qataris, expressing his fury over their choice of architect for their previous London mega-project, at Chelsea Barracks. If only he had similarly intervened here to insist they retained Chipperfield for the interiors.That said, it is hard to imagine Sir David coming up with something as magnificently gaudy as the Eagle Bar on the roof. Conceived as an end-of-days art deco-ish fantasy, with a swooping multicurved ceiling, the bar looks out at the back of the gilded American eagle sculpture that has always crowned the embassy. For the first time, standing out on the terrace, you can see up close how this patriotic symbol of America’s strength and freedom is in fact made from trash – pieced together from leftover bits of B-52 bombers, forming a sinewy pile of scrap metal, daubed with gold paint.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureHotelsLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A cooperative multiplayer adventure where players are let loose to explore an open world, I’m interested to see what emergent gameplay comes out of it. Could Big Walk allow for a kind of community archaeology with friends? I certainly hope so.When games use environmental storytelling in their design – from the positioning of objects to audio recordings or graffiti – they invite players to role play as archaeologists. Game designer Ben Espositoinfamously jokedback in 2016 that environmental storytelling is the “art of placing skulls near a toilet”–which might have been a jab at the tropes of games like the Fallout series, but his quip demonstrates how archaeological gaming narratives can be. After all, the incongruity of skulls and toilets is likely to lead to many questions and interpretations about the past in that game world, however ridiculous.I used to work as an archaeologist in the analogue world, where my work consisted of excavations, fieldworks and assessment of potential development sites across the UK. Now I’m doing a computer science PhD focusing in video game archaeology, where I get tocome up with novel ways to record gameplay experiences, like doing in-game walking interviews with players in the MMO Wurm Online, or recording the location of player messages in Elden Ring.Because I know what being an archaeologist entails, I often find myself thinking about games that just have you play as a person with that job title, such as Tomb Raider or Uncharted, versus those that have you engage in work similar to what we do in the field. Walking sims like Gone Home and What Remains of Edith Finch invite you to explore a space and interpret what all of the objects left behind in the landscape mean. Dr Melissa Kagen, assistant teaching professor in interactive media and game development at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, refers to this interpretive gameplay in walking simulators as “archival adventuring”.View image in fullscreenReady for role play … Outer Wilds: Archeologist Edition.Photograph: Nintendo SwitchIt’s not just walking sims though. There is a growing genre of puzzle games that I would argue also puts you in the role of an archaeologist, piecing together clues about the past from material remains and archival material. Some people refer to these games as “Metroidbranias”, but I’m personally quite fond of them. Essentially, “information games” (as developer Tom Francis calls them) require players to come up with theories based on the information they have, to in turn use those theories to acquire more knowledge. With its central mechanic of deciphering an ancient language, Heaven’s Vault is an obvious candidate, but I would argue that other information games like Return of the Obra Dinn, Her Story and Outer Wilds (which literally has a special “archaeologist edition”) also encourage you to role play as an archaeologist, searching for clues in the environment and past records.In my own work I investigate how to preserve contemporary games, as carefully as you would an ancient artefact. SoI’ve been thinking a lot about parallels in the game world too: how players record their own experiences through screenshots, map-making and diaries, and these are also methods used by real world archaeologists. Some games use these recording methods as central game mechanics. A great example is Season: A Letter to the Future, in which you document the world on the eve of its destruction in your journal.Gamesthat inspire you to take notes also arguably result in a record of the gameplay experience – a good example is 2025’s puzzle sensation Blue Prince, which explicitly encourages players to record anything interesting they see in each of the clue-filled rooms as they explore an ever-shifting estate.Rather than raiding tombs, if you want to be a video game archaeologist, look out for those skulls next to toilets. Better yet, record them. A future games archaeologist will thank you!What to playView image in fullscreenCompulsive and stylish … Shinobi: Art of Vengeance.Photograph: SegaWe’re seeing a lot of classic 80s arcade games being rediscovered at the moment, with Gradius Origins pleasing shoot-em-’up purists and Bandai Namco’s Shadow Labyrinth thrillingly reimagining Pac-Man.Next, here comes Sega withShinobi: Art of Vengeance, a compulsive and stylish adventure platformer based on its classic series of ninja brawlers.

In February, Xbox chief, Phil Spencer,told XboxErathat he was no longer looking to take gamers from PlayStation or PC. Three months later, the previously exclusive title Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was released on PS5, and Gears of War: Reloaded is also bound for Sony’s platform. Meanwhile, Sony has brought Helldivers 2 to Xbox and more titles are likely to follow, if arecently spotted Sony job advertis to be believed.Of course, cross play – the feature of online games such as Fortnite and Apex Legends which allows people to compete against each other whatever machine they’re using – started us off in this direction. Now, in an industry where smartphone gaming is dominating (figures by NewZoo indicate mobile games were worth $92.5bn to the global economy in 2024, compared to $50.3bn for console), and the idea of two games hardware titans expensively competing on proprietary tech and software exclusives seems increasingly anachronistic.And yet … Gamers are intrinsically territorial and always have been, while brand loyalty is a key facet of fandom (and, let’s face it, capitalism) – see also Nikon v Canon, Nike v Reebok or Android v iPhone. Tech specs are only ever part of these conflicts – style, image and identity come into play too. So don’t expect Xbox and PlayStation to, in the near future, become mere apps on a multitude of faceless platforms. Several battles may be over, but the war lumbers on.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterArchaeologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Flyers posted in cities around Europe teased dates in London, Copenhagen, Madrid, Berlin and Bologna, which the band have now officially confirmed for this winter.The band will play four-night residencies at a single venue in each country, with the Spanish, Italian and UK runs coming in November, and the Danish and German dates in December.Drummer Philip Selway said in a statement: “Last year, we got together to rehearse, just for the hell of it. After a seven-year pause, it felt really good to play the songs again and reconnect with a musical identity that has become lodged deep inside all five of us. It also made us want to play some shows together, so we hope you can make it to one of the upcoming dates. For now, it will just be these ones but who knows where this will all lead.”Hopeful fans will have topre-register on Radiohead’s websiteto be in with a chance of buying tickets, a move intended to “reduce competition from bots and ticket touts”. The greater share of tickets will be apportioned to fans living nearer the shows,which they illustrated on a map.“There will be allocations for those who wish to travel inside Europe and for those outside Europe,” they said. “Our aim is to distribute tickets according to demand in a fair and geographically convenient way.”The band also said it would include a £1 levy in each UK ticket price in order to support the Live Trust initiative for arenas and stadium concerts to raise funds for struggling grassroots venues. In Europe, €1 per ticket will go to Médecins Sans Frontières, with Radiohead matching the total raised.The band’s ardent fans had guessed that the news was coming after the band updated its logo on Bandcamp and made their website show an intentional Error 404 message, and noticed that their longstanding visual artist Stanley Donwood shared the rocket-like image from the flyers on his Instagram.In case this sounds far-fetched, Radiohead fans predate Taylor Swift’s when it comes to scrying for clues about future activity. In March, Redditors noticed that the band had formed a new legal entity, a limited liability partnership with the name RHEUK25 – an arcane move they have previously made to herald their next moves. Last summer, bassist Colin Greenwood told NME that they had spent a few days rehearsing.The European dates are the band’s first live shows since 2018, when they concluded the tour for their ninth album, 2016’s A Moon Shaped Pool. Each member has subsequently continued their respective solo careers. Frontman guitarist Thom Yorke and lead guitarist Jonny Greenwood formed the Smile with jazz drummer Tom Skinner, and have released three albums to date. Yorke and Donwood recently collaborated on an art exhibition at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, which Guardian critic Eddy Frankel called“a succession of bad paintings”in a two-star review.View image in fullscreenThom Yorke and Stanley Donwood at their exhibiton This Is What You Get.Photograph: Photograph by Julian Broad, courtesy of TIN MAN ARTGuitarist Ed O’Brien released the solo album Earth in 2020, which featured Colin Greenwood on one song; the latter has also collaborated with the Belgian-Egyptian singer Tamino and toured as part of the live band with Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, as well as Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and Cave’s solo shows. Selway released his third solo album, Strange Dance, in 2023, and played drums on the fifth album by Newcastle band Lanterns on the Lake.Jonny Greenwood also collaborated with Israeli musician Dudu Tassa on the 2023 album Jarak Qaribak, comprising reworkings of Middle Eastern love songs recorded in Tel Aviv, Israel, and Oxfordshire, UK. The ensemble also features musicians from Syria, Lebanon, Kuwait and Iraq. A European tour was cancelled after the Israel-Gaza war broke out in October 2023. In 2024, Greenwood joined protests in Israel calling for the removal of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and for the release of hostages held by Hamas; he and Tassa also performed in Tel Aviv, which drew condemnation from pro-Palestinian activists.This year, the collective had two UK performances cancelled after reports of allegedly credible threats to the gigs. Greenwood said in response that they “dread the weaponisation of this cancellation by reactionary figures as much as we lament its celebration by some progressives”.Israel has proved a fraught subject for the band. Radiohead performed in Tel Aviv on their last tour, in July 2017, despite calls to cancel the performance. Yorke said at the time: “Playing in a country isn’t the same as endorsing its government.”In October 2024,Yorke walked off stage during a solo concert in Melbourneafter being heckled with pro-Palestinian remarks by an audience member. Yorke responded: “Come up here and say that … hop up on the fucking stage and say what you wanna say.” The protester then yelled: “How many dead children will it take for you to condemn the genocide in Gaza?” and Yorke ended the show.1:08Thom Yorke walks off stage after row with Gaza protester at Melbourne show – videoIn May, Yorke released a statement about the war in Gaza, saying that Netanyahu and his administration “need to be stopped” and that Hamas “chooses too to hide behind the suffering of its people”. He said that the Melbourne concert had not seemed like the right moment to “discuss the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza” and that afterwards he was shocked to see his “supposed silence … somehow being taken as complicity”. He added that he thought it would be “self-evident” from his music “that I could not possibly support any form of extremism or dehumanisation of others.”In July, O’Brien posted on Instagram in support of Irish rap trio Kneecap, which drew a comment from a fan about Radiohead’s stance on Israel. O’Brien responded: “My brothers abhor what is going on in Gaza. Just because they aren’t all over social media or using the exact wording that some feel is necessary does not mean they aren’t genuinely upset and angered by what is going on.” He added that “the algorithm feeds division and it’s not a place that many of us feel comfortable expressing our anger”.Before Radiohead’s new dates were officially confirmed, the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel had already shared a statement calling for a boycott of the tour as a result of Jonny Greenwood’s performance in Tel Aviv.“Even as Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza reaches its latest, most brutal and depraved phase of induced starvation, Radiohead continues with its complicit silence, while one member repeatedly crosses our picket line, performing a short drive away from a livestreamed genocide, alongside an Israeli artist that entertains genocidal Israeli forces,” it read.“Palestinians reiterate our call for the boycott of Radiohead concerts, including its rumoured tour, until the group convincingly distances itself, at a minimum, from Jonny Greenwood’s crossing of our peaceful picket line during Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.”Yorke has been less equivocal on the matter of Radiohead’s long-rumoured reunion. Last year, when asked by Australian radio outlet Double J how he felt about speculation over the band’s return, he replied: “I am not aware of it and don’t really give a flying fuck. No offence to anyone and er, thanks for caring. But I think we’ve earned the right to do what makes sense to us without having to explain ourselves or be answerable to anyone else’s historical idea of what we should be doing.”For many bands, a new tour would mean a new album – Radiohead’s 10th. But precedent – and Yorke’s comments – suggest no such guarantees.Radiohead’s EU tour dates in fullMovistar arena, Madrid, Spain – 4, 5, 7, 8 NovemberUnipol arena, Bologna, Italy – 14, 15, 17, 18 NovemberThe O2, London, UK – 21, 22, 24, 25 NovemberRoyal arena, Copenhagen, Denmark – 1, 2, 4, 5, DecemberUber arena, Berlin, Germany – 8, 9, 11, 12 DecemberExplore more on these topicsRadioheadThom YorkePop and rockIndieJonny GreenwoodnewsShareReuse this content"

He launched it in October 1998, after being asked to present a programme duringwhat was known as “the death slot” because of its low Thursday morning audience figures.The show, which explores the characters, events and discoveries that have shaped our world, has proved extremely popular. It celebrated its 1,000th episode in 2023 and is regularly one of the BBC’s most listened to on-demand programmes worldwide.It was also the BBC’s first podcast, and – 20 years since its 2004 launch – one of BBC Sounds’ most popular podcasts among under-35s. To this day, Bragg is the only person to have presented the show.“For a programme with a wholly misleading title which started from scratch with a six-month contract, it’s been quite a ride,” said Bragg. “I have worked with many extremely talented and helpful people inside the BBC as well as some of the greatest academics around the world. It’s been a great privilege and pleasure. I much look forward to continuing to work for the BBC onRadio 4. Thank you for listening.”Bragg’s final episode aired in July. It was a discussion on civility – and how to disagree with someone while still getting along with them. In Our Time will continue with a new host, who is yet to be announced.“Melvyn’s passion for the arts, his intellectual curiosity and his unwavering commitment to public service broadcasting over the last 60-plus years have enriched the lives of millions,” said Tim Davie, the BBC director general.“Through In Our Time onRadio4 he has brought depth, insight and humanity to our airwaves every single week for more than a quarter of a century. He leaves behind not just an extraordinary body of work, but a gold standard of broadcasting and interviewing excellence that will inspire generations to come.”Radio 4 will mark the end of Bragg’s tenure as host of In Our Time by airing some of Bragg’s favourite episodes. It will also launch a curated selection of past shows on BBC Sounds chosen by notable fans of the show.This article was amended on 3 September 2025. A previous version incorrectly stated that Bragg’s final recording of In Our Time was broadcast in August on the topic of political speeches; it was in July on the subject of civility.Explore more on these topicsRadioMelvyn BraggRadio 4BBCRadio industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Other key screenings include the European premiere of Chloé Zhao’s Hamnet, the Maggie O’Farrell adaptation which won raves for Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal at its Telluride premiere last weekend, and the UK premieres of Hikari’s Rental Family, starring Brendan Fraser and Noah Baumbach’s meta comedyJay Kelly, starring George Clooney.Bradley Cooper’s third film as director/star, standup comedy drama Is This Thing On? is also on the lineup, as isBugonia, Yorgos Lanthimos’s well-received latest collaboration with Emma Stone.No less than 247 films are on the lineup this year from 79 countries, with 103 of them made by female or non-binary directors. This proportion – 42% – is marginally down on last year (44%), although there is parity in both the official competition selection and the debut film-makers sidebar.The latter category includes some high profile names, including Kristen Stewart, whose directorial debutThe Chronology of Waterstars Imogen Poots as an abuse survivor, as well as 27-year-old Ronan Day-Lewis, whose first feature, Anemone, was co-written by his father, Daniel, who also stars.The three time Oscar winner is the highest profile booking in the festival’s lineup of screen talks, which also includes Lanthimos, Jafar Panahi, Lynne Ramsay andRichard Linklater.First trailer released for Daniel Day-Lewis’s comeback film, AnemoneRead moreThe notoriously retiring star, who quit acting for the second time in 2017 before returning to make Anemone, is likely to be a hot ticket when he takes to the stage at the BFI Southbank to discuss his new film and career to date.“We really never thought that would happen,” said Kristy Matheson, director of the festival, of the booking. Although sworn to secrecy over Anemone, which has its first screening in New York in early October, Matheson said she believed audiences would be surprised by the film, which is set in the late 1980s and features Day-Lewis and Sean Bean as brothers who served as soldiers in Northern Ireland 20 years before, alongside co-starSamantha Morton.“It’s a really exciting debut because you’ve got these great actors – a really exceptional cast – but it doesn’t get them to do all the heavy lifting. It’s bold and it takes some really big swings stylistically.”Matheson notes that this year’s crop of movies also demonstrate an appetite among film-makers to play with the form.“There are so many films that seem to really be kind of stretching the language of cinema. It’s a medium that allows us to sort of play with time and space and so many directors are doing that.”She points particularly to the roster of urgent political films on this year’s slate, including Jafar Panahi’s Palme d’Or winnerIt Was Just an Accident, about corruption and paranoia in Iran, and fellow Cannes winnerThe Secret Agentby Kleber Mendonça Filho, set during the Brazilian military dictatorship – “a classically made film, but with so many playful interventions”.Also on the programme are The Voice of Hind Rajab, Kaouther Ben Hania’s dramatisation of the 2024 IDF killing of a five-year-old Palestinian girl who lived in the Gaza Strip and Sirāt, Óliver Laxe’s Moroccan desert thriller.Jafar Panahi’s Cannes victory is a wonderful moment for an amazingly courageous film-makerRead moreBut Matheson remains sceptical that film-makers have pulled up their collective socks as an emergency response service amid widespread global unrest.“Often films that seem topical have been in the making for many years. And sometimes, it’s just that the dial hasn’t really moved.” Matheson cites Landmarks, Lucrecia Martel’s documentary about the murder of Indigenous leader Javier Chocobar and the legacy of colonialism on Latin America.“That’s a very specific case, but she uses it to really look at the effects of colonisation on her country, and you can expand out further from that and think about the effects of colonisation on many different places. So it feels a really timely concept.”The Argentine director has, like Day-Lewis, been out of the spotlight for some years: her last feature was 2017’s Zama, which was made nine years after 2008’sThe Headless Woman, regularly cited as one of the best films of the century so far.Her return, alongside that of Zhao, Ramsay and Kelly Reichardt (withThe Mastermind), gives Matheson cheer, she says, in the face of otherwise disappointing statistics. “A 42% proportion [of non-male directors on the programme] is certainly not a number about which we would say, oh, isn’t this great. But these are major female directors with incredibly strong films.”World premieres at the festival include a drama about the friendship between Kate Moss and Lucian Freud and boxing drama Giant, starring Amir El-Masry andPierce Brosnan.The London film festival runs between 8-19 October.Explore more on these topicsLondon film festivalFestivalsJessie BuckleyPaul MescalDaniel Day-LewisGeorge ClooneyLynne RamsaynewsShareReuse this content"

The figures are 28.2% higher than in 2022, when live music more or less resumed after the pandemic, and more than £2bn more than in 2019, the last fully functioning year for live music prior to the shutdown.But with grassroots venues across the UK still closing down at an increasing rate –one in four late-night venues, including clubs, have closed since 2020, with closures accelerating this year– and emerging artists struggling to make a living, the report noted that stadiums and arenas were the major beneficiaries of the increase, thanks to high-profile gigs by the likes of Swift, Dua Lipa and Charli xcx.Live analysed 55,000 gigs, concerts, festivals and events, and found that mainstream pop gigs accounted for 32.1% of consumer spend across the top 2,000 concerts of the year, a year-on-year increase of 4.7 percentage points. It flagged that the grassroots crisis extends beyond venues and artists to include promoters and festivals.Live music expenditure also remained heavily concentrated in the capital, with London accounting for 28.9% of all 2024 outlay, although Manchester experienced a bump thanks to the opening of the new Co-op Live arena. The UK’s festivals and concerts attracted more than 23.5 million music tourists in 2024.Concerts took a 75.3% share of live music spending, up almost two percentage points since 2023. The smaller share for festivals reflects the difficulties faced by that sector amid high-cost inflation – and the challenge to compete with major single-day concerts by the likes of Swift and Bruce Springsteen that force consumers to make decisions over how to prioritise their budget for live music. Live backed the widespread industry recommendation that the government should introduce tax relief to enable festivals to survive.“There is a clear role for government, given that its stewardship of the economy will determine our trading environment and audience confidence,” said Live chief executive Jon Collins.The live music sector employed more than 234,000 people in the UK in 2024, a 2.2% year-on-year increase – albeit one with low job security: 78.8% of these workers are casual or freelance. Short-notice cancellation of events put these fragile livelihoods at risk: 48% of respondents reported having jobs cancelled at less than a week’s notice.The Live Trust was established in 2024 to build on the work of the Music Venue Trust and to help develop a funding programme in which arena and stadium shows with a capacity of more than 5,000 could voluntarily add a £1 levy to ticket prices, creating a fund to support grassroots music venues, artists, promoters and festivals. In July, the Royal Albert Hall in London became the first arena to commit to the programme.“With trustees now appointed and commitments already secured from a number of high-profile artists performing stadium and arena shows throughout 2025 and 2026 the Live Trust is confident it can soon begin offering financial support where it is needed,” the report said.It defines its mission to “empower” the UK music industry as one of kickstarting economic growth, breaking down barriers to opportunity, making the industry safer – targeting worker precarity, harassment and terrorist attempts on live music events – and focusing on environmental sustainability.This article was amended on 3 September 2025. It is the Live Trust that was established in 2024. Live itself was founded in 2021.Explore more on these topicsMusicMusic industryTaylor SwiftnewsShareReuse this content"

With breathtaking confidence, Knausgård mirrors the first book, The Morning Star, giving us other, richer perspectives on the material. The book opens and closes with Tove, the manic-depressive wife of the jaded academic Arne. And her mix of despair and insight, humour and visionary brilliance turns out to be what these novels need most.“Hell isn’t the psychosis. Hell is leaving the psychosis,” she observes, awakening from the manic episode she entered in The Morning Star. Scenes from that book are then enacted from her perspective. The result is an exemplary masterclass in what fiction can offer: the expansion of readerly sympathies, bringing a sense that there are potentially endless perspectives available.Into this is thrown the possibility that there really are incarnated devils wandering the land. Indeed, three members of one of Norway’s notorious black-metal bands are murdered in a lurid act that doesn’t seem humanly possible. Throughout, devils communicate primarily with the already psychotic. There’s a kind of RD Laingian suggestion that psychotics may be more capable of imaginative insight, but also a sense that we could all see like this if we looked differently.And the point of it all? Not many readers will come away believing in devils, so what’s gained isn’t new theological insight but something else: a commitment to the possibilities of transcendence within realism. Arguably, this has been Knausgård’s project all along, even as he was describing himself clearing up his dead alcoholic father’s flat in his breakthrough autofictional series My Struggle.

In its opening section, he recalls his first love: the sweetheart he meets at the prize-giving ceremony for an inter-school essay writing competition, aged 17. Their unsophisticated, all‑consuming romance plays out across one perfect summer between Tokyo and the narrator’s coastal home town. It is convincingly drawn, though perhaps a little too saccharine (at one point the narrator, marvelling at the smallness of his lover’s hands, is “impressed that such tiny hands could do so much. Twisting open bottle tops, for instance, or peeling tangerines”). The lovers exchange letters, and occasion­ally meet up on park benches to kiss and talk. When she begins to describe to him a mysterious town, full of “made-up stories and contradictions”, surrounded by a high wall, he is as entranced by the notion of this strange place as he is by her tiny hands. This walled town, she says, is where the “real her” lives. Months later, as the new school year begins and their meetings become fewer and further apart, his lover vanishes without explanation.This story of tragic young love unfolds across short chapters that alternate with a second narrative, set in the walled town of the young woman’s imagining. Here, again, is our narrator, though now middle-aged. Here, again, is our teenage girl, still a teenage girl. In this town, the narrator works as a “dream reader” in a mysterious library, and the girl is his assistant. The town is populated by strange unicorn-like creatures and veined by willow-fringed rivers. It is serene, colourless and timeless. With its ever-changing walls, it is later described as “a dark realm of the unconscious” – but it’s hard not to read it as a symbolic manifestation of the stasis produced by grief over lost love.AK Blakemore£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionLight in the darknessThe Land in WinterAndrew MillerThe Land in WinterAndrew MillerLight in the darknessIn The Land in Winter, Miller turns to the difficulty of loving in an unlovely world. The book opens with a tragedy: a young man’s suicide at night, in the basement of an asylum, his body discovered by an older man who is woken by his absence from the ward. Both are inpatients, and neither – it turns out – is a protagonist in the novel at hand. We will return to them, but only in so far as their fates cross over with the primary characters we are about to meet. Their actions in this first chapter, however – their presence in the hospital and their deep unease with all that lies beyond – underpin everything to come.What unfolds from here is ostensibly a story of two couples over the course of one very cold English winter. It’s December 1962 and Eric Parry is a young West Country GP; Birmingham-born, he moved in boyhood “from the rough centre to its smarter suburbs”, and he’s still unsure where he belongs, conducting his rounds as a country doctor at one remove. His wife, Irene, is all at sea in their rural cottage, far from her old life in literary London.Their nearest neighbour, Bill Simmons, is a farmer, but only since last year when he bought his few acres and an awkward bull. He’s a dreamer, a drifter in search of solid ground, or maybe “a rich man’s son playing at farming for reasons of his own”. His wife, Rita, is even more of a conundrum. A year ago, she worked as a dancer in a Bristol nightclub; now she’s a farm wife, much to her own bemusement, eating spaghetti with her fingers from the pan, reading paperbacks on the floor by the Rayburn.The war and the Holocaust are both still so recent. It is a mark of Miller’s skill that he makes spare mention of either, and yet they loom large. Love does too, though. For all its wintry setting and cold echoes of the past, and for all that it opens with a death in an asylum, this is not a bleak book. The people in it yearn and reach; they make mistakes, too – some of them terrible. But all the while, somehow, you feel – you hope – they might find a way through.Rachel Seiffert£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseSocietyThe quest for a normal lifeWhat Iranians WantArash AziziWhat Iranians WantArash AziziThe quest for a normal lifeOne Tuesday in September 2022, Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, arrived in Tehran to celebrate her birthday and go shopping – to enjoy herself a bit before the start of the university term. “Mahsa had not come to Tehran to be a hero,” the historian Arash Azizi writes, or, indeed, to become a hashtag tweeted millions of times. But soon after she exited the metro, the 21-year-old was detained by the Iranian police’s moral security division for an alleged infraction of the rules around female dress: her head covering had been deemed insufficiently modest. Witnesses reported seeing police beat her; by Friday, she was dead. The result was an outcry and a record-setting series of protests. “Her murder touched a nerve precisely because so many Iranian women knew it could have been them,” Azizi notes. Although, he adds, “Amini would not have wanted any of this”.What she did want, by all accounts – and what so many Iranian women and men want, was only to live. It’s a sentiment underscored by the widely adopted slogan “Women, Life, Freedom”, and its key demand of “a normal life”.How might “normal” freedoms be achieved? What Iranians Want is methodically organised around areas of struggle including employment, environmentalism and religious freedom. The book is, in the end, a document of real optimism, and a thoughtful examination of the layers of work on which political change is built – not just on the streets, but in accumulated acts of civic faith and calculated defiance in the face of a regime that has been enduring “dual crises of legitimacy and competency” for some time.Mythili Rao£10.79 (RRP £11.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA cut aboveKilling TimeAlan BennettKilling TimeAlan BennettA cut aboveHill Topp House, a council home and the setting for Killing Time is, in Bennett parlance, a cut above: in return for a supplement on the fees, the residents benefit from “a choir and on special occasions a glass of dry sherry … only last week we went to a local farm where they have a flamingo”.Mostly, though, the elderly occupants do jigsaws and knit and eat Angel Delight. They jostle for the better class of bedrooms, which have their own washbasins. The handyman offers sexual services to a shifting clientele of both sexes in the lawnmower shed for a token sum, while Mr Woodruff, the oldest resident, diverts himself with some therapeutic flashing, being firmly of the opinion that “since this was what made his heart beat faster, it was to be encouraged”. There is, despite passing mention of iPads, a distinctly 1970s flavour to Hill Topp House. There is also a persistent low hum of fear, particularly for the less affluent denizens, that, due to some misdemeanour or a shortage of funds, they might be demoted to neighbouring Low Moor, an altogether less salubrious establishment. Life, as Mr Woodruff ruefully notes, “was snakes and ladders”.Bennett is in his element in such an establishment, attuned to both the grim apprehensions of old age and its awful comedy, and shifts deftly between the two. It is familiar territory, but nobody does it like him. Teeth and wigs go missing. So do memories and the threads of conversations. “It’s the same as us,” one resident observes mordantly. “We’re all lost property now.”Clare Clark£8.09 (RRP £8.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionThe wonder of the oceansPlaygroundRichard PowersPlaygroundRichard PowersThe wonder of the oceansThe oceanographer Evie Beaulieu stumbles on her heart’s desire while surveying the wreckage of a second world war naval battle. Thirty metres down in the waters of Micronesia’s Truk lagoon, past the Japanese submarines that have become kelp gardens and the sunken warships teeming with fish, she alights on the skeletons of two sailors that have long since become coral sculptures. Momentarily starved of oxygen, Evie foresees her own death and her ideal resting state. She decides she wants to die at sea, become a reef and thereby secure a rich and strange afterlife.Themes of transformation, loss and regeneration abound in Richard Powers’s Booker-longlisted Playground, a transcendentalist deep dive of a novel that at times almost caves under the weight of its ambitions. Ostensibly, it spins the tale of Makatea, a Polynesian atoll that finds itself preyed on by a consortium of shadowy Californian investors who want to build modular parts for vast floating cities. But that’s only the surface narrative, a protruding rock to navigate by. Playground freely references The Tempest with its framing of Makatea, an island haunted by its past and ripe for exploitation, and cites Arthur C Clarke, who said that the planet we live on should by rights be named Ocean. What we think of as Earth is “the marginal kingdom”, an ancillary to a main stage that occupies 70% of the globe. The real story – the real treasure – can be found in the water.Xan Brooks£8.49 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseHistoryYoung at heartThe Haunted WoodSam LeithThe Haunted WoodSam LeithYoung at heartDelight, as Sam Leith argues in this splendid survey of children’s literature from Aesop to Philip Pullman, lies at the very heart of the genre. A good children’s book thrills its readers with ripping adventures and strong characters; it evokes mental images that can stay imprinted forever. It revels in words: think of Dr Seuss’s stories, or Rudyard Kipling’s perfect ear in lines such as: “Go to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, and find out.” Underlying it all, children’s books tend to remain close to the deep structures of myth, providing a fast track to readerly satisfaction.Having written about ancient and modern rhetoric in You Talkin’ to Me?, Leith knows a lot about these structures and techniques. Here, he adds a more personal angle, having revisited many old favourites with his own children. The result is not an academic history so much as a thoughtful, witty and warmhearted journey through works from different periods, mostly but not exclusively British.Sarah Bakewell£11.69 (RRP £12.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseHistoryA must-read graphic historyWakeRebecca Hall, illustrated by Hugo MartínezWakeRebecca Hall, illustrated by Hugo MartínezA must-read graphic historyIn Wake: The Hidden History of Women-Led Slave Revolts, Hall combines a narrative of her own family life and ancestors with the sometimes-maddening search for enslaved women who died rather than be kept captive.At the very start, she wonders where she might find those foremothers who have resisted, and it’s this question that keeps her traveling, away from her wife and son. She burrows into archives half a world away, in London and Liverpool, through obscure histories of colonial governments, in search not only of what was written but those things alluded to and sometimes obscured by the historical record.She credits the banding together of a group of historians who have long searched the archives for the outlines of the transatlantic slave trade: “By the 1990s, some historians started using new digital technologies and began pooling their resources. Quantitative historians, who use statistical tools to study big-picture historical trends, created a vast database of research on over 36,000 slave ship voyages that took place over 400 years.”At least one in 10 voyages was disrupted by revolt. This doesn’t sound like many until one considers that for centuries no one believed these captives were capable of revolt at all. Quantitative historians could not figure out why some ships were the site of revolts, and others were not, save for a single fact: “The more women on board a slave ship, the more likely a revolt.”In examining records in London, Hall tracked reasons women were likely to rebel. Chief among them was opportunity. Women or girls were placed on the quarterdeck, near the ship’s weapons. Men were below in chains. The enslavers had no reason to believe women would fight, since their views of womanhood were more likely influenced by women in their own lives, bound by a culture of propriety.Hall has written, and Martínez has illustrated, an inspired and inspiring defense of heroic women whose struggles could be fuel for a more just future.Rosemary Bray McNatt£13.49 (RRP £14.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA multifaceted rural taleThe Mighty RedLouise ErdrichThe Mighty RedLouise ErdrichA multifaceted rural taleSet in Tabor, North Dakota, The Mighty Red is part romcom, part overblown family saga, part cli-fi warning, part absurdist heist, part small-town satire, all tumbling out amid the turmoil of the 2008 financial crash.The dominant romantic plot is constructed round a love triangle involving Kismet, Gary and Hugo. Hailing from a “rattled, scratching, always-in-debt” family, Kismet is a gothy and gifted teenager, destined for greatness beyond the town’s limits, at least as far as her sugar beet hauler mother, Crystal, is concerned. Crystal’s aspirations are dashed when Kismet succumbs to the allures of troubled jock-with-a-heart Gary Geist. He’s the son of the wealthiest landowning family around; indeed, the Geists own the farm on which Crystal works. Gary haphazardly proposes to Kismet in a silly set piece involving an errant champagne cork. Against her better judgment, mesmerised by his inscrutable vulnerability, Kismet accepts.Kismet finds herself a conflicted and reluctant bride, not only due to the presence of her mother-in-law, high-pitched Winnie Geist, but also because of the intractable “psychic magnetism” she feels towards nerdy Hugo. Much of the central act of the novel focuses on Kismet’s attempts to quiet the unease she feels as a new member of the Geist household, and her tortured attempts to make her marriage work. Throughout, Kismet’s reading of Madame Bovary – a present from Hugo – is comically symbolic.Erdrich’s achievement is pretty remarkable: a voice with brio and lightness that wends and weaves, as the titular river does, between modes and moods.Michael Donkor£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirA likable and liked leaderFreedomAngela MerkelFreedomAngela MerkelA likable and liked leaderFreedom starts with a lengthy section on Merkel’s first three decades behind the iron curtain, and it’s hard to shake the impression that this is the book she really wanted to write. Not because of any lingeringostalgie: she thought the German Democratic Republic was “as petty, narrow-minded, tasteless and humourless as it could possibly be”. Rather, this reads like the voice of someone finally unburdened of the need to keep quiet about their upbringing. Her first experiences with journalists after the Berlin wall went down, she writes, make her realise that it is difficult “to speak openly with West German media about one’s own life in the GDR”, and she explains that she was reluctant to make too much of becoming Germany’s first female chancellor because she didn’t want to be “pigeonholed”.The second half of the book, which deals with geopolitics, is more breathless, as if its pace is still dictated by her crammed diaries during the cumulative crises that marked her career: the global banking crisis that began in 2007, followed by the threat of the break-up of the eurozone, the arrival of an estimated 1.3 million displaced people on Europe’s borders in 2015, and a brewing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine.All the human qualities that made Merkel a likable and liked leader are in this book: the lack of showmanship, the understated sense of humour, the dedication to building alliances and forging compromises. And yet you finish Freedom asking yourself whether good human beings automatically make good decision-makers.Is it fair to hold one woman accountable for the mess in which the western liberal democracy she embodied finds itself in 2025, especially given her leadership of a country with more restraints on executive power than her counterparts in France or the UK? Merkel answers that question herself. What she admired most in her former patron Helmut Kohl, she writes, was his capacity for “genuinely assuming ultimate political responsibility”.Philip Oltermann£11.69 (RRP £12.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseReligionSex and the churchLower Than the AngelsDiarmaid MacCullochLower Than the AngelsDiarmaid MacCullochSex and the churchJesus never mentioned homosexuals, masturbation or the role of women in social, let alone sacred, life. Yet that hasn’t stopped millennia of godly scholars and lay Christians acting as if he had. According to these finger-waggers, extrapolating from biblical apocrypha, exegesis and their own personal fantasies, women are either morally superior or corrupt whores. Likewise, same-sex love is at one moment the emotional glue that binds celibate monastic communities and at another a sin that requires participants to be stoned.In this masterly book, the ecclesiastical historian Diarmaid MacCulloch sets out to show that the source for Christianity’s confused teachings on sex, sexuality and gender is its own untidy DNA. Woven lumpily from two distinct traditions, Greek and Judaic, each crafted in distinct ways for at least a century before Jesus’s putative arrival on Earth, the Christian church remains an essentially heterogenous affair. MacCulloch conceives it as “a family of identities”, by which he means Roman Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox, as well as a myriad other sects and splinter groups, some of which have long disappeared. And, like all families, there has been tremendous potential for bickering and bad feeling. This is obvious enough when the subject for debate is, say, the precise nature of the Trinity. But introduce human genitalia as the topic under discussion, and the result is slammed doors and sullen silences.MacCulloch deals candidly with the clumsy and often cruel way in which churches in the post-second world war period dragged their feet on contraception, gay and lesbian rights and the ordination of women. His book is not in any sense a campaigning document, but he concludes with the mild and sensible suggestion that what is desperately needed is a general agreement that the church’s teachings on sexuality have little to do with scripture and everything to do with the muddled fears, fantasies and self-interest of subsequent commentators and the historical societies in which they lived. The best thing to do now would be to look beyond the old and often damaging dogma and take proper notice of how real people, in all their splendid variety, organise their sex lives most comfortably when left to their own devices.Kathryn Hughes£17.09 (RRP £18.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClose"

My first instinct was fear that one day I would break it. It looked fragile, a needle of stone with Nyami Nyami’s serpentine body coiled up and gathered at the top, where instead of a snake’s head, a fierce fish’s head sprung out bearing sharp teeth. It was surprisingly heavy. I wore it straight away. A snake with a fish’s head. It was a strange form, as if all life forms were connected and fluid in their existence. No one had ever given me anything like this before.”It’s telling that Chikwava’s usually peppy narration slows to scrutinise this keepsake. The pendant is an emblem of Shamiso’s twisty, mixed path from girlhood to womanhood, a path reminiscent in places of both NoViolet Bulawayo’sWe Need New Namesand Tsitsi Dangarembga’s Nervous Conditions. This curious talisman represents, too, her contrarian nature. “Why can’t you be like other girls?” Shamiso’s father shouts, after she’s been insubordinate at school. It’s a question the novel attempts to tackle throughout.This vibrant, sometimes surreal picaresque begins in a post-independence Zimbabwe. The country is fissured by suspicion and social unrest. Disquiet marks Shamiso’s family life, too: she has been abandoned by her unstable mother, who “lives for the bar and carries a brick in her bag”. She lives instead with her remote father, a former soldier whose desire for orderliness is at odds with Shamiso’s dreamier sensibilities. There is a striking, phantasmagoric scene in which, dusty and disoriented, Shamiso doggedly climbs mountains outside Harare, illustrative of her pursuit of an ineffable promise ofsomethingbeyond the strictures of her sterile home life. Jimson, her Falstaffian, spirited elderly relative, is a self-taught artisan who nurtures Shamiso’s creative yearnings. Her hopes to give freer rein to this more imaginative part of herself are seemingly realised when she gets the chance to study art at the University of Brighton in England.They drift through Brighton’s bars. George has a penchant for drag that is ‘wild, colourful, fun, scary, bold and fearful’The short novel bounds through Shamiso’s fish-out-of-water campus experiences and her attempts to settle herself into a bewildering new world with a host family. We also follow her post-graduation life as she scratches a living as a sculptor in London, producing works that she hopes possess the mystique and force of Nyami Nyami.It is a commonplace of the Bildungsroman that the lead’s self‑discovery is accelerated by encounters with educative external characters. In the earlier part of the novel, this function is fulfilled by vivacious Jimson. With his hare-brained get-rich quick schemes and hot temper, he is a highlight of the novel. In the Brighton section, Chikwava seems to imply that non-binary George will take on this horizon-expanding role. Together they drift through Brighton’s bars and clubs; George has a penchant for drag that is “wild, colourful, fun, scary, bold and fearful”. The implication is that George is a kind of incarnation of Nyami Nyami’s brilliant, powerful strangeness.I write with a general tentativeness here because George’s portrayal and, more broadly, the connection between the protagonist and George was one of a number of uncertainties I had about the novel. George is described as a “terrific human being”, but I wasn’t sure that the writing helped me believe in their charisma at all. Lost on me, too, were the stakes and status of a romantic relationship that blurs in and out of focus. When considering what exactly is going on between herself and George, Shamiso declares: “We understand each other, I think”. That equivocation was something I felt too and couldn’t get past when mulling over what held these characters together.The disjointed shape of the novel also puzzled me. While flinty concision is much praised at the moment, this book could have done with being fleshed out more, not least to enrich the relationship between George and Shamiso. Halfway through, Shamiso exults that she “loves life and makes fast, flash friendships even though [she] cannot hold a thought in [her] head for longer than five seconds”; the odd pace and proportions of the novel attest to this. Jimson seems to be a central character, but is wrested from the narrative far too soon. The depiction of Shamiso’s schooldays, especially when she is exiled to boarding school by her father – the eventual springboard for her life-changing voyage abroad – is compressed and truncated. In the final third, a modelling scam arises that seems like an important plot twist; but this soon fizzles out. Shamiso also stages a risky, seemingly impactful protest in the midst of a gallery opening but this ultimately proves to be fairly inconsequential, too.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The chic Chinese-American actor who first made a splash in the silent era has been fictionalised in films and TV shows, including Ryan Murphy’sHollywoodand Damien Chazelle’sBabylon, and an excellent novel, Amanda Lee Koe’sDelayed Rays of a Star. She has herface on the quarter, the first Asian-American to be honoured in that way, and she is the subject of a page-turner of a biography,Not Your China Dollby Katie Gee Salisbury. But what about the films? This month, BFI Southbank in London hosts a retrospective of this remarkable star’s career, titledAnna May Wong: the Art of Reinvention.Wong was born in Los Angeles to second-generation Chinese parents in 1905. At the very beginning of her film career in 1921, she self-consciously told a movie magazine that she was “a considerable spot of yellow that’s come to stay on the silver of the screen”, announcing her difference as a rare Asian-American leading lady and her determination to become a star in the same breath. As her career continued, she would become more outspoken about the challenges of typecasting and her disappointment with the representation of Chinese characters on screen.“I was killed in virtually every picture I appeared in. Pathetic dying seemed to be the best thing I did,” she said. She never got the career she deserved, banned from playing romantic leading roles where she would kiss a white co-star, and passed over for Chinese roles in favour of white actors in yellowface. “She was forced to reinvent herself at different points of her career,” says season curator Xin Peng, assistant professor in film and screen studies at the University of Cambridge. “She didn’t have the option to repeat what she was doing, or retire in luxury.”View image in fullscreenHer first leading role … The Toll of the Sea.Photograph: BFIThe season traces Wong’s career from her first leading role in early Technicolor silent The Toll of the Sea (1922) through to her last film appearance in the Lana Turner vehicle Portrait in Black (1960) – plus, Flower Drum Song, the spectacular musical she was preparing to star in when she died in 1961. “By watching those films, we can imagine the kind of alternative futures that she may have had,” says Peng.There is plenty in the season to show how impressive Wong was on screen, charismatic even in small roles in silent fantasy The Thief of Bagdad (1924) starring Douglas Fairbanks, or Peter Pan (1924), beautifully shot by Chinese-American cinematographer James Wong Howe. Not to mention the unforgettable Shanghai Express (1932) where she shares a railway compartment and a worldly glamour with Marlene Dietrich. “They put Wong in the background, but I’m not sure she’s very good at staying there,” says Peng. “The Thief of Bagdad is exemplary of Wong’s ability to steal the show, because even with the most fleeting appearance, she was able to shift your attention from any of the stars. You wonder: ‘Who’s that?’”View image in fullscreenShared glamour … with Marlene Dietrich in Shanghai Express.Photograph: BFIIn search of better roles, Wong went to Europe, where she made two beautiful silent melodramas in Germany and another in the UK: Piccadilly (1929), a romance set in multicultural London, with a screenplay by Arnold Bennett. She was particularly warmly received in the UK, at least at first, after her struggles for recognition in Hollywood. In Piccadilly, director EA Dupont filmed a kiss between Wong and her white leading man, Jameson Thomas, which was cut before release against the director’s wishes. In 1930’s Hai-Tang, an early talkie filmed in English, French and German, once again her kiss, with John Longden, was cut for British audiences. Not until 1934’s Java Head would Wong break that taboo, kissing John Loder on screen – a landmark for British cinema.Wong did return to Hollywood in the 1930s, for Shanghai Express and plenty more besides. These films are something of a rollercoaster. Daughter of the Dragon (1931), in which Wong gets top billing, nevertheless contains a collection of orientalist stereotypes, with Wong playing the vengeful child of Fu Manchu. Bizarrely, Wong plays opposite Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa and Swedish Warner Oland, all three playing Chinese characters.View image in fullscreen‘It’s the most spectacular ending, with a virtuosic performance from Wong’ … Dangerous to Know.Photograph: BFIWong finally visited China in 1936, where she was roundly criticised for her portrayals of Chinese villains and stereotypes in foreign films. On her return, she determined to take charge of her career. In B-movies such as Daughter of Shanghai (1937) and King of Chinatown (1939), she was able to play characters with more control over their destiny, and formed Hollywood cinema’s first Asian-American screen couple, with her childhood friend Philip Ahn, a Korean-American actor and activist.In the Edgar Wallace adaptation Dangerous to Know (1938), Wong revives a role she played to great acclaim on stage. Although Wong plays the marginal role of the gangster’s mistress, the climax of the film contains one of her greatest moments on screen. “It’s the most spectacular ending, with a virtuosic performance from Wong, and that performance was possible because of her life experience, her whole career of being typecast in a certain character with a certain fate,” says Peng. “I was completely shocked when I first watched the film.”Wong has many such arresting scenes. Even when playing hackneyed characters, she strikes a bold, modern tone. Following the strange course of her career across these films tells a remarkable story of a woman with a powerful talent, who indeed made her mark on the silver screen – as both a brilliant actor, and a trailblazer in an often hostile industry.Anna May Wong: The Art of Reinvention is atBFI Southbank, London, until 6 OctoberExplore more on these topicsFilmBFIRaceSilent filmfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ahead of it coming out on 19 September, frontman Simon Neil will take on your questions.With Neil on vocals and guitars backed by twin brother rhythm section of James and Ben Johnston, the trio released their debut album Blackened Sky back in 2002, the start of a dogged, delightful march into the mainstream. Trailing sudden dynamic shifts and eye-catching song titles in their wake (special mention for Toys, Toys, Toys, Choke, Toys, Toys, Toys, ... And With the Scissorkick Is Victorious and There’s No Such Thing as a Jaggy Snake), they jumped to a major label for 2007’s Puzzle, to double-platinum sales with follow-up Only Revolutions and to the top of the UK album chart with 2013’s Opposites.Since then there’s been two more UK No 1 albums, headline slots at Download and Reading and Leeds festivals, and a series of arena tours. Now with what is tantamount to a greatest hits set – featuring Many of Horror, Mountains, Bubbles and so many more – the next one begins in January, with stellar support from Soft Play and the Armed. Neil has also found time for side projects Marmaduke Duke, Empire State Bastard and ZZC, and co-wrote a film, Balance, Not Symmetry, for which Biffy Clyro also did the soundtrack.It’s a huge body of work to get into with him – post your questions by Wednesday 10 September, and we’ll publish his answers on 19 September.Explore more on these topicsBiffy ClyroFilm & Music reader interviewPop and rockcalloutShareReuse this content"

The lead character in Ghost of Yōtei is a wandering sellsword from a lowly family. Her sex and lack of status mean that, following the murders of her family, she has no fixed place in 17th-century Japanese society, and there is no permitted path for her to tread if she is to get revenge on the Yōtei Six, the men who killed her loved ones. As the game’s co-director Nate Fox puts it, “Atsu is not somebody who walks in to a room and people pay respect to.”Yōtei’s predecessor, Sucker Punch Productions’ 2020 sprawling open-world gameGhost of Tsushima, is the story of a samurai, Jin Sakai, who shreds his honour to defend his homeland. Jin can’t repel the Mongols attacking Tsushima as a noble warrior, but as “the Ghost”, a fear-inspiring legend willing to use any dirty tactic to gain the upper hand, he can. If Ghost of Tsushima is about a man grappling with the trade of one kind of power for another, Yōtei sees Atsu seize the only power she can with both hands.View image in fullscreenPeak of achievement … Ghost of Yōtei.Photograph: Sony Interactive EntertainmentAtsu adopts the mantle of anonryō, a revenge spirit from Japanese folklore. By embracing this legend, she becomes a figure of fear to her enemies. While the resulting game is similar to Tsushima – in Ghost of Yōtei you also travel across a romanticised open-world recreation of feudal Japan on horseback, carving up your enemies with precise strokes of your katana – the shift from high-class samurai to vagrant sellsword shows itself in unexpected ways.“She has a different life than Jin, and we want to bring that out through interactivity,” Fox says. That means removing Ghost of Tsushima’s contemplative moments, such as those during which Jin would meditate on his surroundings and transform his struggle into haiku. “Jin was a scholarly samurai; he would pause to reflect and take in the beauty of nature. Atsu is not that person.” Those moments softened the rough edges of Tsushima, a mellowing that Sucker Punch doesn’t want to apply to the feral world of Yōtei. Atsu doesn’t write poems; she collects bounties as she hunts down the warriors that stalk Hokkaido.Sucker Punch also expresses the difference in protagonists with a subtle innovation for open-world games: a movable campsite. “We like creating features that are tonally supportive,” Yōtei’s other game director, Jason Connell, says. “Camping is something you would expect in a world like this.” And Fox adds, “Atsu’s a sellsword used to sleeping rough”.Ghost of Tsushima review – Kurosawa-inspired samurai showdownsRead moreAs game worlds have expanded and the numbers of questlines and upgrade trees have multiplied, it has created a barrier of administration between players and the worlds they’re exploring. Instead of moving on foot, they use fast travel to warp between markers on the map. “It’s discordant,” Connell says. One moment you might be in a tropical forest fighting mercenaries, the next you’re on a mountaintop upgrading a weapon before hopping to a beach to deliver a quest item. Atsu’s camp is Sucker Punch’s attempt to redress this disruption and wrap the world around the player. Quest givers, shopkeepers and key characters will now visit you, providing a way to continue your journey without interrupting the flow of the story. “It’s a convenience,” Connell says, “and a more diegetic experience.”In this way, Yōtei is set to be both an evolution of Ghost of Tsushima and an inversion. Set 300 years after the first game and on the other side of Japan, with the player wearing the sandals of a character from the opposite end of society, it promises to be a familiar world filled with unexpected change.Ghost of Yōtei is released onPlayStation 5, on 2 OctoberExplore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsPlayStation 5PlayStationAction gamesAdventure gamesFighting gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To my left, the view is not just clear but startlingly beautiful.I’m able to see back down to the tiny mountain hamlet of Gacaferi, where I’d slept the previous night, to look across the deep greenery of Deçan Gorge beyond, over dense pine forests and grasslands that pop with pink and yellow wildflowers, and gaze all the way to the 2,461m summit of Çfërla and the rugged peaks of western Kosovo’s Accursed mountains.Western Kosovo map showing areas near the routeWe are on stage nine of theVia Dinarica Kosovo, a 75-mile, 13-stage hiking trail through this storied country. The route links up to theVia Dinarica, a Balkan trail that runs from Slovenia through to Albania. The Kosovo section opened in 2015, but was recently remapped and relaunched as part of a three-year, £1.2m project funded by the Italian agencyAICS.There was a Yugoslav barracks in Gacaferi during the Kosovo war – the brutal conflict between the Kosovo Liberation Army (known locally as the UÇK) and Slobodan Milošević’s Yugoslavia, which ended with an aerial Nato bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999. UÇK fighters used to launch surprise attacks over the border ridge here, and arms were smuggled into Kosovo for use by liberation fighters.View image in fullscreenThe writer Stuart Kenny hiking near Milishevc.Photograph: Stuart KennyThe barracks is long gone. Today, the handful of locals in Gacaferi fly red Albanian flags outside their houses alongside Kosovo blue. They tend to their sheep and warmly welcome hikers, who trade travel stories while feasting on burek and Rugova cheese in the scenic guesthouse.“I wish the stones here could talk,” says Uta Ibrahimi, my mountain guide. Uta is the founder ofButterfly Outdoor Adventure, and was an integral part of the Via Dinarica Kosovo project. She also happens to be the first person from Kosovo to have climbed Mount Everest, having done so in 2017. And on 10 May 2025, when she stood on the 8,586-metre summit of Kanchenjunga in the Himalayas, Ibrahimi became the first woman from the Balkans to have climbed all 14 of the world’s 8,000-metre mountains. Uta returned to a hero’s welcome at Pristina airport. “I did it for myself, but also for my country,” Uta says. “Not just for the Himalayan views.”Descending into a meadow, we were engulfed in blueberry bushes; our boots brushing against wild strawberries and carrotsI had arrived in the capital of Pristina some days earlier. I walked past statues of Bill Clinton and Bob Dole; past new cathedrals and centuries-old mosques. Brilliant, bizarre brutalist architecture draws the gaze here – most notably theNational Library of Kosovo, formed of a cluster of exposed concrete blocks, caged in metal and topped by domes.View image in fullscreenThe National Library of Kosovo, Pristina.Photograph: Engin Korkmaz/AlamyThe Via Dinarica connects the municipalities of Peja, Deçan and Junik in western Kosovo. To start our adventure – hiking a 40-mile stint of the Via Dinarica – we drove to the city of Peja, behind which the Accursed mountains rise like fortress walls.We began on stage three, with sunny alpine views and green slopes rising to prominent peaks. Red and white waymarkers guided us up narrow trails to the 2,403-metre Hajla peak, on the border of Kosovo and Montenegro. On one side, the ridgeline slopes sharply down to the Balkan pines of Kosovo and across green valleys to the mountains of Albania. On the other side, there is a near vertical drop down to Montenegro, via rugged, exposed limestone cliff.I ate spinach burek for lunch on the summit of Hajla, sitting next to fuzzy, star-shaped edelweiss flowers, while alpine choughs circled above. We slept at ERA Lodge, a homely wooden mountain cabin run by Fatos Lajçi, a passionate conservationist. “Everything that’s in Europe, we have here,” he said; brown bears, wild boars, wolves and even the endangered Balkan lynx. This lynx is at serious risk of extinction, but has on occasion wandered by Lajçi’s camera traps.View image in fullscreen‘Locals in Gacaferi fly red Albanian flags alongside Kosovo blue.’Photograph: Stuart KennyAs we left the next morning, a shepherd sang songs of love and lost heroes to his flock, and we rejoined the Via Dinarica on a freshly built section of trail. Descending into a meadow, we were engulfed in blueberry bushes; our boots brushing against wild strawberries and carrots.It was not until a few days later, when we reachedKulla Guesthousein Milishevc, a building styled like an old stone tower, that we met another hiker.

We walked by memorials to fallen UÇK soldiers. Hard rain and mist clouded the view, but limestone monoliths poked through and wildflowers defied the clouds with sprinkles of colour. By the time we arrived in Gacaferi, the sun was shining on the tractors and goats of this remote hamlet.‘Reconnect with yourself and nature’: yoga and pristine scenery in MontenegroRead moreIn the evenings there was time for me to bug Uta for stories. She is full of tales; of crampons received as Valentine’s gifts; of poles perilously dropped at 8,000 metres; of loved ones lost on mountain faces, or to war; of emotional summit days and ecstatic nights dancing at festivals.Above the 2,400-metre mark, we hike on limestone slabs bright with lichenIbrahimi was 15 years old when war hit, but she speaks with a contagious positivity. “We had to stay inside for three months of bombing, and you never knew if it was the last day of your life,” she says. “We had to jump walls to run away from the police. That whole idea, of waiting for that moment they will come – and who knows what they will do to you – it just made us stronger and more willing to live. Then when you are free, you do not see any limits.”View image in fullscreenThe mountaineer and guide Uta Ibrahimi on the summit of Gjeravica.Photograph: Stuart KennyFrom Gacaferi, we set our sights on the 2,656-metre Gjeravica. It is a hulking peak surrounded by heart-shaped mountain lakes and patches of snow. This side of the Accursed mountains is more dramatic than the border with Montenegro, the gentle green replaced by fierce grey. Above the 2,400-metre mark, we hike on limestone slabs bright with lichen. On the summit, a Kosovo flag flies above a trig point bearing the double-headed eagle of Albania. There is a metal marker with a UÇK head, and a view over Kosovo’s flatland. Our descent is remarkably pretty, running along the secluded Gjeravica Lake, through fields of blueberry bushes, on to grassland peppered with yellow flowers.There is a soft beauty to this country; in the mint you smell in the meadows, in the sound of the whinchats on the hills, in the fluff of the edelweiss flowers on high ridges, and in the warmth of the guesthouses, where the burek is plentiful and the coffee strong.“People want somewhere quiet, super-wild, without any roads,” says Uta. “It’s here to explore.”The trip was provided byNaturKosovo.

Thompsonturned hers into a saladwith pepper, spring onion, tomatoes and cucumber. Inspired, I rushed out to buy a bag (yes, I see the irony, too) and made a salad using leftovers. And, of course, ended up with half a bag of orzo in my cupboard.Orzo salad: an anti-recipeI’ve called this an anti-recipe because I think recipes are often guilty of creating food waste by being too prescriptive. I want you to cook with love, confidence and creativity, using up whatever you can find. So, use orzo if you have it; if not, another pasta or even a grain can be quickly cooked up to create a satiating salad.Build an imaginative meal using leftovers saved from a previous lunch. Stale or out-of-date – but still safe to eat – nuts, seeds and spices. You can tell if they’re off by the rancid, oily smell and bitter taste. Other foods you can revive and reuse: wrinkly veg and wilted herbs from the crisper drawer (revived in ice water), tinned or frozen vegetables, and odds and ends of cheese.Serves2 as a main or 6 as a sideAll ingredients and quantities are optional and should be added to tasteFor the salad300-400g cooked orzo(from about 125-150g uncooked)130-260g cooked beans or pulses(eg ½-1 can drained cannellini, brown lentils or kidney beans)200-300g vegetables, cooked or raw (eg, frozen peas, diced boiled sweet potatoes, green peppers)100-200g cheese(eg, feta, parmesan, cheddar), sliced or crumbled50-100g toasted nuts and/or seeds(eg, cashews, almonds, peanuts, pumpkin or sesame seeds)50-100g other store cupboard ingredients(eg, sun-dried tomatoes, dried apricots, sultanas)30-50g fresh soft herbs(eg, parsley, coriander, mint), stalks finely chopped, leaves roughly choppedOther leftovers, to taste – I had a small amount of fennel frond pesto salad (recipe coming up in a couple of weeks), which I added to the mix.For the dressingLeftover salad dressings(eg, caesar, French, honey and mustard), or drizzle on 2–4 tbsp oil (eg, extra-virgin olive oil, avocado oil, hemp oil) and 1–2 tbsp lemon juice, wine vinegar or ume vinegar (seemy apricot umeboshi recipefor the latter)Tip the cooked and cooled pasta into a large bowl. Now build the salad like a buddha bowl, arranging each ingredient side by side, so you can see exactly what you’ve got before mixing.Add the beans or pulses, followed by the cooked and raw vegetables. Add the cheese, then sprinkle over the nuts and seeds.Top with anything else you have in the cupboard that’s packed with flavour, such as sun-dried tomatoes or dried fruit.Finish with the chopped soft herbs, then dress to taste (if you’ve got just a little dressing left in the bottle, bulk it out with a splash of oil and lemon juice or vinegar).

Food styling assistant: Caterina Cardoso.FoodWilliam Gleave’s recipes for Catalan fish salad and fried salted hakeSalt-cured fish shines in these distinctly Iberian late-summer dishesWiliam GleaveWed 3 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTShareSalted fish, and salted hake in particular, reminds me of holidays. It’s very popular in southern Europe, where there are hundreds of recipes to choose from. The salting draws out some of the water and improves the fish’s flavour and texture, and it’s a method that pre-dates refrigeration, when salt was used to preserve food.Esqueixadais a Catalan salad of sorts that’s fresh, cooling and utterly delicious. The fried hake, meanwhile, is a little heavier, but addictive and perfect for sharing with a cold aperitif. Both are regulars on our summer menu, and we often flip between the two.Esqueixada (pictured top)Prep15 minCure30 minChill2 hr+Cook15 minServes4For the salted hake2 thick hakefillets(about 200g each), pin-boned50g coarse sea saltFor the esqueixada2salted hake fillets(see above and method)2very ripe large tomatoes, coarsely grated to a pulp and skins discarded2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus a little extra to finish2 tsptop-quality white-wine vinegar1 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsleySalt,to taste2 tbsp black olives, pitted1 tbsp salted capers, well rinsed2 small salad onions, tropea ideally, though spring onion whites will do, peeled if need be, trimmed and finely slicedTo make the salted hake, lay the fish in a dish or tray large enough to hold the fillets side by side without overlapping. Sprinkle evenly with the salt, turn to coat on all sides, then cover with clingfilm and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Wash the salt off the fish, pat dry on kitchen paper and return to the fridge to chill and firm up for at least two hours, and ideally overnight.Bring a large pan of salted water to a gentle simmer, then drop in the salted hake fillets, making sure they are submerged. Take the pan off the heat and leave the fish to poach in the residual heat for six to eight minutes, until the hake turns opaque and flakes easily. Transfer the fish to a plate and leave to cool at room temperature.Gently flake the hake into a large bowl and add the tomato pulp, olive oil, vinegar, parsley and a small pinch of salt. Fold gently, taking care not to break up the natural flakes of the fish, then taste and, if need be, adjust with more vinegar and a little salt to taste.Spoon the salad into four shallow bowls, garnish with the olives, capers and sliced onion, finish with a little extra-virgin olive oil and serve.Fried salted hake with aïoliView image in fullscreenWilliam Gleave’s fried salted hake with aïoli.Prep10 minCure30 minChill2 hr+Cook15 minServes4 as a snackFor the aïoli1 garlic clove, peeled and grated2 egg yolks30gdijon mustard30ml white-wine vinegar½ tsp fine salt200ml sunflower oil50ml extra-virgin olive oil5ml lemon juiceFor the fried fish125gplain flour, plus a little extra for coating the hake250ml sparkling mineral water750ml sunflower oil, for deep-frying2salted hake fillets(see recipe above), each cut into 4 piecesSalt, to taste1 lemon, cut into wedgesFirst make the aïoli. Put the grated garlic, egg yolks, mustard, vinegar and salt in a bowl, then whisk to combine. Now comes the crucial part: whisking continuously, very slowly start dribbling in the sunflower and olive oils in a very thin, steady stream until the mixture thickens and emulsifies. Once all the oil has been incorporated, add the lemon juice and whisk again. Cover and store in the fridge until needed; the aïoli will keep for three days.Now for the batter. In a large bowl, whisk the flour and sparkling water until well combined.Pour the sunflower oil into a deep-sided frying pan and heat to 175C (if you don’t have a probe, drop in a little blob of batter: it should sizzle and bubble, not burn and smoke). Coat the salted hake pieces in a light dusting of flour, then drop into the batter. Working in two batches, lift half the hake pieces out of the batter, let any excess batter drip back into the bowl, then carefully drop the fish into the hot oil and fry for four to five minutes, until golden brown and crisp. Lift out with a slotted spoon or spider, transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper (or a rack) to drain, then repeat with the rest of the battered hake.Very lightly season the fried fish with salt, then serve with the aïoli, lemon wedges and a cold beer or vermouth.William Gleave is chef/co-owner ofSargassoin Margate, KentExplore more on these topicsFoodFishSeafoodSaladSnacksStarterTomatoesrecipesShareReuse this content"

The scanners will return one of two ripeness readings when shoppers present it with an avocado: immediately ready for smashing, or better for slicing.The One Third Avocado Scanner, named afterthe Dutch companythat invented it, promises to read the ripeness of the fruit in seconds, so shoppers can go home knowing the perfect avocado toast awaits.Lisa Lawrence, an avocado buyer at Tesco, said the scanner would help people plan their grocery shopping better and reduce waste.“Smashed avocado on sourdough continues to be one of the trendiest snacks at the moment, garnering millions of views on social media sites for recipe ideas, so we think, for that reason, the scanner will be really popular with shoppers,” she said.The five Tesco stores piloting the scanner are the Cheshunt Extra in Hertfordshire; the Colchester superstore in Essex; the Stratford-upon-Avon superstore in Warwickshire; the Wokingham superstore in Berkshire and the Salisbury Extra in Wiltshire.Avocados have become a breakfast staple in Britain despite concerns about their carbon footprint, water usage andfears about ethical standards on farms. Tesco said it sold nearly 15m more avocados last year compared with the previous year.The supermarket has worked with the fruit supplier Westfalia Fruit on the avocado scanner project. Last year the companies worked together to test out the idea of etching or“tattooing” avocadosas a way to reduce the millions of plastic stickers used to label them. They also introduced cardboard and paper packaging across all Tesco’s packed avocados, which Westfalia said helped save 20m pieces of plastic a year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How to make the viral (and delicious) Korean treatFrom Korean cafes to TikTok stardom, banana coffee is having a moment, and it’s blissfully easy to whip up at homeJaina Rodríguez-GreyWed 3 Sep 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 3 Sep 2025 14.18 EDTShareCoffeegets paired up with flavors of all kinds – vanilla, hazelnut, chocolate – and each one coaxes something new out of your morning brew. But there’s a fresh pairing you might have seen bubbling up onTikTok: banana.Yeah. Banana in your coffee. It’s not as strange as you might think. I spent most of the summer swimming in banana lattes, affogatos and cold brews, and now I’m a believer. Here’s why I think you might be too, and how easy it is to make your own at home.Why it worksMost of the syrup flavors at your local cafe skew toward dessert: cinnamon, almond, caramel. They’re sweet, familiar, and they take the edge off espresso without drowning out its flavors.Banana brings the same sugar-and-smoothness treatment, but with a twist. There’s a fruit-forward nose that brightens the subtler notes in light and medium roasts, plus a creamy lift, almost custard-like, with a soft vanilla undertone that wraps it all together. It’s a complex, multi-layered flavor, and once you’ve tasted it withcoffeeyou’ll wonder how you ever doubted it could be anything butdelicious.I first encountered it about five years ago at a South Korean-owned cafe in Portland, Oregon, calledSoro Soro. I saw banana latte on their menu and I just had to try it. I was amazed that it wasn’t syrupy sweet, and tasted like fresh bananas, not banana-flavored candy.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jaina Rodríguez-GreyThe key ingredientUnlike most coffee flavorings you’ll find at a cafe, we’re not talking about banana-flavored syrup here. The primary ingredient in any banana coffee preparation is banana milk. It’s not a plant-based concoction like soy milk or almond milk; it’s ordinary dairy milk used as a vehicle for banana concentrate.One of the most popular brands, Binggrae, is widely available everywhere fromAmazontoInstacart, and is ubiquitous at Korean groceries likeH Mart. It’s been steadily gaining popularity over the last few years, thanks in part to K-pop fans who noticed their favorite idols drinking Binggrae in video clips online.$7.99 at Instacart$12.99 at AmazonBut it’s been around since the 1970s, when the South Korean government was trying to encourage people to drink more milk to boost the domestic dairy industry and combat still-widespread malnutrition in the aftermath of the Korean war. At the time, bananas were a popular (if scarce) fruit, so companies like Binggrae seized the opportunity and made the first of the banana milks that you may have seen popping up at US cafes in the last few years. There are tons of competitors out there too;Haio,Mooala, and evenNesquikhas a banana milk mix now. You can evenmake it yourself!View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jaina Rodríguez-GreyQuick and easy banana iced latteThis one takes just a minute and requires noespresso machine, but it tastes so much like a cafe-fresh iced latte you might find yourself spoiled for them. It’s the recipe I have been sipping on constantly this summer as Seattle is blasted by heatwave after heatwave.In a mason jar, take two tablespoons of good quality instant coffee (my favorites areColcafeorVerve), and add a splash of hot water, just enough to dissolve the crystals. Stir. Add ice, pour your banana milk over the top (about 10-12 ounces), close the jar and shake vigorously. What you’re doing here is threefold: you’re aerating the mixture, making it creamier, you’re breaking off tiny ice crystals that help that creaminess stick around, and you’re making sure the whole thing is fully and completely mixed. Take off the lid and enjoy right from the jar. Seriously, it’s ridiculous how good this one is.Classic iced latte with banana milkNormally if you’re making an iced espresso drink, you’re adding a flavor syrup and two shots of espresso to a cup full of ice, then pouring your milk of choice over it. For banana coffee you’re doing most of the same work, but with a couple of differences.Don’t own an espresso machine yet? TheDe’Longhi Stilosa EC230was the Guardian’s favorite budget pick, when we evaluated thebest espresso machines.Grind, and pull your two espresso shots however you normally do. If you like the level of sweetness of flavored syrups, add about a teaspoon of sugar to the bottom of your glass. Most brands of banana milk are sweet, but I find fresh espresso (especially a medium or dark roast) really benefits from a tiny extra bit of sugar, since the sweetness in the banana milk itself is not as potent as the sweetness you get out of a commercial syrup. Next, add the coffee and give it a stir. Add your ice, pour the banana milk over the top, give it a stir and you’re all done.Hot latte with steamed banana milkThis is where things get fun. Usually, when you’re steaming milk for a hot espresso beverage you’re frothing it up on its own. Any flavoring goes into the coffee before or after the milk. Here though, we’re going to be steaming the flavored milk itself.Pull your espresso shots like normal, then begin steaming. You should expect it to froth up a little differently than whole milk does. Binggrae in particular is shelf stable, so it includes both stabilizers and a couple of additives for texture like dextrin and carrageenan. These add viscosity to the milk that’s really noticeable when you’re steaming it. It doesn’t really want to froth up on its own, so I’ve found you might need to give it a little encouragement. Submerge your steam wand into the milk, turn on the steam, and once it’s up to temp, pull the milk pitcher down, to bring the steam wand tip to just beneath the surface of the milk. This will get a little more aeration going and get you a thicker froth.There are many, many more ways to enjoy banana milk plus coffee, but between these and an Amazon (or H Mart) cart full of banana milk, you should have plenty to get started.
