The backlash – led in part by the Newcastle-based bakery chain – was swift: Osborne, branded posh and out of touch, was forced into anembarrassing U-turn.Since then, the price of a Greggs sausage roll has almost doubled to £1.30 and consumers are facing a renewed rise in food price inflation.Growing numbers of people are stopping to think twice about buying a takeaway treat or grabbing their lunch on the go as the cost of living squeeze pushes consumers to the limits of what they are willing to spend.Whileprices at Greggs have risen, its share price has halved in a year amid a slowdown in sales growth. In July its boss wasforced to deny that Britain has reached “peak Greggs”. Other on-the-go food retailers, including Pret a Manger, are also testing consumer appetite for pricier baked goods,salads, sandwiches and coffees.View image in fullscreenPret a Manger is also testing consumer appetite for pricier salads and sandwiches.Photograph: Jamie Orlando Smith/Pret A Manger/PA“There’s a limit to how much people are prepared to pay for certain products,” said Richard Lim, the chief executive of the consultancy RetailEconomics. “It’s snapped for some consumers with some products.”He said Labour could take some flak. “There’s a level of awareness [among consumers] that a lot of the inflationary pressures they’re facing have been the result of some of the decisions the government have made.”At the height of the pastygate scandal, the now chancellor, Rachel Reeves, joined Ed Miliband and Ed Balls – the then Labour leader and shadow chancellor – on atrip to Greggs in Redditchfor a media stunt at Osborne’s expense. They bought eight sausage rolls (costing a total of £4.70) a day after Osborneadmitted to MPshe could not remember when he last had a Greggs pasty.Ed Miliband goes for sausage rolls at Greggs after pasty tax rowGuardianAs Reeves prepares her November budget, Greggs sausage rolls are atalking point on TikTokamong Britons nostalgic for pre-pandemic prices, while the price of Pret sandwiches, salads and coffees are the recurring theme of outragedRedditthreads.Official figures show headline UK inflation is running at 3.8%, the highest rate in the G7 and almost twice the Bank of England’s 2% target. Rising food and drink prices have powered much of the increase, with the rate of food inflation expected to peak above 5% this autumn.Prices for fast food and takeaways – including cooked pastry-based snacks, sandwiches and hot drinks – are rising faster than general inflation, with an increase of 33% since 2020.Business leaders have said that the £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions has forced them to raise prices, to pass on costs. Any further tax rises would compound the problem, they say.But companies could find it harder to squeeze the British consumer with further price increases after the eye-watering rises of the past five years.“Consumers are being much more careful,” said Lim. “The big thing for consumers is that, while inflation is down from the peak a few years ago [of 11.1% in late 2022], this does not mean prices are falling. The level is significantly higher.“For some categories – on-the-go food and coffee might be one of them – prices are meeting a level where they are really testing that elasticity of demand.”This month Pret announced it was caving in to competition from supermarkets bylaunching meal deals, while its owner, JAB, wrote down the value of the chain by a third amid “intense strains” on the hospitality industry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Despite sky-high inflation, the richest fifth maintained their spending.The Treasury said it was taking action to help families, including through free breakfast clubs for all primary schoolchildren and expanding free school meals. “We know that while the economy isn’t broken, for working people it feels stuck,” a spokesperson said.Despite the mounting pressure on living costs, official figures show household savings remain above pre-pandemic levels. Annual wage growth is also running above inflation.However, not everyone has benefited equally. Recent strong levels of pay growth are fading, unemployment is rising and talk of tax rises is all over the media. Consumer confidence has fallen sharply in recent months, in a development economists say could translate into weaker levels of household spending in the near future.Dean Turner, a UK economist at UBS Wealth Management, said some companies were probably facing a decline in sales amid shifting consumer preferences.Greggs has blamed hot weather this summer forharming its sales, while a trend for healthier food, in an increasingly budget-conscious nation, is hitting takeaway food retailers.“There is clearly pricing power in certain areas of the economy – the Instagram economy, I call it, of experiences, restaurants, activities, and entertainment,” Turner said.“But it does seem that spending is shifting away elsewhere as people prioritise those other aspects, because the simple thing is you’ve got high inflation and your wages aren’t increasing as much.”Explore more on these topicsInflationFood & drink industryEconomicsRetail industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s how to stop himJonathan FreedlandIt’s not too late to puncture the Reform leader’s populist myth. His ‘make Britain great again’ act is out of step with the British peopleFri 19 Sep 2025 12.02 EDTLast modified on Fri 19 Sep 2025 15.02 EDTShareThe march towards the darkness is becoming a sprint. In the US, warnings about theautocratic ambitions of Donald Trumpthat were once dismissed as hyperbole and hysteria now seem, if anything, too mild. Faster than most imagined, he has moved to weaken institutional checks on his power – whether the courts, the universities, the civil service or the press – and now has set to work gagging his critics, even, it seems, to outlaw large swathes of the opposition.This week saw the suspension by a major broadcasting network, Disney-owned ABC, of a late-night talkshow, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, following remarks Kimmel had made about the killing of the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel did not criticise Kirk himself – an act now considered all but blasphemous in the US – but rather Republicans’ reaction to his murder, especially their eagerness to “score political points from it”.That was enough to prompt Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed chair of the Federal Communications Commission – the body that grants, or revokes, licences to broadcast – to come on like a wannabe Tony Soprano, all but cracking his knuckles as he said: “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.” The threat worked: Kimmel is off the air.Of course, this is no one-off. Trump is also trying to cow the US’s biggest newspaper, filinga $15bn lawsuit against the New York Times, accusing it of “spreading false and defamatory content”. The NYT has the resources to resist, but smaller US papers will have got the message. They could hardly be blamed if they now pull their journalistic punches, if only because they do not have the money to pay for a protracted legal battle against a billionaire president.But the Trump administration is not confining its assault to the media. The Kirk killing has handed it an opportunity to crack down on dissent itself. Witness the promise Trump aide Stephen Miller made this week – onthe Charlie Kirk podcast– to take on those left-of-centre organisations whose “messaging” is “designed to trigger and incite violence”. It is hardly a stretch to assume that Miller will define that category very broadly, so that it sweeps up most of those who express opposition to Trump. If that seems alarmist, recall that, even before Kirk was killed, Miller was calling the Democratic party a “domestic extremist organisation”.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage at a Donald Trump rally in Reading, Pennsylvania, 4 November 2024.Photograph: nigel_farageIn the UK, we like to think we can watch all this with, if not smug distance, then a measure of relief. It’s true that we are a long way from the precipice to which Trump has taken the US. But last week between 110,000 and 150,000 Britons took to the streets of London, heeding the summons of the rightwing agitator andserial convictwho goes by the name of Tommy Robinson.It’s worth stressing that this was not a Reform or Conservative rally that was hijacked by Robinson. This was his event. Britons know who Robinson is and what he represents – and yet up to 150,000 of them marched behind him. They were undeterred by those who had labelled it a far-right protest and, indeed, by the racist rhetoric that camefrom the platform. Britain has an admirable history of confining the far right to the margins, ensuring that it had not, until now, demonstrated this kind of strength in numbers. So last Saturday should be understood as a watershed.0:24Trump says Jimmy Kimmel 'was fired for lack of talent' – videoNot least because of one speech in particular. Elon Musk, via video link, told the crowd “violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die.” He added that the Labour government, democratically elected a year ago, needed to be brought down. This was one of the most powerful men in the world issuing a call thatmay not have broken the lawbut whichseemed to give approval in advance for rightwing political violence in Britain.And yet the British prime minister did not rush to condemn this incendiary intrusion into our politics. Indeed, Downing Street said nothing at all until prompted by reporters’ questions, and MPs’ demands, the following day. We often fault those guilty of overreaction. But, at a moment like this, underreaction is the greater sin.The polls are telling a very stark story. Absent a dramatic shift, a party of nationalist populism is on course to beat both Labour and the Conservatives at the next election, and very probably form the next government. Nigel Farage may be no fan ofTommy Robinson, but he is Trump’s loudest UK cheerleader; he does not condemn the current US gallop towards authoritarianism but rather stands alongside those responsible for it. If we want to prevent Farage doing to Britain what Trump is doing to the US, we need to halt the advance of Reform.The first move in that effort is to puncture Farage’s core claim: that he somehow speaks for the British people, that his views reflect the “commonsense” views of the silent majority. It’s not true. On issue after issue, including those that define him, Farage is an outlier, articulating the positions of a noisy but often small minority.He was the chief advocate of Brexit, a decision so calamitous that only31% now say it was the right move. Indeed, a healthy majority, 56%, favour its reversal and want to rejoin the EU. Farage is on the wrong side of that number.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Farage is out of step with the British people.Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert … who is the next to be silenced? | Moira DoneganRead moreBut surely on the issue he has made his own, immigration, he is in tune with the public? After all, Labour seems to have built its entire political strategy on that assumption. And yet, the numbers tell a different story. While 81% of Reform voters believe migrants have undermined Britain’s culture, only31% of Britons in general believe that. Ask about the effect of migrants on the economy and you get a similar picture. It’s Reform that is badly out of touch.You can keep doing this – and Labour must, pointing out that Farage speaks for the fringes not the centre. Britonsdon’t support handing Afghan refugees back to the Taliban, asFarage advocates. They do not agree thatBritain has become North Korea– and they don’t regard as a patriot someone who sits in Washington and tells a committee of American politicians that we have. They don’t reply to the question, “Which world leader do you most admire?”, with the words “Vladimir Putin”, as Farage did. And nor do they think that the Liz Truss measures that sent the UK economy spiralling represented “the best Conservative budget since 1986”, to quote Nigel Farage.Reform’s opponents need to expose every one of these gaps between Farage and the electorate, recasting Farage as a figure of the fringes. But this can’t be a task forLabouror the Liberal Democrats alone. Any party that claims to value democracy, including what remains of the Conservatives, and that sees how swiftly nationalist populism leads to authoritarianism, needs to engage in the same effort and fast. We all do. As Americans are learning to their cost, you cannot delay – otherwise the freedoms you thought would last for ever can vanish, in the blink of an eye.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist.

From kimchi and natural yoghurt to fibre-rich jerusalem artichoke and probiotic shots, microbiome-nourishing foods and supplements once deemed left-field have become everyday essentials for many – with plenty of evidence that they help our gut bacteria to thrive.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.While many of us assume that diet is the only way to feed the trillions of microorganisms (including bacteria, fungi and viruses) that make up the microbiome, there are myriad daily habits that can help nurture this important part of the body.“Diet often takes centre stage in discussions about the gut microbiome, and rightly so – it plays a major role,” says Dr Emily Leeming, a scientist, dietitian and research fellow at King’s College London, and author ofGenius Gut.“But it’s just one part of a much bigger picture. Our entire lifestyle – from stress levels and sleep quality to time spent outdoors – profoundly shapes our gut health. Everything we come into contact with can influence the ecosystem that lives there.”Since the gut has abig influenceon all aspects of our physical and mental health, it makes sense to look after the microbiome that drives it. Here are just a few ways to do that.KissYou may have to kiss a lot of frogs before finding your prince – but here’s an upside: each (French) kiss can transfer up to 80m microbes in just 10 seconds, making some of those awkward dates potentially worthwhile … at least for your gut.“The mouth is the gateway to your gut and digestive tract, and it’s home to billions of bacteria that can easily make their way down,” says Leeming. But before you pucker up, there is a catch. “It does matter who you kiss,” says Amati. “If someone has strep throat or an imbalanced oral or gut microbiome (which can manifest as persistent bad breath, tooth decay and bleeding gums), those are not microbes you want to share.”The more intimate we are with another person generally, the more microbes we will exchange – so pick your relationships wisely.Get in the gardenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Steinthaler/Getty ImagesSoil is “the richest habitat on the planet” and contains billions of beneficial microbes that can make their way into and on to the body, says Leeming. In fact, a remote group of Amazonian hunter-gatherers, who live in close contact with nature and walk barefoot on nutrient-rich soil daily, were found to have themost diverse gut microbiota ever recordedin humans.Most of us wear shoes outdoors, but there are gut health benefits to be gleaned from going barefoot in the park, as well as spending time in forests and getting our hands dirty in the garden or allotment. Not only do these activitiesboost mental wellbeing, they’ve also been linked to greater microbial diversity. Research shows that people – especially children – who garden tend to have more diverse gut microbiomes than those who don’t.The more we can engage with the natural environment, the better, whether that’s tending to a house plant or hugging a tree. “Forest air is much richer in beneficial microbes than the air inside, so even breathing fresh air can improve your health,” says Leeming.Cook, then cool, your carbsMake the most of starchy, carbohydrate-rich foods, such as potatoes, rice, pasta and bread by allowing them to cool after cooking, and then eating them. This creates resistant starch, a type of carbohydrate that resists digestion in the small intestine. “Instead, it reaches the large intestine, where our good bacteria feed on it,” saysnutritionist Emily English. “In doing so, they produce compounds that help maintain ahealthy gut lining, reduce inflammation and even support blood sugar balance.” You can reheat these foods after they have been cooled and the resistant starch will remain.Whether it’s a pasta dish you eat the next day or fresh bread you freeze and toast later, this simple kitchen hack transforms the gut-boosting potential of everyday foods, making them better for your gut than they were when you first cooked them. “Overnight oats and not-quite-ripe green bananas also offer plenty of resistant starch,” says English.Take a breathA growing body of research shows ourgut microbiome and emotional wellbeing are intrinsically linked. Stress and mood disorders such as depression can evenaffect the composition of our gut bacteria. Most of us can’t just opt out of stressful lives or situations, but we can tap into our breathing. Deep, conscious breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system (our body’s “rest and digest” mode) promoting repair, regeneration and a calmer state of mind.“When we use the breath in a certain way, we speak the nervous system’s language,” says transformational breathwork coach Rob Rea. “This helps the body shift out of the high alert, fight-or-flight sympathetic response and into the parasympathetic rest-and-repair mode. In this calmer state, the body’s systems can work at their best, restoring balance, repairing everyday wear and tear, and counteracting the effects of stress.”An extended exhale always slows the heart rate and signals to the nervous system that it’s time for calmBy contrast, when we remain stuck in fight-or-flight, the body diverts resources away from functions such as digestion, channelling blood toward the muscles that would have helped us escape a threat in the wild. This survival strategy leaves the digestive system under-resourced, slowing motility, reducing blood flow and limiting the production of digestive enzymes to break down food. Shifting back into the parasympathetic state reverses that pattern, allowing digestion to resume its full function, with improved circulation, healthy motility and better nutrient absorption.Before breathwork, Rea encourages his clients – who include business executives and celebrities – to master the simple (but surprisingly difficult) practice of sitting still, in silence, for five minutes a day. “It sounds easy, but with attention spans now hovering aroundeight seconds, it’s more challenging than ever,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He uses the acronym N-G-S-E: Nose, Gentle, Slow and Expansive as a memorable guideline. “Start by breathing in through your nose for a count of three, then out for three,” he recommends. “When that feels comfortable, build up to five or six counts. From there, begin to lengthen the exhale through the nose: breathe in for five, out for seven. An extended exhale always slows the heart rate and signals to the nervous system that it’s time for calm.”Eat dark chocolateView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Geanina Vlasceanu/Getty ImagesIf you consume the right kind, chocolate can be good for your gut health. “Dark chocolate – made of at least 75% cocoa – is rich in powerful plant compounds called polyphenols, which feed your good microbes andact as antioxidantsin the gut,” says Dr Federica Amati, head nutritionist at the wellness companyZoeand author ofEvery Body Should Know This. “We tend to forget that chocolate is made from fermented beans, so you can also count it as one of your 30 plants a week.” With an array of healthy minerals, fibre and other micronutrients, just be sure you choose options that contain as few ingredients as possible – Lindt Excellence Dark 85% Cocoa and Green & Black’s Organic Dark 85% Chocolate are great options.Gargle and humThe vagus nerve – which connects the brain to a number of different organs, including the gut – runs from the brainstem down through the neck to the abdomen. According to Leeming, it is one of the most direct ways that the gut can communicate with the brain. “Certain beneficial bacteria produce neurotransmitters – like gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin – that stimulate vagal receptors in the gut wall,” saysNahid de Belgeonne, somatic movement educator and author ofSoothe.Research suggeststhat people with higher vagal tone (the level of activity of the vagus nerve) tend to have more diverse and balanced gut microbiomes – and vice versa. “If the vagus nerve is impaired, it can contribute to conditions in your gut that make it harder for your microbiome to thrive, like slowing gut motility and reducing the release of digestive juices,” says Leeming, “although it is just one of many factors that influence gut health.”While more research is needed, stimulating the vagus nerve in certain medical settings has been shown toinfluence gut motility(the movement of food through the digestive system) and improve microbial balance, inflammation control and immune function. But where to start? “Gargling is a simple technique – the mechanical stimulation of the throat muscles activates vagal pathways,” advises De Belgeonne. “Singing and laughing also create beneficial vibrations and emotional shifts that are believed to enhance vagal tone.”Other simple practices include humming while exhaling, or massaging the sides of the neck, especially around the sternocleidomastoid muscle on either side, where the vagus nerve runs close to the surface.Get a dogView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Eric Isselee/Shutterstock“The people we live with – whether family, friends or flatmates – can influence our gut health, and the same applies to the animals who share our homes,” says Amati, adding that those with pets are more likely to havediverse gut microbiomes. Why? Because we naturally exchange bacteria with those we are in close proximity to. And our pets – whether we like it or not – are curious creatures who like to nudge their noses into all sorts of questionable places, exposing themselves (and, by extension, us) to a wider variety of microbes.Studies show that early-life exposure to furry pets (such as cats and dogs) both before and in the first few months after birth, canenrich the gut microbiome with beneficial bacteria, such as ruminococcus and oscillospira. They are linked to a reduced risk of childhood allergies, including asthma, as well as lower rates of obesity.The benefits don’t stop there. In adults over the age of 65, canine companionship has been shown toincrease populations of beneficial bacteria, while simultaneously suppressing harmful strains. So if you needed another reason to welcome a pet into your home, your gut just gave you one.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingDiets and dietingHealthMicrobiologyBiologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How do you flip the script and subvert expectations for a long-running, much-loved cosmic saga? The truth is, nobody really knows, because other than George Lucas, no one has really tried.The prequels, for all their beige politics and clunky dialogue, were at least the Star Wars creator’s brave if misguided attempt to rewire the mainframe: a widescreen tragedy about the corruption of democracy, wrapped in a toybox of podracers and CGI frogmen with comedy accents. Elsewhere, experiments have been patchy. The excellent Rogue One took a gritty war-movie detour, only to end with a Vader cameo. The Last Jedi flirted with real subversion, then got bludgeoned into retreat by a panicked studio. And Disney+ has provided everything from samurai-inspired anime shorts (Visions) to Ewan McGregor brooding in a desert hut (Obi-Wan Kenobi). Bold strokes, yes – but ones that have usually been followed by a hasty retreat back to the warm embrace of lightsabers and Skywalker surnames.Which brings us to Star Wars: Starfighter, introduced to the world this week via afirst-look picture of Ryan Goslinglooking distinctly sun-soaked floating on what appears to be the Mediterranean Sea. On the face of it, the new film looks to be the least adventurous new franchise addition since Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. But it’s not just the oddly Ikea-ish, flat-pack-ready title, which feels as if it really ought to be one of those Hollywood placeholder monikers. And it’s not the nagging sense that this film series is being mapped out like a Death Star trench run, or the decision to cast Gosling in the lead, when Star Wars has always prioritised storytelling over megastar wattage.View image in fullscreenThe warm embrace of Skywalker surnames … John Boyega and Naomi Ackie in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyPerhaps it’s that, right now, we don’t know much about the new film. What we do know is that Gosling plays a new character, Flynn Gray will reportedly play his nephew, and Amy Adams will reportedly play the latter’s mother. Mia Goth and Matt Smith are down to portray baddies of some sort, andthe whole thing is describedas an original adventure, set in a “period we haven’t seen explored yet”. The new entry has been placedfive years after The Rise of Skywalker, which means Poe, Finn, BB-8 and the bloody porgs may turn up. Are they going to bring Palpatine back again as a zombie clone of the zombie clone we saw in The Rise of Skywalker? Is someone finally going to explain what the point of Snoke was?This all feels far too close to a period none of us particularly want to revisit (unlike the forthcoming The Mandalorian and Grogu, which will arrive in cinemas before Starfighter). It could have been set 10,000 years after the original trilogy, or in a completely different part of the galaxy that had never heard of the Skywalkers. It’s possible the latter could still apply – but then why opt for a timeframe that leaves the door wide open for sequel trilogy characters to return?As we sit and ponder all this stuff, right now we’ve only really got that snap of Gosling all at sea to keep us focused. At least it’s not another desert. And yet, the longer Lucasfilm stays in the really rather joyless Skywalker sandpit, the less chance it will have of escaping creative drought. If director Shawn Levy and his team really wanted to rip up the rulebook, you’d think they would get as far away from The Rise of Skywalker as it is possible to go.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekStar WarsRyan GoslingScience fiction and fantasy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are genuine fears that Israel is about to annex the West Bank or make Gaza so uninhabitable that Palestinians are forced over the borders into Jordan or Egypt, so destroying the possibility of a Palestinian homeland. Recognition that Palestine is a state with the right to self-determination is an attempt to show Israel cannot simply annex land that the international court of justice has declared to be illegally occupied.The UK placed a set of conditions on Israel – and not the Palestinians – that if met would have meant Britain would hold back from recognition. These were: a ceasefire in Gaza, an end to Israel’s military campaign, and a commitment to long-term negotiations on a two-state solution.The UK has said it envisages a Palestinian state in which Hamas is disarmed, plays no part in the future government, and the leadership of the Palestinian Authority is subject to elections within a year.The requirement for Hamas to stand aside, seen as a precondition of recognition by France, was backed in the New York declaration endorsed by the Arab states on 29 July and then passed by the general assembly on 12 September.What does recognition entail practically?Recognition is largely symbolic. When the UK’s position was announced the then foreign secretary, David Lammy, said: “It will not change the position on the ground.”But it allows the UK to enter treaties with Palestine and would mean that the Palestine head of mission becomes a fully recognised ambassador. Some argue that a greater onus would be placed on the UK to boycott goods imported into the UK by Israel that come from the occupied territories. But it is seen more as a statement on Palestine’s future, and disapproval of Israel’s refusal to negotiate a Palestinian state.What other countries is the UK joining in recognising statehood in some form?Currently, the state of Palestine is recognised by more than 140 of the 193 member states of the UN.Macron has led the current drive for recognition and if events go ahead as planned it will mean four of the five permanent members of the UN security council recognise Palestine next week. The US as the fifth UN security council member can continue to veto Palestine obtaining voting rights at the UN. It currently has speaking rights.Other countries on the brink of recognising a Palestinian state are Canada, Australia, Belgium, Portugal, Luxembourg and New Zealand. They are likely to recognise it either immediately before or at a UN special conference on a two-state solution due to be held in New York on Monday, the day before the UN general assembly high-level week begins. One or two of these countries may make recognition conditional upon Hamas being disarmed.Why is next week’s two-state solution conference particularly significant?The conference is the culmination of months of diplomatic work led by Saudi Arabia and France sketching out what Gaza will look like after the war, including in the now widely supported New York declaration. It will be a moment of high emotion for all sides.What do opponents of recognising statehood say?There are two different criticisms. Israel and the US claim that recognition is a reward for the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023. Israel also claims that the Palestinian Authority leadership is endemically corrupt, repressive and that the promise to hold elections has been repeatedly made only to be deferred. They claim no partner for peace exists.A second criticism is that the two-state solution has become a diplomatic fig leaf, and a relic of the past dating back to the 1993 Oslo accords that proposed a Palestinian state on 1967 borders. These critics argue the emotions ingrained by 7 October mean support for the concept has drained away on both sides of the divide.In a new book, Tomorrow is Yesterday, two veteran negotiators – Robert Malley and Hussein Agha – describe the two-state solution as a meaningless distraction and a performative notion used by diplomats for 30 years to avoid finding real solutions. They say without practical steps to make Israel engage, “the offer of recognition won’t change the life of a single Palestinian”.Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesGazaMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelHamasDavid LammySaudi ArabiaexplainersShareReuse this content"

An artist with 30 gold or platinum singles to his name, he nevertheless quickly shifted the release date of a new album he has been promoting for six months, when it became apparent that it would clash with the arrival of Am I the Drama?View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Am I the Drama?It was a gesture that seems somehow antithetical to the very nature of hip-hop – a genre that’s had gloves-off rivalry in its DNA ever since the night, getting on for 50 years ago, when Busy Bee made the fatal mistake of challenging Kool Moe Dee to an onstage battle and inadvertently ushered ina new rap erain the process. But equally, you can understand Young Thug’s logic. Dressed up as let-me-hold-the-door-for-you chivalry – “It’s a ladies day,” he tweeted – it smacks a little of fear. Perhaps he remembers 50 Cent loudly announcing he would retire if his 2007 album Curtis didn’t outsell Kanye West’s Graduation, then dramatically changing his tune when it signally failed to do so. Why take the risk of being bested?And it seems a little ironic when you actually hear Am I the Drama? From the first moments of opener Dead, the listener is made abundantly aware that Cardi B is not a rapper who needs her memory jogged about the gloves-of frivalry inherent in hip-hop’s DNA. “Never smart to beef with me – what can I say? / These hoes be dumb, bitches die young,” she offers within seconds of arriving on the mic. Seconds later, she is letting longstanding rival Nicki Minaj have it in no uncertain terms. It possibly takes a degree of magical thinking to depict Minaj’s 2024 tour as a failure, given that it grossed $108.8m – and involves invokinga hotly denied 2022 rumourthat Minaj owed $173m to the taxman – but such is the hugely entertaining ferocity of Cardi B’s flow that she gets away with it.Indeed, such is the ferocity of Cardi B’s flow when dispatching perceived slights and minor nuisances on Dead – to the critics who felt her 2019 best rap album Grammy should have gone to Meek Mill, online commenters she accuses of sticking their nose in “my coochie and my business” – that you find yourself wondering if she’ll run out of bile before she even gets to her ex-husband, Migos rapper Offset, from whom she filed for divorce in 2024 amid allegations of infidelity. But no: pausing en route to variously tear strips off Ice Spice (“snow-faced bitch”), former City Girls rapper JT (“tail-wagging bottom-feeder-ass bitch”) former City Girls rapper JT’s boyfriend Lil’ Uzi Vert (bald accusation of sexual peccadillo that modesty forbids relating), BIA (“if I did your numbers I would hop out a plane”), and indeed to have another pop at Minaj, she arrives at Man of Your Word, addressing her estranged husband in a manner that might pass for equivocal were it not so fabulously passive-aggressive: fault on both sides, but considerably more on yours than mine.Cardi B: Safe ft Kehlani – videoThis merely proves an amuse-bouche beforeWhat’s Goin’ On. It involves Lizzo singing the hook of the old4 Non Blondes hit What’s Up?– which turns out to be substantially less irritating when allied to a series of bitter allegations about Cardi B’s marriage, from underwhelming anniversary presents to unsatisfactory oral sex, than to the non-specific grunge-lite angst of the original. Throughout it all, Cardi B offers sharp, impressively witty lyrics delivered with brutal vigour: she never sounds like someone going through the motions, or doing what’s expected of her.Something roughly similar is true of the music on Am I the Drama? An artist who spends six years making an album runs the risk of seeming like an artist mired in uncertainty about what direction to take, but the eclecticism here feels purposeful rather than confused. There’s a lot of distance between the bright pop of What’s Going On and the Selena Gomez feature Pick It Up; or between Bodega Baddie’s astonishing warp-speed salsa and the unsettling piano-led minimalism of Check Please.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

It’s a questionable choice, particularly given a couple of duds. The Janet Jackson feature Principle feels like it’s there largely so Cardi B can brag she’s got Janet Jackson on her album – her actual contribution is understated and nothing special – while even the rapper herself sounds like she’s flagging a bit on Nice Guy, a slow jam about her current partner, NFL player Stefon Diggs: she’s more entertaining in battle than bedroom mode. She has staunchly defended the presence of two old singles, 2020’s WAP (with Megan Thee Stallion) and 2021’s Up, and in purely qualitative terms, she’s right – but there’s no getting around the fact they feel tacked on as an overly familiar afterthought and streaming grab.Still, at least streaming means you can fillet out the bits you don’t like or don’t need to hear again. You’ll still be left with an album’s worth of imperiously raw and powerful material. One suspects on hearing Am I the Drama?, Young Thug will heave a sigh of relief at his decision: it’s not an album that a rival would want to go up against. And besides, it serves ample notice that getting on the wrong side of Cardi B is a course of action best avoided.Explore more on these topicsMusicCardi BRapHip-hopreviewsShareReuse this content"

A Nato spokesperson confirmed the latest incident, saying it had “responded immediately and intercepted the Russian aircraft” and describing it as“yet another example of reckless Russian behaviour”.Late on Friday Moscow denied violating Estonian airspace. The Russian defence ministry said three MiG-31s were conducting a routine flight from Karelia, east of Finland, to an airfield in the Kaliningrad region, a Russian exclave bordering Poland and Lithuania.The jets flew over neutral waters of the Baltic Sea, more than 3km (1.8 miles) from Estonia’s Vaindloo island, “without violating Estonian airspace”, it said.The Estonian defence forces earlier said the MiG-31s were intercepted on Friday morning by Italian F-35 fighter jets based in Ämari in Estonia as part of the transatlantic defence alliance’s air policing mission over the Baltic Sea.The Russian fighters entered Estonian airspace near Vaindloo island in the Gulf of Finland, the Estonian military said. The jets did not have flight plans, had turned their transponders off and were not communicating with air traffic control, it said.Estonia’s foreign minister, Margus Tsahkna, said: “Russia has already violated Estonia’s airspace four times this year, which in itself is unacceptable. But today’s incursion … is unprecedentedly brazen.“Russia’s increasingly extensive testing of boundaries and growing aggressiveness must be met with a swift increase in political and economic pressure.”Tallinn summoned Russia’s chargé d’affaires to protest against the violation.EU leaders will discuss their “collective response” to Russia’s violations of European airspace at a meeting in Copenhagen on 1 October, said the European Council president, António Costa. “Today’s violation of Estonian airspace by three Russian military aircraft is another unacceptable provocation,” he wrote on X.Estonia’s prime minister, Kristen Michal, said on Friday evening that the country had requestedNatoopen consultations under article 4 of the alliance’s treaty, which states that members will consult whenever the territory, political independence or security of any is threatened.In a post on X, he confirmed that three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets entered Estonian airspace, and were confronted by Nato fighters, before they were “forced to flee”. “Such violation is totally unacceptable,” Michal said.A Nato spokesperson, Allison Hart, said that the North Atlantic Council will convene early next week to discuss the incident in more detail.At the White House on Friday night, Donald Trump told reporters he would soon be briefed on Russia violating Estonia’s airspace and made clear he was not pleased with the situation. “I don’t love it. I don’t like when that happens. Could be big trouble,” he said.The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, earlier condemned Russia’s actions as “outrageous” as he urged allies to take “strong action” against Moscow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Incursions by Russian aircraft are fairly common in the area, but do not usually last as long as Friday’s incident, experts said.“This could be a test by Russia to see how Nato responds to this type of challenge, but it could also be purely coincidental,” Jakub Godzimirski, a researcher in Russian security policy at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs, told Reuters.“Still, this happens in a given context, having in mind what happened with the drone incursion in Poland a few days ago.”Earlier on Friday, the head of Britain’s foreign intelligence agency, MI6, saidthere was “absolutely no evidence” that Vladimir Putin wanted to negotiate peace in Ukraineand that the Russian president was “stringing us along”.Putin “seeks to impose his imperial will by all means at his disposal. But he cannot succeed,” Richard Moore said. “He thought he was going to win an easy victory. But he and many others underestimated the Ukrainians.”Tallinn, a staunch supporter of Ukraine, said in May that Moscow had briefly sent a fighter jet into Nato airspace over the Baltic Sea during an attempt to stop a Russian-bound oil tanker thought to be part of a “shadow fleet” defying western sanctions.Reuters andAgence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsEstoniaRussiaNatoEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Child poverty campaigners expect the government to examine the policy as part of the budget on 26 November.Phillipson said the issue was “profoundly personal” to her because she knew “the sting of growing up in poverty” in Tyne and Wear, where her mother’s home had problems with damp and no heating upstairs.One winter, a neighbour who saw her playing outside in a jumper pushed an envelope with money through the letterbox. It said: “For Bridget’s coat.”“Lifting more children out of poverty is why I came into politics,” Phillipson said. “I’m thinking every day about how to turn the tide on child poverty. Everything is on the table, including removing the two-child limit.“I want the mandate to go further. The mandate, as deputy leader, to make tackling child poverty the unbreakable moral mission of thisLabourgovernment.”She added: “We should never forget that it was the Conservatives who introduced the two-child cap, a spiteful attack on children who were punished and pushed into hardship through no fault of their own. I have said time and again that a Labour government would never have implemented it.”The capaffected 1.7 million children in England, Wales and Scotland last year, according to government figures, and scrapping it would cost about £3.5bn a year.Phillipson is a co-chair of the government’s child poverty taskforce, which is working on a child poverty strategy due to be published this autumn which is expected to make a recommendation on the future of the cap. Her intervention is her strongest public signal yet that she supports a change.Gordon Brown, who has called the two-child limit “cruel”,argued last monththat higher taxes on the gambling industry should be introduced this autumn and the revenue used to scrap it.Asked about Brown’s recommendation, Rachel Reeves signalled that she was open to it. “We’re a Labour government. Of course we care about child poverty,”the chancellor said in August. “That’s why one of the first things we did as a government was to set up a child poverty taskforce that will be reporting in the autumn and respond to it.” She added that the government was reviewing gambling taxes and would announce any changes in the autumn.Ruth Curtice, who was the Treasury’s director of fiscal policy before becoming chief executive of the Resolution Foundation this year, has also called for the two-child limit to be lifted. She said this week lifting the cap was “rare example in public policy of an extremely well-targeted measure. On our projections, child poverty reaches record highs by the end of this parliament.”Phillipson’s campaign has secured the backing of five of England’s metro mayors: Richard Parker of the West Midlands, Oliver Coppard of South Yorkshire, David Skaith of York and North Yorkshire, Kim McGuinness in the north-east of England and Claire Ward in the East Midlands.Phillipson also received the endorsement of the National Union of Mineworkers on Friday, and already has the support of the Usdaw and Community unions.Earlier this weekLucy Powell, Phillipson’s rival in the deputy leadership contest, said ministers should clearly endorse scrapping the cap in principle. Powell said it was the “single biggest policy we could do to address child poverty”.The fact that both Phillipson and Powell have signalled tougher positions on the issue means that whoever wins the contest will be pressing for a change, piling pressure on the government to act.Dan Paskins, the director of UK impact at Save theChildrenUK, which campaigns for the removal of the two-child limit, said: “This is a significant and welcome change of tone from the co-chair of the government’s child poverty taskforce.Who should be Labour’s deputy leader? Whoever can tell a good Labour story – and take the fight to Reform | Polly ToynbeeRead more“It provides us with hope that the government will see that removing the two-child limit is the single most effective way of bringing down child poverty and needs to be an urgent priority. It is heartening to see both candidates for the deputy leadership speaking about the two-child limit, and about their commitment to reduce child poverty.”Phillipson emerged as the frontrunner in theparliamentary stage of the contest, receiving 175 nominations from MPs. Powell had 117 MPs’ nominations.A Survation poll for the LabourList website this weeksuggested Powell was ahead with the grassroots, with 47% of members backing her and 30% backing Phillipson. The other 23% were undecided. Phillipson topped the same poll earlier in the contest.The candidates must now secure the endorsements of constituency parties and affiliates before ballots are issued to members. A hustings will take place at the Labour party conference this month, with ballots opening on Wednesday 8 October and closing on Thursday 23 October. The result will be announced on 25 October.Explore more on these topicsChild benefitsLabour party deputy leadershipBridget PhillipsonLabourLucy PowellChildrenPovertynewsShareReuse this content"

They have until Sunday to object, with appeals heard on Monday.The prime ministeris preparing to recognise Palestine as an independent statethis weekend, but many Labour members and MPs would like to see the government going further by ceasing all arms trade with Israel and withdrawing military cooperation.Two British MPs ‘denied entry’ into Israel during official West Bank visitRead moreThe Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC), which has support from some Labour MPs, accused party officials of attempting to stifle debate on Palestine at the party conference.The group argued that many of the proposed motions focused on events that took place after the NPF report was published, including the announcement of theIsraeli government’s plans to militarily occupy Gaza City on 8 Augustand thekilling of five Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza City on 10 August.The motions also raised new issues such as comprehensive sanctions and a ban on trade that aids or assists Israel’s violations of international law.There was a huge increase in submitted motions compared with the previous year, reflecting the priority given to the issue by Labour members and local parties.View image in fullscreenJohn McDonnell was among those within Labour calling for Palestine to be debated at conference.Photograph: Chris Bull/ShutterstockJohn McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor and a supporter of the PSC, said: “With more than 30 motions on Palestine submitted to this year’s Labour party conference, it is clear that party members see Israel’s genocide against the Palestinian people as a major issue that needs to be raised on [the] conference floor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Delegates must not be prevented from discussing these issues at conference.”Ben Jamal, the PSC’s director, added: “Just days aftera UN commission of inquiry confirmed that Israel has committed and is committing genocide in Gaza, it is shocking that Labour officials are trying to block a large influx of motions in solidarity with Palestine from being debated at this year’s party conference.”Israel has consistently rejected all accusations of genocide, citing its right to self-defence.Asked whether there would be any opportunity for delegates to debate Palestine at the Liverpool conference, a Labour spokesperson said: “A wide range of topics will be debated and discussed at annual conference.

Out of an abundance of caution for the safety of both the artist and audience, tonight’s engagement at Foxwoods has been cancelled. We appreciate your understanding.”Asecond postsaid both the shows had been cancelled due to “recent events and out of an abundance of caution for the safety of both the artist and band”.The British singer, whose full name is Steven Patrick Morrissey, is on a world tour and due to appear in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday, with performances booked across the US before heading to Mexico for a show on 31 October.Earlier this week a 26-year-old man from Ottawa, Canada, was released on bail after allegedly threatening to kill Morrissey at his performance in the city.The man is accused of issuing a threat against Morrissey on Bluesky on 4 September, theOttawa Citizen reported, citing court documents.According to the news outlet, a post on the social media platform read: “Steven Patrick Morrissey when you perform at TD Place here in Ottawa next week on the evening of September 12th, 2025 at about 9pm, I will be present at the venue in the audience and I will attempt to shoot you many times and kill you with a very large gun that I own illegally.”The show in Ottawa went ahead as planned.The Instagram post on Morrissey’s account did not elaborate on what “recent events” it was referring to, but it comes after the prominent conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot dead during a speaking event in Utah last week.Morrissey announced this month that he had “no choice” butto put up for sale the entirety of his business interests in the Smiths.The deal, announced on his website, Morrissey Solo, in a post titled“A Soul for Sale”, would include the band’s name and artwork, which he created, as well as his share of merchandising rights, lyrical and musical compositions, synchronisation, recordings and publishing contractual rights.Explore more on these topicsMorrisseynewsShareReuse this content"

Public have no idea of value of top universities, study findsRead moreA head of physics at one university said: “Our university has a £30m deficit. Staff recruitment is frozen, morale is low. Yet colleagues in our school continue to deliver with less and less and under increasing pressure. I’m very concerned that we are close to breaking point.”Prof Daniel Thomas, the chair of the IoP’s heads of physics forum and head of the University of Portsmouth’s school of physics and mathematics, said the survey’s findings were “a great concern” for UK leadership in important areas.“Physics really underpins all technological advances – it has done so in the past and will do so in the future. So many strategic priorities in the UK, our leadership in many areas, are underpinned by physics in things like quantum,photonics, space, green technologies, data science, defence industries, nuclear science – all of those obviously need highly skilled physicists to run,” Thomas said.“If we lose those skills, if we don’t educate the next generation in those skills, then of course we are definitely jeopardising our world leadership as a country – that’s a great concern.”To avoid “irreversible damage”, the IoP is asking for immediate government action including funding to support existing labs and research facilities, as well as setting up an “early warning system” to monitor departments at risk of closure, and reduce pressures affecting international student recruitment.In the longer term it is calling for radical reforms in higher education funding to allow universities to meet the full costs of teaching nationally important subjects such as physics.Sir Keith Burnett, the IoP’s president and a former chair of physics at Oxford University, said: “While we understand the pressures on public finances, it would be negligent not to sound the alarm for a national capability fundamental to our wellbeing, competitiveness and the defence of the realm.“We are walking towards a cliff edge but there is still time to avert a crisis which would lead not just to lost potential but to many physics departments shutting down altogether.“Physics researchers and talented physics students are our future but if action isn’t taken now to stabilise, strengthen and sustain one of our greatest national assets, we risk leaving them high and dry.”Scientists spot mystery object believed to come from beyond solar systemRead moreThomas said the erosion in value of domestic tuition fees and falling numbers of international students were behind the financial pressures, with smaller physics departments the most at risk.“What that means is we will get more and more concentration of where physics is being taught and lose geographical distribution. That goes against aims of widening participation and means some disadvantaged groups will miss out on opportunities to study physics, and it’s important that we recognise that,” Thomas said.A government spokesperson said it was increasing funding for public research and innovation by more than £22.5bn a year by 2029-30, representing a 3% real-terms increase compared with 2025-26.“Our £86bn for public research and development until 2030 will help the UK’s world-class universities continue to lead discoveries,” a spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsPhysicsUniversity fundingResearch fundingStudentsUniversitiesResearchHigher educationShareReuse this content"

The couple were arrested in February as they travelled to their home in Bamyan province, central Afghanistan. They had been held since then without charge and for a long period were separated and detained in a maximum-security prison.They had lived in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, and ran a training and education organisation.Speaking to Sky News at ​Kabul international airport before boarding a flight to Doha, Barbie Reynolds said she was looking forward to “seeing our children and our families”. Asked if she would return to Afghanistan, she said: “If we can.”In a statement, their children and grandchildren said: “This is a moment of immense joy for our family.” They also thankedQatarfor its role in negotiating with the Taliban to secure their release. They said they would be “forever grateful to the Qataris for standing with us during this difficult time”.The statement said: “While the road to recovery will be long as our parents regain their health and spend time with their family, today is a day of tremendous joy and relief.”View image in fullscreenBarbie Reynolds hugs her daughter Sarah Entwistle after landing in Doha.Photograph: Karim Jaafar/AFP/Getty ImagesKeir Starmer welcomed their release and also thanked Qatar. “I know this long-awaited news will come as a huge relief to them and their family,” he said. “I want to pay tribute to the vital role played by Qatar, including the emir, His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani, in securing their freedom.”The minister for the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan, Hamish Falconer, said Qatar had played an essential role in the negotiations. “The government’s ability to help those in need of consular support in Afghanistan is extremely limited. Our travel advice is clear that individuals should not travel to Afghanistan,” he said.Accompanying the couple in Kabul, Richard Lindsay, the UK special envoy to Afghanistan, told Sky News: ““It’s up to the authorities here [in Kabul] to determine why they were detained. We’re grateful at least today is a great humanitarian day and they will be reunited with their family.”Pushed on why they were detained, Lindsay said: “They’ve been released now. I’m not clear what grounds they were held on.”Asked about their health, he said: “I’m not a doctor, but they are very happy. They are very relieved to be going home, they’re just delighted to be reunited with their family.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a very good moment for us to show our appreciation to make sure that this is the way we deal with problems and conflicts and how to resolve it with good manners and with peaceful solutions.”In aninterviewin July with the Guardian, the couple’s son Jonathan Reynolds, who lives in Chicago, said their condition was deteriorating and he feared they would die in prison.Reynolds said his parents had decided to stay after the Taliban returned to power in 2021, despite the security risks. “They said: ‘How could we possibly leave these people we love in their darkest hour?’ But the warning was, ‘if you stay, you’re on your own’,” Jonathan said. “They knew full well that something like this could happen.“We’ve counted the cost as a family for that. They have always said, ‘If this does happen, don’t trade us for some terrorist who’s in prison, and don’t pay a penny in ransom money’. But they never told us what they did want us to do, which has been really, really difficult.”The couple had five children, 17 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, who live in the UK and US. Their eldest son, Simon, died in 1993.The couple published a book,The Sound of a Trumpet, in 2020, which details their early life as Christian missionaries and their evolving faith. Their Christian background raised fears the Taliban had targeted them for their beliefs.The family, however, pointed out that they were not aligned to any faith at the time of their arrest.Their daughter Sarah Entwistle said in March: “Mum and Dad have made it clear in their book that they do not align with any specific organised religion. While their Christian backgrounds are acknowledged, their message transcends labels.”The couple were among the first to be married in a newly built church in Kabul in 1970.

He added that the Greens already offer a political home for left-leaning voters disillusioned with Labour.In a statement to the Guardian, Polanski said his focus was “to keep growing theGreen partyand to be a voice for bold leadership”.He added: “My door is always open for conversations with Jeremy and Zarah, two people committed to making our country fairer who I really respect. But today I’m focused on what I can do towards that end, and that’s to keep growing the movement within the Green party.”After Sultana launched a membership portal for the new party, tentatively called Your party, on Thursday, Corbyn responded angrily, describing it as a “false membership system” that collected money and data without authorisation. He said the party had referred the matter to the Information Commissioner’s Office and urged supporters to cancel any payments made.A counter-statement from Sultana said she had been frozen out by a “sexist boys’ club” inside the party. Corbyn said late on Thursday that she had not been “excluded from any discussions” and remained part of a process “rooted in inclusivity and mutual respect”.Sources within the party said on Friday that efforts were being made on both sides to calm the mood and find a way forward, with some news likely next week.“Emotions were running high but there is an appetite for de-escalation on both sides, and serious efforts underway to figure out what a realistic way forwards looks like,” one said.Explore more on these topicsGreen partyJeremy CorbynZarah SultananewsShareReuse this content"

It also argues that reporting in the book described Trump’s multimillion-dollar inheritance from his father Fred C Trump as a product of “fraudulent tax evasion schemes”, and that Trump’s father had been “twisting the rules” of federal programs used to support returning second world war veterans to build his fortune.Other complaints Trump alleges are false and defamatory in the suit include the Times’s reporting on Trump’s conduct in school, the value of his real estate deals and that he had been investigated for ties to the mafia and money laundering.“The Times has betrayed the journalistic ideals of honesty, objectivity, and accuracy that it once professed,” it states, also accusing the Times of being “a leading, and unapologetic, purveyor of falsehoods against President Trump”.A spokesperson for the New York Times said: “This lawsuit has no merit. It lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting. The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics. We will continue to pursue the facts without fear or favour and stand up for journalists’ first amendment right to ask questions on behalf of the American people.”Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpNew York TimesLaw (US)US press and publishingnewsShareReuse this content"

When did something that has been in the far right’s playbook for decades re-emerge as the right’s most favoured anti-immigration slogan? Since when did women become so vulnerable that they need the protection of vigilante protest groups? How accurate are the claims made by right-wing politicians about the link between sexual assault and illegal immigration?Reform politicians have recently seized on the need to protect women and children against an apparent threat posed by illegal immigrants. Focus on the pressures posed by immigration on jobs, housing and schools has increasingly been replaced in the prevailing anti-immigration rhetoric by the characterisation of migrants as sexual predators.Last month Nigel Farage said anger over the use of hotels to house asylum seekers was moving from concern over “fairness – why on earth are people being given all these things – to very much about the safety of women and children”.Reform’s first female MP Sarah Pochin said: “We are the only party that is talking about what we need to do to protect women and children from the ever-increasing number of illegal migrants living in our communities.”Rob Ford, a professor of political science at the University of Manchester, said: “The goal this rhetorical device achieves is timeless.”View image in fullscreenTommy Robinson claims ‘safety has been taken’ from women and girls because of ‘mass uncontrolled immigration’.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockHe noted that the phrase has a potent three-pronged function: legitimisation, stereotyping and mobilisation. Firstly, it reframes aggressive hostility towards immigrants as something calmer and entirely justified in the interests of defending vulnerable members of society.“When you use the phrase ‘protect women and children’, you’re focusing the listener’s mental image on the idea of defence rather than threat,” Ford said. “You’re saying: ‘We’re not the aggressors. They are the aggressors’.“Secondly, the phrase also brings to the fore the most negative possible stereotypes about immigrant groups. From the dawn of the far-right debate about immigration in Europe, you’ve seen violent criminals and rapists being the go-to trope.”View image in fullscreenSarah Pochin: ‘[Reform] are the only party that is talking about what we need to do to protect women and children from illegal migrants living in our communities.’Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersThe phrase also had a powerful mobilising impact, he said. “If you’re trying to mobilise people, you need to get people to see a political issue in terms of a clear and present danger, an imminent threat that they need to defend against. They all use this language because it serves all three of these purposes.”Similar language around the need to defend women and children from immigrants has been used by Viktor Orbán in Hungary and Giorgia Meloni in Italy.Jean-François Drolet, a politics professor at Queen Mary University of London, said he had observed a growth of this rhetoric in the UK. “At first sight it seems benign language, but when you unpack it there is such a cluster of issues for the far right nesting in this phrase,” he said. There was a paternalistic subtext, hinting also at a need to protect the traditional gender roles and family values that have come under attack from a liberal elite.The narrative is increasingly prevalent in the US. Donald Trump spoke about the need to defend women and children from undocumented migrants during his election campaign, promising: “I will protect women … The suburban women are under attack.”‘There’s a basic decency among British people’: Hope Not Hate’s Nick Lowles on how to defeat the far rightRead moreVice-president JD Vance said: “I don’t want my children to share a neighbourhood with people who are not properly vetted.”In the US, the notion that male politicians need to protect women and children comes packed together with a shift towards a new strand of patriarchy, where the “tradwives” movement is fashionable, where masculine energy in the workplace is praised by Mark Zuckerberg, where a pro-natalist vision is promoted by Elon Musk and where Trump’s owncomments on pussy grabbingare no longer much mentioned.Conservative politicians are reaching for the same phrases. The shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, said rising numbers in asylum hotels was “a public safety crisis, especially for women and girls”. In a newspaper column, the shadow justice minister, Robert Jenrick, last month gave details of “a spate of crimes, all allegedly committed by migrants”, adding that he feared for the safety of his three young daughters.Jenrick’s concern that some people who have migrated to the UK have “medieval attitudes to women” reflects a new strain of nationalism known as “femo-nationalism”, a co-opting of feminism to promote a nationalist agenda.“Exploitation of alleged concern for women’s safety in order to justify xenophobic and racist attitudes towards Muslim men has been labelled ‘femo-nationalism’ – where white, western culture is represented as superior to eastern, Islamic culture, evidenced in apparently better conditions for women,” notes the Runnymede Trust, a race equality thinktank..“Not only does this suppress the fact that violence against women and girls is pervasive in the UK, but it plays on racist assumptions of people of colour as less advanced and developed than white, western cultures.”The threat of violence may in any case lie closer to home.Guardian analysis showedthat two out of every five people arrested after participating in last summer’s post-Southport riots had been previously reported to the police for domestic abuse.The arrest in July of Hadush Kebatu, from Ethiopia, triggered a summer of protests and helped fuel this rhetoric. Kebatu, who was found guilty earlier this month of two counts of sexual assault and one attempted sexual assault, against a 14-year-old girl and a woman, had arrived in the UK days earlier on a small boat, and was housed at the Bell hotel with other asylum seekers in Epping.View image in fullscreenThe arrest of Hadush Kebatu sparked a summer of protests in Epping and across the UK.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAColchester magistrates court heard that Kebatu tried to kiss two girls on 7 July after one of them offered him a pizza. His advances were rejected. He also sexually assaulted a woman by putting his hand on her leg after she offered to help him with his CV, the court heard. Kebatu will be sentenced next week and has been warned that he faces a stretch in prison.This summer’s Epping incident has been loosely bracketed in protesters’ minds with other issues that have nothing to do with small boats, but have been weaponised in the same breath as examples of threats posed by multicultural Britain. Anger over grooming gang scandals linger.Musk appeared by video link at last Saturday’s protest claiming that the UK government had failed to “protect innocent people, including children from being gang-raped”. The killing of three children at a Taylor Swift dance class last year by Cardiff-born Axel Rudakubana also sparked unrest when he was misclassified on social media as an illegal migrant.Why this moment of rightwing racism feels so different – and how we can resist itRead moreMeka Beresford, the head of policy at Action for Race Equality, was concerned by rising references to asylum seekers as “fighting age men”. “This weekend’s protests served as a stark wake-up call for how quickly these sentiments have spread. Violence is something that, unfortunately, happens in every ethnic group, in every age group, in every socioeconomic group,” she said.Reform party officials have recently produced statistics to bolster the argument that women and children need protection. “An Afghan male has a 22 times more likely chance of being convicted of rape than somebody born in this country,” Farage claimed in August, referring to an analysis of Ministry of Justice figures conducted by the Centre for Migration Control, which describes itself as an organisation “committed to controlling and dramatically reducing migration to Britain”.View image in fullscreenIn August Nigel Farage said ‘an Afghan male has a 22 times more likely chance of being convicted of rape than somebody born in this country’.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PAThe Oxford Migration Observatory has also been analysing offending rates of foreign nationals and is cautious about the claim. “It’s likely that rates of criminal convictions vary by nationality, but we can’t measure them precisely,” Ben Brindle, a Migration Observatory researcher, said.Brindle analysed the prison population and controlled for age. “Younger men are more likely to commit crimes. People crossing the Channel are more likely to be younger men, so that is going to play a part. But once you control for age, what we found is that we would expect the foreign national prison population to be bigger than what we actually see in reality,” he said.We need to use the right words to fight racism | LettersRead moreLorraine Cavanagh, who received an OBE for her work as a community organiser in east London, set up a “pink patrol” movement in July after the Britannia hotel on the Isle of Dogs was repurposed as accommodation for asylum seekers. She has recruited about 80 women, who dress in pink, attend protests and will soon be tasked with supervising parks and playgrounds in the area, watching out for harassment of women and children by migrants.She acknowledged that the group was set up in response to a “fear of” attacks rather than any recorded local instances of sexual assault. “We make it quite clear that probably 99% of the people that are in the hotel wouldn’t hurt a hair on a child’s head, but we are not prepared to play roulette with our children,” she said.She was irritated by the suggestion that the group’s concerns were motivated by anti-immigrant sentiment. “I don’t give a rat’s arse if I’m called far right. I’m protecting women and children in my community,” she said.Explore more on these topicsFar rightViolence against women and girlsWomenReform UKTommy RobinsonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He talks odd jobs, busting stereotypes and holding his own opposite Gary OldmanFri 19 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 19 Sep 2025 08.16 EDTShareChristopher Chung is no longer surprised when members of the public walk up and insult him to his face. “It happened yesterday,” he says. “A guy came up to me and said: ‘Are you fromSlow Horses? You’re awful.’” Or sometimes, it’s “You’re a dickhead”.“But,” the 37-year-old adds, the insults are usually “said with love and affection”. And “I want, as an actor, to have some effect, so it’s really …” he hesitates, as if searching for the right word, “really nice,” he beams. Then he bursts into laughter.Whatever fans of the hit spy drama Slow Horses may think of his character, for Chung, playing the talented but abrasive hacker Roddy Ho is a dream role. “The best thing is not having to worry about the other characters’ feelings. You can be as arrogant and obnoxious as you like.” He perceives Roddy as “slightly on the spectrum” and “misunderstood”; never “vindictive” or “nasty”, just “egocentric” and lacking a censor. “Sometimes, the things that he vocalises are similar to my internal voice. So it’s a really fun character to play: I get to just say what I think.”View image in fullscreenSpies like us … Ruth Bradley and Christopher Chung in the new series of Slow Horses.Photograph: Jack English/Apple TV+We meet in London’s Soho, not far from Slough House, the rundown east London office for disgraced MI5 spies where Roddy spends most of his time behind a computer. But in the show’s new season, a series of bizarre events unfold in the city and the hacker takes a more central role. He attracts a glamorous girlfriend and – during a thrilling episode in which he wields a sword – is shown topless and declared to be “ripped” by a colleague.Sitting opposite Chung, I remark on how unusual it is for a geeky character to be presented as physically attractive: in the novels, the hacker’s defining physical characteristic is his thick black glasses.“He’s just me,” Chung drawls in a Roddy-ish way that makes us laugh.It becomes clear, however, that I’ve touched a nerve. He tells me that, after arriving in the UK at 24 in 2012, he had to navigate a lot of “unconscious bias” as an actor with east Asian heritage: “It’s one step forward, two steps back, consistently.” He was often auditioning for roles he didn’t want to play, “stereotypes like the takeaway worker or the Asian nurse – peripheral characters that don’t have any autonomy” – and other opportunities were thin on the ground.I always thought my career ambitions would be capped at being the best friend to the lead. I never thought I’d get to take that myselfTo have the freedom to be more choosy with his acting roles, he started working as a personal trainer: “If I didn’t have that, then my career might be in a very different place.” He continues the work today: “I had a client this morning. I love it because it gives me an external focus, an hour that’s about the client, not me. That’s really healthy.”But when the part as Roddy arrived, Chung “was really concerned about my physicality, because I was quite big at the time”. So at his audition, he tried to “cover up” by wearing a hoodie. Then, after he got the part, he discovered his costume was too small and “started to spiral, worrying they were going to want me to be this geeky Asian kid”. He began to wonder how quickly he could lose muscle. His first rehearsal swiftly put paid to that idea. “They were like: ‘No, no, no. We’re going to build all of that into the character.’ As soon as they said that, it was so liberating.” He realised that he could portray Roddy in a way that challenged even his own beliefs about how a nerdy east Asian guy should be seen on screen: “That was the most beautiful thing given to me on this job.”Acting alongside stars such as Gary Oldman, who plays Roddy’s grubby, mercurial boss Jackson Lamb, has forced Chung to bring his A-game to every scene, he says: “You’re trying to meet them at their level so that they don’t have a dud opposite.”View image in fullscreenCast offs … (from left) Rosalind Eleazar, Christopher Chung, Saskia Reeves, Aimee-Ffion Edwards and Jack Lowden in Slow Horses.Photograph: Jack English/Apple TV+Behind the scenes, the cast of the show are like a “dysfunctional family” with Oldman acting like a “very supportive” father figure. There’s a lot of banter and camaraderie between them all, he says, and when Oldman learned Chung could sing, the two of them recorded a version of Let It Be together “just for fun”.The role has been a “gamechanger” for Chung: he has since been cast as a hot-headed soldier in Doctor Who, a villain’s sidekick in the Steve McQueen movie Blitz, and has just finished filming the Australian Netflix period drama My Brilliant Career. In it, he plays the romantic lead, the handsome and wealthy Harry Beecham.“I always thought my career ambitions would be capped at being the best friend to the lead,” he says. “I never thought I’d get to take that myself.” Previous auditions for leading roles had been unsuccessful, and for a long time he was unable to see himself playing those parts: “Growing up I was never the most desirable kid.”Born to an Irish mother and a Malaysian Chinese father (they met at a party in London in the 1970s, and he often visits his mother’s home town of Limerick) Chung grew up in Mornington, a suburb of Melbourne, where he was one of three or four Chinese kids in a school of 2,500. “I remember kids yelling out to me in the field: ‘Jackie Chan, do some kung fu,’ all the time.” Heath Ledger had been his acting idol; he was not into martial arts, and so didn’t see an east Asian actor whose career he wanted to emulate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He took acting courses in New York and Philadelphia and then moved to London. Within six months, he was cast as Archie Wong, a student in BBC drama Waterloo Road, whose main function is to secretly help his (white) languages teacher learn to speak Mandarin. Later stints in the theatre followed, including roles as the jock Kurt in the musical version of Heathers, and Paris in Romeo and Juliet at the Globe. Then Covid-19 hit and theatres closed. Chung spent lockdown wondering whether he should take a break from acting: “If you weren’t an established actor at that point, what hope did you have?”On the eve of the second lockdown, he landed the part of Roddy. When his agent broke the news, “I broke down on the ground and cried,” Chung says. “Here I was, with an opportunity to have the career I’d always dreamed of.”These twists and turns of Chung’s career are fascinating: it’s hard to imagine Roddy on stage, dancing in a musical, I say.Initially, he shrugs this off with a joke: “I like to show range.” But after mulling it over, he explains that in his experience, actors from minority ethnic backgrounds “can’t just be good at one thing. You have to be good at everything if you want to work.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s a really fun character to play’ … Chung with Hiba Bennani in Slow Horses.Photograph: Apple TV+Before Slow Horses, he says, he often found himself pigeonholed by directors: “They were very much like: ‘This is the Asian part’,” he says. When he was working on Waterloo Road, an executive producer suggested that a good storyline for Archiewould have him “go to China on a boat”. Internally, Chung thought, “What the fuck? But I said: ‘OK.’ I didn’t have the vernacular at the time to say: ‘What are you talking about?’” He felt “othered” and that his presence on set was ticking a box.It was thanks to his wife, the Scottish actor Frances Mayli McCann, that he got past it: “She told me to keep going.” Earlier this year he was nominated for best supporting actor at the Bafta TV awards, becoming the third east Asian male actor ever to be nominated. Now, he’s doing everything he can to break out of “race-specific” roles. There needs to be more diversity “across the board, behind the camera, on the stage, the higher-ups”, he says. “That’s where significant change starts to happen.”Meanwhile, as viewers gear up for Slow Horses’ new series, he eyes the release with some trepidation. “I feel a little anxious about being a bit more central,” he admits. “Fame is not something that I ever chased. I think it’s really overwhelming. You don’t get any time or space for yourself.” On a practical level, he says, being really famous is very expensive, because you can’t easily go out. “You have to get people to go and do stuff for you – and I can’t afford that,” he says.His personal training clients, however, are “thrilled” by his newfound fame: “I think it’s a hoot for them to be able to say: ‘Oh, my trainer is on Slow Horses.’”Slow Horses season five is on Apple TV+ from 24 September.Explore more on these topicsSlow HorsesTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Many masks are available, each claiming to either reduce the appearance of fine lines, stop spots or calm redness. Some even combine different types of light to enhance the benefits.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But it’s wise to be sceptical about new treatments that are costly and non-invasive, and to do your research before you buy. With this in mind, I spoke with doctors and dermatologists to find out whether these light therapy devices actually work.They’re not a miracle cure for deep-set wrinkles, but experts say the best light therapy masks can promote collagen production, improve elasticity and help smooth skin with sustained use. And while it might seem like a new technology,research dating back to the 90sshows the efficacy of light therapy in wound healing, acne treatment and skin rejuvenation.Red and infrared light are safe to use on all skin types, but be warned that blue light can worsen hyperpigmentation on darker skin tones.I’ve tested some of the most popular devices on the market – including infrared masks – to narrow down my favourite LED face masks for treating a range of skin concerns.At a glanceBestLED face maskoverall:CurrentBody Series 2£399.99 at CurrentBodyBest budgetLED face mask:Silk’n facial£99.99 at CurrysBest for targeting multiple skinconcerns:Shark CryoGlow£299 at John LewisBest LED device for acne-prone skin:Lustre ClearSkin Solo£50.40 at AmazonWhy you should trust meI’ve been reviewing health and beauty tech for the past four years. During this time I’ve witnessed many beauty fads come and go. Naturally tight-fisted and a bit of a sceptic, I was initially struck by the cost of these masks. How on earth can an elaborate LED light strip set you back over £300?But after testing multiple light therapy masks, I’ve come to understand the technology behind them, and sadly you won’t be able to engineer your own light therapy system with a costume mask and a set of LED string lights.I don’t have many fine lines or wrinkles to test on, but I can comment on how blue light treatment affects acne because I’ve suffered from it since I was a teenager – despite my mum’s assurances that it would clear up after puberty. The experts I spoke to agreed on the efficacy of red and infrared light for anti-ageing.Are LED face masks actually worth it?Light therapy masks are fantastic additions to a skincare routine, helping to smooth, firm and reduce blemishes. Since I started using one almost a year ago, my skin is calmer, less prone to redness, and has a more even tone.However, LED masks can be expensive, and if you’re not disciplined enough to use one regularly, you won’t see results. Before you jump in and splash between £100 and £400, keep in mind that light therapy masks are most effective when paired with a good skincare routine. It’s crucial to make sure skin is properly cleansed before treatment and protected from sun damage afterwards.If you don’t already have askincareroutine nailed down, don’t buy a light therapy mask just yet. Consider starting out using a gentle cleanser and moisturiser, with anSPFfor daytime. You could also incorporate targeted skincare serums, such asretinolandvitamin C, to help firm and brighten the skin without the need for an expensive light therapy mask.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I tested the fit, comfort levels and usability of 10 of the most popular light therapy masks.’Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianSince LED treatments take a while to show visible results, it’s difficult to test multiple light therapy masks at once (at least, without spending a few years testing them), so I enlisted the help of expert dermatologists who were familiar with light therapy treatments long before they were commercially available.I spoke with Dr Barbara Kubicka, an expert in aesthetic medicine; Dr Derrick Phillips, a consultant dermatologist and spokesperson for the British Skin Foundation; and aesthetic doctor Dr Priya Verma, an authority on the science of skin ageing.I asked the experts to identify which features of a light therapy mask – such as bulb quality and quantity, light wavelength and treatment time – matter the most, to inform my choices. They also outlined the suitability of light therapy for different skin types and its associated risks.Armed with their advice, I tested the fit, comfort levels and usability of 10 of the most popular light therapy masks and other targeted LED devices. Getting hands on with the masks allowed me to pinpoint any of the key features the experts recommended, as well as useful features I found helpful as a consumer.I’ve been using a light therapy mask regularly for the past 12 months, so I can identify a good mask from a bad. My tests also included monitoring how well the treatments worked after four nightly sessions, with the obvious caveat that only very minimal results could be observed after such a short-term treatment. I then tested my favourite masks over several months, too, helping me to verify any unique treatment claims – as well as giving me plenty of opportunities to scare my boyfriend by sneaking up on him wearing each one.Only masks that use the brightest, flicker-free bulbs, fit comfortably and are easy to use made the final cut. After testing, I returned the masks sourced for this article to the manufacturers. Where that wasn’t possible, I cleaned the masks and donated them to theRedbridge Reach Outservice, a local charity that supports anyone experiencing domestic abuse.The bestLED face masks in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianBestLED face maskoverall:CurrentBody Series 2View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£399.99 at CurrentBody£399.99 at AmazonThis is the second red light therapy mask from CurrentBody, and it’s easily the brightest and best-fitting mask I’ve tested. If you want the most powerful red light mask money can buy, I believe this is worth the cost.The mask has 236 LED bulbs that blend red, near-infrared and deep near-infrared light, the latter of which is exclusive to the Series 2 mask. Theoriginal mask, which is £100 cheaper, has only the former two light frequencies.The deep near-infrared lights penetrate deeper than the other two types of light, CurrentBody claims. This leads to more effective treatment where it’s needed most – the deep near-infrared bulbs are positioned under the eyes and around the lips to better target areas where ageing is more pronounced. Add surface-level red light and near-infrared light, and you’ve got a face mask that works harder than most.Why we love itI loved how simple the mask was to use. After attaching it to my head using the adjustable straps, I turned on the mask to activate a 10-minute treatment. It offered brilliant facial coverage, wrapping all the way under my chin. And its eye guards were highly effective, blocking any glare from the bright lights and allowing me to continue doing my daily activities – or endlessly scrolling – while wearing the mask.I used this mask for three months, and was pleased to notice my skin tone looking calmer and more even than usual, with less undereye inflammation. As it’s a red light mask, it didn’t have much effect on my acne, but it did help to reduce redness.If you have blemish-prone skin, CurrentBody does sell ablue light maskfor the same price. It has the same comfortable, high-coverage fit and high-quality bulbs, but uses blue and red bulbs (slightly fewer: 220) to target acne-causing bacteria and reduce inflammation.It’s a shame that …the mask offers only one treatment setting and there isn’t a screen displaying the treatment time. Neither is a dealbreaker, but it’s nice to be able to choose different treatments, and almost every other mask includes a countdown timer.Number of LEDs:236Number of settings:oneTreatment time:10minsLight frequencies:red (633nm), near-infrared (830nm), deep near-infrared (1,072nm)Timer countdown:noBest budgetLED face mask:Silk’n facialView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£99.99 at Currys£160 at FenwickIf you want to try light therapy without remortgaging the house, the Silk’n facial LED mask is a good choice. It has 100 LED bulbs with good facial coverage, is comfortable to wear and offers a good range of light colours. It doesn’t have near-infrared lights like the pricier options, but it covers the basics at a decent price.Why we love itThis mask offers four colour modes: red, blue, yellow and purple. Red light helps stimulate collagen to reduce the appearance of fine lines, while blue light helps to soothe breakouts. The purple light comes from mixing the aforementioned blue and red lights, combining the effects of both to boost the skin’s overall evenness.Although less widely researched (and with limited clinical evidence to suggest efficacy), the experts I spoke to said the yellow light treatment could help improve hydration levels in the skin. I didn’t notice a huge hydration hit when testing this feature, so if your skin is crying out for hydration, I recommend using the other light settings alongside ahydrating serum.Each colour can be selected individually for a 10-minute targeted session, or you can select automatic mode, which cycles through the colours over 15 minutes to provide all the benefits at once.I found the Silk’n light therapy mask simple to use and comfortable to wear. Its flexible silicone build didn’t feel quite as sturdy as more expensive options, but I didn’t really notice this when using the mask. The built-in eye shields weren’t as bulky as others, but they still blocked out the light and protected my eyes well.The automatic mode left my skin feeling completely comfortable, with a slightly glowier finish than usual – just what I’d expect from an entry-level mask like this one.It’s a shame that …there’s no timer and it has fewer than half the bulbs of the CurrentBody, with no near-infrared light treatment for effective collagen stimulation deeper in the skin. This means it’s better for light-touch anti-ageing, and for soothing, acne-busting blue light treatments.Number of LEDs:100Number of settings:5Treatment time:10 or 15minsLight frequencies:red (633nm), purple (463-633nm), blue (463nm), yellow (592nm)Timer countdown:noBest fortargeting multiple skin concerns:SharkCryoGlowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£299 at John Lewis£299.99 at SharkMany will be familiar with Shark’s vacuum cleaners and hair-styling gadgets, but the brand’s latest venture is in skincare. The Shark CryoGlow is the only LED face mask to offer built-in undereye cooling alongside targeted light therapy for anti-ageing and acne repair.Why we love itThe CryoGlow offers three different wavelengths of light: blue, red and deep-infrared. It has three presets for “better ageing”, “blemish repair” and “skin sustain”. If these aren’t clear enough, the control screen explains exactly what each mode is designed to do, making it really user-friendly.I found the lights incredibly bright during my tests – though for safety they automatically dim when you remove the mask from your face – but I was happy with how the mask shielded my eyes.During every treatment, you can choose to switch on the cooling undereye patches, which aim to de-puff and soothe your skin. The cooling can also be used on its own, without the LEDs. There are three levels, the coolest of which felt startlingly cold at first but did a great job of calming down my eyes on a particularly bad hay fever day. Likewise, the blemish mode did a brilliant job of calming spots and redness with sustained use. I also liked using the skin sustain mode for a quick pick-me-up to brighten my skin before a night out.As you might imagine, using the cooling feature on full blast drains the battery more quickly. I performed two battery-rundown tests on the CryoGlow without cooling, and it managed 17 treatments. With maximum cooling enabled, however, this dropped to just seven. That’s still a decent number of treatments in between charges, but it’s something to bear in mind.It’s a shame that …since it’s made of plastic, it’s noticeably heavier than its silicone competitors. Thankfully, Shark has made the mask fit comfortably by using cushioned inserts at the forehead, brow and nose area.That’s when you’re sitting up, at least; when lying down, the metal cooling patches pressed into the delicate area under my eyes. Another unfortunate side-effect of the cooling is the whirring noise it makes – inaudible from far away, but pretty noisy when pressed on to your face.Number of LEDs:160Number of settings:fourTreatment time:4-8mins light therapy; 5-15mins under-eye coolingLight frequencies:red (630nm), infrared light (830nm), blue light (415nm)Timer countdown:yesBest LED device for acne-prone skin:Lustre ClearSkin SoloView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£63 at Lustre£50.40 at AmazonAcne can be a real pain, and many cosmetic treatments that target it leave skin feeling irritated, dry and flaky. These nifty adhesive LED patches from Lustre use blue light, which the company claims reduces acne-causing bacteria.Why we love itEach Solo patch has 15 pure blue LEDs at theproven wavelength for treating acne, 415nm. The patches cover a targeted area of skin about 2.5 x 5cm, which is perfect for treating problem areas such as the chin, cheeks and forehead. Since they’re rechargeable and far smaller than a typical LED face mask, they’re highly portable, making it easy to stay consistent with treatments wherever you are.I found the targeted treatments very effective for minimising breakouts in my chin area – somewhere I often struggle with spots. My skin was also quicker to heal, with fewer breakouts, the longer I continued with treatments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

This also means, unlike typical light therapy masks, they can be safely fixed anywhere on the body.If you’re worried that the adhesive will feel uncomfortable or be tricky to remove from breakouts, don’t be. The patches are so lightweight that the adhesive doesn’t need to be very strong. I found it easy and comfortable to peel off the patches after the recommended 20-minute treatment time.It’s a shame that …you need to buy the sticky patches when they run out. These cost£18 for a pack of 60, or 30p each. They also look a bit like leeches – only you can decide if that’s more palatable than the Hannibal Lecter look of the full-face LED masks.Number of LEDs:15Number of settings:oneTreatment time:20minsLight frequencies:blue (415nm)Timer countdown:noThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘You can choose which kind of light you want to use in four areas of your face’: the Lustre ClearSkin Renew Pro Facewear.Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianZkin light therapy maskView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£499 at ZkinBest for:anti-blemish and anti-ageing in a flexible maskIf the Shark CryoGlow listed above tempts you but you don’t want to use the noisy cooling patches, this mask from Zkin is a brilliant alternative. You may not recognise the brand, but it’s the brainchild of medical consultant Dr Ifeoma Ejikeme.The mask comes with the most widely researched red, blue and near-infrared light, with three modes: red, blue and combination. Whichever you choose, the mask uses near-infrared light tostimulate repair below the skin’s surface and boost circulation. Since it’s made from flexible silicone with removable eye inserts, I found it very comfortable to wear during testing.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s pretty expensive. You’d be better off buying the CurrentBody mask if you’re after very powerful red light treatment and coverage. It also has fewer bulbs than masks of a similar price.Number of LEDs:122;number of settings:three;treatment time:10mins;light frequencies:blue (460nm), red (630nm and 660nm), and near-infrared (850nm);timer countdown:yesFlikezePhotonMask QuintView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£179 at Flikeze£259.95 at AmazonBest for:a comfortable fitThe Flikeze light therapy mask offers a wide range of light colours: red, near-infrared, blue, green and yellow. Its settings include anti-ageing (red light), repair (yellow), brightening (green) and acne care (blue and red), and you can choose to do a 10- or 15-minute treatment. These all use near-infrared rather than deep infrared light.The best thing about this mask is how comfortable it is. It has two straps that wrap around the top and bottom of your head, holding it to your face without the mask ever feeling weighty or digging in. Its eye shades fit like diving goggles and kept my eyes completely shaded from light during treatment (you can see how little light leakage there is in the haunting photograph from testing).It didn’t make the final cut because …for the cost, it has fewer bulbs than average and the bulbs don’t cover the bridge of your nose – not a likely problem area for wrinkles, but spots can be a problem there. It also looks particularly disconcerting when worn.Number of LEDs:92;number of settings:four;treatment time:10-15mins;light frequencies:red (660nm), near-infrared (850nm), blue (415nm), green (532nm), yellow (590nm);timer countdown:yesLustre ClearSkin Renew Pro FacewearView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£449.99 at Boots£450 at LustreBest for:wireless controls and customised treatmentMost light treatment masks have wired controls. That doesn’t mean you need to remain tethered to a single spot, but it does mean there’s a remote that you have to carry around with you. This mask from Lustre, on the other hand, is controlled via a mobile app.It has two programmes, called Energise and Revitalise, and uses blue, red and near-infrared light. Unusually, you can choose which kind of light you want to use in four areas of your face: forehead, eyes, nose, cheeks and chin. In my tests, I liked being able to treat spots on my chin with blue light while using red light on the rest of my face.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not very comfortable. Since the battery is on the mask itself, it’s a little top heavy, and the eye protectors don’t do a great job of shielding your eyes. I also hate having lots of apps on my phone – it’s up to you whether the wireless freedom is worth the app installation.Number of LEDs:80;number of settings:two presets, with in-app personalisation options across five facial zones;treatment time:10mins;light frequencies:red light (630nm), near-infrared light (830nm), blue light (415nm);timer countdown:yesSilk’nLumiLips LED lip maskView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£79 at LookFantastic£80 at BootsBest for:targeted lip treatmentsIf your main area of concern is the lip area, you might not need to buy a full mask. The Silk’n LumiLips has 30 LEDsconcentrated in the lip area, covering smile lines and the chin. It has five light frequencies – amber, red, dark red, near-infrared and deep near-infrared. The only other mask on this roundup offering deep near-infrared light is the CurrentBody 2 mask, which gives you a good idea of how much value it offers.The mask has two modes, both of which use dark red, near-infrared and deep near-infrared light. The red-light mode claims to promote lip volume and firmness,while the second mode adds in amber light to reduce pigmentation and redness. I love that the mask requires only a five-minute daily treatment, making its less-than-comfortable mouthpiece slightly more bearable.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s built like an adult pacifier and feels like one too.

LED face masks are quick, gentle and non-invasive, and suitable for most skin types (although as mentioned above, blue light can worsen hyperpigmentation on darker skin tones, according to the experts I spoke with). The masks are effective and foolproof to use, and the daily treatments also force you to take a little time for yourself – perfect for a morning pick-me-up or an evening wind-down.Does red light help with anti-ageing?“Red-light therapy can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles through a process called photobiomodulation,” says consultant dermatologist Phillips. “It energises mitochondria, which are the batteries of the cells, powering the production of collagen and elastin by fibroblasts, the factories of the skin.”Elastin and collagen are “the building blocks of firm, youthful skin”, says Kubicka. Stimulating the production of these molecules can “improve skin density, elasticity and overall smoothness” as long as you complete treatments regularly.I have yet to develop fine lines or wrinkles, but I’m keen to avoid them by using red-light therapy for “preventive ageing”. However, “most of the clinical evidencefocuses on treating visible signs of ageing or repairing damaged skin, rather than long-term prevention in younger skin,” as aesthetic doctor Verma explains.Still, Verma reassured me my efforts wouldn’t be in vain. “Using LED light consistently and appropriately may help support overall skin health […] especially when combined with sun protection and a good skincare routine.”What different colours of light therapy are available?Several colours are available, with each wavelength claiming to target a different skin concern. These colours correlate to the visible light spectrum, and each can have a different effect on the skin.Red light has a wavelength of between 630 and 700nm and is the most widely known form of light therapy, loved for its non-invasive potential anti-ageing benefits. Near-infrared light above 700nm “penetrates the skin more deeply to support tissue repair and reduce inflammation”, according to Kubicka. Blue light therapy (415nm), on the other hand, has been proven to target acne-causing bacteria, leading to a reduction in breakouts over time. Kubicka also says blue light can help regulate oil production – another common problem for those with acne.The effect of some types of light on the skin are better researched than others.Near-infrared,red lightandblue lightare backed by scientific studies that identify the biological processes that each type of light triggers in the body.Meanwhile, research into green and yellow light is more limited. One study questions theefficacy of yellow lighttherapy and claims that a previous study may have been influenced by the placebo effect. Similarly, a study ongreen light therapysuggests that more research is needed to provide a solid recommendation for use as an anti-ageing treatment.How and when would you recommend using light therapy?The “how” is simple: always use light therapy masks on freshly washed, dry skin, before applying serums and creams. This will give the light the most direct access to the skin.Despite what some instruction manuals advise, don’t jump into daily treatments straight away – you may end up with slightly irritated skin. Start by introducing treatments two to three times a week, and monitoring the impact on your skin. If you don’t notice any sensitivity, you can incorporate more treatments, if permitted by the manufacturer’s guidelines.Once your skin is used to the treatment, “home devices should be used three to five times a week, for 10-20 minutes a session,” says Phillips. Don’t expect instant results, though. If you’re hoping to treat breakouts, you should “see a reduction in redness and the frequency of acne breakouts within two to four weeks”. Those using red light for anti-ageing benefits will need to wait a little longer: “It typically takes six to eight weeks to see visible changes.”Is light therapy safe for all skin tones?“LED light therapy is generally very safe when used correctly,” says Verma. This is because, unlike laser hair removal, it only uses low-level, non-thermal light. “The most common side effects are mild and temporary, such as slight redness, dryness or irritation.”“People with known photosensitive disorders or taking medications that make them more sensitive to light (eg certain antibiotics) should consult their doctor,” says Phillips. He also warns that those with darker skin tones should exercise caution when using blue light, since “some blue wavelengths have been associated with hyperpigmentation”. The Lustre ClearSkin Solo patches recommended above offer exclusively blue light, but the other masks on this roundup have blue-light-free settings if you do find that it causes sensitivity.How much should I spend on an LED therapy mask?There are hundreds of light therapy masks available at different prices, but the quality varies wildly. You may see results from a budget-friendly mask, such as the£100 Silk’n mask, but spending more will generally get you a larger quantity of bulbs that offer a greater range of wavelengths. You’re also more likely to get a mask with a better fit and coverage.The best mask for you will depend on your skin concerns and budget. Those hoping to invest in a mask with anti-acne properties will be able to spend less, since blue light is more widely available, but if you’re looking for the best anti-ageing deep near-infrared light therapy, you will need to part with more cash.High-end red light therapy masks can cost up to £500; if you spend that much, just make sure you use it regularly, or you won’t see results.Sarah Matthews is a consumer journalist who specialises in health and beauty reviews.

Similarly, they have waged pressure campaigns urging employers to take action against the individuals.JD Vance backs mass ‘doxing’ campaign to find and harass Charlie Kirk criticsRead moreCivil liberties groups and free speech advocates havewarnedthat the wave of firings and expulsionsrisks chilling free expressionand couldinfringe onfirst amendment protections.Here are some of the people who have reportedly been affected by the crackdown so far:Government workersThe US Secret Service placed an employee on leave last weekafter reportedly writingin a Facebook post that that Kirk “spewed hate and racism on his show”, adding: “At the end of the day, you answer to GOD, and speak things into existence. You can only circumvent karma, she doesn’t leave,” according toCBS News.A spokesperson for the agency confirmed to the Guardian: “This employee was immediately put on administrative leave, and an investigation has begun.”The Secret Service “will not tolerate behavior that violates our code of conduct”, the spokesperson added.Fox Newsalso reported that an employee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) was placed on administrative leave over an Instagram post describing Kirk as “the literal racist homophobe misogynist”.A Fema spokesperson told the Guardian that the “employee’s words are revolting and unconscionable” and that the employee “was immediately placed on administrative leave”.“We expect all public servants to uphold the highest standard of professionalism, respect and integrity,” they added.The US Coast Guard alsosaidlast week that it was “aware of inappropriate personal social media activity” made by one of their employees “regarding recent political violence” and that they were “actively investigating this activity and will take appropriate action to hold the individual accountable”.Media and entertainmentOn Wednesday evening, news broke that Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show had beensuspended “indefinitely”after comments he made about the shooting of Kirk.In a recent broadcast, Kimmel hadsuggestedthat “many in Maga land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk”, which prompted complaints from the Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr.Carrsaid: “These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action on Kimmel or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”Hours later, ABC, owned by Disney, announced that Kimmel’s show would be “pre-empted indefinitely” after the affiliate operator Nexstar called Kimmel’s remarks “offensive and insensitive”.This came as last week MSNBCfiredits senior political analyst Matthew Dowd after he suggested on air that Kirk’s own rhetoric may have contributed to the shooting that killed him. Dowd’s remarks were condemned by MSNBC as “inappropriate, insensitive and unacceptable”.‘Censoring you in real time’: suspension of Jimmy Kimmel show sparks shock and fears for free speechRead moreIn a subsequentSubstack articleon Friday, Dowd confirmed that MSNBC had fired him and said: “The Right Wing media mob ginned up, went after me on a plethora of platforms, and MSNBC reacted to that mob.”The Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah said on Monday that shewas also firedover a series of social media posts “speaking out against political violence, racial double standards, and America’s apathy toward guns” following Kirk’s killing.Meanwhile, PHNX Sports, an Arizona sports network,confirmedthat it had parted ways with one of its employees over comments related to Kirk’s death, according tomultple reports. Severaloutletshave reported that it was one of PHNX’s sports writers.AcademicsAcross the country, US educators and employees of educational institutions are beingfired or placed on leaveover social media posts about Kirk and his death.At Clemson University in South Carolina, the universitysaidon Monday that it had fired an employee “due to their social media posts” and also laterannouncedthat two faculty members had been dismissed over social media posts in response to Kirk’s killing that the school deemed “inappropriate”.The university did not disclose the content of the posts.Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina, hadpublicly urged the universityto terminate the employees.“Free speech doesn’t prevent you from being fired if you’re stupid and have poor judgment,” Graham said.In Tennessee, the Republican senator Marsha Blackburncalled foran employee at Middle Tennessee State University to be fired for reportedly writing in a post that they had “ZERO sympathy” for Kirk’s death.The universityconfirmed to the Tennesseanthat the employee was terminated.Texas State Universityended the enrollmentof a student who mocked Kirk’s assassination during a campus memorial event.At Texas Tech University, a student wasalso reportedly expelledafter a video showed her disrupting a vigil for Kirk and shouting “F--k y’all homie dead, he got shot in the head.”The Texas Education Agency reported that it was investigating about 180 complaints against teachers accused of posting inappropriate remarks online about Kirk’s death, according tothe Texas Tribune.The state’s teachers union called the investigations a“political witch-hunt against Texas educators”.‘Inappropriate’ comments about Charlie Kirk shooting lead to university firingsRead moreThe University of Mississippifireda staffer who they said “re-shared hurtful insensitive comments on social media” regarding Kirk’s killing. Florida Atlantic University also reportedly placed a tenured professor on leave over sharing posts about Kirk’s politics in the wake of the assassination, according tothe Palm Beach Post.The American Association of University Professorshas condemnedthe wave of disciplinary measures.“The AAUP notes with great alarm the rash of recent administrative actions to discipline faculty, staff, and student speech in the aftermath of the murder of Charlie Kirk” they wrote. “We write to remind leaders of colleges and universities of their fundamental duty to protect academic freedom and the absolute necessity to ensure that the freedom to discuss topics of public import without constraint is not curtailed under political pressure.”And not only universities have been affected. Public school teachers in at least 15 states includingIowa,Kansas,Wisconsin,North Carolina,Pennsylvania,South Carolina,Idaho,Ohio,Oregon,Massachusetts,Michigan,FloridaandMissourihave also been suspended or fired over posts about Kirk after his killing.And in New Jersey, local outletsreportthat a​​ school district was forced to shelter in place last week afterreceiving violent threatsfollowing a controversial social media post about Kirk’s killing falsely attributed to a district employee.Visa holdersThe US secretary of state, Marco Rubio,hasannouncedthat “visa revocations are under way” for individuals in the country on visas who are “cheering on the public assassination of a political figure”.“Prepare to be deported,” Rubio said. “You are not welcome in this country.”The state department did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for details on whether there have been any visa revocations in connection with comments about Kirk.AirlinesOver the weekend, the US transportation secretary, Sean Duffy,saidthat American Airlines had “immediately grounded” pilots accused of celebrating Kirk’s death and “removed [them] from service”.“This behavior is disgusting and they should be fired,” Duffy said. “Any company responsible for the safety of the traveling public cannot tolerate that behavior.”He added: “We heal as a country when we send the message that glorifying political violence is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!.”In a statement to the Guardian, American Airlines said it condemned “violence of any kind” and that “hate-related or hostile behavior runs contrary to our purpose, which is to care for people on life’s journey.“Employees who promote such violence on social media were immediately removed from service,” they added. “We will continue to initiate action with team members who display this kind of behavior.”Duffy alsopraisedUnited Airlines for taking similar action and placing one of their pilots out of service for reportedly celebrating Kirk’s death.“They must be fired,” Duffy said. “There’s no room for political violence in America and anyone applauding it will face the consequences. ESPECIALLY those we count on to ensure the safety of the flying public.”United Airlines told the Guardian that they have “been clear with our customers and employees that there’s zero tolerance for politically motivated violence or any attempt to justify it” and that they’ve “taken action on employees in this regard”.CNNalso reported that Delta Air Lines also suspended employees “whose social media content, related to the recent murder of activist Charlie Kirk, went well beyond healthy, respectful debate”.The airlines did not disclose details about the posts.Healthcare workersOn Saturday, the University of Miami’s health system announced that it had fired an employee over what they described as “unacceptable public commentary”.“Freedom of speech is a fundamental right,” the health systemsaid. “At the same time, expressions that condone or endorse violence or are incompatible with our policies or values are not acceptable.”The statement did not elaborate on the remarks made.In Michigan, a nurse wasreportedly placed on leavefor making controversial remarks about Kirk’s death, and another healthcare worker in Virginia was also reportedly fired over for similar reasons.TheBoston Globereported that a Massachusetts-based biomedical research center fired an employee who allegedly posted a “deeply offensive” comment about Kirk’s killing.Other workersEmployees in various other industries are also facing backlash over social media posts related to Kirk’s death.The Carolina Panthersreportedlyfireda public relations staffer for social media posts about Kirk and his death.Several people fired after clampdown on speech over Charlie Kirk shootingRead more“The views expressed by our employees are their own and do not represent those of the Carolina Panthers,” the organizationsaid. “We do not condone violence of any kind.

Five decades later, John Cleese and Connie Booth’s show is still unmatchedPhil HarrisonFri 19 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 19 Sep 2025 07.25 EDTShareThe first episode of Fawlty Towers was broadcast on 19 September 1975. We are now half a century distant from that point; as far away as the first episode of Fawlty Towers was from John Logie Baird’s first successful transmission of greyscale television pictures in 1925. And, while the creation of Fawlty Towers wasn’t a technical breakthrough on quite the same level, Fawlty Towers does feel almost as fundamental and foundational to the medium. Like the music of the Beatles, it’s become part of the dominant cultural language of the era.In a 2019 list compiled by the Radio Times, the show wasnamed the greatest ever British sitcom. Has anyone ever done it better? Fifty years seems a reasonable point at which to assess the show’s legacy and conclude that they probably haven’t. And even if anyone has, they were almost certainly following a template that John Cleese and Connie Booth’s English Riviera romp established.The apparent genesis of Fawlty Towers seems too good to be true and very easy to imagine. During the filming of the second season of Monty Python’s Flying Circus, the cast were staying at a hotel in Torquay. Thanks to the uptight, schoolmasterly proprietor, it was an interesting visit. He made a habit of waiting in the lobby for the group to return after an evening out, and even demonstrated the correct British use of a knife and fork to the American Python Terry Gilliam.This hints at the enduring, antihero appeal of Basil Fawlty. To rewatch Fawlty Towers is to be reminded of how appalling Basil really is. He’s sneaky, pompous, pedantic, xenophobic, rude beyond description, and an appalling snob. And, yet, in a way that offers a clue to the show’s lasting legacy, he’s usually just about got a point. Like Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm, Basil takes tricky situations and amplifies them into comic absurdity by his inability to cut his losses. Curb is one of an endless list of sitcoms that simply would not exist without Fawlty Towers. Arguably, might the “no hugging, no learning” template of Curb’s predecessor, Seinfeld, have been born here? Imagine if Basil had just chilled out a bit? Or if Manuel’s English had improved? No fun. The vast majority of sitcoms are a tortuous loop; everyone has to stay exactly where they are.View image in fullscreen‘Uniformly brilliant performances’ … John Cleese, Connie Booth, Andrew Sachs and Prunella Scales in character for BBC sitcom Fawlty Towers.Photograph: BBC/PAAt one point during the gestation of Fawlty Towers, it was suggested that the show might do without a laughter track or a live studio audience (it plumped for the latter). It’s piquant to imagine the show without the laughter. It would still have been funny, naturally, but also tragic; a man in the middle of a painful meltdown. Many 70s comedies now seem strikingly racked by psychic doubt and even anguish; Reginald Perrin fakes suicide and disappears from his own life. Even a show as cheerful as The Good Life has an existential crisis at its heart.In this sense, Fawlty Towers is an emblematic 70s sitcom. But this became an eternal sitcom trope. From Open All Hours and Only Fools and Horses through to The Office and Peep Show, many classic sitcoms are a parade of men behaving badly but also sadly; men going nowhere; men with big ideas and an infinite capacity for self-sabotage. The gender politics of Fawlty Towers are intriguing and a big part of its enduring appeal. The female characters pick up the pieces. Sybil Fawlty (Prunella Scales) is rarely likable, but she is ferociously efficient. Polly (Connie Booth) is game, funny and endlessly put-upon. For all that the show is inextricably linked withJohn Cleese, Booth’s role as co-creator always feels crucial.In defiance of modern viewing habits, Fawlty Towers never feels particularly bingeable. Instead, it’s the comedy equivalent of an extremely hot chilli: delicious but a little goes a long way. The uniformly brilliant performances are endlessly rewatchable, certainly – Cleese’s aptitude for physical comedy remains unmatched. But to revisit it now is to be struck by the sheer, sustained levels of discomfort on display. Each episode is a tightly constructed panic attack; a perfectly calibrated Swiss watch of cringe. In simple narrative terms, theWaldorf Salad episodein season two is one of the least plot-heavy episodes of comedy it’s possible to imagine. But that isn’t the point; it’s 30 incredibly precise, escalatingly painful minutes based around a series of misunderstandings concerning a dinner order. “This is exactly how Nazi Germany started!” fulminates Basil at the episode’s climax, somehow embodyingGodwin’s law, long before the world wide web was born.View image in fullscreenJohn Cleese, Bruce Boa and Claire Nielson in the episode Waldorf Salad.Photograph: ImagenetThere isn’t much of Fawlty Towers to watch. Two seasons of six episodes each, with a three-and-a-half-year gap between them. The writing of the second season was shadowed by the disintegration of Cleese and Booth’s marriage and Booth subsequently disappeared from the public eye. And yet even this scarcity feels like a feature rather than a bug. It didn’t decline into mediocrity. As such, its brevity has become a beacon for other sitcom writers – the creators of The Office and The Young Ones both cited the show’s decision to quit while they were ahead as an example.As such, it has survived perfectly intact. Where does Fawlty Towers stand in 2025? The West End theatre adaptation is streaming on the U platform and offers a clue. It isn’t a reinterpretation, it’s a faithful reproduction. It is period-detailed comedy karaoke. Because, while television may have evolved since 1975, Fawlty Towers was born fully formed. It still lives in a world of its own.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionJohn CleeseTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We need to get out of here.” As we speed out of a north Belfast estate, he checks the rearview mirror. The pedestrian who spooked him is snapping our departing car with his phone. Once we’re safely out of view, our driver breathes a sigh of relief. “That was a close call. I didn’t mean to scare you but that was a bad boy. And he was definitely taking an interest in us.”As part of our exclusive visit to the set ofBlue Lights– which is about to roar back on to BBC One, sirens blazing and bulbs flashing – the show’s creators and police adviser have invited us on a ride-along around some of the locations that inspired the Bafta-winning drama. It’s the first time they’ve taken a journalist on such a trip and nobody’s treating it lightly.The adviser – a retired detective I’ve been instructed to call “Roy” (not his real name, since there remain security risks for ex-police in Belfast) – told us not to use a Vauxhall or Skoda, which would be twigged as unmarked cop cars. “No matter how covert you think you’re being, they’ll rumble you,” he says. Instead, we’re in a hired SUV for a guided tour of the city’s crime hotspots, trying not to attract unwanted attention.View image in fullscreenThe long arms of the law … Frank Blake as Shane Bradley in series three of Blue LightsPhotograph: BBC/Two Cities Television“These areas traditionally policed themselves because there’s such a stranglehold from organised crime,” says Roy, as we move from a staunch enclave of loyalism – those who wish to remain part of the UK –to one whose residents are republican–supporters of a united Ireland. “I remember a kid on this road stole a neighbour’s car and was going to be kneecapped as punishment. He deliberately assaulted my colleague to get arrested before they came to shoot him. People here lived and died by a sense of community. There was a code of ‘we don’t talk to police’. That’s changed over the last decade or two but there’s still hostility.” Graffiti reading “All cops are bastards”, “Touts out” and “Police fuck off” illustrate his point.It makes law enforcement fraught with risk. “If we came here to arrest a drug dealer, we could be surrounded,” says Roy. “They’d cut off the road. You might have to fight your way out hand-to-hand. If it was somebody of a higher profile in organised crime or [unofficial armed force] the paramilitary, you’d bring four armoured Land Rovers, lots of backup and, in the past, maybe military support.” “Police say they don’t have no-go areas,” addsBlue Lightsco-creator Adam Patterson. “But even now, there are neighbourhoods you wouldn’t enter without significant numbers and force. That’s on both sides of the community.”A total of 302 police were killed during the Troubles.The near-fatal shooting of DCI John Caldwellin 2023, mere weeks before Blue Lights first aired, was a grim reminder that they remain a target. “That gave us pause for thought,” says Patterson. “It was difficult but we talked to police and decided to move ahead. Writing a contemporary show, it’s an occupational hazard to depict things uncomfortably close to real life.”Retired officers are offered a sidearm for personal protection. Roy still checks under his car each morning for bombs. He says: “There are three religions in Northern Ireland: Catholic, Protestant and police. The only thing that unites the first two is their hatred of the third. This is a uniquely dangerous place to be a frontline cop.”View image in fullscreenNeighbourhood watch … Andi Osho as Sandra Cliff in series three of Blue Lights.Photograph: BBC/Two Cities TelevisionTwenty-seven years since the Good Friday agreement, Northern Ireland remains divided along sectarian lines. “You see tribalism everywhere,” says Patterson, pointing out a flag for loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Volunteer Force on a lamppost. “You’re under no illusion about which side of the political fence you’re on.” Wealth divisions are equally stark. As Roy puts it: “You can throw a stone from a council flat and hit a Porsche.” Received wisdom says Belfast is a hard place to police but a harder place to live.It’s against this knotty backdrop that Patterson and his writing partner Declan Lawn set their pulse-pounding drama. The pair met while working as investigative journalists on Panorama and take a documentarians’ approach to storytelling. They interviewed 30 Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officers to inform Blue Lights’ characters and flesh out their fictional world.“We spoke to a lot of cops again for series three, distilling their experiences into the plots,” says Lawn. “Police carry so much pain. The job separates them from their communities and families. It was an emotional process. Officers sat in front of me crying about things they’d been through and what they’d sacrificed.”As part of that commitment to realism, Roy consults on procedural authenticity and ran a boot camp for the cast. “Whenever we’re on location, police stop for selfies with the cast,” says Lawn. “They say that, despite the dramatic licence, the show captures the feeling of a shift in Belfast.”Blue Lights began by following rookie response officers in republican west Belfast. The second series moved across to the loyalist east side. As we return for series three, they’re two years into the job, on the verge of passing their probation and becoming “actual peelers”. Venturing into a different part of the city’s criminal ecosystem, behind the high gates and leafy hedges of south Belfast, they slowly realise how little they still know.“We portray the professional apparatus around organised crime,” says Lawn. “The lawyers and accountants who facilitate it.” “We also look at how the appetite for cocaine, especially in affluent areas, filters down to the job of response cops,” says Patterson. “It causes domestic violence, driving offences, suicides, overdoses – which cops call a ‘coke stroke’. We follow the money to see what fuels the city’s drug trade.” South Belfast is an area close to home for both showrunners. “It’s literally where we live,” laughs Patterson. “If you can’t write that, you’re in trouble.” Lawn adds wryly: “After it airs, we’ll probably have to move.”Series two drew criticism for its workplace romances. “That actually came from our research,” says Lawn. “There’s a surprising amount of in-station romance because cops here can’t go on dating apps for security reasons. The only people it’s safe to consort with are colleagues. Riding around in a car together puts intimacy on fast-forward. This season, all those relationships are put under strain.”Scripts full of gallows humour and police lingo are also rooted in reality. “‘Notebook wanker’ [an officer who does everything by the book] and ‘sneaky beakies’ [MI5 agents] were directly lifted from real cops,” admits Lawn. “So was Gerry Cliff’s catchphrase ‘Take a beat’.”Ah, the much-missed Gerry. The veteran officer, played with craggy charisma by Richard Dormer, was a cult hero until fatally gunned down on duty. “One cop told me about arresting a guy on the street,” laughs Lawn. “The car journey to the custody suite was silent until he leaned forward in his cuffs and said: ‘Guys, I’m really sorry about what happened to Gerry.’ As if they were recently bereaved! They were like: ‘Thanks, mate, we appreciate your concern.’”View image in fullscreenGoing underground … Charlie Maher as Fogerty in series three of Blue Lights.Photograph: BBC/Two Cities TelevisionDo they regret killing him off? “Not at all,” says Lawn. “It was very deliberate. We wanted to explore the legacy of death which most police dramas tend not to do. Somebody dies and two episodes later, they’re never referred to again. That’s not real life. It’s pretty radical for Gerry to be gone but not forgotten. He’s still present – in his wife Sandra’s grief, in the memorial plaque on the station wall. A new character, played by Michael Smiley, knew Gerry back in the day at Special Branch, so we learn about different sides of him.” A fourth series is already commissioned and being written. “As the show goes on, we answer questions about why Gerry died,” says Patterson. “Trust us, by the end, it’ll all make sense.”We pull up at Netherleigh House, the ex-government building that doubles as Blackthorn police station, to watch filming in progress. Once you’re inside its bustling corridors and locker rooms, full of patrol boots and rolls of barrier tape, it’s uncannily convincing. I pause to pay my respects at Gerry’s plaque. “Everyone does that when they first come here,” says Lawn.I grab a chat with actors Siân Brooke and Martin McCann, who play constables Grace Ellis and Stevie Neill. The will-they-won’t-they colleagueswere last seendriving off into the sunset in a taxi. “A year on, they’re now a couple,” says Brooke. “They’re living together, even looking at houses to buy.”Tensions arise when Stevie is offered a temporary promotion to sergeant. “He’s a pragmatist,” says McCann. “The bucket man who shovels shit. Stevie gets the job done, finishes his shift, then goes home.” “Whereas Grace is an ex-social worker who wants to make a difference,” adds Brooke. “That causes friction. But, oh my God, if I had a penny for every time somebody comes up and asks if they’ll end up together. There’s genuine affection for them. People are invested.”Three series in, the duo have grown accustomed to their uniforms. “Sometimes sitting in the patrol car, the stab vests ride up around our heads,” says McCann, “and we look like Ninja Turtles. Two neckless wonders.” Brooke admits the role leaks into her own life: “I’ll be in my car, spot things on the street and say: ‘What’s going on over there?’ My husband has to remind me: ‘Siân, you’re not a police officer.’”View image in fullscreenKindergarten cops? … Dearbháile McKinney as Aisling Byrne and Katherine Devlin as Annie Conlon in series three of Blue Lights.Photograph: BBC/Two Cities TelevisionGo through a door and we’re in a luxurious new location: a swanky members’ club, presided over by Cathy Tyson – along with Smiley, this year’s other major cast addition. “The club is basically a front for criminal enterprise,” says Lawn. “It’s our way into issues like child exploitation, drug dealing on encrypted messaging apps and white-collar clients.” I also watch a funeral scene (no spoilers as to whose funeral). So sombre is the atmosphere and so powerful the performances, it’s still moving by the sixth take.Roy believes the show fulfils an important function by humanising the police: “Police used to be represented on TV by a silhouette of a flak jacket and a rifle. Just another part of state oppression. Blue Lights gives us a voice. We see the person behind the uniform.”It also portrays a Belfast where attitudes are slowly changing. “There’s a long way to go but we’re optimistic,” says Patterson. “It’s a show about trying to move forward, not be pulled backwards by history. All communities are proud of the show. I think that’s because it is uncompromising and written in our vernacular. Declan and I aren’t just journalists. We’re Belfast citizens who love this chaotic place for all its flaws.”It’s not just our fictional heroes who get flung into life-or-death situations. “We were filming on location early in the series,” says Lawn. “A crowd gathered to watch, as they often do, when one guy collapsed with a heart attack. There was this weird expectation that our actors would spring into action. Two extras dressed in uniform were like: ‘We’re not actually cops.’ But they ended up giving CPR until paramedics arrived. We checked the next day and the man was OK. Even fake cops can be useful now and again.”“Sharp eyes save lives” is an oft-quoted mantra in the show. It seems that Blue Lights saves lives too.Blue Lights returns to BBC One on 29 September at 9pmand on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionBlue LightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This was a masterclass by Kévin Rouet’s team who used pace, patience and instincts to knock the Blacks Ferns out and book their spot in the final for only the second time.The match had already been picked out as one that would go down in history but the result certified that. Sophie de Goede excelled once again for Canada. Whether affecting breakdown turnovers, kicking conversions or tearing through the opposition defence, she was the linchpin. The trust Canada had in each other when they had front-foot ball allowed them to play with pure freedom that downed New Zealand and set up a final against England or France next Saturday.England and France ready to fight for a shot at Women’s World Cup gloryRead moreThis is the first time since 2014 New Zealandwill not be in the final, their first tournament loss since Ireland defeated them 11 years ago and just the second semi-final they have lost. Canada, who crowdfunded their preparations for this tournament and are semi-professional, went in as underdogs, a title they will surely not be labelled with again after a performance for the ages.“The confidence in this team, we arrived at the game not being stressed by the event and not being stressed by playing the Black Ferns,” Rouet said. “That is a big gamechanger for us, especially with the way we want to play the game. If we don’t have the confidence it is going to be hard for us. I like to see that in this team now. I am pretty confident I will see the same behaviour arriving at the final.”Ashton Gate was almost sold out and the tension was palpable. There were perfect conditions with no rain all day and clear skies at kick-off. Canada laid no challenge in response to the haka, they simply watched in a tight-knit line as the Black Ferns electrified the atmosphere.The first blood came from a well-worked Canada try with the captain, Alex Tessier, collecting a chipped kick and the player of the match, Justine Pelletier, evading defenders to dive over. The crowd were treated to more moves from Canada as they constantly broke the line and they next scored through Asia Hogan-Rochester. The wing jumped on a huddle of her teammates in celebration with the Black Ferns looking shocked by how fast Canada were converting.View image in fullscreenNew Zealand’s Stacey Waaka loses control of the ball under pressure from Canada’s relentless defence.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianEach of the Canadian tries came after they won a penalty and kicked to the corner and their third was no different. A rolling maul and 15 phases later Florence Symonds scored and the defending champions congregated under the sticks trying to figure out how to get back into the game.Whatever was said in that huddle worked: less than two minutes later Tanya Kalounivale was over. It set fire to New Zealand’s attack but one move went begging with a forward pass and then another through a dropped ball. The injurythat sidelined Jorja Millerin those moments was keenly felt: in previous matches she was the player to create something from nothing. Not taking their chances cost New Zealand as Canada were in again, this time through the formidable De Goede.The Black Ferns knew they had to be the next to score after the break but Canada did not take their foot off of the gas, with Tessier going over. A whiff of a comeback began with tries from Liana Mikaele-Tu’u and Braxton Sorensen-McGee, who added her ninth of the tournament, but it was snuffed out with a De Goede penalty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tukuafu said she was “gutted” and Bunting added: “Sport is pretty tough sometimes. It can break your heart. We get another opportunity, which is a good thing, to play for our country.” The Black Ferns will play in the bronze medal match before the final next Saturday.Canada may be underdogs again for the final, particularly if they face England, but that will be a mere title. Rouet’s side proved themselves before this semi-final as the world No 2 team but this will have woken everyone up to the level they are capable of.

With Pep Guardiola this is always going to be meant as a positive thing, a sign of a team starting to fizz.These are benevolent machines: not so much joyless droid-football, more perfectly functioning jam factory assembly line, interlocking units, systems in perfect concert. A chess computer playing padel against a chess computer, coached by 25 even more powerful chess computers. A conversation about Bauhaus architecture in a New York food-science restaurant where dessert is a cube of fibreglass flambéed at your table by a hologram.Garnacho’s return is a referendum on Amorim – he cannot afford to be embarrassed | David HytnerRead moreSomething like that anyway. It is acceptable to get a little carried away, a little purple prose at the spectacle of a high-functioning Guardiola team. If only because Guardiola himself is such a paradox.Here we have the ultimate control coach, whose ideal game of football is the million-man midfield plus infinite possession, but who is simultaneously gripped by an almost comical degree of unfiltered passion, leaping on the touchline, carving wild human shapes in the air with his cold metal robot hands.Either way machine-level excellence was clearly a theme of the post-match chat in a very happy Manchester City dressing room aftera fine, fluid 3-0 winagainst a non-fine, non-fluid Manchester United last weekend.Guardiola’s eyes boggled with pleasure as he spoke about the relentlessness of his players. “Erling is a machine,” was Jérémy Doku’s verdict afterErling Haalandhad scored two fine goals and in between spent much of the game running over the various portions of sullen human flesh acting as the United defence.Although, arguably, the parts that stood out most were when Haaland was less not more of machine, and in ways that may – repeat: this was against the outdated software, the systems crash of Amorim-era United – point to a change in City’s attacking patterns.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland’s goal past Manchester United’s Altay Bayindir in the derby victory for City had an air of assuredness.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersThe usual elite Haaland qualities were there. The sniper’s eye. The miss-one-score-two fearlessness. The preternatural height-to-speed agility ratio, a physical gift, but one that also requires constant maintenance, aged 25, and is perhaps a little taken for granted in his fourth season at City.It is easy to overplay the nature of the Haaland style. He remains an unusual elite footballer, albeit one who is either a single-cell Viking goal-zombie with the first touch of a League Two carpet-fitter; or the complete centre-forward every time he manages to complete a through ball.But there was also a slight sense of pattern-shift to the way Haaland led City’s attacks, and an ominous note forArsenalbefore Sunday’s unavoidably massive early season meeting at the Emirates. Liverpool play their home derby against Everton on Saturday. Their record in that fixture reads played 12 and lost one with an aggregate score of 24-7 over the past decade.By the time Monday rolls around, defeat by City at home could leave Arsenal six points behind the champions before the early season fumblings have ironed themselves out. You can’t win the title in September. But you can do quite a lot to stop Arsenal from winning it.And for Haaland in particular the chance to inflict a lung-crunching early body shot may just represent an interesting side-project. Is it personal with Arsenal now? Surely not. Football moves too quickly, players see each other constantly. There isn’t really time for genuine old-school grievances to fester. But it is also easy to forget that the last meeting of these teams in February was a strange occasion, a statement-style Arsenal result that ended up meaning very little, and also, in its optics, something of a grudge game.View image in fullscreenMyles Lewis-Skelly replicated Erling Haaland’s yogic celebration after scoring in Arsenal’s thumping 5-1 win over Manchester City in February.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersA5-1 Arsenal wincould have felt like a corner turned given their poor league record against City across the entirety of the Guardiola mega-era. Five Arsenal players scored that day, including two teenagers. But what might have been a note of ignition became instead a moment of vertigo.Arsenal went out of the Carabao Cup three days later. The next home game was the1-0 defeat by West Hamthat killed the league season. After the City game they dropped 18 points in their next 12 games and were 10 off the top at the end.Scroll back and the key snapshot that day wasMyles Lewis-Skelly doing the Haaland yogic celebrationafter scoring, a follow-up to the “Who the fuck are you?” interplay between the twoin the previous game at the Etihad. This is all fine, fun, normal stuff. Lewis-Skelly is a very good and confident young player. Haaland probably found it funny.

Yes, you’re nine points ahead of your closest recent rivals. But this was actually the chance to win the league in City’s season of drop-off. And Haaland now has the opportunity to open another chapter in a game that actually does count for something, going into which he is also in a rare run of form.View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola was effusive in his praise of Erling Haaland after the striker’s display against Napoli in the Champions League this week.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAHis current goalscoring run is modern-football craziness: 18 in his past 14 games from May to September, scored across four competitions against opponents from eight countries. We can probably say it now. This guy, well, this guy knows how to do this.Haaland has also been playing a little differently, at least at certain times and against the right opponents. In the Manchester derby he had 31 touches, five of which were shots, six headed clearances. His control has just got better, his passing quicker and more City-like.This should happen. He is being coached by Guardiola every week. But there is also a sense the team shape and the available spaces have shifted a little. Two things were apparent on Sunday. First Haaland dropped deeper, linking the transitions well. Late in the second half he took the ball in the centre circle, sniped into space and nudged a perfect pass to put Tijjani Reijnders in on goal, De Bruyne-style.Pep Guardiola unsure if Rodri will be fit enough to start for Manchester City at ArsenalRead moreAnd second, he got to run at the centre-backs, using his speed facing goal as a weapon as it was in his Borussia Dortmund years. Even his close-range opener had him running away from a mildly interested Luke Shaw, before producing a super-delicate finish. His second involved romping like a wild mustang from halfway. And yes, outpacing Harry Maguire over 40 yards may be the elite football equivalent of defeating a pot plant in a bare knuckle fist fight, but the finish also had a lovely air of inevitability.Haaland is just very, very good at this, in a way that has at times got lost in City’s blitz attack. It helps to have the right opponents. United’s centre-backs repeatedly stepped up to fill holes left by an outmanoeuvred central pivot, leaving gaps to sprint into, another example of how easy it is to plan against a manager who tells you exactly what he’s going to do every time.Haaland could be in his familiar pared-back form against Arsenal, who have excellent, mobile centre-backs and a swarming midfield block. But he has also produced outstanding all-round games against the same opponents, most notably inthe 3-1 win in February 2023.And on days like these he really can look, not just like an actual centre-forward, but like the best centre-forward in Europe. For Arsenal he presents a highly motivated note of danger in a game that already feels like an eliminator for the right to chase Liverpool through the autumn.Explore more on these topicsErling HaalandManchester CityArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In order to change the record, it may be time to do something different with Everton on Saturday. The club won at an empty Anfield underCarlo Ancelottiduring Covid but have not silenced the stadium since 1999.Your Guardian sport weekend: Women’s Rugby World Cup semis, Azerbaijan Grand Prix and moreRead moreWith Everton emboldened by positive beginnings to the campaign, starting the weekend sixth, this could be the moment for Moyes to be more adventurous. The arrival on loan of Jack Grealishhas brought new lifeto his forward line. The England international looks revived after becoming a bit-part player at Manchester City. Four assists in as many games show the threat he offers.A goalless draw last Saturday against Aston Villa did not reflect the quality of Everton’s attacking but did show their continued defensive fortitude, three goals having been conceded this season. Everton’s expected goals (xG) was 2.08 but they got only two of 20 shots on target. The salient point is that they are creating opportunities and attacking with urgency. Grealish manufactured five chances against Villa, offering a creative spark not heavily associated with the team over recent years.Iliman Ndiaye and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall enhance Everton’s armoury. The Senegal international brings his own brand of trickery and an uncertainty with the ball at his feet regarding what will happen next, an attribute that confuses and scares opponents in equal measure. Dewsbury-Hall has guile and intelligence, wanting to play progressive vertical passes when he can to keep Everton moving forward. There is even the enticing prospect of giving Tyler Dibling a debut off the bench to test the Liverpool full-backs.Only three players in the Premier League have completed more take-ons than Grealish and Ndiaye, who have eight. Although Liverpool are top, there is an acceptance that they are vulnerable, and a more expansive Everton could exploit them. “We have got to be careful,” Moyes says. “We have to watch we don’t open ourselves up. We lost narrowly at Anfield and had a draw at Goodison [last season], both close games. So I think Liverpool’s signings have improved them. It’ll show, maybe not immediately, but it will show in time. We are improving as well. It is difficult to show improvement at the top for Liverpool, but we have a real chance to show we have made a step up. It doesn’t mean we are close to Liverpool yet but I am going to see if we can get a positive result if we can.”View image in fullscreenIliman Ndiaye brings his own brand of trickery to Everton’s attack.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Ed Sykes/Apl/SportsphotoOne clear issue is the centre-forward. Thierno Barry is still settling and Beto has never given the impression of being prolific, though eight goals in 30 Premier League appearances last season give a faint indication he could be a useful striker.When Everton drew with Liverpool at Goodison Park last season, Beto was dominant, causing Virgil van Dijk regular problems. He may not often be in the same league as the Liverpool captain but he has the ability to raise his game for box office events.“Liverpool have played at a different level to us for the past few years and against teams that have been at a different level and they did in midweek as well,” Moyes says, referencing the Champions League and Wednesday’swin against Atlético Madrid. “I think we will go and try and do the best we can and we always have done. I don’t think there is any game we haven’t done that. At the moment I wouldn’t care how I won at Anfield. I would take any sort of victory I possibly could; it wouldn’t matter whether I played great expansive football or defended with a low block.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Keane was close to providinga winner against Aston Villaand the same level of intent in the box would be problematic for Liverpool. Variety is advantageous, to keep opponents needing to deal with consistent problems.Liverpool have had issues at full-back. On the right, fitness concerns have limited the game time of Jeremie Frimpong and Conor Bradley, forcing Dominik Szoboszlai to learn a new position. On the opposite flank, Milos Kerkez has provided mixed results and Andy Robertson replaced him against Atlético. Liverpool looked vulnerable down their left, from where the Spanish side got numerous crosses into the box. Everton will feel they can exploit the lack of consistency in the lineup of Liverpool’s back four.History shows how difficult it is for Everton to win at Liverpool. Moyes knows pragmatism will be imperative if he is to change the record but he finally possesses the weaponry and style to threaten the champions. This could be the moment to loosen the shackles at Anfield.Explore more on these topicsEvertonDavid MoyesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Portuguese has insisted throughout that run that he is not for turning, a message he reiterated in emphatic, dramatic fashion prior to Chelsea’s visit to Old Trafford this evening.“Not even the pope will change [my thinking on] this. This is my responsibility. This is my life,” he said. “If I’m a player and I have a coach that with a lot of pressure all around the world is being told: ‘You need to change the system’ and I’m going to change – they [the players] will look at me in a different way. So, I will not change that, but there will be an evolution. But we need to make all the good steps [first].”Garnacho’s return is a referendum on Amorim – he cannot afford to be embarrassed | David HytnerRead moreBenjamin Sesko is yet to score in five United appearances since his £73.5m summer arrival from RB Leipzig. In part that has been down to a lack of service, something that also held back Rasmus Højlund prior to the Denmark striker’s loan move to Napoli. Amorim, however, is unconcerned about history repeating itself: “If you remember Arsenal [in the opening game of the season] we missed a lot [of chances]. Burnley, we missed a lot. Fulham in the beginning, we missed a lot”.Amorim did admit a lack of service to the striker was an issue in last weekend’s 3-0 loss at Manchester City, Sesko’s first start for United. “Against City, Sesko looks like he’s alone in the box, I agree,” said the head coach. “In the final third we get there many times [but] when I look at the box, Ben was alone. We cannot score in that way. But [overall] I think it’s not the same team in that department compared to last year.”Amorim also defended deploying Bruno Fernandes in midfield. “I want Bruno deeper, to have more possession, to try to control the game more. And we are doing that,” he said. “Sometimes we miss Bruno a little bit up front. Maybe because [Mathues] Cunha is not there. But if Cunha is there, we have one extra player.”Meanwhile, Amorim has revealed he received a show of support from SirJim Ratcliffeafter Manchester United’s co-owner flew in for a meeting on Thursday.The Portuguese met Ratcliffe after he arrived at United’s Carrington training ground in a helicopter, along with the chief executive, Omar Berrada, and the football director, Jason Wilcox, and insisted the discussions were positive. “He was offering me a new contract,” joked Amoim of Ratcliffe. “[No], it’s normal things, just to show the support. Explaining that it’s a long project. He said many times: ‘This is my third season.’ For me it’s not. I spoke with him, with Omar, with Jason. Just trying to see all the data around the team. So a normal meeting and we had several, but at this moment it’s normal people pay attention to that.”View image in fullscreenSir Alex Ferguson (top left) behind Jason Wilcox, who is next to Omar Berrada and then Sir Jim Ratcliffe, during Manchester United’s 3-0 defeat at City on 14 September.Photograph: David Blunsden/Action Plus/ShutterstockAmorim acknowledged he has to win more matches. “This is football and this is the club with more pressure in the world,” the 40-year-old said. “But we want to win. Last year I was very critical of the way we play. [This year] we are playing well until the boxes. Defending and attacking. We need to be more aggressive in the boxes. We need to be more clinical.“The rest I think we are improving. Comparing to last year we are in a better place. But again we need to win. We lost against Arsenal and we lost against City. And here losing, especially in the beginning after last season [finishing 15th], is a problem.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I came in last April, around 18 months ago, and it’s been a real challenge – I can’t lie.“I thought the club was in a much better place than it was. We had no football identity, we lacked alignment between ownership, the CEO, football and the academy and we’ve just been working so hard behind the scenes.”Amorim will have Cunha and Mason Mount available for the game against Chelsea and he brushed aside questions regarding Alejandro Garnacho’s return to the venue. The wingerjoined Chelsea for £40m last month.“Garnacho is not our player,” said Amorim. “I’m focused on our players – I’m really happy with Mase and Cunha returning. That is my focus.

At that time I was depressed, but this time I am energised. I love what I do and I am happy. I have the best support staff and the best crowd I could have ever asked for.“My face is blasted everywhere over Tokyo. This is amazing and such a joyous moment I am going to keep with me for ever. Now I want to win the gold medal in the relay.”The talented Jamaican Bryan Levell just pipped the Olympic champion Letsile Tebogo, who has been nursing a knee problem, to take bronze. Britain’s Zharnel Hughes was fifth.“I studied my competitors,” Lyles said. “I knew their momentum was going to slow up once we got closer to 150m but mine was going to build up after I hit that mark. Being patient was the most important thing. I controlled the race. I knew some of the guys were going to tighten up but I just stayed relaxed and got the job done.”There was drama in the men’s 400m hurdles as the Olympic champion Rai Benjamin was initially disqualified after crossing the line first before being reinstated as the winner.View image in fullscreenThe USA’s Rai Benjamin dons a crown after his victory in the 400m hurdles.Photograph: Andrzej Iwańczuk/NurPhoto/ShutterstockThe American had a crown on his head when an official told him he was going to lose his gold medal because in knocking down his final hurdle it had dislodged a hurdle in the next lane to him in the final straight.The decision was overturned, however, when it was shown that it had no impact on the final result.“We were sitting down near the elimination chairs, ironically, and Alison dos Santos said the referees are reviewing the race,” said Benjamin, who won in 46.52sec. “And that it was about me being disqualified. I asked: ‘Did I step on the line or what?’ It might have been because of that last hurdle I knocked down. But it was all fine in the end.”The world record-holder, Karsten Warholm, was left frustrated after finishing fifth in 47.58. “I had something happen when I got out of the block, like a little strain in my left thigh,” he said. “I don’t know if it’s a hamstring or knee.View image in fullscreenFemke Bol (centre) celebrates after winning gold in Tokyo.Photograph: Andy Astfalck/MTB-Photo/Shutterstock“Trying to hurdle with it wasn’t good.

To luxuriate even, in the contentment so sparingly yielded at the highest level. None of which, strikingly, is the case for Laurent Mekies,the new team principal of Red Bull, who concedes only to an overwhelming, almost Sisyphean, commitment to moving ever forward, ever upward.“There is no such thing as having made it, you always feel you are surviving,” he says. “You always feel that you should have done more yesterday, more a week ago. To step up next week, next month. You never feel you made it – never, never, never.”The Frenchman leads one of one of the most successful teams in Formula One’s modern era, a role he took on two months ago after the former team principalChristian Horner was sacked. It is one of the most high-profile and high-intensity positions in the sport, what might be considered a herculean task for the 48-year-old to go with his own self-imposed boulder rolling.Atthe last round in Monza, Max Verstappen took Red Bull’s first GP victory under Mekies, his first major achievement with the team duly ticked off as they go into this weekend’s Azerbaijan Grand Prix. With over 20 years in the sport there must have been similar occasions when he could allow himself a sense of satisfaction?Piastri and Norris ‘in control of own destiny’ in F1 world championship battleRead more“If you feel you made it, you feel like that on the evening of a win. Then on Monday morning, it’s over,” is as much as he will allow.Mekies is a fascinating character, at ease in theRed Bullmotorhome for his first full interview with any British media since he took over from Horner in July. Notably he chooses to sit alongside me, rather than behind the desk in his office.There is a palpable sense he feels the need to communicate earnestly and honestly. His answers are not rehearsed but thoughtful, with the careful precision that might be expected of a man from an engineering background. He is clearly interested in a desire to connect, a distance from the more businesslike approaches of some of his contemporaries. He will lean in almost intimately to make a point, occasionally touching my arm to emphasise, to ensure he is being understood.Perhaps this desire to connect is what he is now bringing to Red Bull and while adamant in his determination to keep striving, he is also pleasingly human enough to know he has one hell of a gig.“When I go to the pit wall, every single race weekend you feel the most privileged. You know you have the best seat in the house,” he says. “I’m excited. I can’t wait to get the car ready to go, I’m like a kid, just sitting with Max, I just want to see the car running. So you see the contrast between the two? You never feel you made it, but you always feel privileged.”The kid, who never believed he would make it to F1 then, is still peering out through the man’s eyes. “I was just a little boy playing with his cars, watching the races with my father,” he says of growing up in France. “The first race my parents took me to was in 1988 at the French Grand Prix. It was in the heat of the Prost-Senna battle. You get submerged by that atmosphere that feels like it’s the most fantastic sport in the world but it feels so far away.“You don’t think you will be ever entering a paddock, let alone work inFormula One.”Yet he was far from deterred. Mekies studied mechanical engineering at the ESTACA school in France before gaining an internship with the Signatech F3 team, a moment he describes as “life-changing”.He went on to enter F1 with Arrows in 2001, stints at Minardi and Toro Rosso followed before he became safety director at the FIA in 2014, the year Jules Bianchi suffered injuries in an accident at Suzukathat proved fatal nine months later.Mekies was at the helm in the difficult years that followed as the sport’s governing body oversaw the introduction of the halo cockpit protection device. He noted, with typical determination given the opposition to it at the time, that there could be no room for complacency in safety.View image in fullscreenLaurent Mekies (centre) with Max Verstappen (left) and Yuki Tsunoda at Monza – Verstappen’s Italian GP victory was Red Bull’s first race win under the new team principal.Photograph: Jay Hirano/ShutterstockFerrari brought him on board in 2018 and he became racing director in 2021 before Red Bull headhunted him to return to their sister team, now known as Racing Bulls, as team principal in 2024.There he was witness to the turmoil that went on to embroil Red Bull that season. The controversy that surrounded Horner after accusations of inappropriate behaviour by an employee – for which he was later cleared by an investigation – was followed by the loss of a number of key personnel, including the design guru Adrian Newey.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mekies will have no easy pass from them and that too is part of his challenge. Here he offers a straightforward, if necessarily diplomatic, solution.“I’d like to oversimplify the situation. We are here to conceive, to design, to produce the fastest car possible,” he says. “When you do that, everything gets sorted. So that’s where the focus goes, not in terms of: ‘Do I need to manage that? … or that?’.“Max is a huge asset in the car, he’s a huge asset outside of the car. He’s part of the project, he’s not judging the project from outside, he’s pulling the project every day from inside.”Certainly in these early days Mekies is winning hearts and minds, earning praise from the world champion and Marko.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen ahead of Lando Norris during the Italian GP – the Dutchman’s third race victory of the season.Photograph: Alessio Morgese/NurPhoto/Shutterstock“What I like is the technical questions throughout the weekend, back at the factory, useful meetings. It seems like that’s all working well,” saidMax Verstappen.“The whole technical team is more open and they discuss things,” Marko said. “Appointing him was the right decision. Given the complexity of F1, having a technical expert at the top is probably the better solution.”Mekies is also seemingly less inclined towards the somewhat adversarial approach of Horner, who revelled in rubbing up against other teams and bosses. Yet Horner also inspired great loyalty and was much loved by many at the team. His dismissal after 20 years in charge was both shocking and upsetting for many staff. How Mekies dealt with that moment of upheaval is instructive.“‘Why are we changing? Why now?’ were all questions I didn’t have an answer to,” he says. “So I told them exactly as I’m telling you now. The why and the why now are not questions for me. I don’t have the answer to them. There is no other way than to be honest. My focus is on the future and the next phase.“Of course it is the biggest challenge. But if I go back, the one before was the previous biggest, and the one before was the previous biggest. There is only one objective we have been given, to go back to winning and to do it the Red Bull way. That’s the only brief.”Explore more on these topicsRed BullFormula OneMax VerstappenMotor sportinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Hillsin travelled smoothly from the off and still clearly had plenty of running left when he jumped the last within a length of the lead, but Kitts remained motionless all the way to the line without asking his mount to quicken, before eventually finishing third, a length-and-a-quarter behind the winner.Kitts told a recent disciplinary hearing into the case that he had deliberately prevented Hillsin from winning, due to the “perception of a threat” from Higgins if he did not. He has not ridden in public since the Worcester race and has left the sport. Higgins, like Barnes, refused to co-operate with the investigation and declined to appear at the hearing, on the grounds of ill-health.Despite Kitts’s suggestion that he had been threatened, the panel said in its initial finding on Friday that the jockey’s “life or personal safety was not threatened in the event that he failed to comply with the instructions which he received from John Higgins”, adding that he “had ample opportunity to refuse to comply with Mr Higgins’ instructions, had he been minded to do so.”Honour was found to have misled the local stewards after the racing, telling them that Kitts had told him that Hillsin had been “hanging” in the closing stages. In the panel’s view, “while it was a lie which could have been construed as the lie of a co-conspirator… it was far more likely to be attributable to a desire to defend a young jockey who had been found wanting in how he should have run his race.”The penalties for Kitts and Higgins will be decided at a later date.The British Horseracing Authority said in statement that it was “pleased” by the independent panel’s decision, adding: “The actions of those involved in this case are fundamentally incompatible with British racing’s values and are an affront to the many thousands of people, up and down the country, who dedicate their lives to this sport and to competing fairly.“The outcome of this hearing demonstrates that our sport will not accept this sort of behaviour, and we will always do what we can to uphold our values and ensure everybody who loves racing can be confident in its integrity.”Electrics has spark for Gold Cup sprintJim Goldie registered the first Group One success of his 30-year training career when American Affair took the King Charles III Stakes at Royal Ascot in June, but the Lanarkshire trainer might well draw even greater satisfaction from a first success in the Ayr Gold Cup on the final day of the track’s Western meeting on Saturday.Goldie has turned his stable into a northern powerhouse over the last four seasons, posting a new record for prize money won in every campaign since 2022, and has already moved into seven figures for the first time this year.He has had little to celebrate in Ayr’s historic sprint handicap, however, with the long-time stable stalwart, Hawkeyethenoo, failing to make even the first 10 home in five attempts from 2010 to 2014, while American Affair, racing off a mark of 97, was only 16th after setting off as 11-4 favourite 12 months ago.Goldie relies onJordan Electrics(3.35), fifth home as the stable second-string last season, in this year’s renewal, and while it is, as ever, an intensely competitive handicap, the nine-year-old could prove to be the horse to end the trainer’s long wait for a win.It is, admittedly, an unusually advanced age for a potential Ayr Gold Cup winner but Jordan Electrics is an unusual sprinter who notched no fewer than seven handicap wins as an eight-year-old last year.There are valid excuses for a couple of lesser efforts this year and Jordan Electrics, who is priced up at around 20-1, was just over half a length behind Northern Ticker, the likely favourite, at York last month.He is 5lb better off with that rival on Saturday and also has Goldie’s excellent apprentice, Lauren Young, who was aboard last weekend’s Portland Handicap winner at Doncaster, taking off a potentially invaluable 7lb.Ayr 1.15Mr Kinghad no luck in running last time and is weighted to go close with a better passage.Newbury 1.30Montassib drops to five furlongs for the first time on his seasonal debut andCover Upcould could exploit any rustiness in last year’s Group One Sprint Cup winner.Ayr 1.50The lightly racedAlmericshould find further improvement for the step up to 10 furlongs.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday tipsShowNewmarket:1.00 Annastarzy 1.35 Queen Of Atlantis 2.10 Dapper Guest 2.45 Golden Redemption 3.20 Bob Mali 3.55 Almuhit 4.30 Warrant Holder 5.05 Triple Force.Ayr:1.15 Mr King 1.50 Almeric 2.25 Fivethousandtoone 3.00 Catching The Moon 3.35 Jordan Electrics (nap) 4.10 Red Spells Danger 4.40 Jannas Journey 5.15 Rock Melody.Newbury:1.30 Cover Up 2.05 Majestic Warrior (nb) 2.40 Night Step 3.15 Into The Sky 3.50 Sticktoyourguns 4.25 Linwood 5.00 Stem.Chester:1.55 Go Victor 2.30 Callahan 3.05 Al Shabab Storm 3.40 Paws For Thought 4.15 Jer Batt 4.45 Solar Pass 5.20 Imperial Trooper.Wolverhampton:4.19 Dunkeld Dreamer 4.50 Highlighting 5.25 Ten Sixty Six 5.55 Queen Kassi 6.30 Hilltop 7.00 Under Curfew 7.30 Karakula 8.00 Jimmy Mark 8.30 Dragonfly In Amber.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Newbury 2.05A slight drop in trip could be just whatMajestic Warriorneeds after a solid run in the Ebor last time.Ayr 2.25Fivethousandtooneis 4lb below his last winning mark on turf and can build on a promising run last weekend.Newbury 2.40Owen Burrows’s three-year-oldNight Stepmaintained his progression in defeat last month and remains fairly weighted on a 2lb higher mark.Ayr 3.00Catching The Moonshowed a fine turn of foot at Beverley last month and looks ready for this step up in grade.Newbury 3.15Jim Boyle’sInto The Skywas an 80-1 shot on debut but powered nearly eight lengths clear of his field and the bare form was backed up by an excellent time.Explore more on these topicsBritish Horseracing AuthorityTalking HorsesHorse racing tipsHorse racingnewsShareReuse this content"

Could the Europa League offer a boost?Ben FisherFri 19 Sep 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 19 Sep 2025 15.02 EDTShareThe statistic doing the rounds this week was that Chris Wilder has been sacked andreappointed as the Sheffield United managersinceBoubacar Kamara scored Aston Villa’s last league goalfour months ago. Villa have been slow out of the blocks and this is unusual territory for Unai Emery, who has spent the best part of three years almost exclusively exceeding all expectations, elevating a team who were near the bottom of the Premier League into one capable of bloodying the noses of European superpowers in the Champions League.But a sticky start, of four Premier League matches without a victory or goal – they are the only team in the English professional pyramid to carry that ignominious mantle – and amidweek Carabao Cup exit, has been rather in keeping with a difficult few months. Villa headed into the summer knowing incomings would be limited owing to the financial picture andthey sold Jacob Ramsey, a homegrown and well-regarded player, plus some on the fringes, to help balance the books. But uncertainty lingered around key players until the September transfer deadline, none more so than their goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez, who had been keen to move. Theadditions of Harvey Elliott, who will join permanently next summer,Jadon Sancho and Victor Lindelöfbelatedly provided a much-needed boost.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreConsidering Villareached the Champions League quarter-finalslast season, they have arguably improved year on year sinceNassef Sawiris and Wes Edensacquired the club. So, has it been a strange time? “A little bit, but we keep going,” Emery says. “Because I had a lot of [difficult] moments. Two and a half years ago we lost three matches in a row [against Leicester,Manchester CityandArsenal], and in that moment I was focused on the reaction. Today is the same. The last two matches, I felt our progress.”Is it too early to think this could be a defining week for Villa? On Sunday they visit the Stadium of Light – where Sunderland have won both games since returning to the top flight – in need of a fillip and a week later host Fulham, another side they will be expected to overcome, in between hosting Bologna in the Europa League on Thursday. Emery recently watchedSunderland ’Til I Die, the Netflix documentary taking in their journey down to League One and back up, and it is worth remembering the strides Villa have taken in recent years. Equally, that does not mean Emery is immune to scrutiny.“Circumstances” was the buzzword for Emery on Friday and, really, it is a euphemism for the financial rules the Villa hierarchy believe hinder clubs with naked ambition from progressing. The parameters have been compared by Villa’s senior figures to the tightening of not one but two belts. Qualifying for a European competition for the third successive season ensures another set of hurdles, with Uefa’s squad cost rule (SCR) – which limits spending at 70% of revenues – as pertinent an issue as the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules. Villa’s wages-to-revenue ratio in 2023-24, covering a 13-month period, was a league-high 91%. Villa were fined £9.5m in Julyfor breaching SCRand agreed a “glide path” with Uefa to move in line with the rules, acutely aware the ultimate punishment is they could be kicked out of continental competition for repeated transgressions.At the time Villa felt adamant they could strengthen despite the rules but it has proved trickier than envisaged. Senior players acknowledge more signings would have invigorated the squad, with Ezri Konsa, one of Villa’s most consistent players, suggesting the ruleshad “killed” Villaand another, Youri Tielemans, noting there is a balance to strike. “Sometimes it’s good to have new players because it brings some freshness and you get different qualities, but in my experience, when I was coming in as a new player I took some time to put the system in my body because it can take some time,” he said last month.View image in fullscreenNew signing Harvey Elliott (No 9 in picture) scored Aston Villa’s only goal of the season so far in the Carabao Cup defeat by Brentford.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersIt may explain why Villa’s bigger signings have struggled to enhance the team. Donyell Malen has made three league starts since arriving in January from Borussia Dortmund in a £20m deal, Ian Maatsen has not displaced Lucas Digne at left-back since joining for £37.5m from Chelsea – instead Digne signed a new contract this summer – and Amadou Onana, after a fast start, scoring twice in his first three matches, has been on the periphery of Villa’s success, partly owing to injury. Moussa Diaby also faded before Villa recouped their £50m outlay after a single season. Villa believe there is more to come fromEvann Guessand, a £30m summer buy.It is also worth remembering that this time last season Villa’s start was not as flawless as it seems. Villa won six of their first seven matches in all competitions but in that run Emery turned to his bench and, chiefly, Jhon Durán. The Colombia striker, on loan at Fenerbahce after leaving for the Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr in January, scored five goals in that period, four as a substitute, including three winners. Emery moved for Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio in January to quicken the pulse of his side and maybe Elliott and Sancho will yet do similar.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Failure to score at Sunderland would make them the third team in English top-flight history not to score in their first five league games, joining Ipswich in 1970-71 and that Palace side. The dismal start eight years agocost Frank de Boer his joband though Palace roused under Roy Hodgson, who led them to mid-table, they had to wait until after the October international break for their league first goal and victory. Emery is not under any internal pressure but the expectations are significantly greater at Villa. “Genuine expectations are now in a difficult place,” said Damian Vidagany, Villa’s director of football operations, recently.It is too easy to blame PSR and SCR for stunting Villa’s growth, though rapid progress has meant they are, in part, victims of their own success. Some at Villa recognised a drop-off was inevitable but few predicted this season. Did Emery expect a dry spell? “We are Aston Villa, with our circumstances,” he said. “We have a lot of positive things in front of us and I’m excited to recover our consistency in the Premier League; this is the first objective. And then it is another competition: theEuropa Leagueis something so, so special for us.”He is, of course, a Europa League specialist, having won it on a record four occasions – three years in a row with Sevilla from 2014 and more recently with Villarreal in 2021 – and it would not be a surprise if Villa dispatch Bologna on Thursday and go deep into the competition or even win it in Istanbul. Monchi, Villa’s president of football operations, has a tattoo of the Europa League trophy on his left wrist to commemorate those wins with Sevilla, and Vidagany said he will follow suit if Villa triumph this season. For now, though, there are other priorities.Explore more on these topicsAston VillaUnai EmeryEuropa LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He will touch the No 24 on his shirt, chosen to commemorate the day Jeremy died, aged 18. And then he will head out to where it all comes to him and it all leaves him too. “I feel nervous every game,” Dolan says, “but when I’m walking though the tunnel it’s like it’s all dropping off me, the shackles fall. All the graft, everything you gave to get here, this is it, now you’re free. You have responsibility, but it’s like the playground again.”Some playground. This is not the Dales Estate, Salford. This time the Santiago Bernabéu awaits. “These are the stadiums any kid dreams of, but it’s not even for me. I’m quite selfless,” Dolan says. “I’ve always got satisfaction from other people’s enjoyment. It’s a moment for everyone around me, friends and family, to be there, to see these places and say: ‘Remember when he was in the park,’ to look back and think: ‘We’ve been through so much, now we’re here.’”‘Mourinho is more than a man – he’s a global brand’: coach returns to Benfica with plenty to proveRead moreThe third of seven siblings, born in Manchester and signed byEspanyolin July, Dolan sits at their training ground in the Barcelona sunshine, talking eloquently about the pathway, the pressure, loss and love, friendship. He thinks about the Manchester City team he joined at seven and left soon after, told he was too small. He thinks about Burnley and City again, whom he rejoined at 13 and where he was cut for a second time. He thinks of Preston, non-League Clitheroe, all the kids who played with him, about Jeremy especially.Now here he is in Spain. He has come a long way the hard way, acutely aware of those he wishes could have got there with him, and grateful to those at his side. “You can’t imagine how tough it is,” Dolan says. “I was lucky, but 99% aren’t. It’s scary; I think what would I have done if I hadn’t [made it] and I genuinely don’t know. You’re labelled as a footballer. When that’s stripped from you, you think: ‘Who am I?’ I remember taking ‘Man City’ out of my Instagram bio. You feel you’ve lost your identity and without that the world is a scary place. I was lucky I have a real supportive family. Some people have no one, constantly battling their own thoughts.”Football doesn’t do enough for those who don’t make it, which is almost all of them. In October 2020, two weeks after his birthday, Wisten was found dead in his bedroom at home, the coroner concluding the teenager had killed himself. Released by City after suffering a knee injury, Wisten struggled to find a club. Dolan was broken, his best friend taken from him. A pall-bearer at the funeral, he wrote and read a poem during the service. An ambassador for the mental health charityGo Again, he takes calls, offers support and perspective.View image in fullscreenTyrhys Dolan says it was a ‘no-brainer’ to sign for Espanyol after he was offered a move.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./Alamy“It shouldn’t take losing someone to see that football needs to take action,” he says. “Jeremy had come to Preston but he didn’t get the scholarship. At the time he got released a lot of his friends, including me, were succeeding. I don’t know the reason and I don’t want to say it’s football, but it must have been so hard for him. You see your friends [playing] and feel: ‘Who am I? Now that I’m not a footballer, what am I?’“Football is a highlights reel. I’m not posting a picture on Instagram not looking my best; I’m posting when I’m fresh. They think, ‘Oh, he’s blessed’, that football solves everything. They don’t know what’s behind it. There are more dark days than light. I try to help young players understand.”Even after he reached Blackburn, a first professional contract signed in 2020 having been three months without a team, there were tears. At times, Dolan admits, you wonder where the joy is. Until you get into the tunnel, and on to the pitch, that is. “After the rain, the sun comes. You wouldn’t appreciate the sun without the rain.” There’s a moment’s quiet. “Sometimes you get survivor’s guilt. My friends were at City. Now they go to every game and they buzz off it. They’re like: ‘We’re living the dream through you, Ty.’ It’s bittersweet because you’ve grafted so hard to get there and you just want everyone with you. Maybe I’m the way I am because I lost Jeremy.“We’re not macho guys and they support me always, they would if I was on the other side of the world. When Espanyol called, they were like: ‘Get your bags packed. We’ll miss you but, click a finger, you need us, we’re there.’ I needed that. There was one thing, though: Jeremy’s cemetery. I go every Sunday. I felt I was leaving him. He would have told me himself: get on the plane and go, this isLa Liga. But I was thinking: ‘Who’s going to take flowers? Who’s going to go?’ My boys were like: ‘We’ll cover that, we’ll clean the headstone, we’ll take flowers.’ It brought me to tears. I’m 23, still young, but I needed to take steps. Espanyol was a no-brainer. I don’t know how many have made that step from the Championship.”View image in fullscreenTyrhys Dolan celebrates acrobatically after scoring for Blackburn against Stoke last year in the Championship.Photograph: Craig Galloway/ProSports/REX/ShutterstockThere’s a smile. “To be truly honest, that first week training, I thought: ‘Pfff, this is …’” Dolan laughs. “I didn’t tell anyone because I didn’t want them to worry, but I was like: ‘Am I up to this?’ Genuinely. The standard was … honestly, it was unbelievable. But I love that. It’s a wake-up call: you wanted this, raise your game.”Introduced as a substitute against Atlético Madrid, Dolan helped Espanyol to a comeback victory on the opening weekend of the season. A starter since, he set up the winner against Osasuna with a flick and provided an assist against Mallorca. Espanyol are third, their best start in 30 years. Fans are calling him Dolandinho or Maradolan. No wonder he’s cracking up.“It’s crazy. I knew what I could do but this quick?” Dolan says. “Against Osasuna I had been nervous in the first half. I couldn’t explain it. At half-time I thought: ‘I could be coming off here,’ but the manager said – well, he had it translated – ‘Just be yourself’. I thought: ‘He’s right.’ I did that little trick, we scored, everyone was buzzing. That’s a liberation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You see it in the nicknames and clips. I was saying to my dad: that feeling when you get the ball and you hear the ‘Dmm-dmm-dmm-dmm-dmm’ of seats flipping up, feel the anticipation. People spend their money and time; it’s only right I give them that. I don’t want to just do a pure bunch of skills and not add anything, but I do want to put on a show. I want them to enjoy watching Espanyol, to know that when Ty gets the ball something can happen. After Osasuna, I was sitting on the balcony with my mum and dad, looking at the videos, talking. And I wished that moment could last for ever. But football is relentless, constantly turning another page.”And so to the Bernabéu, another playground. “I’m the same person I was in the park, the kid my dad made run up hills until I couldn’t breathe,” Dolan says. “I would go home crying and my mum would give me a cuddle. You think of everything you endured, how many miles my dad’s driven, how many tears my mum has wiped off my face. Football is such an emotional game. We’ve had an unbelievable journey. My family and all my friends. The players only got two tickets so my mates have theirs in the Madrid end. It’s all right, they’re not hooligans. This is for them.”Garnacho’s return is a referendum on Amorim – he cannot afford to be embarrassed | David HytnerRead moreIt’s also for Jeremy. “I’d said to my mum: ‘I want my next shirt to be for him’,” Dolan says. “He was born on the ninth [of October] and you’re not going to get the No 9. When we got to Espanyol they said they had 16 and 24 available; 24 is the day he passed away, and my mum’s eyes started filling up. It felt like he was with us. All the numbers you could get, and we got the one we needed.“He’s always here. I feel him with me, like I’m living this for him as well. Would I trade all my career to have Jeremy back? I would. I put everything into it but some things are bigger. Try to enjoy the journey and if I can take it to the heights, that’s Jeremy’s dream and all my friends’ dreams. That’s probably why I work as hard as I do. It is a responsibility because so many people truly want me to do well and there’s that pressure of ‘What if I don’t?’“I’ve come to Spain and I love it. Now let’s see where it will take me. And I’m sure he’s proud, man.

We can do the past. The rest of the world may be more powerful and richer than we are, but only Britain can embody statehood in a banquet. Only Britain can force the titans of the digital age into white tie and tails, and reduce an American president toquivering admiration.The question is where now? Trump’s itinerary mostly avoided central London. He did not go near Downing Street, let alone address parliament. Imagine a state visit to the US that did not include the White House or the Capitol. This week was all soft power and flattery. It probably did more for British tourism than for steel tariffs or pharmaceuticals.Yet as I watched the golden carriage trundle through an empty Windsor park and into a gathering of bear-skinned soldiers, I did wonder what real message was being given out. How could such a country handle a struggling NHS, with its courts and prisons in disarray and its Treasury not knowing where to turn? What of its prime minister, embedded in woes of past and present, but with no vision of the future?It was the past that cost Keir Starmer both Angela Raynerand Lord Mandelson, key figures in two major areas of his policy. Their faults were not monstrous, their atonement sincere and their talents clearly needed by the nation. Yet Starmer lacked the authority of his leadership to tell everyone to shut up and get back to work. Even a senior aide, Paul Ovenden,had to resignover eight-year-old text messages. Politics is becoming a no-go area for anyone with a past.Britain has become crippled by the cabinet being seen not as the nation’s executive but as a cabal. Starmer last week felt he could only restore his authority with a reshuffle. A year into office, almost all the leading ministries of state, including the Home and Foreign Offices, are again run by novices. Were David Lammy and Yvette Cooper really so bad at the foreign and home ministries? For the past five years, departments such as transport and culture have had a new boss every year. Ministerial office appears to be merely an internship.The historical archaism of British government is ingrained. An Attlee, indeed a Disraeli, would recognise the rituals of the modernHouse of Commons. Many prime ministers have tried to end the theatrical punch-up of PMQs, but without success. Debates are ill-attended and pointless. Select committees are lacking in authority. The House of Lords is virtually immune to reform, with hereditary peers and bishops still taking their seats, the former at least for the time being. As for Britain’s head of state, he still has to be anointed by God with oil.Every party comes to power promising to end what is widely agreed is the most over-centralised state in western Europe. Every one ends by increasing it. Last year Starmer did not bother even to wait and consider beforeeffectively abolishingwhat is seemingly local councils’ last area of democratic discretion, over housing and industrial development. His concession to the defence lobby was a reassertion of Britain’s once imperial presence east of Suez. His concession to the Labour left was a return to its ancient war on private landlordism.Over the years, some of Britain’s favourite television documentaries have been on archaeology, whether presented by Mortimer Wheeler or Alice Roberts. We love dredging up past history. Popular, too, is dredging up grim political sagas as public inquiries. There are roughly a dozen running at any one time, costing as much as a West End musical, and offering a running theatre of political failure.Barely a week passes without the spectre of past calamities – from the infected blood scandal to the government’sCovid response– haunting the present. Other countries determine issues of corporate responsibility and get on with the future. Swedeninvestigated Covid in two years. Britain is still doing so, at a cost that is likely to exceed £200m. It can take two years to bring rapists to trial, while thousands of lawyers crowd public inquiries. They are the soap operas of politics.The reason Britain’s public services are in such disarray cannot be separated from the recent instability of British politics, traditionally indicated by a surge in third-party support. Critical areas of reform simply went by the board. The health service defies reorganisation, as does the legal profession. The regulation of social media andartificial intelligenceare clearly beyond the competence of parliament. The assisted dying bill requires the utmost care and attention, not the present shambolic back and forth between Commons and Lords.

But we must do much more to achieve safety and stabilityJacinda Ardern is a former prime minister of New ZealandFri 19 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 19 Sep 2025 21.31 EDTShareIt was usually when my daughter hadn’t slept that the conversation started. I’d message my friend wondering aloud whether I would get through the day without making some glaring mistake. I was the prime minister of New Zealand. Only the second woman in the world to have a baby while leading a country, and some days were hard.Yet there was one response, a simple text message from my friend, also deep in the trenches of caregiving, that would stop me in my tracks: “Women give birth during war.”I knew what her intent was. Five simple words meant to remind me that every single day, women defy the odds – surviving horrifically difficult things, all while being mothers and caregivers. If they could persist, so could I. But that wasn’t the effect these words had. Instead, I thought endlessly of the women giving birth through the perils of war.We live in a world plagued by humanitarian crises. Famine. Civil conflict. The facts on the ground are often relayed crudely. The tons of food delivered or not. Aid funding announced or taken away. Territory gained or lost. Bombs dropped; casualties sustained.None of that tells us a simple truth. For all of the dehumanisation of these grave humanitarian crises, life, in the most extreme conditions, continues. Children still need to be fed. People still mourn the loss of loved ones, while trying to find a safe place to sleep. Health conditions need treatment. Women still give birth – and many of them don’t survive.Globally, loss of maternal life resulting from childbirthis most commonly caused by postpartum haemorrhaging(PPH). The World Health Organization estimates 14 million women a year areaffected, but death is largely preventable. In fact, in high-income countries, deaths from PPH have nearly been eliminated. But globally, 70,000 women are still dying every year. That’s one PPH death every 7.5 minutes. More than half of these deaths are in the 25 countries with current appeals for humanitarian aid.These are women in South Sudan who have experienced civil unrest for decades, and now reside in one of the most dangerous places to become a mother. The maternal mortality rate is more than1,200 per 100,000 live births.These are thousands of newborns in Burkina Faso, where hundreds of health facilities haveclosedas the security situation deteriorates, who will grow up without mothers, and all of the social and economic scarring that brings.There’s no question these environments are difficult to operate in. And that’s one of the reasons for the lack of progress in ending these preventable deaths. But they remain just that – preventable.Researchers from the World Health Organization and the University of Birmingham recentlypublisheda study that suggested a new solution, known as E-MOTIVE, could reduce deaths from PPH.The study, which involved more than 200,000 women in four countries, found that measuring blood loss using a simple, low-cost collection device called a “drape” and bundling together evidence-proven treatments – rather than offering them sequentially – resulted in dramatic improvements for women.These solutions are low-cost and can be delivered more widely. But the focus has been on providing them in stable settings, rather than areas of conflict and crisis where they are urgently needed.That is why the International Rescue Committee is launching a new global partnership titledSafer Births in Crises. This consortium brings together those experienced in the field, such as theInternational Medical Corps, theUN population fundandJhpiegoto deliver these lifesaving solutions for preventing, and treating, PPH to the world’s most vulnerable women.While Safer Birth in Crises will begin in countries such as South Sudan and Burkina Faso, it will also explore how to adapt these solutions for countries such as Papua New Guinea, which are increasingly prone to extreme weather events within the Pacific region. And with future resources, the consortium hopes to expand access to lifesaving interventions for both mothers and babies in additional crisis-affected settings, such as those in the Middle East.The Matariki Fund for Women isjoining this initiativeto fill a critical funding gap, and to save thousands of women losing their lives each year in child birth, by providing $4m to the consortium.But no one should pretend this is enough. Even a child born safely in these conditions is still being born into crisis.In the coming weeks leaders willgather for the UN general assembly. And as they do, we must continue to call on those with power to respond to these humanitarian crises, ranging from the conflict in Ukraine to natural disasters caused by the climate crisis. We should start with Gaza. There is a path to stopping the genocide still happening daily before us: more countries must recognise Palestinian statehood; any cooperation that facilitates military action must end; humanitarian aid needs to urgently reach the trapped and starving; and medical care must be available for the injured, the malnourished, and for the expectant and new mothers.We may live in a world plagued by humanitarian crises, but we must resist the dehumanisation of numbers. Because yes, women give birth during war, and they die. But they shouldn’t. Not in the midst of birth, nor in the crossfire of conflict. Sometimes politics and leadership should be as simple as that.Jacinda Ardern is a former prime minister of New ZealandDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He was right. I was moved through six ministerial briefs in four years. I knew nothing about Africa when I was made the Africa minister. I had only just completed my Africa strategy, and introduced myself to the key African leaders, when I was made the prisons minister nine months later, still knowing very little about Africa and nothing at all about prisons. Little wonder that civil servants were reluctant to throw themselves behind my radical rethinks of my predecessor’s approach – not least because they sensed that I would soon be gone and my strategy with me.Starmer has now donehis own reshuffle, and it is if anything worse than what the Tories did. Cameron left William Hague as foreign secretary for four years. Starmer has taken David Lammy, just as he has built his relationship with world leaders, and replaced him with someone, Yvette Cooper, who has never held a foreign policy brief in government. The ministers who have painfully mastered the complexities of AI or the welfare system have all moved hardly more than a year into their jobs.And the loss of knowledge is not compensated for with fresh talent. Cameron sent seven cabinet ministers in 2014 to the backbenches, replacing them with entirely new faces. Starmer has changed 10 of his secretaries of state. But he has only sent one to the backbenches. The others have simply been moved from one ministerial job to another. He has done the same to 20 of his junior ministers. His holding on to the same team in new posts without sacking the bad and introducing the new suggests a poker player too afraid to raise or fold. And he will just make his problems worse if he tries to tinker yet again.But the fundamental problem he faces is not the individuals. It is the way in which every aspect of our political settlement – parties, whips and electoral systems – creates all the wrong incentives and behaviours.The best hope for better government is not another reshuffle but a constitutional revolution. We should build on the success of the newish mayors in Manchester and Birmingham, giving them far more freedom to tax and spend and forge their own industrial policies. (Here we can learn from both France and Germany.) A New Zealand-style electoral system – balancing proportional representation and constituencies – could break the old parties and encourage coalitions around the centre. An Australian model of compulsory voting would force politics to pay attention to the marginalised and try to persuade the undecided centre, rather than indulge the extremes. And we should make far greater use of citizens’ assemblies – which,as Ireland has shown, can achieve remarkable radical progress that parties often cannot achieve – and which would have a democratic legitimacy that we are losing from our parliaments.Do AI the right way and Labour could reap the rewardsMariana MazzucatoProfessor in the economics of innovation and public value at University College London, where she is founding director of the UCLInstitute for Innovation & Public PurposeThe government has spent much of its first year in office trying to attract private investment into the British economy. This has meant changing planning regulations, “cutting red tape” and, most recently, opening the door wide to AI companies. But the point must not be to accept any kind of investment. We should be prioritising the type of growth Britain needs: innovation-driven, inclusive and sustainable.The global investment summit last autumn, for instance, mostly attracted controversial financial companiessuch as BlackRockand Macquarie; the latter is best known in Britain forloading Thames Water with debtduring its much-criticised ownership of the company. Getting AI investment right in this context is crucial, but there are worrying trends.This week’s US-UK tech prosperity deal is an example of tech investment being structured poorly. US tech firms have pledged to invest £31bn in the UK, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Nvidia and Google, while the governmentrefuses to rule outscrapping the digital services tax. It will lead to the outsourcing of more AI capacity across public institutions and the wider economy to US tech firms. With Labour promising to “mainline AI into the veins” of the country, we must ask: are we building AI capacity for Britain or Silicon Valley?Labour should demand clear conditionsalongside state investments – this is what the Biden administration did with the Chips Act that requiredsemiconductor companies to limit share buy-backs and improve working conditions. In the UK,which remains 28thin the OECD for business investment, and where companies are often overly financialised and prioritise rapid dividendsfor shareholders, we should require that AI companies benefiting from government programmes make real investments in the country that are good for our economy. That kind of confidence was shown during Covid when the taxpayer-funded Oxford University/AstraZeneca collaboration ended up shaping public goals: knowledge-sharing and keeping costs and prices in check.This isn’t about choosing between innovation and regulation. Governing AI for the common good means steering markets, not just opening them up for “business-friendly” contracts. Labour’s upcoming partyconference presents an opportunity to reset this approach. Rather than “cut the red tape” fetishism, Labour needs AI governance that generates British capabilities and public value. TheTUC arguesthat workers must have a role in shaping AI. AsI’ve written recently, Britain should explore public funding models akin to the BBC licence fee – collectively supporting AI systems serving public purposes rather than commercial imperatives.For a government struggling to bring the public with it, promising growth through unfettered AI adoption risks repeating the mistakes that fuelled populist backlash against globalisation. When citizens see deals with tech companies while local jobs fail to materialise at resource-heavy datacentres, the political costs are inevitable. Smart AI governance – with workers’ voices, public ownership stakes and visible benefits for communities – offers a positive radical and Labour vision. By showing the state can actively shape technology for public benefit rather than simply accommodate Silicon Valley’s agenda, Labour can rebuild trust that the government works for ordinary people.Gaza is the stainShaista AzizJournalist and crisis response campaigner working on GazaI resigned as a Labour councillor from Oxford city council in October 2023, days after Keir Starmer, then the leader of the opposition, agreed during a live radio interview that Israel was justified in cutting off water, gas and electricity in Gaza, after Hamas’s deadly attacks. Two years later, his government stands credibly accused of being complicit in genocide. The domestic politics of this are less important than the immense suffering that the people of Gaza have gone through, but it seems clear that this government’s inaction over Palestine has damaged its credibility in the eyes of many voters.If there is to be any way back,the government must fully reset the UK’s relationship with Israel and acknowledge it for the destabilising force in the region it is. After all, Israel is accused of killing more than 60,000 Palestinians in Gaza, with thousands more missing and buried under the rubble. It has reduced Gaza to a wasteland and has launched attacks on Lebanon, Yemen, Iran, Qatar and Tunisia. It is a flagrant violator of international law and should not be considered an ally of the UK in the way it has been up to this point.Starmer could take a leaf from European countries such as Spain, whose prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, recently announced that he would formalise his country’s arms embargo on Israel, ban the use of Spanish ports and airspace to transport fuel or weapons to the Israeli military, and comprehensivelyban imports made in illegal Israeli settlements. This is the absolute bare minimum and should have been done some time ago.Stop being afraid of debateAlan FinlaysonProfessor of political and social theory at the University of East Anglia and expert in political rhetoricGreat political rhetoric doesn’t sell a policy position. It shares with us a vocabulary, a way of thinking and speaking about our situation, so that we can join with the rhetorician in making decisions. Then, we don’t buy what a politician offers; we agree with it because we thought it ourselves.Labour is poor at doing this. The prime minister “umms” through interviews. Ministers focus on policy process rather than making arguments for a future we might all live in, defending their expertise and skills in the language of HR. Welfare reform wasn’t argued for but insisted upon as an inevitability, as if people could be forced into supporting a policy without a clear picture of how they might live in the world it would create.Reform UK has benefitedby taking the critical counter-position: smash the orthodoxy, humiliate the HR managers and give free rein to the few allowed to stay on the island. Greens are developinga lively languageconnecting environmental security with larger arguments about future housing, jobs and security.Your Partywill probably employ a strident anti-war moral vocabulary appealing to those sick of a politics of “pragmatic” positioning.These are parts of a tortured, fractious (and overly dramatic) argument that the country is having with itself, and to which this Labour government has contributed no key term, concept or description.What Labour needs is an ideology: an overarching argument connecting policy areas to an analysis of what’s wrong with British politics, economy and culture, as well as the principles that define its response and a picture of a future we can see ourselves living in well. Ministers arguing for policy, instead of just insisting that they are hard-working and serious, could then show the bigger picture of which they are a part.MPs could seek opportunities to share arguments with key affected sectors: local teachers, chambers of commerce, NHS staff. People won’t all agree but will respect being treated like rational citizens and potential participants in rebuilding society. Of course, this also needs to happen online, since that is the primary arena for ideological contestation today (as a few in Labour arebeginning to understand). Imagine two or three Labour MPs with different takes, arguing things out at length on YouTube (without fear of expulsion). That would model good political behaviour, invite audiences to think for themselves and communicate an image of life beyond desiccated managerialism.Only a minority are deeply attached to Reform’s politics, but they are confident in making arguments for it to friends, family and colleagues. That is why it is winning. Labour’s instinct is to keep members and supporters at a distance rather than supporting them in becoming active representatives of party-thinking online, offline, in work and with friends.As long as Labour prefers the language of force, law and managerial necessity, it will lose – and what’s more, it will deserve to. The rest of us will have to find our own ways to push back against what’s coming.This article was amended on 19 September 2025.

Yes, he ranted about the enemy of the people, insulted journalists and taught his followers to hate the press. But the guardrails mostly held and the spines of media owners stayed fairly stiff.This time, his project to keep the media on a tight leash – and therefore control the message – is going much better. At least from the point of view of a would-be authoritarian.That was made clear this week when the broadcast network ABC abruptlypulledJimmy Kimmel’s late-night show off the air. That move followed Kimmel’s Monday nightmonologuein which he talked about thedeath of Charlie Kirk, the far-right activist.Kimmel’s on-air commentscriticized Trump, but he also went out of his way to condemn Kirk’s murder and he slammed both ends of thepolitical spectrumfor their “extraordinarily vile” responses.Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert … who is the next to be silenced? | Moira DoneganRead more“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the Maga gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said.The next thing you knew, the Trump-appointed FCC chair,Brendan Carr, was making a guest appearance on a rightwing podcast, apparently threatening to pull federal licenses. Objecting to Kimmel’s suggestion – made before more evidence came to light – that the shooter was part of the Maga movement, he urged broadcast affiliates to“push back” on Disney– or else.“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” said Carr, sounding a lot like a Bond villain. “These companies can find ways to change conduct … or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”No need to say more, apparently. Nexstar, the nation’s largest owner of local TV stations, quickly decided to remove Kimmel’s show from their offerings, and soon Disney brass were pulling Kimmel off the air, at least for the time being.Kimmel’s sudden defenestration may be a political success for Trump but it’s a dire sign for free speech in America.The move “marks a dark new level of capitulation and censorship of speech more redolent of autocracies than democracies”, according to PEN America, the free-expression advocacy organization.The Trump administration’s bullying appalls first amendment champions. Just as bad is the way so much of big media has rolled over like a docile lapdog, eager to obey in advance.The administration “is becoming increasingly brazen in its abuse of government power to silence its critics”, said Jameel Jaffer, who heads the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, adding that “too many of the powerful institutions that could stand up to this thuggery are capitulating instead”.Each instance of bullying emboldens Trump and his allies, and each instance of capitulation lays the groundwork for more cowardice.Just a few months ago, it seemed shocking when ABC Newssettleda suit brought by Trump over on-air remarks made by star anchor George Stephanopoulos. Most first amendment experts believed that the network could have successfully defended the case, but instead ABC buckled, even including an apology with the financial settlement.Not long afterwards, an evenmoredefensible suit against CBS News over the routine editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris went a similar route.Parent company Paramount Globalsettledthe case. Soon after Stephen Colbertcriticizedthat settlement, calling it a bribe, his CBS late-night show wascancelled.The media has been cozying up to Trump in earnest since last fall, often with the owners’ commercial interests all too obvious. Paramount Global, for example, was eager for federal approval of a huge merger with another media giant.Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension is an alarming new low for the ongoing culture wars | Jesse HassengerRead moreThe Washington Post, at the behest of its owner, Jeff Bezos,killed its editorial endorsingHarris just before the presidential election, and since then, has taken a sharp right turn in itsopinion coverage. And the Los Angeles Times, under its billionaire owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong, has madesimilarTrump-friendlymoveson the paper’s opinion pages.Elated and on a roll, Trump recentlyfiled suitagainstthe New York Times, the hometown institution with which for decades he has had a love-hate relationship.The Times has vowed to defend the case, which is laughably weak despite the whopping $15bn price tag for supposed damage done to candidate Trump before the 2024 election.“This lawsuit has no merit,” the Times responded. “It lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting.” The Times publisher, quite accurately, called it frivolous.Such a stalwart response is heartening but all too rare. Instead, too many media companies are bending the knee – and then cowering as Trump grows ever bolder.What good is the first amendment when so many in power don’t seem to know it exists?Explore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionTrump administrationJimmy KimmelcommentShareReuse this content"

He’s yet another casualty of corporate kowtowingFri 19 Sep 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 19 Sep 2025 10.22 EDTShareWhen the history of this era is written, there will be much to say about the behavior of large corporations. And none of it will be good.As the Trump administration has ramped up its assault on American democracy, many corporationshave chosen to look the other way or to curry favor with the president. They have fired employees who were too outspoken in their criticism of Donald Trump–ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night talkshow, after Kimmel’s remarks about Maga’s reaction to the killing of Charlie Kirk, is the latest example.Or corporations have muted their brand’s identification with progressive causes.One casualtyis Jerry Greenfield, co-founder and namesake of Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream. This week, he resigned from the company.He did so because, hesaid in a statement, the politically outspoken company had been “silenced”.The consumer goods company UnileveracquiredBen & Jerry’s in 2000, for a reported $326m. At the time, it agreed to respect the company’s independence.Ben & Jerry’s co-founder quits, accusing Unilever of silencing social missionRead moreNo more, according to Greenfield.“Standing up for the values of justice, equity, and our shared humanity has never been more important,” Greenfield noted in explaining his resignation. But, he said: “Ben & Jerry’s has been silenced, sidelined for fear of upsetting those in power.”Ben & Jerry’s crossed swords with Unilever last year when itsuedthe company for allegedly fighting its calls for a Gaza ceasefire and an end to US military support for Israel.The 2024 suit claimed that Unilever had threatened to dismantle the ice-cream company’s independent board and punish members if Ben & Jerry’s issued a call for a ceasefire. (Unilever said it rejected “the claims made by B&J’s social mission board”. Its motion to dismiss the lawsuit is pending.)Another flare-up occurred in March of this year, when, according to Ben & Jerry’s, Unilever fired its chief executive, David Stever,over his workto advance the company’s “social mission”.If those allegations are true, Unilever would not be alone in trying to avoid offending theTrump administrationor its supporters. This is just the latest sign that the era of corporate social and political responsibility is over.Ice-cream lovers will now have to choose between their taste buds and their consciences.Corporate social responsibility (CSR) requires that business leaders recognize, as Harvard Business Schoolexplains, that they “have a responsibility to do more than simply maximize profits for shareholders and executives. Rather, they have a social responsibility to do what’s best – not just for their companies, but for people, the planet, and society at large.”The CSR movement reallytook off about 40 to 50 years agowhen businesses realized that they could carve out a niche and attract investment from people who wanted to make money and stay true to their values. Ben & Jerry’swas foundedin 1978 during the heyday of CSR, by Greenfield and Ben Cohen.Itwas upfrontabout the issues it cared about and the values it sought to promote. The list was long, but it included racial justice, refugee rights, climate, LGBTQ+ rights and democracy.The Association of Corporate-Citizenship Professionalstracesthe roots of CSR back to the 18th century. At that time, religious groups would not invest, and would urge their members not to invest, in businesses that did not advance their values. Those included the slave trade and businesses that supplied the instruments of war.Fast forward to the start of the 20th century, when in 1928, the Pioneer Fundbecame one of the first mutual fundsto promote socially responsible investing, which meant avoiding companies producing alcohol or tobacco, or promoting gambling. Almost a century later, theBusiness Roundtable includedin its statement on the purpose of a corporation the following: “We commit to … supporting the communities in which we work. We respect the people in our communities and protect the environment by embracing sustainable practices across our businesses.”Some progressiveshave criticizedCSR, describing it as a charade and a public relations tactic that left the profit motive intact and did not require substantial changes in the way companies did business. But Ben & Jerry’s did more than brand itself as interested in social justice and political equality.As its 2024 lawsuit made clear, Ben & Jerry’s has wanted to take political stands even if it meant that it would lose some customers. A year earlier, in March 2023, as Newsweekreports, Cohen “shocked many” by speaking out against the US providing military aid to Ukraine.” (An ally said he opposed Russia’s invasion butwanted a diplomatic solution.)While from time to time, the companyhas been accusedof not living up to its values, not surprisingly, conservatives have targeted Ben & Jerry’s for being “woke”. Some havetried to organizea boycott to protest what they see as its radical left politics.That’s perhaps why Unilever apparently wanted to pull back Ben & Jerry’s activism.What we are witnessing now in the way of corporate acquiescence to the rise of authoritarianism is a familiar story. There are plenty of examples.Take Viktor Orbán’s Hungary. There, as the political economist Gábor Scheiringargues: “Since 2010 Orbán has been using the momentum created by popular anger at the failures of liberal policies to build up his own system: authoritarian capitalism.

But these two combatants, Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell, may ignite exactly the rethinking Labour needs. Like it or not, whoever the contestants were, this would be framed as establishment v insurgent, or asproxiesfor Keir Starmer and Andy Burnham. It’s for Phillipson and Powell to strike out and show they are their own people. In truth, Phillipson is not very establishment and Powell not very insurgent.Any party would be in a state of ferment after falling further than any previous government in its it first 14 months, with inflation stubbornly high and growth flatlining. It reels from the shock ofscoring 20%in opinion polls while Nigel Farage’s Reform UK rides high on 31%.Large numbers ofLabourMPs on thin majorities are projected to lose their seats at the next general election. But beyond narrow self-interest, they can all see the historically terrifying price of failure this time. The possibility of handing power to a demagogue Trumpite xenophobic authoritarian would make a Labour failure not just a blow against social democracy (again), but an emergency for the country, its European defence and trade alliance, and even its democracy and the rule of law.What needs to emerge from their debate is what is missing from the government so far, a sense of direction, what and whom they are for, where they want to go and why. No red thread pulls together a list of things they have done, unacknowledged for lack of language and sense of purpose. Rail and steelnationalisation,buses back to council controlin England, huge investment ingreen energy, renters’ rights,workers’ rights(undiluted), falling hospitalwaiting lists– none of this is linked into coherent self-definition.Some things, quite expensive and good, slip below the radar: everyone knows about the winter fuel allowance cut, but who knows that an extra 2.7 million people, 6.1 million in all, can get a£150 energy discountthis winter? A mumbling government is unsure if it wants to be cast as leftist or even leftish, despite losing many more voters to Greens and Liberal Democrats than to Farage.As education secretary, Phillipson can boast of the most already done so far. Her determination to stick toearly years as a prioritywas hard fought as the most effective engine of opportunity: others wanted that considerable budget to be spent on more politically visible education for older cohorts. But her near-universal free nurseries from nine months old started this month, plus a Sure Start revival now called Best Start, with300 nurserieswithin primary schools and more to come, planting education – not mere childcare – as the purpose of her early-years spending. Free breakfasts for all primary schoolchildren in England,free school lunchesextended to many more, begin the prevention of hungry children. Despite the hullabaloo, removing VAT exemption from private schools is highly popular and the money goes tostate school teachersin England, further education renewal and now a big push on apprenticeships, on the rise at last.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Is there anything Starmer can do to turn things around? Our panel responds – part oneRead moreBut too little of any of this has landed with the public due to bad errors on benefits, mistakes that sprang from uncertainty about their message, never mind missions that never resonated. This contest is likely to raise the difficult issues. The failure to address child poverty head-on has been the gaping void for Labour people. The 2024 partymanifesto said: “Labour will develop an ambitious strategy to reduce child poverty.” I expect both Powell and Phillipson to come out for abolishing the two-child benefit cap that damages 1.6 million children. If so, Rachel Reeves would be obliged to do it in her budget.Powell will draw many of the disaffected now she has become an involuntary outsider. Wisely, she is unlikely to stray far from the fold of existing policies she voted for: throwing bricks at the government is not a winner with Labour members, only with those who long ago departed. Attempts to draw her on a wealth tax by Nick Robinson on Political Thinking drew a sensible answer that she wasn’t about to write the budget. But both will reject the current Starmerite notion that “delivery” will overcome present misfortunes: it did nothing to save Joe Biden, who delivered a lot. The one who tells the missing story of what Labour is for – and why – in the most lyrical and persuasive language deserves to win.But their greatest duty, above all, is to take the fight to Farage and show Labour how to hit back hard, taking no prisoners. Be unafraid to call out racism: the timid and delayed response to the terrifying march of 100,000 people at Tommy Robinson’s beckoning is indeed a klaxon. No need to worry that some who are seduced into this poison don’t see themselves as far right or racist – history shows us that “ordinary people”, even “ordinary majorities”, can be drawn into the politics of hate by malign demagoguery exploiting immigration as a proxy for all grievance. Both candidates need to show how best to challenge this lethal toxin, which is more pressing than any slight difference between them.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionBridget PhillipsonLucy PowellReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

Apparently we only have the right to roam across 8% of England at the moment, a situation that strikes me as so perfectly us that it should be submitted to the Unesco intangible cultural heritage list immediately if not sooner.But anything to do with land rights and rules in this sceptic isle always throws up a delight or two – usually around the vision always conjured of furious, red-faced owners shouting impotently at paddling peasants (or, should your mood or Norman ancestry prefer, shooting at them non-impotently with the family’s Holland & Holland). Born and raised in Catford, I was 30 before I realised that people owned the countryside – that fields could be rented like flats and vegetation could have a landlord. The idea that you can own a tree still blows my mind.Obviously, as a pleb, I fully support the push to give us access to the wonders of the remaining 92% of the place that is still forbidden to us. Not least because as a kind of reverse Dick Whittington I sort of think there must be gold lining the hedgerows and things. All I would ask is that when the rights to wild camping and swimming are bestowed, they are accompanied by stringent legislation against people talking about it. Enjoy your activities by all means. But do not make it 92% of your personality and conversation. You know what I mean, and you know who you are. Think on.TuesdayThe Tenth at the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park has opened a luxury postpartum retreat for new mothers. You can check in for up to a month to get 24/7 access to therapy sessions, massages, lactation guidance, reflexology and more (the more includes yoni steaming, as if you’re letting anything near there ever again. I presume it’s offered as a joke in order to test how your pelvic floor is recovering when you laugh). It’s almost enough to make me want another baby. Or it would be if I just had the £1,795 a night minimum it costs.You used to get a week in normal hospital after a normal birth, you know. Yes, even the most plebeian (it’s turning out to be a useful word this week) vagina and womb – the latter recovering, lest we forget, from a wound the size of a dinner plate left by the placenta bidding adieu – were considered worthy of recuperation. I wonder what that was like. For at least 1,795 reasons, I will never know.View image in fullscreen‘So, if we just move slowly backwards, blend in with the forest, we can make a run for it.

I explained. Songs. A finite number. Until it self-destructed in a “cassette player”. Sober burial or, if a “mix tape” from a beloved, entry into a keepsake box for your mother to throw out when you went to university. Or to the shops if she was in a particularly manic menopausal decluttering mood.Joke’s on him though, because they are poised to make a comeback. This time incorporating tape developed by Chinese researchers that uses DNA to hold data. A 100-metre strip could store 36 petabytes, which is up to 7bn songs in old money. No word yet on whether your old sound system will play it or a pencil through the spoolie bits will straighten out the chewed bits, but I have a feeling our time is coming again. The old ways shall be restored and those with mastery of them shall be revered as gods instead of pitied and subjected to another paean of overly detailed praise of Silksong. Oh yes.ThursdayMy favourite genetic and de-extinction research company Colossal Biosciences (motto: Never Knowingly Undernamed) is back in the news. In March it announced the creation of a woolly mouse that reopened the way to the woolly mammoth. In April it reckoned it was about to bring back dire wolves. And now?Now it’s dodos.

That is the alarmingwarning from Martin Jones, HM chief inspector of probation. He estimates that 100,000 offenders on probation are currently not being properly managed. This overstretched service cannot be expected to manage the increased workload that will  follow from sentencing reforms. The deliberate stoking of publicanxieties about crimeby far-right activists and Reform UK is all the more reason to pay attention.Supervising more offenders in the community is a good idea in principle. Prisons are overcrowded and short sentences are ineffective, with a high reoffending rate. When too many people are locked up for 12 months or less, and jails are too full, the continual churn and poor conditions make it difficult for prison officers to do their job. The cost-saving potential of technology in public services is often overstated. But the increased use of electronic tags is a plausible means of improving the criminal justice system overall.Fewer short sentences and more tagging were among the recommendations of David Gauke’s sentencing review. Labour’s implementation of his proposalsshould be welcomed. But Mr Jones is right that such a shift is not risk-free. He has suspended ordinary probation inspections for six months in order tosurvey the overall situation.Ministers know that the Probation Service requires building up, if the work of supervising offenders is to be shifted on to it and away from prisons. Investment of up to £700m between now and 2028-29 has been promised. The danger is that the risk to public safety increases – as a result of more offenders being released early, or tagged instead of imprisoned – before the capacity of the probation service to manage them.Past failures mean that concerns are well founded. Two years ago an inquest found that“omissions” by probation officerscontributed to a situation in which Damien Bendall was able to kill his pregnant partner and three children. A similar finding followed themurder of Zara Aleena. In both cases, probation officers’ lack of experience was a factor.The Metropolitan police chief, Sir Mark Rowley, said in May that someincrease in crimeshould be expected when more offenders are released. He raised concerns about the need for new resources jointly with the heads of MI5 and the National Crime Agency. Such risks must not be overstated. Sentencing reform takes courage, and ministers should stand by their pledge to tackle prison overcrowding. But it is better to recognise a public safety issue now than ignore it and hope for the best.Probation has rarely been treated with the seriousness it deserves. The Tories’ attempt to privatise it was adisaster. There have been 11 justice secretaries in a decade. Some experts think probation and prisons should never have been merged into one organisation, and that probation needs stronger links to councils and housing providers.This is challenging work, the dangers of which were underlined last month when aprobation officer in Prestonwas stabbed. It needs investment, but also human capital in the form of experienced staff who can build relationships with offenders and younger recruits. Mr Jones’s cry for help on behalf of the service must be heard.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Amid the celebrations, the founders ofDrama MOBin Manchester, where Cooper attended weekly classes for two years, rightlypointed outthe crucial part this training played in landing him the role, an impact the young actor acknowledged in hisacceptance speech.In pushing back against the“done nothing and came from nowhere”narrative, they paid tribute to all the teachers working in unglamorous community halls up and down the country to make such stories a reality. Billy Elliot, after all, only learned to pirouette thanks to his chain-smoking ballet teacher, Mrs Wilkinson, played by Julie Walters in the film. Walters started out at Liverpool’s Everyman theatre, whose youth programme also counts the Adolescence co-writer and starStephen Grahamamong its alumni. As Walters hassaid, the prospects for young working-class actors are much starker today.Drama schools across the UK are incrisis. For the first time since it opened in 1946,Bristol Old Vic theatre schoolwill not be welcoming undergraduate students this term. The Rose Bruford College in Sidcup, which celebrates its 75th anniversary this year, hasreportedfinancial difficulties. The college gave a chance toGary Oldman, who returns next week in the hit seriesSlow Horses. He went from working in an abattoir (among various odd jobs) to winning an Oscar for his performance as Winston Churchill. Other leading drama schools have closed completely. According toCampaign for the Arts, the number of students taking drama at GSCE and A-level has plummeted since 2010.New researchshows that the grip of private education on the most influential jobs is stronger than ever. This will be no surprise to the TV and film industries:almost half of all British stars nominated for major awardsin the last decade were privately educated. Yet there has been no shortage of working-class dramas in the last few years, with awarding-winning shows such asMr Bates vs the Post Office, andI May Destroy You, written by and starringMichaela Coel, who grew up in Tower Hamlets, east London, and won a bursary award to Guildhall School of Music and Drama.The triumph of Adolescence, coming a day after last Saturday’s “unite the kingdom” rally, is a powerful reminder of art’s duty to reflect the whole of society, to tell everyone’s stories, in authentic voices. For all the talk of “raw talent”, few stars arrive fully formed. If we lose our world-class drama schools, we will lose our place on the world’s stages and screens. The government haspromisedto redress the decimation of arts education under the Tories. Projects such as theNational Theatre’s schools programme, which aims to reach every child in Britain, as well as community ventures like Drama MOB, deserve recognition. But more must be done to support young actors from all backgrounds, especially outside London. As Idris Elba memorably put it:“Talent is everywhere, opportunity isn’t.”We owe it to the next Coel or Cooper to make sure that talent is discovered and nurtured.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Comments from the Royal Society and Universities UK show that, 21 years after it was launched, they still fail to understand what the boycott targets. A Royal Societystatementtalks of “blanket boycotts of scientists or other academics”, and the risk of “denying scientists or other academics their rights to freedom of opinion and expression … and of inhibiting the free circulation of scientists and scientific ideas”. Universities UK, the article says, “do not endorse blanket academic boycotts” as this represents “an infringement of academic freedom”.Clearly, these comments are about the specific academic boycott ofIsrael. But that boycott unambiguously targets Israel’s higher education institutions, not the academics who work there.Israeli universities are deeply complicit in the regime of apartheid, denial of rights, repression and now genocide carried out by Israel. Boycotting them institutionally in no way interferes with collaboration between individual Israeli academics and their colleagues in other countries. What is targeted is any involvement of Israeli universities in that process – no funding streams, no publication in journals based there, no academic references for appointments and internal promotions, no international conferences held there. The impact is on the institutions, not the flow of ideas.Jonathan RosenheadLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I supervised Dan Milner’s PhD thesis on Irish American folk song. Taking on a student in his 70s who was struggling to write felt like a chore. But then Dan stepped into my office and sang one of the songs he was writing about. We found a way to combine his lifetime’s knowledge of folk song with my sense of how to structure a thesis, and he graduated and published his research.Dan Milner sings Away Rio.He lived in New York and visited Birmingham for supervision, to see friends and family, and to sing at the Lamp Tavern. Joining him there (but, unlike everyone else in the room, not joining in, as I cannot sing) was one of the pleasures of my life. He sang Away Rio like no one else on earth. I stayed with him and his wife, Bonnie, in New York, and we drove long distances to meet up when I was on the east coast.Then Covid came, and we did not see each other for years, though I watched a livestream of him singing at a socially distanced event in Connecticut. Then one morning, an email from Bonnie telling me he had passed away. I had no one to tell or talk to. I could not attend the funeral and don’t know anyone who knew him well. There has been no way to share that grief or remember that friendship. I wonder if, as our worlds change, our habits and vocabularies for ordinary life lag, and need to adapt.John FaggBirminghamJustin Myers’ article about the agonising loss of his best friend resonated with me very deeply. I also lost my best friend, Anne, two years ago and cannot even now articulate the profound feelings of loss and pain that I struggle with almost daily. I cannot imagine the pain that Anne’s family have had to endure and they are suffering more than I am. But I feel that the level of grief I am experiencing somehow isn’t valid. Anne’s family understand my loss, but most people don’t.Anne and I called ourselves “soul sisters”, but were not related. So generally it is assumed that I am well and truly recovered. The truth is that I will never recover from losing such a wonderful, kind, cheeky and caring best friend. She was absolutely brilliant and my heart is broken without her.Sarah MackayNiton, Isle of WightThank you to Justin Myers for sharing his story. I lost my best friend to suicide a few years ago, and it devastated me. I rarely spoke about it, but if I did summon the courage to mention it, people’s questions would inevitably be: how long did you know her? How often did you see her? It felt as though I had to justify why I was so bereft.Mainly because of this, I have carried the weight mostly in silence. I don’t talk to my partner or my family about it even though I think about it all the time. I assumed that it was the manner of her death that made it so painful, but reading his article helped me see a different angle: that losing a long-term friend does leave an enormous hole in your life that can’t be filled by another; not everyone has been blessed with those deep, sustaining friendships and so they can’t always identify with the grief when one is lost.Name and address suppliedJustin Myers, I feel for you. My husband of 34 years died five years ago. Everyone around me understood my grief, including my best friend of 40 years, with whom I had enjoyed cultural city breaks a dozen times (while my husband preferred demanding wildlife trips).Two years later, she died. I spoke at her funeral. With very few exceptions, no one I knew could comprehend the level of loss I felt, and still feel. I wish we had a mutual friend to keep her memory alive. I am only glad no one has ever quoted the seven stages of grief to me – they do not relate in any way to either of my bereavements.Name and address suppliedIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted onfreephone116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

There’s no accounting for tasteReaders respond to Jonathan Jones’s view that the chain of galleries is losing its identity as more dynamic rivals flourishFri 19 Sep 2025 12.15 EDTLast modified on Fri 19 Sep 2025 12.49 EDTShareThe analysis by Jonathan Jones of what’s gone wrong at Tate was spot-on (Shrinking audiences, a cash crisis and rivals on the rise: what’s gone wrong at Tate?, 12 September). All the truly memorable exhibitions we have seen this year were in the National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, the Wallace Collection and the Royal Academy. Frankly, the Tates have not had a single show that excited us since Peter Doig (2008), Lynette Yiadom‑Boakye (2020), Frida Kahlo (2005), and Richard Deacon and El Anatsui in 2016.The universally loved, wondrous art of painting is eschewed in favour of performance nonsense, boring videos and hideous installations.Ann EastmanLondonI felt very disheartened by Jonathan Jones’ comments about Tate Liverpool’s temporary home. His description of it “feeling like a deserted hulk complete with grumpy caretaker” couldn’t be more different from my regular recent experiences of visiting it to see exhibitions or to attend the kids’ activity area (temporarily housed in RIBA North, Mann Island).The exhibitions have been excellent, includingBrickworksandthe 2025Liverpool Biennial. The environment is colourful and life-enhancing, and all staff are always extremely good-natured, helpful and well-informed.Susan BockingLiverpoolJonathan Jones makes some good points about the Tate-National relationship, especially in the matter of Tate Modern’s failure to display a coherent history of 20th-century art. Yet the Tate was right in making Liverpool its first provincial venture, because its founder Henry Tate made his fortune in Liverpool.TheNational Galleryought to follow this by opening a northern branch, for the 42 paintings in the National’s Ludwig Mond bequest were bought with money from Mond’s chemical works in Lancashire and Cheshire.The National has just announced a £375m extension in London; this money would be better used to build an extension in Liverpool or Manchester.Brian HattonLondonJonathan Jones’s critique of the Tate is overblown. Tate Modern has recently mounted a string of fascinating shows, including Yoko Ono and Mike Kelley, that have opened up new fields, rather than tilling the well-ploughed pastures of what are often – yawningly – billed as “blockbusters”.Dick EllisDerbyHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

As David Attenborough has pointed out, dragging weighted nets over sensitive seabeds is likebulldozing a rainforest– obliterating habitats vital for fish, seagrass and countless species. Other European nations are taking action, but Britain’s protections are token at best, covering just three sites. Conservation cannot be a meaningless label; marine protected areas must actually be protected.Healthier oceans benefit everyone, including fishing communities that depend on thriving stocks. If the UK is serious about safeguarding 30% of its waters by 2030, it must stop allowing destructive fishing in areas set aside for nature. Without real action, any claim of ocean stewardship rings hollow.Rick KlinkGuildford, SurreyMonths in the making, theenvironmental audit committee’s 60-page reportcategorically calls for a whole-site ban on bottom trawling in marine protected areas: 16 MPs and 61 parties contributed to the report, including conservation NGOs, marine scientists and academics (including myself). And yet, despite all the effort, time and expertise put in, the ruling from on high is that the destruction will continue within what are so fraudulently called “protected” areas. Words fail us.Unversed, hubristic civil servants and politicians should be compelled in law to follow scientific advice on marine policy, or be taken out of the decision‑making process altogether – if not, we’ll never be able to protect the sea from ruin.Deborah Rowan WrightBristolHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Notably, one member of the band is currently facing terrorism-related charges in the United Kingdom.“Criticism of foreign governments is protected under Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms, however advocating for political violence, glorifying terrorist organisations and displaying hate symbols that directly target the Jewish community are not protected forms of expression and will not be tolerated by our government.“That is why, as parliamentary secretary for combating crime, I am announcing that, effective immediately, the members of Kneecap have been deemed ineligible to enter Canada.”The trio responded with a statement on X, titled A Message to Vince Gasparro, in which they announced legal action and said they will beat the politician in court.They said: “Your comments about us are wholly untrue and deeply malicious.

More than 1,000 images were category A – the most serious kind – which includes “sadistic” sexual acts or activity with animals.DS Simon France, of Greater Manchester police (GMP), said Latham was “one of the most dangerous offenders” he had encountered in 14 years investigating sexual offences. He said “potentially hundreds” of young girls had been exploited by the “abhorrent” Latham.Sentencing Latham to a minimum of 14 years in prison on Friday, the judge, Philip Parry, said: “You are a highly dangerous individual. You are a predatory sex offender with little to no remorse. Young girls who come within your orbit, either in person or online, are in danger of being sexually abused by you.”Latham, who was not previously known to police, had admitted 49 offences in relation to at least 41 victims, of which eight are unidentified. GMP said the case was one of the biggest online child sexual abuse investigations it had ever undertaken and appealed for other potential victims to come forward. At least three girls have been identified in the US.Preston crown court heard how he posed as a 14-year-old boy named Josh, sending out hundreds of messages at a time to young girls on Snapchat and other social media.He would quickly steer the conversation to request sexual images, sometimes offering money. When victims refused to send more, he threatened to post their images online, telling one girl: “I guess I’ll leak these to your friends or family.”Latham struck up a relationship with a 12-year-old girl who initially told him she was 14, believing him to be 15. He was 19 at the time. He bought her sex toys and erotic outfits, the court heard.Teachers at the victim’s school became aware of the relationship and alerted Lancashire constabulary.After his arrest in December 2023, Latham admitted sexual contact with the girl but denied knowing she was 12, claiming he believed she was of legal age.The court heard that he attempted to arrange a threesome with the girl and one of her friends, who he had also sexually assaulted.Latham continued his sexual relationship with the 12-year-old when he was released on police bail, according to videos later found on his phone.Asked by police why he had carried on abusing the girl when he knew it was wrong, Latham said he “knew he was already in trouble for physically abusing the two girls and just thought that he couldn’t be in a worse situation”.The judge was told how one 11-year-old girl had been left “distraught” and “crying in the corner of her room” after being targeted online by Latham.The mother of another of his victims said: “This entire ordeal has taught our daughter that her body is up for grabs, for whoever wants to grab it.”Nicholas Clarke KC, representing Latham, told the court that online sexual abuse the defendant experienced a decade ago had influenced his offending.Clarke said the 22-year-old’s emotional age was not too distant from his victims and that his level of maturity had improved since his arrest – a claim that provoked angry reactions from the friends and families of the victims in court.The judge said Latham “struggled to show any meaningful empathy” for his crimes and that he attempted to “appear naive in order to minimise his responsibility”. “[It is] no exaggeration to say you have left emotional wreckage in your wake in the offending that you have committed against multiple girls,” he added.France said many people assume child sexual abuse images were limited to the dark web, away from easily accessible parts of the internet. He described Snapchat and other popular sites as a “hive of activity for people who are committing these sort of offences”.He said social media companies should have stricter protocols for verifying the age of users and urged parents to keep a closer eye on their children’s online activity. “It’s just horrific,” he said. “The level of offending on this scale, I’ve never seen before.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Acled’s researchers may also not have captured all combatant deaths over the six-month period, but their total does include Hamas political figures.The Guardian revealedlast month that internal data from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) indicated a civilian death toll of 83% between the outbreak of war in October 2023 and May of this year.The Acled report also found that incidents involving the demolition of buildings in Gaza had increased significantly since the renewal of hostilities in March, with 698 in the 15 months before, and 500 in the six months since. Many incidents involved more than one building, researchers said.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises from Gaza after an explosion, as seen from Israel.Photograph: Ammar Awad/ReutersA senior Israeli military officer told the Guardian last week that there was “a tension” between protecting civilians and the “demands of fast-moving military operations”.“We are fighting a very different war from any previous conflict anyone has fought anywhere in the world,” they said. “There are strict rules of engagement but what has changed is the policy that was designed for small wars where we wanted to deter [enemies] … We are now fighting in Gaza to ensure that Hamas is not ruling Gaza.”The IDF said on Friday that it would operate with “unprecedented force” in Gaza City, urging residents to flee southwards while announcing the closure of a temporary evacuation route opened 48 hours earlier.Acled said Israeli airstrikes had killed at least 40 commanders and key operatives in Hamas’s military wing since March. Only one senior official from Hamas’s pre-war military council is still in command, the report noted.“Hamas has been weakened undoubtedly and does not think they can now stop or defeat Israel and push them out of Gaza through military force,” said Ameneh Mehvar, Acled’s senior analyst for the Middle East and a co-author of the report. At this point Hamas is trying to “preserve what is left” of the movement”, he added.The monthly number ofHamas clashes with Israeli forceshas declined sharply since the end of the ceasefire as it relies more on booby-trapped buildings and roadside bombs to cause casualties.Four Israeli soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb in Rafah this week, bringing the number killed since March to 54.Mehvar said that although small cells of fighters were scattered across much of Gaza, Hamas was now largely limited to Gaza City and the central town of Deir al-Balah, with some presence in al-Mawasi, the undeveloped and overcrowded coastal area where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been ordered to go by Israeli forces.“These are areas where [Israeli forces] are not operating so logically that is where Hamas would be present. Hamas do obviously hide among civilians, but also in areas where there are none,” said Mehvar.The Israeli offensive in Gaza has killed more than 65,000 people, mostly civilians, and injured more than 160,000 since 7 October 2023. Swathes of the territory have been reduced to ruin, and almost 90% of homes damaged. Health services have collapsed and expert UN-backed monitors declared famine in the north last month.The war was triggered by a Hamas incursion into Israeli during which it killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. It also took more than 250 hostages back to Gaza, of whom 50 remain, though fewer than half are thought to still be alive.TheAcled reportsaid there was no evidence of Hamas systematically stealing aid that was delivered to Gaza by the UN as alleged by Israel, but that some assistance distributed by smaller NGOs might have been diverted by the organisation, which took power in Gaza in 2007.“Israel has created conditions of chaos and violence around aid distribution,” the report said. “At the same time, looting has sharply increased. The pattern of looting shows no evidence of Hamas’ systematic involvement. Hamas has probably diverted aid through other mechanisms and can continue to do so as long as it retains domestic influence.“With little prospect of eliminating Hamas entirely, [Israel’s] government is pursuing a long-term strategy of control: degrading Hamas while blocking alternative Palestinian governing arrangements, pushing Gaza toward unliveable conditions to encourage voluntary emigration and ultimately obstructing any path to Palestinian sovereignty.”Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Most of those cases – 85% – involved wounds being exposed to seawater, and 92% of the infected had one underlying health condition, the health department said.Over the previous decade,Louisianahas registered an average of 10 Vibrio infections and a single death, state health department officials said.The higher numbers in Louisiana come after scientific researchers havewarnedof evidence that Vibrio infections are becoming more common amid rising sea surface temperatures associated with the climate crisis – which has primarily been spurred by human emissions of greenhouse gases.Vibrio bacteria flourish in warm coastal waters and proliferate between May and October. Infections can result from exposing an open wound to seawater or from consuming seafood that is either raw or undercooked.About one in five people who contract Vibrio vulnificus in particular die – occasionally within two days of feeling sick from the infection. Those who do survive such an infection on occasion require limb amputation or intensive care.The story of one man who grew up in New Orleans, and died after contracting Vibrio vulnificus in July in nearby Bay St Louis, Mississippi, vividly illustrated the dangers of the bacterium to the public in the region.Basil Kennedy, 77, evidently contracted the bacterium after scraping his leg on a boat trailer, his daughter told the Louisiana news stationWVUE. Kennedy reportedly cleaned and bandaged the wound, and he avoided getting into the water, thinking nothing more of it. But in about three days, his health sharply declined, and he died, his daughter said.Kay Kennedy Regimbal told the station “there doesn’t need to be fear of the water” despite her father’s death – but she added that “there really needs to be an education and an understanding of how to be prepared for a situation where you may be exposed or there is a potential risk”.Symptoms of Vibrio infection can include gastrointestinal illness, an unusually severe wound or – as associated with bloodstream infection – fever, blistering and dangerously low blood pressure.The US usually reports about 150 to 200 cases of Vibrio vulnificus a year. About half of those cases occur in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Louisiana officials said the most cases and deaths have been in their state and Florida.Explore more on these topicsLouisianaClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

By the 1970s, the newly independent republic was producing278,000 barrels of crude oil a day. For a country of just 1 million people, after the collapse of its sugar and cocoa industries, oil proved to be transformative.Today, witha population of 1.5 millionand oil productiondown to less than 54,000 barrels a day, Trinidad and Tobago is at a crossroads. The country’sonly petroleum refinery closedin 2018 due to mismanagement and declining production by the state-owned Petrotrin company.A recent analysisnoted that the energy revenues plummeted 48.4% to $14.7bn (£10.9bn) in the last fiscal year, while non-energy revenues grew by 26% to $32.7bn.View image in fullscreenTrinidad and Tobago’s only oil refinery in 2015. The state-owned plant was closed in 2018, when local production fell so low that oil had to be imported to supply it.Photograph: Andrea De SilvaWith crude oil production declining since the 2000s (while gas increased, then sharply decreased), the country faces a standoff. Environmentalists are calling for a greener economy, while the new government, like its predecessors, pushes for more deepwater exploration.“We have fallen victim to ‘Dutch disease’ – a dependence on one single sector – which has defined who we are from an economic and social perspective,” says Indera Sagewan, an economist and director of theCaribbean Centre for Competitiveness.We have fallen victim to Dutch disease – a dependence on one single sectorIndera Sagewan“Non-energy economic diversification is imperative as the way forward forTrinidad and Tobago. We are living a defining moment.”Unlike other oil-dependent states, such as Norway, the UAE and Qatar, Trinidad and Tobago has failed to maximise the benefits of theHeritage and Stabilisation Fund, which was established in 2007 to invest surplus revenues as a means of consolidating the legacy of oil wealth.Now, the country faces the prospect of chronic low growth, according toan OECD reportpublished in December. Last year, GDPgrew by an estimated 1.7%, up from 1.4% in 2023. The government also faces rising unemployment rates and fiscal pressures, with public debt reaching64.5% of GDP in 2024– higher than theaverage of 51.9%in Central America and the Caribbean, according to the OECD.A chart showing the decline in oil and gas productionTo escape the low-growth trap, experts such as Sagewan have long argued that Trinidad and Tobago should diversify its economy, a challenge for a commodity-exporting country reliant on oil and gas.You can find new reserves using new technology … or drill deeperDax DriverIntroduced in 2022, the country’sgreen hydrogen strategyis a step in that direction, aiming to overhaul the energy sector by shifting from grey to green hydrogen (the former produced from gas, which creates CO2emissions; the latter splitting water using renewable energy), using existing petrochemical infrastructure, and producing 4m tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2065. The country has also announced plans to install 57GW of offshore wind capacity by 2065 with the aim of achieving 30% renewable electricity generation.Yet, all of that remains just a “very early-stage” plans, according to Sagewan.On 13 August, the government of the prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, signalled its intent to press on with fossil fuels bysigning a deal with ExxonMobilto explore a vast ultra-deepwater block off the country’s east coast, covering more than 7,000 sq km in waters more than 1.2 miles (2km) deep.View image in fullscreenPort of Spain: the skyline of Trinidad and Tobago’s capital reflects the boom years the country enjoyed from fossil fuels.Photograph: Andrea De SilvaIf reserves are found, the investment could reach up to $21.7bn, according to the energy minister, Roodal Moonilal.The deal underscores the new government’s commitment to deepwater drilling, seeking new discoveries in unexplored Atlantic waters like theoil rush in nearby Guyanaand Suriname.“There is no real strong stakeholder movement here that says: ‘Stop exploring for oil and gas in Trinidad and Tobago’,” says Dax Driver, chief executive of theEnergy Chamber, the industry’s lobby group.From the first oil well drilled in the 19th century to the discovery of offshore gas fields in the 1990s, fossil fuels have been Trinidad and Tobago’s economic lifeblood, bringing infrastructure and wealth far beyond Caribbean neighbours.The oil money transformed lives for the better in many ways: free university education, extensive public-sector employment, subsidised electricity, gas and water that were among the cheapest utilities in the world, andpetrol prices at a third of UKlevels. A thriving middle class and a wealthy elite emerged; highways, hospitals and airports were built.But wealth also fuelled corruption, inequality and violent crime. The country remains heavily dependent on oil, while drilling and spills threaten the fragile ecosystems.View image in fullscreenAn oil rig operating in state-owned Petrotrin’s Soldado field off the coast of Trinidad in 2014.Photograph: Andrea De Silva/ReutersNow, experts question how close Trinidad and Tobago is to a crunch point. A 2019 report by a US consultancy estimated there were10 years of gas reservesleft.Last year, Stuart Young, then energy minister, said reserves hadrisen to 11 years, or potentially 20 with efficient extraction. However, the oil cartelOpec’s data indicatesthat crude oil output is in freefall, and gas production is also declining.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The discoveries raised hope that new fields could also be developed in Trinidad and Tobago. “You can find new reserves using new technology,” says Driver. “Or drill deeper.”A recent gas find between Tobago and Barbados has increased optimism among fossil fuel advocates. But uncertainties persist since much of the deep Atlantic remains unexplored. Offshore acreage extends 125 miles into the Atlantic, though recovery rates are low – about 10 to 15% for each oilfield.View image in fullscreenRoodal Moonilal, the new UNC government’s energy minister, being sworn in this year.Photograph: Andrea De SilvaStill, investing heavily in oil and gas exploration has once again become a priority afterApril’s elections in Trinidad and Tobagorestored the United National Congress (UNC) party to government under Persad-Bissessar.Moonilal says the government supports decarbonisation initiatives, such as theBrechin Castle solar farm, the largest in the region, which could supply 10% of the nation’s electricity. However, fossil fuels remain the priority. “We need to be finding more natural gas,” the energy minister says.“Natural gas production declinedby 34% from 2015 to 2024, and oil declined by 35% over the same period,” he says. “At the end of 2022, proven gas reserves stood at57tn cubic feet[1.14bn tonnes]. That represents significant potential for future discoveries, particularly in deepwater acreage. Deepwater exploration is important to us.”Moonilal adds that Trinidad and Tobago hopes to also export its energy expertise. “Guyana, Suriname and Grenada are at different hydrocarbon development stages. We have great human resource expertise and infrastructure. We also have plants that need raw material,” he says. “We see a win-win scenario.”View image in fullscreenThe Brechin Castle solar farm is the largest energy project of its type in the regionGoing against this enthusiasm for oil and gas, environmentalists and economists warn that such reliance on fossil fuels exposes Trinidad and Tobago to ecological harm, price shocks and socioeconomic collapse in a region vulnerable to extreme weather events.The climate crisis has cost Caribbean countries an average of2.13% of regional GDPannually from 1980 to 2020, according to the OECD. Meanwhile,Trinidad’s per capita emissions rank eighth highestglobally, at 22.8 tonnes, which is more than five times the rate of the UK.‘Will you stop exploring yours?’: Latin America forges ahead on new oil frontierRead moreAidan Farrell, of the University of the West Indies, says the Caribbean has warmed by about 1C (1.8F) since 1960, with a similar rise expected by 2050.“There is a lot of attention on how we will be able to produce enough food. The government is preparing for more frequent tropical storms, sea-level rise and coastal erosion, where most economic activity, including oil and gas, is located,” he says.Environmentalists argue that the ecological toll is already high. “Oil spills, gas flaring and industrial waste have degraded ecosystems, impacted fisheries and exposed coastal communities to real harm,” says Dizzanne Billy, regional director ofClimate Tracker Caribbean.“We’re faced with a troubling paradox: a small island bearing the brunt of climate impacts while contributing significantly to the problem.”The country has faced several environmental disasters in recent years. In 2024, a capsized barge triggereda national emergency, with oil spreading hundreds of miles to the island of Bonaire, contaminating beaches, mangroves and coral.We need policies empowering workers to transition with dignity … into new industriesDizzanne BillyBilly stresses the urgent need to pivot away from fossil fuels. “The urgency isn’t just environmental; it’s economic, social and generational,” she says. “Fossil fuel wealth hasn’t trickled down equally. Frontline communities face underinvestment while absorbing environmental fallout. That’s not just economic – it’s a climate justice issue.”For campaigners such as Billy, a continued focus on fossil fuels is shortsighted. “Our dependence leaves us vulnerable to global price shocks,” she says.The problem is that diversification remains at an early stage. Tourism is marginal outside carnival week in spring, and agriculture needs a dramatic boost to fill the oil void.View image in fullscreenWorkers clean a beach in La Brea, Trinidad, in 2013 after an oil pipeline leak.Photograph: Andrea De SilvaStill, Sagewan sees the country as a potential exporter of food globally. Michael J Cooper, an expert in energy finance and a former economist at the energy ministry, sees banking and insurance expanding with a development strategy over the next decade.He lists manufacturing, tourism, film, entertainment, shipping, shipbuilding and ship repair, as well as food production, as viable alternatives.‘Like dropping a bomb’: why is clean energy leader Uruguay ramping up the search for oil?Read more“We have a very educated workforce, with many highly skilled people relative to other developing countries,” he says. “While energy production decline is slow, the government should act early to stimulate other sectors.”Billy calls for a new model that focuses on renewables, regenerative agriculture, digital services, community tourism and the creative economy.“We need policies empowering workers to transition with dignity through re-skilling, support systems and clear pathways into new industries,” she says. “It means shifting power to communities most affected by our current economic model, placing them at the heart of the redesign.”Explore more on these topicsTrinidad and TobagoThe Latin and Caribbean oil rushAmericasFossil fuelsEnergyOilClimate crisisEnergy industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Government officials insist this is not the case.There is a wider push from the chancellor to inject more urgency into housing and infrastructure development, which she is hoping will help her fill a multibillion-pound hole at the next budget.But environmental campaigners warn that clipping the wings of the Environment Agency could harm wildlife and the natural world.One agency source said the staff from the Ministry ofHousing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) were “pushing development at any cost”.They added: “We are taking a step back from planning and the organisational steer is to do the minimum required to fulfil our legal duties but nothing more. They are seeking legal advice as to what the minimum they can get away with is.”They added: “There are lots of examples of where nature and development happen together, but going forwards, the EA doesn’t seem to want to be part of it.”An Environment Agency spokesperson said they did not recognise the claims, but acknowledged that MHCLG staff had been brought into the agency. They added: We have received no directions to wave planning applications through. The EA continues to provide robust technical advice to ensure that environmental protections are considered in planning decisions. The government’s ambitious target for building 1.5m new homes is vital. To support this, we have rapidly reformed our planning service, now provide advice consistently within the 21-day deadline and use our technical expertise to achieve the best outcomes for the environment and economic growth.”Reeves has told ministers to make a fresh push to cull quangos that their departments oversee, with sources indicating that the environment department has been singled out.The department, whose new secretary of state, Emma Reynolds, was previously a Treasury minister, controls 37 agencies, including Natural England, the Environment Agency and the Office for Environmental Protection.Ministers in this government and the previous Conservative administration have expressed frustration at the ability of some of the environmental regulators to hold up development. The chancellor hasblamed them for choking economic growthby demanding developers build expensive wildlife protections such as the infamous £100m “bat tunnel” over the HS2 high-speed rail line.The Environment Agency polices nutrient neutrality rules which ban developments in dozens of regions across the country if they are predicted to add to nutrients to nearby rivers.The rules are in place to prevent the buildup of algae and other plants, which can choke off aquatic life, but have been blamed for the lack of housebuilding in certain areas.The agency’s role in judging planning applications is enshrined in law, but Reeves is working on a planning and infrastructure bill that could rip up many of the rules around permitted developments. New rules could also be included in the forthcoming water bill.Environmental campaigners say removing the agency entirely from the planning process could damage British wildlife.Ali Plummer, the director of policy and advocacy at Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “Deregulation won’t speed up nature recovery; it will just leave us with poorly designed developments, increased pollution and lower access to nature. Weaker regulation is not the foundation to build from for the next generation.”Alexa Culver, a lawyer at the ecological consultancy RSK Wilding, said: “Properly funded and independent regulators are an essential part of any thriving economy. Choking the role of the Environment Agency and fettering their independence goes against all principles of good regulation.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironment AgencyHousingEconomic policyGreen politicsConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

Red squirrel numbers have fallen dramatically across mainland England since the introduction of invasive grey squirrels in the late 19th century, which outcompete them for resources and carry the squirrel pox virus that is fatal to red squirrels.View image in fullscreenResearchers said island populations are more exposed to other threats such as limited genetic diversity.Photograph: Wight Squirrel Project/PADr Emilie Hardouin, a conservation geneticist at Bournemouth University, said the red squirrels on the Isle of Wight “might be the last remaining populations that used to be native to southern England”.However, the researchers also said continual monitoring was necessary as island populations are more exposed to other threats such as limited genetic diversity.Helen Butler, the founder of the Wight Squirrel Project, a conservation group, said: “It’s hard to overstate their importance to the Isle of Wight.” For Helen, who began working on the protection of the red squirrel “almost by accident” after one inspiring volunteering experience more than 30 years ago, every day can look different.“People can call in and report things to me … because I can’t be everywhere at once. Sometimes I’m attending to ones that are sick and injured, or investigating if someone thinks they’ve seen a grey one.“They’re also important to local businesses – they bring visitors in who want to tick seeing a red squirrel off their bucket list.”Debbie Hart, another volunteer, said: “Everybody loves them … if people see them in the road they get out of their cars to take pictures. I have about eight in my garden – you get to know them, what they like or don’t, for example they’ll eat red grapes, but they won’t eat green ones.”Hardouin added: “Now that we have the genetic data and we have the forestry data it’s easier to go back and look to see if we are missing any corridors to help the two groups of red squirrels integrate to help them thrive.”Explore more on these topicsWildlifeIsle of WightnewsShareReuse this content"

Ross had accused the government of dithering over plans for a summit to tackle “out of control” gulls.Swinney had defended Hepburn, who is widely liked within the Scottish National party and respected by opponents.Ross, who quit as Scotland’s Tory leaderin a row over his bid to become an MP at the last election, is known for trying to goad ministers.In his resignation letter, Hepburn acknowledged his behaviour was inappropriate and said it was “quite out of character”. He said: “Irrespective of whether or not the ministerial code has been breached, even if there had been no complaint made, I believe I have not acted in accordance with my own personal code of practice.“I hope it would be felt by most … that in my personal and professional undertakings I have always tried to act courteously in interacting with colleagues, either of our own party or others. There is no denying that my interaction with Douglas Ross fell well short of that standard.“Despite whatever annoyance I felt at that particular moment, there is a manner in which that might have been conveyed, or indeed shouldn’t have been conveyed. That is not in utilising the language that I did.”He added: “With no sense of personal pity, having served continuously in government for almost 11 years it is a source of regret that my tenure in ministerial office comes to an end in this fashion.”Ross said Hepburn had contacted him after his resignation to apologise in person about his conduct. Quitting was the “correct decision”, Ross said, adding that Swinney should have acted sooner by sacking Hepburn immediately after he heard about the incident.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Several have been forced to quit, includingthe former health secretary Michael Matheson– who faced a parliamentary investigation into how he racked up a near-£11,000 bill on his work iPad – only after serious and substantiated allegations of misconduct came to light.Swinney said he accepted Hepburn’s resignation with “much personal regret” but said he was leaving office with “my warmest thanks”.

Public hearings, akin to public inquiries, involving families and witness will be facilitated and overseen by independent judges.The ICRIR said more than 200 people “from all sections of society” had already come to the commission with 90 “live investigations” into more than 170 deaths.Mark Thompson, the chief executive of the campaign group Relatives for Justice, told Radio 4 there were almost 400 killings by British soldiers against unarmed civilians that were never investigated.Conditional immunity for soldiers or agents of the state and the ban on civil proceedings taken by victims will be lifted.A legacy unit will be established by the Gardai in Ireland, and a €25m (£22m) fund set up to help witnesses deal with the legal process.Benn said veterans who were giving information to the commission would be supported, protected and given the opportunity to provide evidence by video link, rather than being treated as they had been in the past, which included getting letters or calls out of the blue demanding they travel to Belfast to give evidence in inquests.He said this support would be extended to former paramilitaries on both sides who put down their arms in 1998. However, normal court rules would apply in potential court cases.Ireland considers the measures, which were hashed out over nine months, an important reset in relations between the two countries and a “return to partnership”, according to one diplomat.“It has been a hell of a long time since a British and Irish government stood shoulder to shoulder in Northern Ireland on legacy. In fact, I think it was 2014 and that deal never got implemented, and that’s been too long,” Harris told reporters.He said the 2023 act had moved the relations between the two countries backwards and the goal was now to move forward.Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandNorthern Irish politicsIrelandHilary BennSimon HarrisnewsShareReuse this content"

In recent years, it has posted comments indicating it is likely to be Allen’s account, such as an announcement last month that the handle user had been elected to Northumberland county council for Reform.Under videos about thearrest this month of the writer Graham Linehanby armed police at Heathrow over posts on X about transgender issues, the account posted: “Five armed police??? I’d shoot Starmer myself if I had the weapon and opportunity!”Under a video about the conviction last month of an asylum seeker for sexual assault, it posted: “I can’t wait to see Starmer swinging from a lamp post.”Georgie Laming, the director of campaigns at Hope Not Hate, said Allen was “not fit to represent the people of Northumberland” given the alleged links to the account.Allen said he would not comment on “private information”, adding that he sometimes watched YouTube videos and commented on them, and that he believed that freedom of speech was being restricted.There is growing concern over the increasingly violent language finding its way into British political life.Last weekend, a man was arrested after allegedly being filmed at the far-right rally in London threatening to kill Starmer.Separately, Downing Street condemned “dangerous and inflammatory” language used at the event by Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of Tesla and X. Appearing via a live link, Musk told a crowd of protesters that “violence is coming” and “you either fight back or you die”.Explore more on these topicsReform UKKeir StarmerNorthumberlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Some of its critics are concerned it has not been determined how the process will work, where it will take place and how it will be funded.Berger, a Labour peer, said: “The introduction of a select committee is a victory for those of us that want proper scrutiny of how these new laws would work, the massive changes they could make to the NHS and how we treat people at the end of their lives.“It is essential that as we look at these new laws we get a chance to hear from those government ministers and professionals that would be in charge of creating and running any new assisted dying system.“Without their input we simply do not know how it would work in practice and, importantly, how we can make sure we have the safeguards and protections necessary to protect the vulnerable.”A committee of about a dozen peers is likely to be formed next month to hear more evidence from experts about how an assisted dying service would be funded, the potential impact on the health and justice systems and the role of coroners and various medical professionals in the process.It will report to the Lords by 7 November, before the bill can progress to the next stage of the legislative process.In their joint letter, Falconer and Berger said: “It would be of benefit to this house for further evidence to be available before the process of detailed scrutiny begins at the (whole house) committee stage of the bill.“We believe it is possible to call that evidence without causing a significant risk that the bill would fail in this house through lack of time.”During Friday’s debate, a former senior judge, Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, said it was a “badly flawed bill that needs radical improvement” and highlighted “43 delegated powers to be dealt with by the secretary of state but obviously more likely civil servants in the department of health”.Some peers in favour of the bill also objected to language used in last week’s Lords debate, in which Theresa May described it as a “suicide” bill and saidsome called it a “licence to kill bill”.Tessa Blackstone, a Labour peer, said she felt “affronted” by some of the language used, including references to “the ‘killing bill’ or the ‘assisted suicide bill’”.The Labour peer Jan Royall said she had been “dismayed at the conflation made by some of suicide and assisted dying”, while her fellow Labour peer Glenys Thornton said: “People have written to me in the last week, very distressed, and they say, ‘we are not suicidal, we want to live, but we are dying, and we do not have the choice or ability to change that’.”Peers will debate the bill more later this autumn. If it does become law, the government has four years in which to get an assisted dying service into place, meaning it could be 2029 before the first assisted death takes place.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingEnglandWalesHouse of LordsnewsShareReuse this content"

Fifty-eight Democrats opposed it, 38 voted present and 22 did not vote.The five-pageresolution, introduced by the House speaker,Mike Johnson, and co-sponsored by 165 House Republicans but no Democrats, praises Kirk as a “courageous American patriot” who sought to “elevate truth, foster understanding, and strengthen the Republic”.The House minority leader,Hakeem Jeffries, had told Democrats in a closed-door caucus meeting Thursday morning that leadership would vote for the resolution, but his team was not whipping the vote, leaving lawmakers to decide for themselves, multiple people present toldAxios.Dozens of workers disciplined after Charlie Kirk shooting, from journalists to Jimmy KimmelRead moreSeveralDemocratswho opposed the resolution said they condemned his murder, but could not support his speech.“I cannot vote yes on this resolution because it grossly misrepresents Charlie Kirk’s methods, views and beliefs while citing Christian nationalist language. I will always condemn heinous acts of violence, but this resolution ignores the false and hateful rhetoric that was too often present in his debates,” said Colorado’s Diana DeGette, who voted present.Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who voted no, said in a statement: “We should be clear about who Charlie Kirk was: a man who believed that the Civil Rights Act that granted Black Americans the right to vote was a ‘mistake,’ who after the violent attack on Paul Pelosi claimed that ‘some amazing patriot out there’ should bail out his assailant, and accused Jews of controlling ‘not just the colleges – it’s the nonprofits, it’s the movies, it’s Hollywood, it’s all of it.’ His rhetoric and beliefs were ignorant and sought to disenfranchise millions of Americans – far from ‘working tirelessly to promote unity’ as asserted by the majority in this resolution.”But Maryland’s Jamie Raskin said he voted yes on the measure because it “repeatedly condemns all political violence, extremism and hatred in unequivocal terms”, while adding: “We should overlook whatever surplus verbiage is contained in this Resolution designed to make the vote difficult for Democrats. We cannot fall for that obvious political trap and should rise above it.” The measure calls Kirk’s shooting “a sobering reminder of the growing threat posed by political extremism and hatred in our society”.The internal Democratic tensions reflect broader concerns aboutpolitical polarizationfollowing Kirk’s killing on 10 September at Utah Valley University.The struggle has extended beyond infighting on Capitol Hill, as the Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr, has now been criticized by a handful of Republicans after he pressured ABC tosuspend the late-night hostJimmy Kimmelover comments about Kirk’s killing.“We all should be very cautious,” Jerry Moran, a Republican senator from Kansas, toldPolitico. “The conservative position is free speech is free speech, and we better be very careful about any lines we cross in diminishing free speech.”The House energy and commerce chair, Brett Guthrie, whose committee oversees the FCC, said on Thursday: “Just because I don’t agree with what someone says, we need to be very careful. We have to be extremely cautious to try to use government to influence what people say.”However, more than a dozenRepublicanstold Politico they were not concerned by Carr’s intervention, largely framing Kimmel’s suspension as a business decision rather than government coercion.A US neo-Nazi fight club is using Charlie Kirk’s killing to recruit new membersRead moreDonald Trump, while at a state visit and press conference in London with the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer,blamedthe Kimmel suspension on an exaggerated claim of supposedly bad ratings while simultaneously admitting the Kirk issue played a role.“Jimmy Kimmel was fired because he had bad ratings more than anything else,” Trump said. “And he said a horrible thing about a great gentleman known as Charlie Kirk.”Eleven Democrats in the Senate, including the minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said they were “outraged” by Carr’s comments, and demanded answers by 25 September, telling the FCC chair ina letter: “This is precisely what government censorship looks like.”Democratic leaders in the House took it a step further anddemandedCarr’s resignation, accusing him of “corrupt abuse of power” in forcing ABC to suspend Kimmel’s late-night show through regulatory threats. They warned that House Democrats would “make sure the American people learn the truth, even if that requires the relentless unleashing of congressional subpoena power”.Explore more on these topicsHouse of RepresentativesRepublicansDemocratsCharlie Kirk shootingUS politicsHakeem JeffriesUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

Social media videos show bodies trapped under rubble and debris.RSF has not commented on the incident. The paramilitary group has been engaged in a ragingcivil war with the Sudanese Armed Forcessince April 2023 but since the army’s capture of the capital, Khartoum, in March, the RSF has been fighting to maintain territorial dominance of Darfur, its stronghold.El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state, is the last remaining capital in the region controlled by the Sudanese army and has been under siege for more than a year.Research from YaleUniversity’s Humanitarian Research Lab shows RSF is building an earthen wall around El Fasher to trap people inside.View image in fullscreenBefore and after satellite images showing damage to a building within the former Unamid compound in El Fasher, sustained between 15 and 18 September.Photograph: Maxar TechnologiesSatellite imagery released by the lab on Thursday showed RSF forces advancing in many areas, including around the Abu Shouk camp and the former peacekeeping base for United Nations-African Union Hybrid Operation in Darfur (Unamid), now used by anti-RSF joint forces.The city and the camp have been under an intensifying assault in recent months, experiencing artillery shelling and drone strikes.Brutal attacks there killed at least 89 civilians over a 10-day period last month, with the UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) saying some appeared to have been summary executions.View image in fullscreenBefore and after satellite images of the Abu Shouk IDP camp showing thermal scarring and damage to several structures that took place in recent days.Photograph: Maxar TechnologiesLast week, at least 13 people were killed in shelling of the city by RSF.A new reportby the OHCHR said at least 3,384 civilians were killed between January and June, mostly in Darfur – a figure representing nearly 80% of civilian casualties in Sudan last year.El Fasher mapMost of the killings were caused by artillery shelling and air and drone strikes in densely populated areas, and many deaths happened during the RSF’s offensive on El Fasher as well as the Zamzam and Abu Shouk camps in April, the report said.The UN and rights groups have in the past reported that some killings have been ethnically targeted.El Fasher is under a communications blackout, making it difficult to verify casualties or coordinate aid. At a briefing on Tuesday on the situation in the city organised by Avaaz, an advocacy group, participants talked of dire and deteriorating conditions in the city due to the assaults.Fatima, an artist and lecturer who works with displaced communities in North Darfur, said civilians in El Fasher were enduring deliberate shelling, rapid deaths, slow deaths, injuries, starvation, disease, intimidation and other inhumane practices daily. “This is a real catastrophe,” she said.Mohammad Duda, spokesperson of Zamzam camp in North Darfur, said people in El Fasher were “being forced to hide in buried shipping containers as makeshift shelters”. He appealed to the international community “to intervene immediately and save the people of El Fasher from this catastrophic humanitarian crisis”.Avaaz expressed concern that if El Fasher fell, RSF could carry out ethnically targeted attacks, as reported afer the capture ofZamzamthis year and inGeneinain 2023.The fighting in Sudan has created what theUN has describedas one of the worst humanitarian crises of the 21st century.More than 150,000 peoplehave been killed,more than 14 millionhave been displaced from their homes and a larger number arein need of humanitarian aid.Explore more on these topicsSudanMiddle East and north AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But Trump offered no details about the agreement or when it would be signed.The American and Chinese leaders had connected over a phone call earlier in the day, the first direct contact between the two leaders since June.Chinaand the US have been at loggerheads over trade negotiations and the future of TikTok, a Chinese-owned social media platform that faces a ban in the US.Trump had said earlier this week that Washington and Beijing hadagreed a deal on TikTokunder which it would be transferred to US control, but details of the framework have been scant, and elementsreportedlyremain to be hashed out. Investors including the US software giant Oraclehave been in talksto take a large stake in TikTok’s US operations, which would dilute the amount of China-based ownership to comply with a law Congress passed last year.The Wall Street Journalreportedon Friday that investors in the TikTok deal would pay the US a fee in exchange for negotiating the agreement with China.Trump celebrates TikTok deal as Beijing suggests US app would use China’s algorithmRead moreIn the call on Friday, the Chinese president “emphasised the vital importance of US-China relations”, according to a Chinese readout of Friday’s phone call.“China’s position on the TikTok issue is clear,” the readout said. “The Chinese government respects the wishes of companies and welcomes them to conduct commercial negotiations based on market rules and reach solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and balance interests. China hopes that the US will provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies to invest in the US.”China described the call as “pragmatic, positive, and constructive”.In a post on Truth Social, Trump described the call as “very productive”. “We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,” Trump wrote.He said he and Xi would meet at the Asia-Pacificeconomic cooperation summit in South Korea in late October and he would visit China “in the early part of next year”. China has not commented on when Trump and Xi might meet in person.The TikTok deal was negotiated this week in Madrid, where the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and the Chinese vice-premier He Lifeng met to negotiate a trade deal. The US and China have agreed to a temporary pause in the trade war and the deadline to reach an agreement is 10 November.TikTok owner set to launch share buyback valuing company at $330bnRead moreThe call came as Trump returned from a state visit to the UK, which was accompanied by news of amultibillion-dollar investment dealfor US tech companies in the UK. Microsoft will invest $30bn while Nvidia will invest £11bn.US tech companies have been caught in the cross-hairs of the US-China trade war. This week it was reported that China had ordered its top tech firms to stop buying semiconductors from Nvidia, which makes the world’s most advanced chips. Nvidia’s most high-end models are already banned by the US from being exported to China, but it had developed less sophisticated chips specifically for the Chinese market.The Chinese readout of the call said Trump had praised Beijing’s recentmilitary parade– the biggest showcase of military might in decades – as “magnificent”. The second world war commemoration parade, which was attended by Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un, was widely seen in the west as being a show of unity from an anti-American bloc.However, China has been keen to stress its cooperation with the allied forces in the second world war. According to the readout, Xi on Friday “pointed out that China and the United States were allies who fought side by side during world war two”.China described US-China ties as “the most important bilateral relationship in the world”.Explore more on these topicsTikTokChinaTrump administrationDonald TrumpAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

But he alleged that the defamation suit against his publisher fit into a broader pattern of nationalist parties using legal means to intimidate critical voices in the arts.“What we are seeing is far-right parties using the arsenal provided by democracy in order to destroy it,” he told the Guardian.Strache, who served as Austria’s vice-chancellor between 2017 and 2019 butresigned over the so-called Ibiza affaircorruption scandal, has announced his intention to pursue a further defamation claim against Rau personally, for repeating the allegation in an interview with the Austrian playwright Elfriede Jelinek.Rau, meanwhile, said he intends to make his experience the theme of a new theatrical production at Hamburg’s Thalia theatre next February.The defamatory passage was part of a speech Rau made in Berlin in March, in which he spoke about the way the FPÖ has agitated against “woke events” such as Eurovision and the Vienna festival, which Rau has been the artistic director of since 2023.The speech was reprinted in a collection of Rau’s writing called Resistance Has No Form, Resistance Is the Form, which was published in May and withdrawn from sale last week, ahead of the trial.It says: “What can we learn from a period – our period – in which a member of the biggest Austrian party, the FPÖ, a man called H-C Strache, sings the song ‘We’ll manage the seventh million’ in the morning and in the afternoon goes on to visit the Yad Vashem remembrance centre, where the dead of the Holocaust are commemorated?”The mention of the song is a reference to a 2018 scandal where an FPÖ politician was found to have been a member of a fraternity orBurschenschaftwhose songbook made light of the Holocaust and glorified the Wehrmacht.Austria to dissolve Nazi songbook fraternity linked to Freedom partyRead moreOne of these drinking songs contained the line “Step on the gas, you ancient Germanic peoples, we’ll manage the seventh million”. Dating back to the 19th century, the song was sung in the 1930s by liberal fraternities to make fun of the SS but was then adapted by neo-Nazi groups after the war, when the line mocking the Holocaust was added.Rau said that while the specific allegation against Strache was incorrect, he still stood by the broader criticism it was trying to make: that the FPÖ, which was founded by former members of the Nazi party, was now pretending to act as protectors of Jewish interests.As leader of the FPÖ, Strache made several visits to Israel and caused a scandal in 2010 when he visited Yad Vashem wearing not a kippa but the traditional cap of a student fraternity.“Strache’s visit to Yad Vashem wearing the headgear of a German nationalist fraternity was more brazen than anything alleged in my book,” said Rau.While German-language student fraternities can range from far-right national socialists to liberal societies, Austrian fraternities have historically been located on a more narrowly nationalistic spectrum, and more vocal about their commitment to the idea of a “Greater Germany” based on ethnicity, precisely because they were located outside German borders.Explore more on these topicsBooksMilo RauAustriaEuropeHolocaustNazismSecond world warnewsShareReuse this content"

With the indelible musical receiving an anniversary rerelease in cinemas this weekend – in a gleaming new 4K restoration to boot – five of the seven are preparing for another reunion to mark the occasion.Two are no longer with us. Charmian Carr, who played eldest daughter Liesl, and Heather Menzies, who played Louisa, died in 2016 and 2017. But the other Von Trapp actors, as Hammond says, have otherwise largely been spared any great misfortune. “None of the actors who played the children have really had terrible incidents in their lives of tragedy, chaos, addictions or problems that you hear about so often with child actors. Yes, we’re all identified forever as those characters. But it hasn’t sent anybody’s life off the rails.”None of the seven became major movie stars off the back of starring in what was, at one point, the biggest box office hit of all time; some went on to steady acting careers, while others eventually picked another vocation entirely. (Duane Chase, who played Kurt, studied geology and became a forester; Debbie Turner, who played Marta, is a floral designer, though she makes and sells Sound of Music-themed scarves on her personal website.)You might expect the combination of vulnerable youth and blockbuster exposure to have monkey’s-paw consequences in at least one of their cases. But various where-are-they-now interviews with the actors over the years have been consistent in their general positivity: it was a great experience, they’re part of a great legacy, and they’re all still great friends.“It’s like watching home movies,” says Angela Cartwright, who played middle daughter Brigitta, of watching the film today. “It’s like the way our kids watch videos of themselves. It brings back wonderful memories. I remember, I instantly clicked with Heather Menzies, so I was in Salzburg with a really, really good friend who also loved the Beatles and it was just fantastic. But everybody on it was great. When we see each other again, it’s like we’ve never been apart. We’re just like a family.”“We see each other at Sound of Music reunions, of course,” says Hammond, “but sometimes we just get together and have a meal, and that’s always really fun, too. I love them all. I mean, unashamedly, I love them. I don’t have a sister, and those girls are my sisters. We’ve been through a lot with each other, you know: good times, birthdays, weddings, bad times, divorces, funerals, illness, and we’ve always been there for each other, and we always will be. I know no matter what happens to me, at three o’clock in the morning, I could call any of them, and they would pick up, and be there for me if I needed them.”Their tales of making the film are uniformly sunny, and steeped in fondness for the film’s leading ladyJulie Andrews, then a new mother, who was happy to bond with her on-screen charges when the cameras were off. Hammond, who toured the southern hemisphere with Andrews in a two-person stage show, regards her to this day as a close colleague and personal friend – someone with whom “you can talk about this and that, and make sure you don’t have spinach between your teeth just before you walk on stage.”View image in fullscreen‘It was a huge event’ … Julie Andrews, Heather Menzies, Angela Cartwright, Kym Karath, Nicholas Hammond, Debbie Turner and Charmian Carr at the Hollywood premiere of The Sound of Music.Photograph: Bruce Bailey/Getty ImagesCartwright, meanwhile, treasures her memories of attending on-set classes with all her on-screen siblings (save the then-adult Carr), which bonded them across a wide age spectrum. “We all went to school together. Kym [Karath], who played Gretl, was only five, so she wasn’t required to get her school hours. But she wanted to go with us anyway.”Collectively, they had little sense that they were in the process of making a cultural phenomenon. “You hope every movie will be a success, but there were a lot of factors that were telling people it might not be,” says Hammond. “It was already the mid-60s, and we were moving into an era of darker, grittier, more realistic stories.Musicalsabout singing nuns and singing children – people weren’t at all sure this was something the public was going to buy.”Only at the film’s premiere did it dawn on the young stars that they were part of something very big indeed. Cartwright’s memories of the night are rapt: “It was a huge event at this theatre where the big velvet curtains parted and the music whisked you away to this land of mountains. And then, of course, Julie twirling. I remember just going: ‘Oh my gosh, this isamazing.’”Of the seven, Hammond and Cartwright are the two who have enjoyed the most sustained showbiz careers. Each was an established child actor prior to making The Sound of Music; indeed, Cartwright had already worked with the film’s director, Robert Wise, on the Paul Newman boxing drama Somebody Up There Likes Me at just four years old, though she recalls he didn’t remember her nine years later. And each found cult TV success in the years after the film, Hammond as a 1970s Peter Parker in The Amazing Spider-Man, and Cartwright on the sci-fi series Lost in Space.Hammond was last seen on cinema screens in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood; Cartwright has retired from acting but cheerfully plugs her website, Angela Cartwright Studio, and a podcast she recently launched with her sister, Alien star Veronica Cartwright. But neither has had a role to eclipse The Sound of Music on their CV, and both are perfectly happy with that.“There was nowhere I could go in the world where people didn’t come up and always want to talk about it,” says Hammond. “People would have a story to tell of what the movie meant for them, what it meant for their grandmother, what it meant for their child. And the enormous impact that the film had on everybody meant that I felt it was a great responsibility to listen to those stories, and to always behave in a manner that didn’t let down the film. And, in a way, that didn’t let down people’s opinion of the characters in the film.”The Sound of Music at 60: a flawed but enduring cultural touchpointRead more“It is moving,” Cartwright says of the enduring fandom that follows the film, and her. “I try to go to the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles every year for the singalong screening. And when you stand up there in front of all those people that have come together to watch one movie, and we sing Edelweiss, and everybody sways back and forth with their phones, and you see all those lights – it’s tremendously moving and very, very special. Magical. You can’t jar something like that. It’s just a feeling. And I’m grateful that I’m able to let that sweep over me and appreciate it.”“To this day, if a flight attendant looks at my boarding pass and sees my name, they will want to tell me what the movie meant to them,” says Hammond. “That still happens all the time. That’s just part of who we are now, you know? We can’t do anything about that.”The Sound of Music is in cinemas from 20 September.Explore more on these topicsThe Sound of MusicJulie AndrewsMusicalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But is a $90m subterranean labyrinth, created by Herzog & de Meuron, really the answer?Oliver WainwrightFri 19 Sep 2025 09.36 EDTLast modified on Fri 19 Sep 2025 12.33 EDTShareAshimmering metallic wall slices through a scrubby mound on the edge of a highway inPhiladelphia, like a long steel blade cutting into the earth. Halfway along its length, this silvery barrier flips up, recalling the lid of a giant laptop, forming an entrance canopy that beckons you inside. As you ascend the planted knoll, you find great furrows gouged into the ground, jagged concrete sinkholes from which the peaks of colourful sculptures protrude.Welcome toCalder Gardens, an otherworldly place conceived by Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron to celebrate the work of Philadelphia-born Alexander Calder, master of mobiles. It is one of the strangest cultural complexes to be built anywhere in recent years. On an unpromising site no larger than a football pitch, wedged between two highways, a beguiling sequence of spaces take visitors on a journey of discovery deep into the ground. It is part barn, part cave and part rolling meadow, compressing a whole universe of different gallery types into one compact encounter.It seems very much tuned to our age of spectacle – the camp stagey quality can verge on Disneyish“I have never worked on anything like this before,” says 75-year-old Jacques Herzog, who hascreated numerous museums and galleries around the world, often reinventing the type each time. “There was literally no brief. I felt like an artist, waking up every morning without someone telling me what to do. Architecture is never this free.”There might not have been a defined brief, but the client certainly had strong opinions about what theydidn’twant. “I had no intention of making a museum,” says Sandy Rower, Calder’s grandson and president ofthe Calder Foundation, who steered the $90m project. “We wanted people to be able to sit in resonance with the work and have their own mysterious, unmediated experience. My grandfather wasn’t trying to predetermine the viewer’s reaction, so we don’t want to tell people what to think or feel.”View image in fullscreenInside and out … two works at Calder Gardens.Photograph: Oliver Wainwright/The GuardianThe project has been a long time coming. Born in 1898, Calder was the third generation in a lineage of esteemed Philadelphia artists. His grandfather sculptedthe statue of William Penn that crowns City Hall, while his father createda striking fountain of reclining river gods, marooned on a roundabout nearby. But the younger and most famous Calder left the city aged eight and – bar a big mobile in the main art museum – has never had much of a presence here, until now.His grandson describes the project as something of a spiritual quest. Rower has referred to the complex as a hypogeum, meaning an underground temple or tomb, calling it “a sacred space for self-cultivation” – and there is a ritualistic air to the place. Visitors are taken on a theatrical journey of compression and release, ushered through dark passages, then thrust into unexpectedly airy galleries, invited to peer around corners, perch in cubbies, and explore sunken gardens to discover the work on their own terms, with not a wall text in sight. The idea is not to ask when and how these sculptures were made, or what they might mean, but to submit yourself to a pure aesthetic encounter, communing with Calder’s moving creatures in this curious submerged menagerie. So does it work?View image in fullscreenIn the depths … a black mobile and a red stabile.Photograph: Iwan Baan/Herzog & de Meuron undefinedThe arrival sequence is worlds away from the nearby neoclassical cultural piles that linePhiladelphia’s Parkway Museum District– a misnomer for an inhospitable ribbon of highways, sliced through this part of the city in the 1960s. Once you have crossed 10 lanes of traffic, you arrive at a hilly garden (sadly ringed by an ugly chainlink fence) and ascend one of several winding paths, through what will one day grow into a lush display of perennials, laid out by Dutch celebrity plantsmanPiet Oudolf, finally reaching a circular plaza at the summit.Entering beneath the building’s sharp steel flap, you find yourself in a warm timber-lined lobby, with the feel of a domestically sized Apple Store. A bleacher staircase leads down to the first glimpse of a sunken gallery, where the contorted spidery limbs of one of Calder’s “stabiles” (what he called his static sculptures) stretch out in taut arcs. A mobile dangles above, hanging like a splatter of black paint, frozen in mid-air. The rumbling interstate highway can be briefly glimpsed through a long horizontal window, providing a reminder of the outside world that will soon be forgotten as you descend deeper into the Earth.Things start to get stranger at a second staircase, which winds down through what feels like a lava tube, lined with bubbling black sprayed concrete with the look of rugged basalt. A circular rupture gnawed through the wall provides a window on to another Calder mobile, hanging spotlit in the stygian gloom like a ghostly white tangle of coathangers. The dark stairs lead to a light-flooded central gallery, roofed by a polished plaster ceiling, which droops in a shallow bulge overhead, like the underside of a puddle. It adds a surreal, unsettling air, as if the weight of the ground above might burst through at any moment. One of Calder’s red steel animals writhes in the middle in twisted gymnastic curves, while more mobiles hang nearby, like flocks of angular birds.Windows on either side provide views of further contraptions. In one direction, a balancing black-and-red object stands imprisoned in a cylindrical concrete well. It is ringed by a dimly lit curved corridor gallery, where paintings and drawings hang on the raw foundation walls. A side niche presents another mobile against a seamless white backdrop, with the depthless quality of a photographic studio. Another purple-painted niche houses a sort of family altar, with works by Calder’s parents and grandfather. On the other side of the gallery, a door leads to the “vestigial garden”, where a memory of the site’s historic street pattern is summoned in the form of angular concrete forms jutting out into the courtyard, their surfaces scraped with a rough, rocky finish, as if freshly clawed from the earth. (Flood risk put paid to the possibility of using rammed earth; instead, concrete is used throughout to simulate stone and soil.)View image in fullscreenPerfectly framed … a ghostly mobile.Photograph: Iwan Baan/Herzog & de Meuron undefined“Calder’s work was about negative space,” says Herzog, “so our process was one of excavating and carving, rather than creating positive form. We see the project as an organism with different members, each with its distinct character, triggering unlikely situations. Otherwise things are too predictable.”There is a palpable restlessness on show throughout the complex. At times it can feel like too many ideas crammed into too small a space, a virtuosic display of Herzog & de Meuron’s greatest hits, populated by incidental Calders. It feels very much tuned to our impatient age of spectacle, and the camp, stagey quality can sometimes verge on Disneyish. You half expect to turn a corner and find an animatronic Calder bursting into a rendition ofIt’s a Small World, or his bones dramatically lit in a carved-out ossuary.‘A gilded temple to the new world order’: inside the former US embassy that is now a super-luxe hotelRead moreA bit more of the artist’s presence would help. The decision to omit captions entirely can be frustrating. Rower says he doesn’t want visitors to be staring at their phones, but without any kind of explanation of the work, you might resort to Google. “We are working on other forms of interpretation,” says Juana Berrío, director of programming. “Sometimes it will be music, or a sound bath beneath one of the sculptures, or collective singing. It’s about celebration, experimentation and real-time experience.” The loaned works will be on constant rotation, she adds, so each visit will offer something new.I left feeling entertained, but none the wiser about Calder. Perhaps that is what he would have wanted. “Theories may be all very well for the artist himself,” he once said, “but they shouldn’t be broadcast to other people.”There is a childlike wonder to Calder’s work, as there is to the building that Herzog & de Meuron has created to display it – even down to the loos, which wallow in a rich blue resinous soup. Kids will love exploring this labyrinthine place, just as they have stared in wonder at Calder’s mobiles for generations. Asthe artist once quipped: “My fanmail is enormous: everybody is under six.”Explore more on these topicsArchitecturePhiladelphiaHerzog & de MeuronfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’ve got the seemingly ordinary family with secrets: Ed Harris’s Vincent, spouse Sandy (Gabrielle Union) and her nerdy teenage son DJ (Miles J Harvey). There are the disrupters: Vincent’s ex-wife Ruth (Jennifer Coolidge), their errant son Rocco (Lewis Pullman) and his girlfriend Marina (Emanuela Postacchini), who spark revelations about Vincent’s former life. And there are the comic-relief mob killers, nicely underplayed by Bill Murray and Pete Davidson. But it’s Coolidge who is the film’s trump card: funny, profane, horny – and wonderfully disinclined to take the revenge plot in any way seriously.Sunday 21 September, Prime VideoElioView image in fullscreenHe’s the alien ambassador! … Elio (Yonas Kibreab) and Glordon (Remy Edgerly) in Elio.Photograph: PixarThe latest from the Pixar factory is another chipper animation, a sci-fi adventure that serves up big doses of Spielbergian wonder and DayGlo visuals.

With its ornate dialogue and lavish period flourishes, the essence of Knight is so strong in this drama that it approaches self-parody. It tells the story of the aftermath of the death of Benjamin Guinness in 1868, whose passing leaves a vacuum to be filled by some combination of his four dissolute, complacent, scheming children. Meanwhile, outside their inheritance battle, Irish republicanism is stirring.

Or, to put it another way, is there now enough reasonable doubt to declare her conviction unsafe? This documentary’s answer to the second question could hardly be clearer: yes.Letby was declared to be the biggest child serial killer in modern Britain, though she could yet go down in history as the subject of our era’s most serious miscarriage of justice. Public opinion, media mythology and the law turn as slowly as an oil tanker. Letby could walk free … or she could end up the subject of unending and fruitless debate, in a kind of permanent standoff with her accusers, like theMenendez brothers in the US, contentiously convicted of killing their parents in 1989 and still in prison.The film shows the struggle of Letby’s voluble and media-savvy barrister Mark McDonald to bring her case in front of the Criminal Cases Review Commission to have it sent back to the court of appeal – a process which is continuing. Among the interviewees on Letby’s side are Private Eye’s investigative reporter Dr Phil Hammond and the Toronto neonatal expert Dr Shoo Lee, some of many convinced that the conviction is unsafe. The Mail on Sunday columnist Peter Hitchens, a vehement commentator on the case, is glimpsed here at a press conference, but not interviewed. And on the prosecution’s side there is the expert witness Dr Dewi Evans, whose testimony was so important.Letby, a former neonatal nurse at Chester hospital who was convicted in 2023 of seven murders of infants and the attempted murder of seven more, was at the centre of a trial that focused on the sensational handwritten Post-it notes recovered from her house in which she appeared to confess her guilt, and which surely swayed the jury. She claimed these were merely imaginary cathartic exercises encouraged by a counsellor (it is a fault of this film that it does not more closely examine the process of this counselling.)Daniel Bogado’s documentary, which is due to be shown in two-episode form onChannel 4, focuses on the overwhelming importance of Dr Evans, the prosecution’s expert witness who was dramatically convinced of Letby’s guilt early in the process. Dr Evans himself, extensively interviewed in this film, is an experienced health practitioner and proud Welshman who is of the view that the current campaign is a London-based media stitch-up to put him and his expertise on trial. He calls Letby’s defenders the “Great Metropolitan Elite” or “God’s Most Entitled”. And in fact it is perfectly possible to feel sympathy for Dr Evans due to the abuse which he receives. The film also interviews anonymous parents whose infant was transferred away from Chester hospital and now believe that their child’s survival is due to escaping Letby.The convictions of Lucy Letby: should they be overturned?Read moreAs for Letby herself, she is a blond, blue-eyed former nurse who was once chosen as the face of the hospital PR campaign, and these are the qualities that might have made her the subject of prurient media fascination in the first place. But they might also have done her current campaign no harm; the film does not offer an opinion on that. But it certainly presents a very coherent argument in the case of each infant death that what could well have happened was incompetence and mishap; the all-important pattern of mysterious and questionable deaths, so easily attributable to a single malign person, could as easily be the result of systemic underfunding, understaffing or mismanagement. As Dr Hammond says: we don’t want to believe that it could happen in our NHS, so we blame an individual.None of this solves the issue of guilt; the argument merely addresses the onus of proof. It is conceivable that the conviction was only partly faulty. Everyone involved here makes it clear they have utmost respect for the feelings for the bereaved parents, and declare that getting at the truth will help them in the long run. That may or may not be accurate; what remains to be seen is whether the Letby debate leads to an increase in the standards of neonatal care.Conviction: The Case of Lucy Letby is in UK cinemas from 19 September, and on Channel 4 on 29 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsLucy LetbyChannel 4Television industryreviewsShareReuse this content"

This package offers a reissue of two episodes, about 50 minutes each, from the first 1965 season of Thunderbirds, the sci-fi/adventure series performed entirely with puppets and scale-model sets, a format that creators Gerry and Sylvia Anderson called “Supermarionation”. Most readers will probably already be familiar with the basic premise, but for gen Z and Alpha types out there, the idea is that the all-male Tracy family, led by former astronaut paterfamilias Jeff (voiced by Peter Dyneley), operate a private international rescue business with mysteriously unclear sources of funding that sends various super hi-tech vehicles (the titular Thunderbirds) to bail out people in jeopardy. Indeed kids, this is what inspiredTrey Parker and Matt Stone’s spoof movie Team America: World Police.In Trapped in the Sky, an evil Asian supervillain called the Hood plants a bomb on a Concorde-like supersonic plane making its maiden voyage so that he can lure out the Thunderbirds and thereby study their mechanics in order to sell them on. It’s a delightful hark back to an era when industrial espionage just involved covert photography rather than hardcore hacking and intellectual property law. Also, this episode contains posh spy totty extraordinaire Lady Penelope (voiced by Sylvia Anderson herself), and her trusty manservant Parker (David Graham) with his almost prehensile bushy eyebrows. (Parker has to stand up coachloads of guests to Penelope’s stately home in order to help out with the rescue, a shocking violation of etiquette, but needs must.)In the second, even better, episode, Terror in New York City, the Tracys must help rescue some pesky but hapless journalists who fall into a fissure in the ground when – get this – the authorities decide to move the Empire State Building 200 yards to the side in order that redevelopment of the area can go ahead. It’s a mad scheme that onlylegendary NYC city planner Robert Mosescould love, but not a single character questions the initial idea for a moment, even when it all goes disastrously wrong.These crisp remastered versions allow us to really appreciate the quality of the effects, which are so persuasive and intricately detailed you soon almost forget that you are watching models. But those sneaky little black strings always give it away, little reminders of the means of production that in fact makes it all the more endearing. Moreover, the costume and set design is especially swoon-worthy for fans of retro fashion (in those days, just fashion), especially the nifty lapel-less, cropped, double-breasted sports jackets the men wear and the orientalist loungewear favoured by the ladies. Aspiring designers are advised to take notes and execute a little industrial espionage of their own.Thunderbirds: Trapped in the Sky/Terror in New York City are in cinemas from 20 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsScience fiction TVTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Inviting experimental music eminences – Steve Noble, Elaine Mitchener, Maggie Nicols – to play alongside younger generations, Grain nights feature Laird and Williams as the still points of this constantly turning little world. The duo also perform as Crosspiece (recently as support for UK band Caroline) with Laird’s serene focus a foil to Williams’s rougher, busier sounds.Laird has previously recorded with Loraine James, and has played alongside Mica Levi and Tirzah. Her improvised work is concerned primarily with breaking language, then remaking it. That’s reflected in Goodness, her full-length debut as Feeo, as a capacity to work with extreme conviction without disrupting the delicate atmospheres around her. On this fairly still and grounded album, every syllable feels cared for, every utterance close and alive in the mix. Emerging from a London underground enamoured of submerged, grimy sounds, it feels like gulping clean, crisp air.All manner of horizontally stretched textures – blemishing drones, light beats, uneven synth and piano figures, and Williams on guitars, bass and baritone – accompany Laird’s vocals. Their beauty belies a lyricist of poetic intrigue, of colours and bodies on the intensely simmering single The Mountain, and emotional insight. On Here, a mid-album highlight, Laird pleads with a lover to run away from a brutal city that has twisted both of them out of shape. “This place was built to last,” she sings. “It wasn’t built for love.”Hugh MorrisThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenJazz-fusion freak-out … Thundercat.Photograph: Eddie AlcazarThundercat – Children of the Baked Potato ft Remi Wolf“When it’s all said and done, I did it for my health,” Thundercat croons – before a classic Brainfeeder jazz-fusion freak-out that doesn’t suggest retiring to the seaside with a blanket on your lap.Hannah Frances – Life’s Work“Learning to trust in spite of it” – namely love’s inevitable demise – “is life’s work,” the Vermont songwriter sings, her run-on lyrics blazing with purpose as a muted New Orleans-y rumpus creeps up on her.Claire Rousay – Somewhat BurdensomeIt’s slowcore season, time to dust off your Yo La Tengo records – and add the Canadian-American sound artist’s gorgeously moody guitar wanderings to the rotation.

Returning after nine years away, ‘it’s a different world’, they sayLouis PattisonFri 19 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTShare‘You guys would freak out if you drove down Grand Avenue now,” says Tortoise multi-instrumentalist Dan Bitney. These days, this major Chicago thoroughfare is looking pretty bougie. “Expensive flower stores, bakeries, cafes. Back when we were there, it was empty streets, motorcycle gangs.” He shakes his head at his expat bandmates. “It’s a different world, you know?”At the dawn of the 1990s, Chicago was down on its luck. A long depression and a declining manufacturing sector had left parts of the city a ghost town – not great conditions if you wanted to open an expensive flower store, but a pretty great place to start a band. It was 1991 when bassist Doug McCombs and drummer John Herndon moved into a 40,000 sq ft warehouse space off Grand Avenue. The pair had started Tortoise the year before, initially conceiving the project as a freelance rhythm section in the vein of reggae duo Sly and Robbie. “The idea was we’d play with our friends – like session musicians, except not getting paid,” says McCombs.“We’d play for a frozen burrito,” adds Herndon, laughing.View image in fullscreenTortoise in about 1997: (L-R) David Pajo, Doug McCombs, John McEntire, Dan Bitney and John Herndon.Photograph: Andy Willsher/RedfernsTheir loft home became a rehearsal space, and they started inviting other musicians to join them, building a soundproof room for sessions. “You could be blasting and someone could be having a nap next door,” says Herndon.“But, to be soundproof, it also had to be air-proof,” adds McCombs. “It was like a sauna.”From this hothouse, incredible sounds emerged. Tortoise’s early records proposed a radical new way of making music: informed by the ethics and mindset of indie rock, but technologically advanced, with ears wide open. In 1996, they released the elegant, oceanic Millions Now Living Will Never Die, which had myriad influences swirling in its depths: dub reggae and Krautrock, musique concrète and classical minimalism, all flowing into one.Tortoise were innovators, but their music also reflected the city around them. As well as cheap rents, Chicago had a diverse cultural infrastructure – from rock venues and dance clubs to more august institutions such as the Art Institute of Chicago and theavant garde contemporary community AACM. “It was really diverse,” agrees McCombs. “There were a lot of people into those different types of music, all cross-pollinating.”Gradually, the lineup that has sustained Tortoise for the past 25 years took shape. John McEntire, a percussion major from the prestigious music conservatory Oberlin College, brought marimba, vibraphone and a knowledge of cutting-edge production techniques. Jeff Parker, a Berklee-educated jazz guitarist with a beautifully languorous style, joined the group shortly before the recording of 1997’s TNT.They also took influences from dance music. In parallel to Tortoise, Herndon was moonlighting as part of Deadly Dragon Sound System, a DJ collective that would spin dub and dancehall vinyl at Chicago venue the Empty Bottle. He recalls the band’s first trip to London, where a friend introduced them to jungle via pirate radio. “I was immediately attracted to it – it seemed so insane,” says Herndon. “The crazy editing, this dude on the mic yelling things – I’d never heard anything like it.”Everything Tortoise heard, they folded into their music – a forward-thinking approach that saw them heralded as US emissaries of a new sound: post-rock. It’s a genre name the group never warmed to, but grudgingly recognise. “In some ideal utopian world, you wouldn’t describe music in those terms,” says McCombs, with a grimace. “But that’s not the way human minds work. People want a frame of reference.”These days, only McCombs and Bitney remain in Chicago; Parker and John Herndon are in Los Angeles, while McEntire lives in Portland. Herndon left for family-related reasons. (His sons have followed in his footsteps: Hollis is viral rapper 2hollis, who has 4.1m monthly Spotify listeners where Tortoise have 115k, , and Angus is in hardcore band Start Today.) But the slow creep of gentrification also played a role. “Everything was starting to be corporate-sponsored or arts-funded and, if you weren’t in cahoots with the right people, you weren’t making money,” says McEntire, who left for California in 2018. “It was getting harder to make a living in the community without making compromises that I was at odds with.”Next month, Tortoise release their first album in nine years, Touch. That gap is attributable to several factors – distance, competing schedules, the lack of a consistent place to record (traditionally, Tortoise recorded at McEntire’s Soma Electronic Music Studios, but he scaled it back after his move to Portland). They began recording in 2021, bouncing files back and forth. “But we discovered we’re not really remote collaborators,” said McEntire. Instead, everyone worked on demos at home, then met up to chisel away at them in Los Angeles, Portland and Chicago, crammed in whenever schedules allowed. “It wasn’t until the last session that we were able to put everything into one big batch and see it all together, even though it wasn’t finished,” says McEntire. “Something came into focus – although I couldn’t tell you why, exactly.”That final session was a homecoming of sorts, taking place at Electrical Audio – the Chicago studio founded by their late friend, the musician and audio engineerSteve Albini. Like Albini, Tortoise emerged from an 80s underground rock community characterised by DIY self-reliance. McEntire reveals that Albini recorded the first album he ever played on, Diablo Guapo by noise-rockers Bastro (“I don’t think I ever knew that,” remarks Parker). He attests to Albini’s generosity. “Even before I had really established myself as a producer, I could come at him with some sort of technical question and he would write me back, like, a two-page email. That was a hallmark of his character.”View image in fullscreenJeff Parker and John Herndon perform at Matadero in Madrid, Spain, in 2012.Photograph: Mariano Regidor/RedfernsNotoriously, Albini expounded a distinctly no-frills analogue recording approach. McEntire, meanwhile, was an early adopter of digital-editing software Pro Tools, using it to splice togetherfin de siècleexperimental landmarks like Tortoise’s TNT, andThe Fawnby another of his bands, the Sea and Cake. “Foundationally, where we came from is extremely similar, even though we diverged in our methodology,” says McEntire of Albini. “He remained a pretty strict documentarian. And my process became kind of the opposite of that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

A sense of playful hybridity runs through Touch – from the sci-fi spaghetti western soundscaping of Vexations to the pulsating man-machine techno of Elka. It also extends to the album’s cover art, a collage by the artistPaw Grabowskithat foregrounds a metal scorpion sculpted by McEntire’s father, a mechanic and welder. “Why he made it, I have no idea,” says McEntire. “He made exactly two sculptures in his life. He always had like a dozen little projects going at any given time, but …totallyrandom.”Even when scattered across the US, Tortoise retain an umbilical link to Chicago. Following seven albums for Thrill Jockey, Touch marks the band’s first studio album for another label, the Chicago-based jazz outfitInternational Anthem. Discussing the move, McCombs looks pained. Thrill Jockey founder Bettina Richards “is a very old friend of mine, so it was a really hard decision to make. Ultimately, it just felt like we needed to try something different.”Parker has the deepest relationship with International Anthem, home to a string of his solo and ensemble records as well as collaborations with label staples such as drummer and producer Makaya McCraven. He developed a close friendship with the label’s founders, Scottie McNiece and David Allen, in the process. “Those guys are a generation younger than us. They came up listening to Tortoise – had a kind of reverence for our band. One day, Scottie was like, ‘Man, I would really like to work a Tortoise record.’” Parker and the band met him in LA. “And it felt good,” says Parker. “It’s been cool working with musicians who came up listening to things I’ve been involved with, and are conceptually very simpatico.”View image in fullscreenDan Bitney performing with Tortoise at All Tomorrow’s Parties in 2004.Photograph: Edd Westmacott/AlamyIt’s a mark of Tortoise’s enduring influence that their music is being discovered by younger generations. McEntire enthuses about British bandSquid, who enlisted him to mix their albumsO Monolithand Cowards. “At university, we’d often nerd out over the crisp and singular style of John’s mixing – particularly the drums in Tortoise’s Djed,” says Squid’s Ollie Judge. “He’s a hero – and now a friend, which is still very surreal.”Parker, meanwhile, has a fan in formerBlack Midi frontman Geordie Greep, who contacted him before his Los Angeles show in May. “I was not familiar with his music,” says Parker. “But I put together a trio to open for him, playing this crazy, improvised electro-acoustic music. Geordie and his band really dug it, and the audience was there with us the whole time.”The evolution of Steve Albini: ‘If the dumbest person is on your side, you’re on the wrong side’Read moreAn early Tortoise concept, McEntire explains, was that its music would be “malleable” – designed to be remixed, recontextualised or deconstructed. The group will test this idea again in November when they play a home town show with the Chicago Philharmonic. Parker, assisted by some of Tortoise’s friends – among them, Sean O’Hagan of the High Llamas, Nate Walcott of Bright Eyes and Brian Wilson’s former musical director, Paul Von Mertens – are in the process of arranging Touch and other back catalogue highlights.You could say that this attitude – an openness to chance, a drive to look at their music from a fresh angle – is what’s sustained Tortoise all these years. But they probably wouldn’t overthink it. “Eighty-five percent of Tortoise records are made with four of us sitting on a couch listening to shit, throwing out ideas to John,” says McCombs. “Sometimes, it turns into something we like to listen to,” says McEntire. “It’s whatever the music dictates.”Touchis released via International Anthem on 24 OctoberExplore more on these topicsMusicIndieExperimental musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But to judge from this impressive collection of five works by Schoenberg, all recorded at concerts in the Berlin Philharmonie between 2019 and last year, Kirill Petrenko is already exploring the composer far more thoroughly than any of his predecessors.Petrenko’s set does include some of Schoenberg’s best known works. There’s the string sextet Verklärte Nacht in its sumptuous string-orchestra expansion, and the Chamber Symphony No 1, thankfully not in the late orchestral version that blurs the acerbic textures and robs the instrumental writing of its muscularity, but in the original scoring for 15 solo instruments. And a superb account of the Violin Concerto, in which the soloist, Patricia Kopatchinskaja, turns what can sometimes seem a rather four-square, dutifully conventional piece into something constantly surprising, and the Variations for Orchestra, with each event vividly, fiercely characterised.View image in fullscreenBerliner Philharmoniker/Kirill Petrenko: Arnold Schoenberg.Photograph: BPHR/Peter HalleyBut there are already fine versions of all these works in the CD catalogue; it’s the recording of Die Jakobsleiter (Jacob’s Ladder), the first new version of the oratorio fragment in more than 20 years, that makes this release so compelling. Composed between 1915 and 1925, it was originally intended as the first half of a much larger work exploring spiritual transcendence in an earthly existence. But the project obsessed Schoenberg for much of his life, like his other great biblical epic, the opera Moses und Aron, he failed to complete the task, and it was left to one of his pupils, Winfried Zillig, to create a performing score out of what he had composed.But as Petrenko’s magnificent performance shows, the score contains some of Schoenberg’s most powerful and impressive music, composed at a time when he was moving away from free atonality towards his first 12-note scores, and often more dramatic and theatrical than anything in Moses und Aron. It helps that Petrenko has a first-rate octet of soloists, led by the baritone Wolfgang Koch as Gabriel, but the sense he believes in the quality of every bar is inescapable.Explore more on these topicsArnold SchoenbergClassical musicBerlin Philharmonicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

But she could also conjure up a dream world of her own that listeners would willingly follow her into. Her new album, Oh Snap, is a set of 12 originals and one cover that she created on her own over four years, before adding her band. She experimented for the first time with computer-generated sounds to draw on grungy pop and intimate folk music and expand on the classical-vocal education and extensive jazz input she acquired while living in France in the 2000s. Salvant says her enthusiasms as a visual artist also liberated her for this adventurous step-change.The opening I Am a Volcano is a diaphanous vocal that builds intensity against a drum loop, while Anything But Now – themed around procrastination – is a breezy jazz swinger featuring freewheeling pianist Sullivan Fortner. Take This Stone, featuring Salvant’s folksy harmonising with favourite fellow singers June McDoom and Kate Davis, is a standout – as isWhat Does Blue Mean to You, a brushes-cushioned, quietly conversational and then starkly soul-wailing epiphany inspired by Toni Morrison’s Beloved. The meditative, pandemic-induced Expanse, the playful Auto-Tuned electro-pop of A Little Bit More and theskipping, scampering synth-hooked title trackall show how ingeniously and fearlessly this remarkable artist can reinvent herself.Also out this monthDistant geography and other ventures have periodically silenced 2009 Mercury nomineesLed Bib, the unique UK band led by expat American drummer Mark Holub – but Hotel Pupik (Cuneiform) returns to strip the lineup down to just two saxes, bass and drums, and recaptures much of their original directness in the tracks such as the polyrhythmic, raw Iron Ore, and the ensemble spontaneity of the long, hypnotically bass-thundering title track.

It’s early 1963, and Dax, a travel writer, is in his Sussex cottage working on his latest book, struggling with emotional baggage and yearning for his MI6 handler and sometime girlfriend, Faith Green. She persuades him to go to Guatemala to check out the popular leftwing leader who is threatening to topple the country’s CIA-backed government, but Dax is forced to flee when things go seriously awry. He ends up being sent to West Berlin to gather intelligence on a possible assassin, whose arrival in West Germany just before the visit of US president John F Kennedy may not be coincidental. Beautifully crafted, with echoes of le Carré, Greene and Forsyth, this is a superb evocation of a vanished world, seen through the eyes of a relatably hapless accidental hero.View image in fullscreenThe Killer Questionby Janice Hallett (Viper, £18.99)Hallett’s latest centres on that staple of British social life, the pub quiz, and like its predecessors it’s told in emails, WhatsApp messages, texts and transcripts. We know from the start that things haven’t gone well for pub landlords Sue and Mal Eastwood: their nephew is pitching a true crime documentary to Netflix, promising “intrigue, tension, betrayal, deception and … murder”. Rewind to five years earlier: Sue and Mal, desperate to keep their struggling business afloat, are pleased at the arrival of a new quiz team. However, the Shadow Knights proceed to sweep the board every week, prompting accusations of cheating. So far, so nerdy – but when the body of someone already outed as a quiz cheat is discovered in a nearby river, things take a darker turn. Some suspension of disbelief is necessary – why Sue and Mal chose to communicate via WhatsApp rather than talking to each other is unclear – but Hallett is a master of misdirection, and this plot is up there with her fiendishly clever best.View image in fullscreenThe Impossible Fortuneby Richard Osman (Viking, £22)The fifth novel in Osman’s bestselling Thursday Murder Club series sees crime-solving pensioners Elizabeth, Joyce, Ibrahim and Ron engaging with secret codes, drug dealers, impecunious aristocrats and cryptocurrency, with assistance from former cocaine queenpin Connie, friendly cop Donna, Bogdan the handyman and Ron’s clever nine-year-old grandson. Although still grieving for her husband, Elizabeth steps up when Nick, the best man at Joyce’s daughter’s wedding, confides that somebody is trying to kill him. Nick and his business partner Holly own a high-security storage facility and once accepted a payment in bitcoin, the value of which has risen to £350m. They want to cash out, but the money is protected by two codes, and as Nick and Holly have one each, neither can access it alone. When Nick disappears, the quartet gets on the case. The central mystery is a satisfactory head-scratcher, but the true pleasure is a gently humorous read, peopled with characters who feel like old friends.View image in fullscreen59 Minutesby Holly Seddon (Orion, £10.99)Seddon’s seventh novel is a high-concept, inhale-at-a-sitting tour de force. On a Friday afternoon in November, the announcement of an imminent nuclear strike on southern England – just 59 minutes until impact – causes instant chaos. The public are told to seek immediate shelter, but Carrie, stuck in a crowd of panicked commuters at Waterloo station, is desperate to get home to her family. Frankie and Otis, on a romantic minibreak in Devon, are trying to find enough supplies to sustain them until it’s safe to leave their rented cottage, but the queue at the local store soon degenerates into a melee, with worse to follow. As the clock ticks down, Seddon paints a terrifyingly convincing picture of what happens when everything we take for granted breaks down in a matter of seconds, as well as creating characters you’ll be rooting for and keeping up a breakneck pace with a plot that twists, turns, and – without giving too much away – somersaults back on itself.View image in fullscreenDeadman’s Poolby Kate Rhodes (Orenda, £9.99)The eighth novel in Rhodes’s splendid series set on the Isles of Scilly begins when DI Ben Kitto’s dog discovers the remains of an emaciated girl on the uninhabited island of St Helen’s. Kitto and his colleagues are baffled: no one has been reported missing, and rumours about rich islanders being involved in a people-smuggling conspiracy are dismissed as the imaginings of bored schoolkids. Kitto’s narrative is interspersed with that of Mai, a Vietnamese girl who is being held captive in a basement, alone now that her younger sister and her baby – the result of rape by her captor – have been taken away. And when a tiny baby is found abandoned at the police station, the race is on to find the mother before it’s too late. An atmospheric and moving depiction of a tightly knit community in a rugged and often dangerous landscape, Deadman’s Pool is tense and deftly plotted, the pathos fuelling true suspense.Mick Herron and Richard Osman: Crime, Comedy and the Art of the PlotOn Tuesday 23 September, join Mick Herron, Richard Osman and Alex Clark for an insightful discussion about their new books, Clown Town and The Impossible Fortune, live at Cadogan Hall, London and livestreamed.

I secretly believed that Rivendell was based on that house, which it clearly wasn’t.My favourite book growing upImpossible. I’m inconstant, so it was whatever I was reading at the time. Let’s say Finn Family Moomintroll, which is the most perfect of Tove Jansson’s lovely (and occasionally frankly terrifying) Moomin books.The book that changed me as a teenagerGreat Expectations byCharles Dickens, at 14. I loathed it. It nearly turned me off reading for ever. Everyone kept telling me it was a masterpiece and I just couldn’t understand why [school would] set a book about being an alienated child for a bunch of teenagers. “Yes, I know adults are incomprehensible and other people make no sense and loneliness is awful. Why do I need to read about it?”The writer who changed my mindTan Twan Eng. The Garden of Evening Mists is a stunning novel – jaw-dropping, beautiful, intricate, elegant, powerful, touching – and made me see how books about terrible things can be uplifting to the point of transcendent. As I type that it seems obvious, but it wasn’t obvious to me then.The book that made me want to be a writerAh. That one’s a little bit tricky, because I’ve always been immersed in writing. I can tell you that Cloud Atlas byDavid Mitchellis so good that it infuriated me into starting a new novel, and that everything I’ve read by Michael Chabon has filled me with a furious creative envy that makes me work harder. Jeanette Winterson is some kind of perfect dreamer; Anne Carson and Colson Whitehead always make me feel like I should be wilder, wiser and better. But perhaps the honour has to go to A Murder of Quality by John le Carré. My father gave me a leather-bound copy when I was very young, and the smell of the pages and the beauty of the object itself made me believe in the magic of words.The bookI came back toWe’re back with Great Expectations. It really is a brilliant book, but we shouldn’t force it on teenagers. That’s not to say they shouldn’t read it if they want to. But just because it’s about young people doesn’t mean it’s written for them; it’s written for the rest of us remembering who we were.The book I rereadThe Hound of the Baskervilles byArthur Conan Doyle. I read it as a child and scared myself sleepless, then at university and chuckled at my tween fear, and again more recently, conscious at last not of the monstrosity of the hound, but the astounding cruelty of its master.The book I could never read againAlmost every book I read for fun between seven and 17. I actually don’t remember what they were, so I can’t name and shame, but that is some kind of judgment in itself. To highlight instead some of the notable exceptions: Susan Cooper’s Dark Is Rising sequence, Patricia McKillip’s harpist trilogy, and all thingsWilliam Gibson.The book I discovered later in lifeLabyrinths by Jorge Luis Borges.The book I am currently readingMatt Wixey’s Basilisk. And, with my kids, I’m reading the latest Amari Peters book, Amari and the Despicable Wonders by BB Alston. It’s very tense and I don’t know how she can possibly win through!My comfort readSpook Country by William Gibson, who I mentioned earlier, of course, but this is one of his later books and for me it’s just superb. The audiobook, read by Robertson Dean, is also a gem.

Elite schools (Collegiate, Vassar, NYU); sleepovers with Sean Lennon and a cast of New York’s nepo who’s who; hanging out with Michael Jackson; the abundant creative freedom gifted by the safety net of generational wealth. It would be enough to make many readers roll their eyes before turning a single page. Their loss.Ronson’s talent as a writer enables him to render this privilege, the background glamour, his awkward stumbles as well as successes, with a kind of wry, soft self-deprecation that is genuinely endearing. It helps, of course, that he is a massive nerd. “I had the rhythm to play the music, but not the confidence to let go,” he writes in that throwaway line about dancing. It’s both deeply revealing and hard to get your head around. Ronson would rather spend paragraphs enthusing about the thickness of slipmats required for a specific DJ setup than he would recalling the wild-eyed buzz generated at an afterparty close to dawn. On balance, this is a good thing. There is more than enough bad writing on hedonism in the world. I’ll take the earnest, qualitative review of turntable cartridges.This is not supposed to be a definitive history of 90s club culture, but it’s a vivid snapshot told from a unique perspectiveIn Night People, the debauchery – of the best and worst kind – is alluded to rather than gratuitously revelled in. There are passing references to taking heroin (wait,what?) and late nights dieting on a menu of uppers and vodka cranberry, but without the detail that could tip into cliche. Instead, Ronson is faithfully reverent to the many people who helped a gawky Jewish, London-born hip-hop fan from the Upper West Side to become synonymous with the 90s celebrity-model party scene. It’s not an era of New York nightlife that has been particularly eulogised. Understandable, given it was preceded by the white-hot energy of the 70s and 80s and, I suppose, because it’s difficult to romanticise a period during which dancefloors began to give way to velvet-roped club lounges, bottle service and a scene built around being seen.Still, Ronson gives it a great shot. The impact of mayor Rudy Giuliani’s crackdown on crime and clean up of the city is told through the lens of its night-dwellers. The east coast-west coast hip-hop rivalry is documented through the many characters that kept the city hyped. It’s not supposed to be a definitive history of 90s club culture, though Ronson interviewed dozens of friends, DJs, bouncers, promoters and clubbers to help piece together his memories. But it’s a vivid social and cultural snapshot.The one-man hit factory, the force who famously drove Amy Winehouse to create her best work, the mega producer who just celebrated his 50th birthday – none of that is here, of course. At the centre of this book is a Ronson much closer to the teenage crate-digger whose mum bought him his first Technics turntables and who blagged his way to the booth. It shouldn’t be as compelling as it is, but for the accompanying soundtrack of deep cuts alone, Night People is well worth a spin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Almost 30 years since its first production, I can still recall the chill that came across Rae Smith’s snug set, hear the humorous sneer in the line “the Harp drinkers” and sense the despair beneath the banter.McPherson’s aptitude for atmosphere was later deployed in his Bob Dylan musicalGirl from the North Country, set during the Great Depression, and will be tested when he evokes the dystopian Panem foran immersive version of The Hunger Games. But first here is The Weir, back for another round, designed again by Smith and this time directed by McPherson in a revival of such exactness it appears effortless.The headline star is Brendan Gleesonbut The Weir is an ensemble: its characters are on different frequencies yet see each other for who they are. That goes for the locals as well as a stranger like Valerie, relocating from Dublin as a “blow-in” while literal gales whistle outside in Gregory Clarke’s sound design. Her arrival prompts a troubling exchange of tall tales, dreams, memories and confessions but McPherson judiciously uses humour to clear the air between them. Much like a weir, the effect is simultaneously of free flow and stillness.View image in fullscreenBarnstorming … Tom Vaughan-Lawlor, right, with Seán McGinley in The Weir.Photograph: Rich GilliganTo tell a story is to make yourself vulnerable. Each teller here has their own style but seeks reassurance from their listeners. With knotted brow, Gleeson’s Jack first unsteadily threads together a bit of local folklore but also gives the aching closer, aKrapp-like remembranceof romance unseized in youth that has dogged him daily since. It’s heightened by Gleeson’s age (he is 70, the character is written as in his 50s) and by coming at the end of a performance rich with quips (“That fella’d peel a banana in his pocket”) and perplexed grimaces (starting with a lovely bit of physical comedy with a bar tap).Finbar is altogether more of a raconteur. Tom Vaughan-Lawlor plays him as equal parts theatrical showman and school-class showoff in a caffeinated, barnstorming performance that you initially fear will overwhelm the others – but proves irresistible. Each line comes with a lick of the lips, a pointed finger or a boxer’s footwork, yet Vaughan-Lawlor keenly reveals Finbar’s insecurities and sense of absence.View image in fullscreenCool and bemused … Kate Phillips as Valerie.Photograph: Rich GilliganThen there’s Jim, played by the wonderful Seán McGinley, also significantly older than his character was envisioned by McPherson. His lengthy grave-digging tale is all the more compelling coming from this sleepy-seeming onlooker who elsewhere can raise a laugh with the briefest of utterances. (Much humour comes in the play’s pregnant pauses, too.)Cheers to The Weir! What makes Conor McPherson’s mysterious pub drama so mesmerising?Read moreThe only British actor in the cast is Kate Phillips, emphasising Valerie’s outsider status. She is coolly bemused by the men before delivering a painful account that shares unsettling similarities with the others: defenceless children, uncanny noises, altered states. Phillips makes clear that it’s a story Valerie is still getting used to telling, aware it will define her.Owen McDonnell harbours heaviness as barkeeper Brendan, keeping himself busy with routines that bring a comfort akin to Finbar superstitiously preparing the stock for banquets at his businesses. Weddings and funerals are all part of the talk but it’s tiny day-to-day kindnesses that define these lives in a room dimly lit by Mark Henderson to evoke personal isolation and the blanket darkness of rural night.You wouldn’t want to match them drink for drink but all five characters stay with you: it’s an endlessly rewarding evening that proves McPherson’s play is built to last.AtHarold Pinter theatre, London, until 6 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreConor McPhersonBrendan GleesonWest EndreviewsShareReuse this content"

On the other: a Steinway concert grand piano. Such juxtapositions are typical ofBold Tendencies, the groundbreaking arts organisation based in Peckham Multi-Storey car park, which programmes a wide array of performances in its concrete concert hall a few minutes’ walk from the vivid scruffiness of the south London high street and a busy railway line.Commissioned by Bold Tendencies, the world premiere of Garland,Oliver Leith’s large-scale “processional work”, fitted right into its world of equivocal, self-conscious semi-gentrification. Leith, the composer of the critically acclaimedLast Days, begins his hour-long piece with hymn-like piano chords and someone whistling a descant. Then the two tubas of an expanded12 Ensembleentered with a hefty bass pedal, cueing the first of many slow journeys across the stage travelled by a community choir, the Bold Chorus, and professional vocal ensemble Exaudi. Initially they smiled and chattered before standing to join the pseudo-hymn, their sound warm and wholehearted. Later, grim-faced, they trailed thin ropes of bells, blew through straws, spun whirly tubes, and dragged planks of wood and lengths of aluminium tubing. A couple of singers pushed supermarket trolleys full of glass bottles, shaking them as commanded by scores propped on the child seats.These beguiling sounds counterpointed the often voluptuous tone of 12 Ensemble’s strings – at close quarters and as the procession continued out of sight, behind the audience. One memorable passage felt like being in a bell tower as the changes are rung, the entire concrete structure made wildly, ecstatically resonant. There were also solos from sopranoPatricia Auchterlonie(often stunningly controlled crescendos and blistering releases of her laser-like upper register), a dramatised switch of onstage conductors fromJack SheentoNaomi Woo, and a horse steered reluctantly across the stage. On its second pass, it led off the singers, clattering away as the final chord echoed.Charlie Fox’s text was largely inaudible, its narrative lost. Instead, Garland was an extravagantly immersive staging of sound in motion.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicPeckhamreviewsShareReuse this content"

The focus is on displaced minors, some of whom are German, others Slavic. There is talk of a third category of “special” children who were stolen by the Nazis as part of their campaign to create a breed of Aryan “pure bloods”. This, we hear, consisted of abducting mostly Slavic children and habilitating them into German families – if they met the “genetic” requirements.Young Thomas is among this category, his previous Polish identity having been erased. He was given a new name, mother, tongue and Bavarian home, but we meet him as he is torn from this second, adoptive family to become a temporary charge of Ruth (Juliet Stevenson), a UN relief worker working with the American forces to return the children to their original towns, villages and homes.When he turns up at her door in London 45 years later, demanding an explanation, Ruth takes the adult Thomas (Tom Wlaschiha) into her investigations of his family history in the direct aftermath of war.Stevenson gives a typically muscular performance, but it is Artie Wilkinson-Hunt, playing the young Thomas on press night, who well and truly steals the show. Under the direction of Stephen Daldry (who famously elicited a superb performance from Jamie Bellin Billy Elliot), he is an initially angry, mercurial and fearless force in the lives of Ruth and the GIs. Wilkinson-Hunt is an absolute whirlwind, baleful, melancholy and tender by turns. A star in the making, without a doubt.View image in fullscreenAn absolute whirlwind … Artie Wilkinson-Hunt, front, as young Thomas in The Land of the Living.Photograph: Manuel HarlanEverything seems lined up for a captivating production, from the strength of the cast to Miriam Buether’s original and intricate traverse set, which has a kitchen at one end, representing the present, and a bookcase and piano at the other, which takes us back to 1945. The ground in between is filled with scenes from the past, set beside the present as we travel into the mystery of Thomas’s heritage and displacement and his anger at Ruth.Yet the pace is too slow (almost three hours) and the characters around Ruth are generic, from the classically cocky Yanks to the oh-so-British aid workers. At one point, a group of aristocratic Germans enter, after the fall of the Third Reich, all dressed in black and seeming like cartoon villains.Earth Angel review – Alan Ayckbourn’s 91st play is a plea for decencyRead moreAnd there is so much plot that it does not leave enough space for you to feel the play’s big emotional jolts, despite the stupendous central performances. Buether’s set design is superb, but its middle span of empty space does not lend itself to emotional intimacies.Still, it is impressive as a production and resonant in its subject matter. The DPs of then equate to the asylum seekers and refugees of today. Those protesting at what they term the immigrant invasion may benefit from watching this play as a way of restoring their humanity.At theDorfman theatre, National Theatre, London, until 1 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreNational TheatreJuliet StevensonreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was to be mere syllables to sing notes to, immune to “vulgarisation” as he put it – a way to tell a tragedy without too much pesky drama getting in the way.In choreographer Wayne McGregor’s production of Oedipus Rex, paired with a new ballet based on the myth of Antigone and premiered by the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet, there is drama, but it is of the stark, unsentimental kind. The double bill is entitled Jocasta’s Line, as Jocasta, queen of Thebes, sees her husband/son (spoiler, they’re the same person!) and daughter meet tragic ends. It is visually striking and exciting in scale – the first half austere, the second softer – and pristinely danced, but still with a sense of distance, as of the gods from mere mortals.Stravinsky’s original instructions were for the singers to be masked, unmoving, in restrictive costumes. In this production, designed by Vicki Mortimer, they are trapped in Bauhaus-esque towers, as if Oedipus is in a pulpit, or Creon, his brother-in-law, in the dock. The small group of dancers, often in stillness, provide another kind of architecture. The male chorus lines up like a battalion. The ever-glorious Sarah Connolly as Jocasta is utterly imperious. The singers are eyes forward, unblinking – as Oedipus, Paul Appleby’s voice is on full beam – and unresponsive to others’ plights. It’s a startling mode of delivery for the layers of confusion, anger and distress that tussle within the story of a man discovering he murdered his own father.View image in fullscreenLining up like a battalion … Jocasta’s Line.Photograph: Erik BergA projection of actorBen Whishaw, just his lips, gives a precis of the story. The rest of the text is deliberately not translated, no surtitles here. McGregor does not want you to read your way through the performance, he says when we speak the morning after the show. “I want you to shift your attention from a cognitive headset to kind of a sensual headset, where you give attention to music in a different way.”There’s an ominous nature to Stravinsky’s music, but there’s also jarring contrast between Oedipus’s heavy fate and the jaunty, eccentric countermelodies in the score, bassoon and oboe playfully chasing each other like an illustration of the gods playing games with these throwaway humans’ lives.Stravinsky was interested in form as meaning, and McGregor’s work is not dissimilar. With 30 years of intensive movement research behind him, the choreographer is famously resistant to literal, narrative interpretation. In fact, he’s exasperated by people (especially critics) who want to know exactly what is going on. “Especially in ballet,” he says, “there’s a push all the time for concrete narrative. And it’s something I’m really sad about.”View image in fullscreen‘In ballet, there’s a push for concrete narrative’ … Wayne McGregor.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianDance offers “a more fluid relationship to meaning”, through concreteness and out the other side, which McGregor sees as more akin to how we experience our lives. “We don’t know from moment to moment exactly what we’re thinking,” he says, so to try to do that on stage would be “completely reductive”.Stravinsky’s way with distinctive orchestral textures is something picked up by Canadian composer-conductor Samy Moussa, who has scored the second half of the programme, along with a pared-down libretto (in ancient Greek, again no surtitles) for a female chorus, whose dense but fragile chords shimmer at the peak of the work’s crescendos. There are no named characters in the second act (McGregor’s acts are called Son and Daughter, not Oedipus and Antigone), and there’s no differentiation in their costumes: vests daubed with black, a symbol of Oedipus’s blood, the family carrying his stain. Nevertheless, the daughter is Antigone. Her brothers have killed each other in an ugly fight for power (portrayed here as an artful struggle), one led by flash of white light to the afterlife, the other left to rot, by Creon’s decree. Antigone is determined to honour his body and perform funeral rites, even if it means her own death.Her reined-in dance is a study in precision of line, beautifully measured angles as if by protractor. There’s little sense of character, but what you do see embedded is certainty. In Sophocles’s play, Antigone is unsentimental about her actions – she is driven by a sense of duty. Through that prism, this appears not a dance of grief, but a dance of purpose. When asked, McGregor is only frustrated by questions about what he himself was interested in exploring. “None of that matters, none of that matters. What matters is how you receive something.”View image in fullscreenEver-glorious … Sarah Connolly as Jocasta, right, and Magnus Staveland.Photograph: Erik Berg“It really bores me, this transactional conversation,” he says, meaning the choreographer explaining their intention; the audience expecting something explicit to be communicated. “I think we need to be much braver about trusting our instincts about what we’re receiving, by opening up ourselves, our own lenses.”‘Don’t worry, just watch’: how do you tell a story through dance?Read moreMore important than knowing, surely, is feeling. McGregor may be allergic to button-pushing, but Daughter has two especially strong scenes that tap into tragedy. Antigone’s brother’s body prone on the floor, met by a solemn string phrase, the stage suddenly bereft. And a pas de deux between Creon and his wife (Eurydice) at the work’s denouement. Antigone and her fiance have died and Eurydice, the fiance’s mother, finds them. She dances in a kind of nauseous disbelief, her body folding and pulling and keening, while Creon is unfolding and pulling back and trying to save her from herself. It’s one of the few moments where there’s a real sense of something at stake. To me, at least. The subjective push-pull between form and content, intellect and emotion, meaning and meaningfulness, artist and audience is just as alive almost a century after Stravinsky wrote his Oedipus Rex.Jocasta’s Line is atOslo Opera Houseuntil 4 October.

They’re wrong’James Vanderbilt (Truth, 2015)Robert Redford hid from me behind a door once. I was directing my first film, Truth, and had somehow, improbably, gotten him to star in it. We were shooting a take, I called cut, went in to give a note, and he was gone. The whole cast was smiling, and I couldn’t figure it out – there was only one door in and out of the room and I had just walked through it. How had I lostRobert Redford?Then, from behind me, I heard that Redford chuckle. You’ve heard it in a hundred movies. I turned around and there he was, possibly the most famous man in the world, hiding behind the door I had just walked through, pressed up against the wall, giggling.View image in fullscreenBlanchett and Redford in Truth.Photograph: Supplied by LMKBefore Truth, I had been a journeyman screenwriter with some hits and some misses and had met Bob (he asked me to call him “Bob”, which in itself was a career highlight) after writing a script he was supposed to direct called Against All Enemies that never got made. I remember, while developing that film, he gave me a note on a scene I had written featuring Bill Clinton. I was resisting the note and explained why, and Bob very gently said to me: “It’s just, knowing Bill, he wouldn’t say it like that.” And it crashed in on me that he was giving me the note because he personally knew the president of the United States. It was one of those moments where you remembered: “Oh my God, I’m actually talking toRobert fucking Redford.”He knew the effect he had on people. Crew members who had been working on movies for 30 years would turn into teenagers at the sight of him. The first day he was on set for Truth, Cate Blanchett told me she changed clothes three times before coming to work in case she bumped into him before she went into wardrobe. Elisabeth Moss, who I’d never seen be anxious in her life, nervously went over to say hello to him. He told her he admired her work and that her show at the time, Jane Campion’s Top of the Lake, was on his network, the Sundance Channel. “I forgot he has a network!” she told me, grinning.View image in fullscreenRedford as Dan Rather in Truth.Photograph: Sony Pictures Classics/AllstarHe had a network, he had the Sundance Institute, he had built everything himself. He started out as a stage actor, then became the most handsome and famous movie star in the world, then decided he wanted to become a producer, and used his star power to produce some of the greatest films ever made, then decided to direct. His first film as a director, Ordinary People, won best picture and best director at the Academy Awards. Of course, he made a stone-cold classic right out of the gate.And now I was directing him in my first film. He knew how intimidating all of that could be, the “Robert Redford” of it all and, at every turn, he chose to disarm, to put you at ease. The first time I went to dinner with him, he sat down across from me and said: “What’s your story? Everyone has a story. I’d like to hear yours.” Nobody had ever asked me that question, before or since. It might be the kindest question I’ve ever been asked. So, we sat there and I told him about my life. Because he was curious, because he was interested.“I’m here as an actor,” he told me. “I’ll never look at the monitor. Just tell me what you need.” And he was true to his word. He was a generous performer, game to try anything with the other actors. He loved the craft of it, playing the scene, being part of a company. All he asked for on set was a chair and a copy of the New York Times. Every weekend, he would have me come to his apartment and go through the next week’s work. Just Robert Redford and me, talking about the movie we were making together, no big deal.We shot in Australia. He had never been there before. That blew my mind. I couldn’t conceive of a place he hadn’t been, an experience he hadn’t lived. And he loved it there. On his days off, he would go out and explore. “I went to the zoo yesterday,” he’d announce, proudly. We told him we knew, because his visit had been breathlessly covered by the media. They covered his every move throughout the city. Because he was Robert Redford, and Robert Redford coming to your country and doing anything was a big deal.He didn’t treat it that way, though. He knew that a random encounter for him would be a story the other person would tell for the rest of their lives. He was everything you wanted him to be, in an industry where so often that isn’t the case. They say you should never meet your heroes. They are wrong.View image in fullscreenJames Vanderbilt, Cate Blanchett and Robert Redford at a Truth film screening at the Cinema Society in New York.Photograph: Gregory Pace/ShutterstockOne last story. We were shooting his character’s introduction, and I explained to him I wanted to shoot him sitting in profile first, completely in silhouette, backlit so all we saw was the shape of his face. “Like Lincoln on the penny,” I said. “Great,” he said. Super-simple shot.We rolled film. “Action!” Bob sat there, then turned his face a fraction of an inch so the light spilled perfectly off it. I called cut. I told him I’d love to try one where he stays in silhouette. “Got it,” he said, “love that.” I called action. He turned his head again and caught the light. We did it four more times. Same thing every time. He kept apologising for it. I couldn’t figure it out. Our wonderful DP Mandy Walker finally did. “It’s muscle memory,” she whispered to me, smiling. “He’s been doing this for 50 years. He can’t not find his light.”I get to direct movies today because, for some reason, Robert Redford took a chance on me as a film-maker. But not just me. Hundreds of film-makers came through his Sundance Labs. Thousands more through his Sundance festivals. The impact he has had on film-making today is incalculable. He was a giant and his loss is tremendous. The gifts he leaves behind are not just his incredible performances, or the films he produced and directed, but his devotion to the legacy and the art of cinema. At every opportunity, he gave of himself to the art form he loved.For more than 60 years, in every facet of his career, Robert Redford could not help but move towards the light.‘We were locked up in a hotel for months. What a treat!’Lena Olin (Havana, 1990)View image in fullscreenRedford and Lena Olin in Havana.Photograph: THA/ShutterstockRedford was almost a fairytale figure. A dream cowboy of the sort I had imagined as a little girl that American men would be like.But Redford seemed to have the answers and the ambition to save us all. Ridiculously handsome, always so articulate and bright. Beneath that cool surface lay a volcano of emotions and desires.We spent six months together shooting Havana in the Dominican Republic at a time of political instability. That meant we were basically locked up together on the top floor of the hotel for months. What a treat!As an actor, he was extremely sweet and always wanted us to find other ways to tell the story, never sticking to the mainstream. As a king in Hollywood, he could have just sat on his throne but instead used that power to give new talent a chance through the Sundance institute.There was no one like Robert. I just don’t understand why I didn’t fall in love with him.‘I was a nobody. But he knew my name’F Murray Abraham (All the President’s Men, 1976)View image in fullscreenWith Dustin Hoffman in All the President’s Men.Photograph: Warner Bros/Kobal/ShutterstockThere were night shoots on that movie, and we gathered at the catering truck before the shot was set up. I didn’t have any stuff with Redford in the film, nor did the other two actors I was having coffee with, but he came over to us and said, “Hi, I’m Bob Redford”, to which I had to reply, “We know who you are”, and he said, “And I know who you are”, and he called us each by our first names. I was absolutely a nobody, so he must have learned the names only minutes before he met us, but what did that matter – it was a wonderful way to start that job. A long time ago, and still as fresh in my memory as yesterday.‘His smile made you feel like you’d won something.’Marianne Jean-Baptiste (Spy Game, 2001)When I accepted the role portraying Robert’s assistant, Gladys, in Spy Game, I don’t think it actually registered that all my scenes would be with this iconic actor who I’d grown up watching. My first day on set it suddenly dawned on me, and I turned into a bag of nerves. All I can remember is looking at him and seeing the titles of all his films rolling through my mind.Baptiste and Redford in Spy Game.Tony Scott introduced us and Robert warmly took my hand and told me how happy he was to be working with me. I think I mumbled a response – my mind totally blown. I needed to get a grip and remind myself that he was just an actor. But that annoying inner voice was screaming, “It’s the Sundance Kid! It’s Bob Woodward from All The President’s Men!” I was a mess!After we blocked the scene, he didn’t rush off to his dressing room. He quietly asked if I would mind going over lines with him and discussing our characters’ histories and relationships. I was stunned. I guess I thought he’d be aloof and star-like, but what I found was a warm, generous actor who was about the work. An actor on the hunt for the gems that would turn our small scenes into prized moments.View image in fullscreenRedford and Brad Pitt in Spy Game.Photograph: THA/ShutterstockI studied him – the way he conducted himself with the cast and crew alike; a consummate professional with a genuine, warm, and cheeky sense of humour. A beautiful human. His twinkling eyes lent encouragement and his smile made you feel like you’d won something.He was light. When it came to shooting our scenes, he kept them alive by always trying things and always seeking the particular. He was the type of actor who made you want to be better.When we shot our final scene, on the last take his character leans in and kisses me on the forehead. Tony screamed, “Cut! That was great.” Tony came to me afterwards and said: “That was beautiful. What were you thinking about?” On the spot I made up something like, “She’s worried because she knows he’s going to do something really dangerous.” But I was actually thinking: “My God, Robert Redford just kissed me.”‘He made clear his wariness regarding Hollywood cliches’Ralph Fiennes (Quiz Show, 1994)View image in fullscreenFiennes in Quiz Show.Photograph: United Artists/AllstarI was incredibly sad to learn of Robert Redford’s death. Thirty-two years ago he cast me in Quiz Show alongside John Turturro and Rob Morrow. I remember his patience and kindness as I became acquainted with all things 50s America – and American culture generally.View image in fullscreenRalph Fiennes and Robert Redford shooting Quiz Show.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockIt was challenging and intense and fun. I loved his droll sense of humour as he guided me through screen-acting skills and process.His maverick spirit was readily apparent and he made clear his wariness regarding Hollywood cliches and practice.I treasure my experience of working with him, which was also an introduction to a great film-maker with a true artistic vision of an American cinema that could be intelligent, original and politically provocative.He took me riding near his home in New Mexico. I’m no horseman, but he made me feel I could be. The film-making world is smaller without him.‘Failure and Robert Redford were not two things you put together’Richard Jenkins, The Company You Keep (2012)I first met Robert when I was an actor at the Sundance Institute screenwriters’ lab in the late 80s. It was a wonderful time. You’d workshop and shoot during the day and then, at night, there was a big plastic garbage can filled with beer and soda on ice and people would sit around and talk. There was also a screening room in a cabin where they’d show movies and the lead actor or the director of the movie would come and talk about it.It was like Camp Hollywood: no pretension, everyone staying in other people’s houses, just kind of jerry-rigged and hanging out in the mountains. Karl Malden was there, and Sydney Pollack. You knew you were a part of something special when you were doing it, which doesn’t happen very often.Robert would come and direct some of the scenes and, after about three days, once you’d got over the fact it was Robert Redford, he was just Bob. The idea of being special bothered him, because it would have meant he was alone. He wanted people to be themselves around him and he made that easy, which was much appreciated. I found him really easy to chat to.View image in fullscreenJenkins and Redford in The Company You Keep.Photograph: Sony Pictures Classics/Sportsphoto/AllstarIn about 1990, they announced they were going to start this little film festival. Bob said: “I just want these films that nobody was seeing to be shown somewhere.” It was always going to work. Failure and Robert Redford were not two things you put together.About 20 years later, I worked with him on The Company You Keep. As a director as well as an actor, he never hurried. His sets were very quiet and calm and gentle. He made the movie he wanted to make and played the scene the way he felt comfortable playing it. It was very cool to be around that.Actors know what it’s like not to be treated well and he wasn’t going to be one of those directors. I remember we were looping dialogue afterwards – which I don’t like doing: saying the line again and trying to match your lips to the footage. I did a take and Bob said: “I like that better than the original. And I liked the original.” It was such a nice thing to say.As a director, Bob took on stories that spoke to him and he felt needed to be made, rather than projects to make money. The Company You Keep is a movie about a world not a lot of people today are aware of, and there were a lot of people of the generation who remembered 60s radicalism and idealism who worked on it: Julie Christie, Susan Sarandon, Sam Elliott, Nick Nolte, Chris Cooper, Brendan Gleeson. Bob liked being around those folks.On the set of The Company You Keep, we spoke about that time back in Utah at the start of Sundance. He said: “Oh my gosh, you were there right at the beginning!” I said: “I know! That was something, wasn’t it?” It really was. You could tell he loved that time. Bob excitedly told me I had to come back to Sundance, so I did and was a mentor for a year there. And he was in every single day, just doing it.‘Beneath that suave surface, his passions always boiled’Lasse Hallström (An Unfinished Life, 2005)View image in fullscreenRedford in An Unfinished Life.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyIt’s worth remembering that Robert’s views of the world were also formed by his travels in Europe as a young man, painter and artist.I think he came back from those trips with a new view of America so, all his life, while he was caught up in his success as a leading man in Hollywood movies, his heart was always with true art, European taste, experimental film-making.With that came also a passion for truth and honesty, and a desire to protect what was genuine, natural, true nature, nature.He spoke so eloquently and coolly about those things, almost like a politician, but his passions always boiled in him, right underneath that suave and well-mannered surface.‘Robert seemed the last person who’d need to buy somebody for the night’Adrian Lyne (Indecent Proposal, 1993)Robert was really the only true film star who I’ve worked with. He’d walk on to the set and I wouldn’t be looking at him – I’d be speaking to someone else – and everything would go quiet. There would be a hush, and I’d know he’d arrived. They never went quiet about me, or anybody else I’ve worked with.He had an extraordinary presence and aura. It was an uncanny thing, really. He also walked better than anybody on Earth. I remember that very particularly. Very straight and very beautiful to watch. I’ve never seen anybody walk like that.View image in fullscreenDemi Moore and Robert Redford in Indecent Proposal.Photograph: David James/Paramount/Kobal/ShutterstockCasting him in that role in Indecent Proposal [as a businessman who offers Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore $1m to spend the night with her] was interesting, because Redford seemed to be the last person on earth you’d think would need to buy somebody for the night.We both thought the film posed a really interesting question: if you wouldn’t do it for a million, would you do it for two, or 10? What’s your price?Making the movie, I was very aware of his being a director as well as an actor, and of him watching me be a director. It was almost like a secret between us both. There’s one scene in the film in which he’s telling a story to Demi Moore about missed chances, which was based on something that happened to me on the tube in London when I was about 17.A girl was sitting opposite me on the train and I thought she was just lovely. When I looked at her, she turned away and, when she looked at me, I would turn away because I was shy. Then it was my stop: I got off, the doors shut and she looked at me and gave me this beautiful smile. I wanted to rip the doors open. I remember I went back to that station at the same time for the next 10 days in case I saw her.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The take I’d chosen should have ended right on his face, within his face almost, to coincide with when he speaks about the girl smiling at him from inside the train. But, for whatever reason, the camera assistant didn’t quite hit the end mark. Robert was watching it next to me and he was saying to himself, “Tighter, tighter, tighter, tighter!” and I went to him: “I know, I know, I know!” It was the best take but we both knew it didn’t go in quite tight enough.And I’ll always remember shooting the scene in which Robert was looking at Woody and Demi as they danced to The Nearness of You. I was on the camera and shooting little moments of Robert through the crowd dancing. Then he looked at me through the crowd and smiled.I think he saw the director’s agony, which you get when nothing’s going right – it was a sort of, “Shit, I know what you’re going through” sort of smile. He was seeing it from that perspective. It was the sweetest smile and I used that shot for him smiling at them in the scene. I’ll always treasure the way he looked at me through that crowd.‘It felt like a private, intimate masterclass’Danny Huston, The Conspirator (2010)For me, Robert Redford was a dream. I admired him not only as an iconic movie star, but as a political activist and a passionate champion of independent film.Working with Robert gave me a deep insight into how he approached his craft. We were shooting a courtroom scene and the assistant director had mistakenly placed the witnesses in the wrong order. I called on the wrong witness, and Redford immediately seized the opportunity. He said, “Let’s keep it that way – have your character realise mid-sentence that he’s addressing the wrong man.” That spontaneous adjustment brought levity and humour to the scene – something that wasn’t on the page. It was his special kind of magic, that extra nuance he so effortlessly delivered.View image in fullscreenRedford directs Danny Huston, James McAvoy and Kevin Kline in The Conspirator.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyFrom that point on, with each scene, I’d turn to him and ask, “How would you do it?” Without hesitation, he would act out the scene for me – with a twinkle in his eye. It felt like a private, intimate masterclass. His acting was invisible in the best sense: refined, precise, often laced with that quietly sarcastic wit. He was always searching for that light touch that made the drama feel more genuine and heartfelt. He would save his final jab, and it was always unexpected.For example, the way he delivered his last line in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, in response to Butch’s insistence they jump off the cliff to escape pursuit – “I can’t swim” – and then Butch’s reply: “The fall will probably kill ya”, before they both start to run to the edge. That will always break my heart.View image in fullscreenRedford with Paul Newman in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.Photograph: Photos 12/AlamyWhat moved me most about Robert was his unwavering stance for justice and loyalty. His creative partnership with Sydney Pollack produced some of the most thoughtful films of their time. As a director, he showed a deep understanding of the human condition. His dedication to Indigenous communities and environmental causes was not just admirable – it was unshakable. He was a man of rare beauty and grace. As an audience member, I’ve always considered him one of the greatest movie stars of his generation. And for me, he will always be the Sundance Kid.‘It was the privilege of a lifetime to get to spin stories beside him’David Lowery(The Old Man and the Gun, 2018)I don’t know where I’d be without Robert Redford. I still remember the day my mom told me about this film festival of his in the mountains of Utah, and the concept of independent film; I was nine or 10, already stubbornly independent, and everything he was doing up there sounded pretty great to me.View image in fullscreenSissy Spacek and Redford in The Old Man and the Gun.Photograph: Lifestyle pictures/AlamyCut to two decades later and, against all odds, I’m on set with Bob for the first time, pinching myself, wondering how I’d managed to wind up working with this legend. The answer is: I followed the path he laid out, for me and for countless other film-makers and artists over the years. He gave us all the confidence to tell stories on our own terms, as we saw fit. It was the privilege of a lifetime to get to spin a few of those yarns alongside him. He was a storyteller, through and through, and I can’t imagine there’s a better way to honour his life’s work than to keep on telling them – and making them count. Rest well, Bob. Thank you for everything.‘Always gracious, creatively egalitarian and generous in spirit’Delroy Lindo (The Last Castle, 2001)When I heard of Robert’s passing, I thought about the relative impermanence of our time on this planet, and the opportunities we have to impact our world while we’re here. Robert Redford’s time among us was clearly impactful.As a huge global movie star, but choosing to use his platform to promote social causes that were important to him; that spoke to a vision the man had, far exceeding his own personal sphere.View image in fullscreenDelroy Lindo in The Last Castle.Photograph: THA/ShutterstockI particularly respected that, as it’s not a given that people of influence and power will make those kinds of choices. In Redford’s case, though, it clearly represented a desire to have a far broader impact outside the entertainment industry, in his life and work.As a film-maker and storyteller, making in-depth investigations into our world, and culture; while simultaneously presenting his work engagingly, as broad-based entertainment. Films such as Ordinary People and Quiz Show are about very different subject matters; but both represent compelling explorations into human behaviours, illuminating the human condition as he saw it.We first met in the early 2000s, when I attended a film workshop at the Sundance Institute as an adviser. One project in particular was having some difficulty. He asked me what I thought the sources of those problems were, and I told him. Our subsequent conversation had nothing to do with his being a movie star; but rather, represented two creative workers striving to unlock and solve a specific set of creative challenges and problems. I engaged very directly with his innate, genuine creative impulse and aspiration.The trailer for The Last Castle.Wrapping the one scene we had together on The Last Castle, he offered: “Hey man, you’re a really nice actor.” A few years later, I reached out to him on behalf of an event I’d created to benefit aspiring Black scientists. He very readily contributed financing.I didn’t know him well. But, in the few interactions I shared with him over the years, he was always gracious; creatively egalitarian, and generous in spirit. I appreciated that.‘There was nothing easy about his tenacity and commitment’Elizabeth McGovern (Ordinary People, 1980)Robert Redford represents the sort of movie that is fast disappearing. The movie that grapples with the complexity of the human experience and, at the same time, is genuinely entertaining. He was a guy who could think and feel simultaneously, and make audiences do the same. But he made it seem fun and easy. You didn’t realise you were doing both until suddenly you were.With Ordinary People, you had a phenomenon in the sense that lots of people were reacting collectively to a story about one particular American family. Everything about his approach to the story was specific and detailed, and that’s what made it universal.View image in fullscreenRedford directing Elizabeth McGovern and Timothy Hutton in Ordinary People.Photograph: American Pictorial/THA/ShutterstockI had no way of knowing, at the time, that it wouldn’t last. This kind of film-making, that sort of person. Because he made it all seem so easy. And that’s how it felt being directed by him. Easy. I didn’t ever feel as if I was acting in any kind of big deal movie. I was just going bowling with Timothy Hutton. Easy.That was 43 years ago. Now I realise only too clearly there is nothing easy about the tenacity and commitment it takes to sustain the kind of work he did all of his life. It’s hard. He made movies that work. He did it over and over again. I miss that kind of film-making, that kind of person. I will miss you so much, Bob.‘My mom screamed and put him in a bear hug’Norman Reedus (The Conspirator, 2010)I heard the news about Robert’s death on a long motorcycle trip in Spain. I’d pulled over for gas and a coffee and read about it on my phone. I was super bummed because he was such a nice guy to work with. A creative force, of course, and an icon whose movies I grew up watching, but also just so much fun.I made a movie with him in which I played one of the men behind the killing of Abraham Lincoln. We were filming in Georgia and shot the scene in which my character is hanged. I was sitting with Robert as they were setting up the hanging of the next guy. I said to him: “You know, in real life, this criminal actually wet his pants on the gallows.”View image in fullscreenReedus and Redford on set.Photograph: Supplied imageHe looks at me and goes: “Really?” I went: “Yeah! I did a lot of research. And I told the actor who plays him he should probably do that, because that would impress you.” He looks at me and goes: “No. You didn’t.” And I go: “Yeah, I did.” And we both started cracking up. This poor guy was being hanged in front of us and we were laughing hysterically.I was supposed to ride a horse in the film and had told Robert straight that I didn’t know how to do that. He said: “Don’t worry, we’ve got a great team.” But every time my horse got near other horses it would start to trot backwards and go and stand ear to ear with the horse next to him. So I’d be giving a speech, trying to be all serious, and the horse would start walking backwards. It was totally humiliating. Take after take! Robert was yelling: “Can somebody handle Norman’s fucking horse?” I thought: I’m dead, he’s gonna fire me. But luckily he didn’t.The trailer for The Conspirator.We had the premiere at the Ford’s theater in Washington DC, where Lincoln was assassinated. I remember speaking to Robert in the first couple of rows in front of the stage. The movie was about to start and the lights going down and I just heard this shrieking from the back of the theatre. Then my mom – who I’d brought along with me – came running down the aisle towards us, like she was watching the Beatles or something. The whole theatre kind of stopped as she ran in and put Bob in a bear hug. She was screaming and he was looking over his shoulder at me like: “Help! Get her off me!” I held up my hands like: “Nothing I can do, sorry.”He was just that cool. It was so impressive to have been a heart-throb your entire life and successful in every area, as well as a philanthropist and the founder of Sundance, and also not have it go to your head.I loved how honest he was. He just vibrated at this level where he could see everything from every single direction and angle and everybody’s point of view, all at the same time. He oozed this level-headedness and knowledge of how the world works and what it all meant. Everybody else was sort of panicky around him, but he was always the coolest, calmest person in the room.View image in fullscreenRedford shooting The Conspirator.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyI was quite a new actor when I worked with him and nervous about a lot of things. He gently sort of pushed me to jump in and we also just really got along well, from the get-go. I have a ton of photos where we’re just talking and really into each other’s conversation.He was a guy’s guy who’d sit on the floor with you and talk. There was nothing pretentious about him. He never acted as if he were above you, just got down to your level and wanted to hear what you had to say. I really appreciated that.I lost my dad early, so if there’s a cool older guy that I can latch on to and who likes me then I really love them. I had that with Kris Kristofferson and Scott Wilson, too. There’s a certain calibre of person who’s very honest and cool that I gravitate towards. And I really gravitated towards Robert.‘He offered me kindness when I needed it most’Terrence Howard(The Company You Keep, 2012)View image in fullscreenTerrence Howard in The Company You Keep.Photograph: Voltage Picture/Kobal/ShutterstockRobert Redford gave the world more than extraordinary films. He gave us sanctuary. By founding Sundance [film festival], he created a refuge where independent voices could be heard, seen and honoured. Without Sundance’s sheltering light, many of us, myself included, would never have had the room to be recognised. That festival shaped the world that made my name possible, and for that gift alone, his legacy is forever woven into my life.But my connection to Robert goes deeper than the history books or headlines. We worked together only once, yet it was during one of the hardest emotional moments of my life. It’s difficult enough to hold your own opposite such an icon, but when you’re weighed down by personal turmoil, the challenge can feel impossible. What I found in Robert surprised me. He wasn’t just cool in the way so many of his characters had been. This wasn’t a role and he wasn’t performing. He became, in that moment, a friend and a mentor.Actors know there are rare bonds forged under the lights, between takes, in the fragile space where reality and movie magic meet. That day, Robert offered me steadiness, kindness and a sense of belief when I needed it most. It wasn’t grand, it wasn’t scripted, it was simply human. And it reminded me that the truest measure of a person is not the spotlight they stand in, but the quiet moments where they stand beside you.View image in fullscreenRedford in The Company You Keep.Photograph: Moviestore/ShutterstockRobert’s gift was never just his talent. It was his stewardship. He didn’t hoard praise or power, he used them to lift others. His films changed cinema, but his leadership changed culture. He showed us that artistry and integrity can share the same path, and that generosity itself can be a kind of courage.I will miss him: his candour, his warmth, and the steadying force of a man who believed in artists and audiences alike. Yet grief is its own kind of promise. The friendships he seeded, the moments he gave, the courage he shared, these will find us again. Until our paths cross in another lifetime, I’ll carry the memory of that bond with gratitude.‘I said: “I’m not obese.” He said: “We’ll put sweaters on you.”’Judd Hirsch (Ordinary People, 1980)I was shocked when I learned of Robert’s death. I never knew he got old. The last time I saw him was in about 2006 when he had an Ordinary People reunion. Six of us in one room: Timothy Hutton, Elizabeth McGovern, Mary Tyler Moore, Donald Sutherland, Robert and me. Three of them are now gone. Robert was a year younger than me and when I saw him then I thought, well, he ain’t ever gonna look as old as me, no matter what happens to him. But then I realised, no, he’s human.When he asked if I’d be interested in playing the psychiatrist in Ordinary People, he sent me the novel it was based on. The description of my character was an obese, fumbling man who couldn’t turn off the radio and had to look up his clients’ names. I said: “I’m not obese.” He said: “Don’t worry, we’ll just put some sweaters on you.”View image in fullscreenRedford directing Judd Hirsch in Ordinary People.Photograph: American Pictorial/THA/ShutterstockI wanted to give the character more flaws, so the viewer had a reason not to expect the kid [a bereaved and suicidal young man played by Timothy Hutton] to come back after the first session. I suggested smoking. He said: “No, no, no, no, no – that’s a cliche.” I said: “Look, I stopped smoking last year, but I think it’s the only thing I can do that will make the kid think: why did you do that?” He said OK, and so I did. I was very proud of that.He was very much an actor’s director and conscious of the obvious. I felt in one scene there was a way of dramatically enhancing a moment, almost as if to say: “Ah, you got it!” But Robert said: “You don’t have to say it like that. Just tell him.” That was the only direction we ever got: “Just tell him.”View image in fullscreenRedford with his best director Oscar for Ordinary People.Photograph: APMaking that film, Robert was not self-assured about anything. He said he really did not know how to do this from behind the camera. And he was mostly interested in the values of the characters and in telling the story in a way nobody else could.I felt a tremendous responsibility playing that part. I was always afraid that, if it was a little different from what he expected, I’d feel a failure. It was a special movie for him because it was about something he had thought about. When we had our first meeting, he said: “I’m going to have you say [to Hutton] that you are his friend.” I said: “But psychiatrists don’t do that, you’d get shut down for that.” And he said: “I don’t care. We gotta say it and we gotta mean it.” Two of his own kids had gone to therapy and he never, ever believed that it was any good.At that point, Robert had never won an Academy Award. Then Ordinary People won four, including best picture and best director. It was like magic. They threw everything at him in one bundle. He was totally surprised.Later on, he came to see me in a Broadway show. I was rather surprised, but it was a wonderful acknowledgment. He’d not only remembered me through doing the movie, but he also knew I wasn’t just a television actor. He came to the dressing room afterwards and we had a great discussion. He liked the play and what I did and it was sort of like he was saying: “I’m glad I chose you for the film.”View image in fullscreenRedford in All the President’s Men.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarWe don’t see people like Robert any more in the movie business. He was so honest about what he did as an actor, a director and a man interested in the politics of the nation. That honesty undercut what everybody might expect of this handsome star. I think people would’ve voted for him if he’d run for political office. I know I would.Explore more on these topicsRobert RedfordMarianne Jean-BaptisteRalph FiennesRichard JenkinsDanny HustonElizabeth McGovernFilm industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The first thing I did this morning was fire up YouTube and watch Jon Stewart’s monologue on last night’s Daily Show. Stewart usually only does the Monday edition, but he had made an exception in the wake ofABC’s decision, at the encouragement of the Federal Communications Commission and its Trump acolyte head, Brendan Carr, to indefinitely sideline Jimmy Kimmel.Stewart’s midweek appearance, then, was an event – and one that didn’t disappoint.Set to the images of soldiers saluting and American flags billowing in the wind, the opening voiceover trumpeted the “all-new, government-approved Daily Show, with your patriotically obedient host Jon Stewart”. Cue Stewart, his usually cool blue set switched out for Mar-a-Lago gold, his eyes nervously darting, launching into 20 minutes of mock-obsequious toadying to “our great father”, praising his state visit to the UK, redrawing maps to reflect Trump’s spotty knowledge of international affairs – Azerbaijan is now officially “Aberbaijan”, and it’s at war with Albania – and frantically shushing the studio audience whenever they laughed at or booed the president (“Shut up, you’re going to blow this for us!”)Stewart, of course, was not alone in responding in double-quick time to the attack on his peer.All of late-night was at it. Stephen Colbert, already in some eyes a victim of Trumpian overreach, revived his old hyper-patriotic persona on The Colbert Report as part of a larger defence of Kimmel. Seth Meyers, never one to hold his tongue, waded in too. Even thehair-ruffler himself, Jimmy Fallon – long criticised for his mealy mouthed response to the political moment – chimed in in his own underpowered way, defending Kimmel and aiming some extremely gentle digs at the president. Why wouldn’t he? Fallon’s previously cautious approach doesn’t seem to have gotten him anywhere: Trump has called on him, along with Meyers, to be cancelled next.View image in fullscreen‘Not a talented person …’ Donald Trump enjoying the company and platform of … Jimmy Kimmel in 2015.Photograph: Randy Holmes/GettyAll of which begs the question: how did American talkshow hosts, historically more used to yukking it up with movie stars or looking nervous whilewild animals clambered all over them, acquire such political importance that presidents now use the instruments of state to shut them up? When did the late-night desk become such a battleground?Certainly things have progressed a bit from the days of Johnny Carson. The King of Late Night didn’t entirely banish politics from his Tonight Show – he, from time to time, had politicians on as guests (Bill Clinton, saxophone in tow, useda Carson appearanceto rebound from a disastrous speech at the 1988 Democratic convention) and cheerfully knitted current affairs into his monologue – but he remained wary of it throughout his career. “TV is probably not the ideal place to discuss serious issues,” he told Kenneth Tynan in acelebrated 1978 profilefor the New Yorker. “It’s much better to read about them.” Carson’s squeamishness around this stuff stood in stark contrast to his competitor Dick Cavett, whose show would launch headlong intosometimes contentiouspolitical discussion. Naturally, Carson trounced him in the ratings.If Carson codified late-night TV’s softly, softly approach to politics, his heirs didn’t exactly reverse course: Jay Leno, who took over the Tonight Show from Carson, practised a similar studied neutrality (a world-champion ratings chaser, he was well aware that taking a side meanslosing half your audience); while Leno’s rival David Letterman was often too busy deconstructing TV conventions to bother with grandstanding. Still, there were some topics the pair found unavoidable, or perhaps irresistible: from 1 January to 10 September 1998, according to an Observer story at the time, the pair, along with fellow late-night hosts Conan O’Brien and Bill Maher, made a total of 1,401 jokes about the Clinton-Lewinsky affair alone.View image in fullscreenThen first lady Hillary Clinton appearing on The Late Show With David Letterman in January 2000.Photograph: Barbara Nitke/APIn hindsight, many of those jokes were pretty grim and sexist (Letterman hasspoken of his regretat aiming so many of them at Lewinsky), but at the time they contributed to a sense that late-night TV held real weight when it came to politics: 47% of people aged between 18 and 29 got their news from late-night TV shows,according to a 2000 poll. Central to that was the emergence of Stewart’s Daily Show, which used the traditional signifiers of late-night TV – big wooden desk, host in suit and tie, celebrity guests – to do something more politically strident. Mining a similar furrow, though from a slightly different political leaning, was Bill Maher with his show Politically Incorrect,famously cancelled by ABCafter an off-colour comment about 9/11 and replaced by a bro-ish – and what the network hoped would be a far less contentious – host called … Jimmy Kimmel.All of this, though, didn’t mean late-night TV suddenly became a politics fest. In the 2010s the genre was instead synonymous with James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke and Fallon’s Lip Sync Battle, inoffensive entertainment segments designed to rack up online views to help stem the bleeding of TV viewers. What changed things was Trump, a political story so all-consuming, like Clinton-Lewinsky before it, that it was impossible to avoid in late-night monologues, and a figure that just begged to be satirised.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Of course, lower ratings also make it easier to cancel your show, especially one that is politically unhelpful at a time when, say, your parent corporation istrying to get government approvalto merge with another corporation.Late-night is particularly vulnerable in that regard, but in gunning for it the Trump administration has afforded it a strange amount of weight, even power. Comedians are “the banana peel in the coalmine”, Stewart said in a 2022 Mark Twain prizeacceptance speechthat I’ve seen shared around a lot online in the past couple of days. “Comedians are the ones who get sent away first.” There areplenty of precedentsfor that.

Beyond assuring him he meets the standard, could you help him to see the standard doesn’t matter?Eleanor Gordon-SmithThu 18 Sep 2025 20.17 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 20.19 EDTShareMy boyfriend sees sex as a competition he is losing. He feels like he doesn’t perform enough (he does) and worries he isn’t big enough (he is!).He grew up without a father – the father’s fault – and I wonder if this has something to do with it. How can I assist him to see sex as non-competitive? I love him, and I find this self-loathing distressing.Eleanor says:I assume he doesn’t think he’s losing the competition with you, somehow, but with imagined manly foes, comparisons, symbols of everything he (imagines he) isn’t?Masculine adequacy, what a curse. It means every time you go to bed together it isn’t a moment between just you two. Also joining you: the fictional ideal of “male performance”, the version of himself he imagines he needs to be, and a fleet of imagined competitors. It can get so crowded in there, it’s hard to even see each other.I want to wonder about something. Does reassuring him that he lives up to these standards ultimately leave him trapped within them? That is, does telling him heisman enough leave that as the standard to use?There is one universal sex tip. It is simple, teachable and obviousRead moreIn an ideal sexual utopia I feel like we’d get away from the notion of “man enough” altogether. You know and I know that it’s stupid propaganda from equally stupid porn and pop culture that good sex has to involve out-manning others with size and muscles and a grimly determined march to an orgasm.It would be so much nicer if in place of sexual standards, like “big enough” or “performing enough”, we cared about things like “do Ireallyknow what my partner likes”, “do I make them feel totally free and irresistible”, “are we building something together, or am just I enacting a script”.I wonder whether reassuring him that he meets his expectations for male sexuality nonetheless leaves him in a world where those are the most important things. After all, reassurance that you comply with standards doesn’t get you out from under them. You’re not a servant to a system any less when you’re in its good graces.Admittedly, it’s tough to shepherd people away from these standards. Saying “it doesn’t matter whether you’re big enough” is a bit like saying “it doesn’t matter whether you’re beautiful”. Can’t expect your audience to be thrilled. The trick might be to communicate “you live up to these standards, but that other things matter more”, then help him see those other things.Bigger is always better – and nine other sex myths bustedRead moreFor instance, does he know whatyoulike? You, particularly, outside of his expectations of how sex in general should look? Could you get nitty gritty with the language, more than you’re comfortable with at first?If you’re able to find and share a novel experience with him, something genuinely really exciting and pleasurable for you – and he’s got his head screwed on right – that could be much more exciting than fulfilling the docket of Abstract Ideal of ManSex.And as always, therapy works. Nobody would expect to be able to fix their stove on their own from first principles; we call an expert. But when it comes to problems like these – the ones that are hardest to identify, with the worst collateral for the people we love – we think, “I bet I can figure that one out on my own”. That’s no disrespect to your boyfriend; we all do it. But he doesn’t have to live like this; he can call an expert. Short of sex therapy, which can be expensive, there areplentyofbooksandother resourcesout there that can help debunk this kind of thinking.Sex can be a moment to really see each other. We can’t do that so well when we’re looking through the thick lenses of false ideals about manhood. I wonder whether the best reassurance could be helping him take off those goggles.This letter has been edited for clarity.Ask Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsRelationshipsLeading questionsSexAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But there was one part ofladolcevitathe 32-year-old never warmed up to: long, late, lazy dinners that rarely began before 8pm and stretched well past 10.“I am such an early eater,” Stobo said. Back home in Miami, her “ideal dinner time” is 5.30; she simply “can’t wait” much later.Stobo, who works in hotel marketing, does not care if that makes her sound uncool or uptight; she thinks a 5pm dinnertime is healthier. “That’s the normal time people used to eat dinner when we, like, lived by the sun and the moon and the way of the world,” she said. An idyllic way to put it – butstudiesdo show that eating two hours or less before bedtime can disrupt our circadian rhythm and be a risk factor for obesity.Thought to be the stuff of early bird specials and old folks’ homes, the five o’clock dinnertime could be one of 2025’s most surprising comebacks, as younger generations seem willing to finish meals before the sun goes down. According to data collected by the reservation app OpenTable, 53% of gen Z and 51% of millennials in the US are interested in snagging an early seat. OpenTable also found that 5pm dining was up 11% from January to August 2025, compared with 2024; 6pm, the most popular time to eat, was up 8%, while 8pm was up only 4%. In New York – now, apparently, a sleepy city? – 5pm dining was up 20%.View image in fullscreenThe reservation app OpenTable found that 5pm dining was up 11% from January to August 2025, compared with 2024.Photograph: Maskot/Getty Images“Our data points to a clear trend in earlier dinner reservations this year, which could be influenced by factors like return to office, shifting health and wellness priorities, and/or strategically booking in-demand tables at historically quieter times,” Cheryl Paniagua, vice-president of restaurant sales and services at OpenTable, said in a statement.Young people aredrinking lessand working out more; 73% of gen Zers have gym memberships, according to a 2024report. Why stay out late when you have to rise and grind the next morning? Then there’s the issue of making reservations, which has become a bit of abloodsport. Reservation scalpers are known to gobble up prime tables as soon as they become available, then sell them to the highest bidder. Want to eat at that TikTok-famous bistro or celebrity-favored Italian joint? Hope you’re hungry at 4.30pm.Late-evening reservations conjure images of European cities, bottles of wine consumed slowly among friends and Anthony Bourdain in a leather jacket. Spaniardseatthe latest, usually around 10pm, followed by Italians (9pm), the French (8pm), Germans (7pm), and Swedes, who are prompt 6pm diners.According to a recent Yahoo/YouGovsurveyof 1,690 US adults, most (34%) liked to eat dinner at 6pm, 21% said they enjoyed it at 5pm, and only 14% said they sat down for the meal after 8pm. A 9pm dinner is nice if it is enjoyed with friends, but a late dinner alone, at home, perhaps involving a TV tray and Sex and the City reruns? Slightly sad. (Apologies to the late Mr Bourdain.)Dinner is a really good example of how our cultural norms and rituals aren’t set in stoneJulia C SkinnerStobo recently shared her penchant for early dinner on TikTok, in aclipliked more than 61,000 times. “Dinner by 6, in bed by 9,” she captioned a video showing her munching at her kitchen table, basking in late-afternoon light. Many viewers agreed. “Around 5:30-6 anything after that I’m copping an attitude,” one wrote. “5:30 is goated,” commented another.Julia C Skinner, a food writer and historian, believes that earlier dinner times reflect America’s post-Covid work-from-home attitudes. If people are not commuting, they can theoretically eat as soon as they close their laptops at 5pm on the dot. “It makes it easier for us to eat whenever we want,” she said. “My last office job, I commuted two hours each way. That obviously impacted my dinnertime. Now, I work remotely, so I can get off work and be like, ‘great, right to dinner’.”Dinner did not always exist. According toEater, households ate in shifts until the 1700s. When families first started to gather, midday meals were considered the most important. “Dinner is a really good example of how our cultural norms and rituals aren’t set in stone,” Skinner said. “Breakfast used to be a huge meal, because we used to work on farms and needed the energy. Now, most people don’t eat a full steak and eggs for breakfast. Times change.”Early dinner evangelists are not that different from happy hour regulars. Chris Syed, a managing partner of New York’s Highwater Rooftop, says his bar has recently become overrun with young people showing up right at 5pm to eat. “They’re able to take advantage of happy hour specials, so dinner is cheaper for them, and they’re only out from five to 7pm,” Syed said. “Then they can be in bed by eight watching Netflix.”‘They tell you every minor inconvenience’: US bartenders on which generation has the worst behaviorRead moreSyed, 46, still feels the call of the 8pm reservation, but he has noticed that time looks more like senior hours than peak rush. “There is a big difference between the 8 o’clock crowd and the five o’clock crowd,” he said. “[Five o’clock] is so young.” He can imagine his bar staging a “reverse happy hour” later in the night to counter the early onslaught.“I can’t feed 200 people at the happy hour price,” Syed said. “You’re going to start to see a lot of [restaurant industry] folks trying to get more strategic, because we still have to cover our costs. Eventually, it’s going to take a toll.”Giovanni Luciano, 24, a line cook who works at a Brooklyn bistro, eats dinner at 5pm, not necessarily by choice. That’s just when he’s served family dinner, a staff meal eaten before peak hours. He usually finds himself needing a second dinner after his shift.Luciano, who is something of a sleaze-chic influencer (you may know himas “theBushwickline cook”) and starred in an Addison Raemusic videothis summer, knows he is an anomaly. Among his cohort of TikTok glitterati, “people just want to eat dinner and get it over with” then go on to their next event or party. Sometimes, he will peek outside the kitchen and see a “long, full line of people waiting to be seated right at 6pm”.To each their own, though Luciano believes that it diminishes dinner when you hustle things along. “Meals should be an event,” he said. “I like a candle with my dinner, baby. I want it to be dark.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleRestaurantsBars, pubs and clubsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This crostata – a buttery, crumbly pastry filled with homemade blackberry and bay jam – would work well for both breakfast and an afternoon treat. You will have more jam than needed here, but if you’re going to the effort of making it yourself, it’s worth having a bit extra to enjoy on yoghurt or toast.Blackberry and bay crostataPrep5 minMacerate1 hr+Chill1 hrCook1 hr 30 minServes8-10For the jam600g blackberries300g caster sugarJuice of ½ lemon2 fresh bay leavesFor the pastry155g unsalted butter60g caster sugar1 egg, plus 2 egg yolks310g type 00 flour, or plain flour¼ tsp baking powder½ tsp fine sea saltMilk,for brushingStart with the jam. Put the blackberries, sugar and lemon juice in a large bowl and leave to macerate for at least an hour, and ideally three or four, until the berries turn syrupy and most of the sugar has dissolved.Put a small saucer in the freezer – you’ll use this later to test if the jam is done. Put the berry mix, including all the juices, in a large, wide saucepan, then add the bay leaves and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat, simmer for 10-12 minutes, then put a teaspoonful of the jam mix on the chilled saucer. Leave it to sit for two minutes, then push it with a fingertip: if it wrinkles a little, it’s done; if not, cook for a couple of minutes more and retest. Remove and discard the bay leaves, then pour the jam on to a shallow tray and leave to cool.To make the pastry, beat the butter and sugar until creamy. Whisk in the egg and egg yolks, then add the flour, baking powder and salt, and stir well to bring the mix together into a dough. Give it a quick knead, then divide in two, with one piece slightly larger than the other. Wrap both in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for an hour, or until firm.Roll out the larger piece of dough to about 2½cm wider than a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin, then lift into the tin and press evenly into the corners. Trim off any overhanging pastry, prick the base all over with a fork and fill with about 300g of the cooled jam.Roll out the other piece of dough, then, using a sharp knife or crimped cutter, cut it into eight strips. Arrange these neatly on top of the jam (ie, four in each direction) to create a lattice pattern, then trim off any overhanging edges. Brush the exposed pastry lightly with milk, then bake for 25-30 minutes, until nicely browned. Remove, leave to cool completely, then lift out of the tin.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotPastryItalian food and drinkFruitBakingPickling, fermenting and preservingSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"

The spree was driven primarily by a rise in demand for the cash Isas rather than the stocks and shares version.The number of cash Isas increased by 2.1m to just shy of 10m, with the total squirrelled away in this type of account jumping 67% to almost £70bn, according to HM Revenue and Customs.UK state pension: what is the triple lock, and could it be ditched?Read moreIts report said that, during the period, “increased returns to savings are likely to have increased the attractiveness of Isas as a means to reduce savings income tax liabilities”.This “dash for cash” is likely to have accelerated after the period covered because of speculation that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was going to put a cap on cash within an individual’s £20,000-a-year allowance after Labour’s return to power last year.The plan, whichhas been paused, sought to encourage Britons to invest in the shares variety. The number of stocks and shares Isas was up 283,000 at 4.1m, with a total of £31bn saved this way.Rachael Griffin, a tax and financial planning expert at Quilter, said: “These figures don’t yet capture the frenzy of cash Isa ‘stuffing’ in early 2024-25, when rumours swirled that the chancellor might slash the cash Isa allowance. Billions were hurriedly parked into cash.”Griffin added, however, that the appeal of cash was unlikely to persist much longer, in a climate of gradual rates reductions. “Rates are already starting to drift lower,” she said.The figures also highlighted the growing interest in lifetime Isas (Lisas). There was a 28% increase in Lisa use in 2023-24, with a record £2.3bn invested in the near 1m accounts.Lisas allow people to save for their first home or retirement in the same pot. They come with a government bonus, helping to increase nest eggs.Savers can withdraw money if they are buying a first home worth £450,000 or less, are aged 60 or over, or are terminally ill with fewer than 12 months to live. A withdrawal charge of 25% may apply if someone withdraws cash or assets for any other reason and data for 2024-25 showed savers were hit with more than £100m in penalties.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is up from £75m the previous year.“The 25% government bonus for Lisa contributions can really boost people’s savings and help that dream of owning your first home or having a decent retirement feel that bit more real.“However, the way the early exit penalty works is that it not only takes away the benefit of the government bonus but also a chunk of your own savings.”Explore more on these topicsIsasSavingsBanks and building societiesBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, demonstrators are putting pro-Palestinian slogans and symbols on their clothes – and not just for marchesByEllie Violet Bramley. Photographs byEthan ParkerFri 19 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 19 Sep 2025 10.25 EDTShareIt’s early afternoon at the latest national march for Gaza in central London. A man is wearing a sweatshirt bearing a photograph of Hind Rajab, the five-year-old girl who was killed in the Gaza conflict last year along with family members and the paramedics who tried to save her. He doesn’t want to be named. But it is, he says, his attempt “to keep her memory alive, until we get justice … Whether it takes one month, one year, 100 years, I’m not giving up. I’m not going to stop wearing this until the killers are behind bars.”It’s a heart-rending example of a phenomenon common to all these marches over the past two years: people are here to call for an end to the war and the Israeli occupation, and many are using their clothes to bolster their message.Far from being a frivolous afterthought, protest dressing has become an important part of these marches. Wearing the symbols and colours of solidarity can be an expression of grief and a call to action.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenMarima (left), with a friend, and the Rev Poppy Hughes marching on 6 September in London. Photographs: Ethan Parker/The Guardian“Enough is enough,” says Mariama, who is in her 30s and works for the NHS in Nottingham. She is wearing a football-style shirt with a Palestinian flag in place of the club crest. Alongside it are the words “viva Palestina” and a visual representation of the contested area.“It’s one way of giving voice to your opposition, my opposition, to the occupation of Palestine,” says the Rev Poppy Hughes, 65, of her Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) pin badge. Otherwise “there’s nothing to identify you as somebody who’s opposed to the occupation and the genocide and the starvation.”View image in fullscreenLoulou and Suhail on the march. Photographs: Ethan Parker/The GuardianThere’s a sense of shared project about it. “You feel more united when you’re sharing the dress code,” says Suhail, 44, who is here with Loulou, 45; both are wearing their solidarity on their sleeves.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenJaiman and Tony demonstrating solidarity through watermelons. Photographs: Ethan Parker/The GuardianFor the people here, simple things such as a keffiyeh or a badge signify solidarity without words. Watermelons,a symbol of Palestinian solidaritysince public displays of the Palestinian flag were outlawed by Israel, hang as earrings or are crocheted into hats. Jaiman, 28, from Bexley, is wearing a shirt covered in them. So too is 71-year-old Tony from London. A longtime wearer of Hawaiian shirts, he thought he “should get a better fruit”.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLeft, a protester expresses herself from head to toe; right, Lamdy in a customised shirt. Photographs: Ethan Parker/The GuardianOthers are getting creative, wearing entire outfits crafted from keffiyehs or dressing from head to toe in the colours of the Palestinian flag. For each protest, 65-year-old Lamdy customises something. This time it’s an old white shirt painted with a watermelon. “Words are not being heard,” she says.Protest dressing has long been used as a way to express support for a cause. For Camille Benda, author of Dressing the Resistance: The Visual Language ofProtest, it is “using objects in the form of garments, accessories, clothing, fashion, costume, to send a non-verbal visual message”. According to Stanford’s Richard Ford, author of Dress Codes: Crimes of Fashion and Laws of Attire, while “the specifics vary quite a lot … it’s when people choose a common style of dress as a symbol of their political struggle”. He points to the suffragette movement wearing white and people during the civil rights movement wearing their “Sunday best”.View image in fullscreenTaylor Benac dances in a pink ‘pussyhat’ during the Women’s March in Washington DC, January 2017. Photograph: Ali Smith/The GuardianThe impact is greatest when single items become shorthand for a movement.The pink pussyhatbecame a symbol in the first Trump administration. In austerity-gripped Greece,rubber gloves became an emblem of political discontent. And there were thegilets jaunesof the recent French revolts.The power of these clothes is demonstrated by how authorities try to stymie it: during the first Palestinian intifada, women would stitch symbols of resistance on to what became known as “intifada dresses” – an update of the region’straditional style of embroidery, known astatreez. According to Rachel Dedman, atatreezexpert, “these dresses, just like a flag … were forbidden and dangerous to have”. Even in the UK, protest clothing is controversial: at a protest in Parliament Square last August, one man was arrested for wearing a T-shirt with the slogan “Plasticine Action”, complete with a picture of the Aardman character Morph. (He was released not long afterwards.)View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLeft, a marcher sending a strong message; right, Richard Daniel, 66, sports a Plasticine Action T-shirt. Photographs: Ethan Parker/The GuardianAyham Hassan is a Palestinian designer whose graduate collection at Central Saint Martins this summer caused waves. Originally from the West Bank but currently in London, he understands what it is to protest through clothes, which he does symbolically through his work, “because I’m discussing a concept that is about my culture … about the genocide, it becomes unapologetically a protest to free Palestine”. But he also uses fashion to express himself more tangibly: for his graduate collection, atatreezscarf made by his mum had to be, in effect, smuggled from the West Bank to London. Even though there’s no law against it, he says, “it’s not safe to havetatreezgoing from one place to another because it’s clearly Palestinian … and it’s clear that they see that as a threat.”But protest dressing goes way beyond protests – and for many, it is about incorporating these symbols into the everyday, keeping these causes front and centre even without the context of a protest. That extends to commutes, offices, parks and, over the summer, festivals – long a location where hedonism meets politics, and protest has historically found a voiceAya Mousawi, a regular protest-goer andeditor of Love Is Resistance, a new book of posters in solitary with Palestine, stencils her own clothes with flags and slogans; she wears them not just to the protests, but in her everyday life. It is, she says, “a visible mark of this community that has formed and is growing in power”.If, in the past, people taking part in movements dressed with more uniformity, now we’re seeing more individual expression. Ford explains: “To get that many people together required a long-standing organisation with a lot of administrative chops, so it was easier to have a dress code if you had that kind of organisational apparatus. Today it’s more decentralised. People can show up, wear what they’re going to wear.” It goes for the protests but also more broadly.View image in fullscreenLaura O’Herlihy at the End of the Road festival. Photograph: Ellie Violet Bramley“Wearing something is such a good way of doing that,” says Laura O’Herlihy, a 51-year-old from Dublin wearing a keffiyeh and badges at the End of the Road festival in late August. “Every time you look down or anybody looks across the crowd, they just see it, and it keeps it there.”Jim Derbyson, from a village outside Bristol, has dyed his beard the colours of the flag. “It raises consciousness of the situation. You can’t just let it disappear.” These symbols are appearing worldwide. Riffs on football jerseys, like Mariama’s, are popular:Greta Thunberg has been wearing onefrom the Dublin football club Bohemians on board the flotilla en route to Gaza. And at the Cannes film festival last year,Bella Hadid wore a keffiyeh dress.But protest dressing in 2025 also comes with limits. Katharine Hamnett is one of the pioneers of the slogan T-shirt, having famously worn one that read “58% DON’T WANT PERSHING” to meet Margaret Thatcher in 1984. She hasn’t stopped using the medium since, and last week launcheda new design in collaboration withAnnie Lennox that reads, simply: “Let Gaza Live”.“T-shirts are still great, as they become your caption,” Hamnett says. “They are in your brain instantly.”It is perhaps why other designers, from Simone Rocha and Priya Ahluwalia to Bella Freud, arereleasing their own slogan T-shirtsto support Palestinian humanitarian organisations.Done right, protest dressing can be a powerful tool for a movement. “We’re all speaking with one voice just by virtue of what we’re wearing,” says Ford. “With the advent of mass media, photographs or films of people all dressed in similar clothing together in a mass protest is a really powerful visual image.”Explore more on these topicsProtestPalestine ActionIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was conceived as an economic regeneration project in the 1970s to join up and provide tourism to tiny villages with ageing populations and declining industry. In each location, one or more providers elects to supply overnight accommodation and food to hikers; as a result the variety in our stays was immense. It cost €60-70pp pn for half-board, sometimes less in dormitories. It’s a very quiet trail compared with many in the Alps, and we often had it to ourselves.

When we moved out of our tiny flat and into a house, a brewing kit arrived in the post as a housewarming gift from his parents, soon followed by a small hop plant from an old friend, which now takes up more room than anything else in the veg patch.This perennial has proved easy to grow. Once established, you can expect a flush of bines (similar to vines) to emerge every spring, bearing hop flowers, or “cones”, which are ready to be picked about now.While our plant was grown by a professional, you can grow your own hop from rhizome cuttings taken from a healthy parent plant in spring. Having cleared a section of soil around the plant’s crown, use a clean, sharp knife to remove a 15cm section of the rhizome. If you’re not able to plant this cutting in its final position fairly swiftly, wrap it in damp kitchen paper and store somewhere cool, or pot up into a compost-filled container.Our hop romps away in multiple directions, partly grasping at a trellis, partly crawling along the groundIt’s also possible to propagate hops from stem cuttings taken in spring and summer, by selecting a healthy section of bine, stripping away all but a couple of top leaves, and placing it in some gritty potting compost.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Only female plants produce the hop cones used to make beer. Hops need full sun, and should be planted into fertile soil with good drainage. Be very mindful of where you position your plant. If you’re fortunate, your bine will be rampant and take up a lot of space – swamping your raspberry bed, in my case.If you’re eager for a plentiful crop, training your bines on to a support structure is worth the effort. Wear gloves and long sleeves when handling bines: they’re covered in short, hooked hairs that can cause painful grazes.Our hop romps away in multiple directions, partly grasping at a trellis, partly crawling along the ground, yet it still provides plenty of hops for home brewing. The flowers are ready to harvest when they’re turning from green to yellow and becoming papery, filled with yellow lupulin powder (which imparts flavour to beer), and exuding a heady fragrance. After harvesting, leave them to dry out completely before you start the brewing process, or store them in the freezer. Hops can also be steeped in hot water to make a (very bitter) tea that is said to help you sleep.Explore more on these topicsGardensBeerGardening advicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not everyone can say they have befriended a lobster and a sharkJoseph DituriFri 19 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 19 Sep 2025 03.27 EDTShareMy stay inJules’ Undersea Lodgestarted in March 2023. The habitat, secured to the bed of a 30ft-deep lagoon in Key Largo, Florida, wasn’t the most comfortable hotel I’ve spent time in, but then I wasn’t there for a holiday. I’m a biomedical researcher and I was there as part of a scientific mission called Project Neptune 100.The main aim was to research the mental and physical impact on the human body of living in increased atmospheric pressure – 70% higher than at the surface. It was also to study what happens when you leave someone alone in a confined environment for 100 days. The data might have all manner of applications – for future missions to Mars, for example.Having spent 28 years as a naval diver before retraining, this kind of environment wasn’t new to me, so when the opportunity arose, I was happy to be a human guinea pig. My girlfriend’s ultimatum: “You can have 100 days, but not a minute longer.”To reach the lodge, I had to scuba dive to the bottom of the lagoon. It was accessed from underneath through a “moon pool”, via which food would be delivered by a diver using a sealed plastic case. This central wet room also housed a small toilet and shower. On either side, a couple of 2m x 6m tubes contained the sleeping quarters and a kitchen-living room.The only miserable thing was cracking a tooth on day 12, which I then had to endure for the remaining 88Each day I rose at 5am, did push-ups and a workout using resistance bands, had coffee and breakfast, then carried out a range of biomedical engineering experiments on myself throughout the day, such as checking my heart and brain, blood, urine and saliva. At 9pm I’d meditate, then have eight hours of sleep filled with vivid dreams.There was room to stand in the lodge, but I cracked my head repeatedly on a screw sticking down from the ceiling. After a couple of months, that stopped – I’d shrunk by three-quarters of an inch. Whereas astronauts are in low gravity and get taller over time, aquanauts’ spines become compressed.Experience: I am the world porridge-making championRead moreInitially, I had some concerns about how the isolation and lack of sunlight might affect me, but I took vitamin D supplements and had weekly sessions with a psychologist. I did miss more tactile interactions with friends and family, though my 80-year-old mother took a scuba lesson to pay me a visit. Otherwise, I had at least one visitor each week – marine scientists, microbiologists, astronauts and doctors – and continued to teach my biomedical engineering class via Zoom.The lagoon is used for diving lessons and I’d always pause to acknowledge the children outside. Even after catching a sickness bug, I crawled over from the bucket I’d been throwing up in to high-five a kid swimming past.Another regular visitor was a lobster I called Fred. When Fred once passed by doing a strange undulating motion, I pulled on my scuba gear and swam after him, but found just his empty shell and a little pink, gelatinous thing skulking away from it. I’d just watched a lobster moult underwater. How often do people get to see that?Early on, I also spotted a 1.5m nurse shark, circling at some distance. Over the weeks, she gradually got closer and closer. Seventy-five days in (just after I’d beaten the world record for staying underwater without depressurisation), I found her sleeping on the step at the entrance to the moon pool. I had to move her out of the way to get into the water to exercise. She’d seen me every day and finally accepted me as part of her environment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Tests revealed that collagen and stem cell production in my body had increased, suggesting a potential slowing down of the effects of ageing. I doubled my REM sleep, waking up refreshed and alert every morning. Thanks to the increase in my metabolism, I lost 23lb and 100 points on my cholesterol.The only miserable thing was cracking a tooth on day 12, which I had to endure for the remaining 88. Feeling the sun on my face again and getting my tooth fixed were the most satisfying aspects of returning to dry land.Back at normal atmospheric pressure, I spent a little time each day hanging upside down. After seven or eight months, I was 6ft 1in again.As told to Chris BroughtonDo you have an experience to share?

It is a blazing summer day and a group of researchers, engineers, students and a city councillor, dressed in hi-vis clothing and safety goggles, are gathered at the site of the city’s new and ambitious project to help manage the toxic problem of road runoff.After six years, the Wild Park rainscape, formed of a vegetated swale linked to four planted basins, is at the tail end of development. Dry and golden beneath the sun, the landscape, if all goes well, will soon teem with lush greenery and wildlife. But it will also be performing a much more critical function: filtering pollutants from runoff to prevent them from seeping into the precious chalk aquifer that lies beneath the city.View image in fullscreenNick Bean, an engineer for Brighton and Hove city council.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianSo little is known about road runoff, the liquid that sloughs off roads and into our waterways when it rains. It is not monitoredby the UK governmentor globally, and the makeup of this chemical and microplastic cocktail will vary from country to country and from one road to another.And yet this toxic liquid – millions of gallons a year – is a significant pollutant in a multitude of ways. The microplastics shed by car tyres make up a quarter of the microplastics in the environment, according toone study. The chemicals in those tyres and the runoff are also highly problematic. Many of them are toxic for aquatic life: in 2020, for example,runoff was linkedto a vast die-off of silver salmon off the US west coast. And, of course, they spread up the food chain. Researchers insouthern Chinarecently found tyre-derived chemicals in most human urine samples. This is especially concerning as some of the chemicals are known carcinogens.The problem is made worse by the climate crisis, which brings heavier rainfall and more rapidly overwhelms city sewage systems. Coping with storm water has become a new challenge for local authorities and governments everywhere.Hundreds of potentially toxic road runoff outfalls polluting England’s riversRead moreBut monitoring the problem or stopping it at source seems, for now, too complex. In most cases, local authorities and governments seem to more or less shrug it off.In some locations, such as Brighton, where the entirety of the city’s drinking water is sourced from the underground chalk aquifer, a shrug will not do: preventing pollution from seeping into the ground is critical to reducing reliance on chemical water treatments.View image in fullscreenThe microplastics shed by car tyres comprise a staggering quarter of the microplastics in the environment.Photograph: Radius Images/AlamyHence the rainscape, a nature-based structure in Wild Park that will be enhanced by technology and designed to treat the water running off a 2.5-mile stretch of the A27. TheAquifer Project, formed in 2016 to protect the chalk aquifer, secured£1.79m funding from National Highways to build the rainscape with the help of Brighton and Hove city council.As Mélanie David-Durand, a former biosphere programme manager for the Living CoastUnesco biosphere, which manages the Aquifer Project, explains: “If we don’t have the water being soaked up by nature-based solutions like swales or rainscapes then it will directly flood into the sewers and trickle down through the aquifer.”Research by Martin Smith, a professor of geochemistry at the University of Brighton, found that contaminant levels in the area’s water were higher than recommended.Smith says: “Lead is still there – a legacy from when lead used to be in fuel. There’s chromium from the road paints. We also looked at polyaromatic hydrocarbons, which come out of the bitumen and from the rubber in the tyres, because they are known to be quite deleterious environmental contaminants.”Under the new system, instead of seeping directly into the chalk aquifer, water from the motorway will be captured and will flow along a 1.2-mile route, passing through multiple stages of filtration, before being released into the ground. Two vortex separators have been installed in a balancing pond near the motorway to remove particulates, such as grains and granules.“What we managed to show,” says Smith, “is that a major part of that contaminant load [from road runoff] is in the solids. So if you can get the solids out then you’ve done 80% of the treatment job.”The remaining water will then move through three bays of reeds and planting before being piped to settlement basins in Wild Park.View image in fullscreenThe Wild Park rainscape under construction in Brighton.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian“The finer material will get filtered out by the plants … The mixture of extra oxygen in the water, sunlight, and the action of the plants themselves will break down some of the remaining contaminants,” Smith says. “So finally, what comes out of the basin down here should be really good quality water.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe team behind the development are hopeful the landscape will improve the local community’s access to nature as well.David-Durand says: “It’s not just managing the water, it’s really about people. Wild Park nature reserve is in the Moulsecoomb area, which is highly deprived. And we hope this is going to make that area more appealing, both for the residents and for people from outside the area. We’re really hoping that the ponds and the water will help people of all ages and backgrounds enjoy nature, feel good and enjoy their lives.”It is the same approach that other countries are taking to road runoff. Monitoring it at source is extremely challenging, but installing green infrastructure such as bioswales, wetlands and permeable pavements is one way to tackle the issue.In Michigan in the US,permeable pavementsand a rain garden have been created. In Guangxi in China, storm water runoff has beenreduced by 75%by implementing a palette of measures. Our global understanding of how to implement the“sponge city”is leaping ahead.Across the road from Wild Park, children at Moulsecoomb primary school are reaping the benefits of their own rain garden, spending lunchtimes fishing for wildlife in ponds.The rain garden, installed at the school with support from the Aquifer Project and local organisations, was similarly designed to reduce water pollution and mitigate flood risk.Waterfrom the school’s rooftops is funnelled through drainpipes into flowerbeds, water storage systems and ponds.View image in fullscreenWater from Moulsecoomb primary school is funnelled into flowerbeds, water storage systems and ponds.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianKatie Eberstein, the environmental education programme manager at Brighton and Hove city council, who is raising awareness of water issues with schools across the city, says: “It’s an important place to engage young people so that they understand how water can get polluted, how flooding causes problems, and how we can use nature to keep our water clean.”Smith and his students will continue to monitor the performance of the Wild Park rainscape over the coming years – data he hopes to share with other councils to inspire similar developments.He says: “We’ve now got a demonstration site to show other councils and authorities managing road systems that this kind of system works.”Tours of the rainscape will take place on 21 September from noon to 3pm as part of acommunity eventto celebrate Wild Park.Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesPollutionWaterBrightonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Social media videos show bodies trapped under rubble and debris.RSF has not commented on the incident. The paramilitary group has been engaged in a ragingcivil war with the Sudanese Armed Forcessince April 2023 but since the army’s capture of the capital, Khartoum, in March, the RSF has been fighting to maintain territorial dominance of Darfur, its stronghold.El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state, is the last remaining capital in the region controlled by the Sudanese army and has been under siege for more than a year.Research from YaleUniversity’s Humanitarian Research Lab shows RSF is building an earthen wall around El Fasher to trap people inside.View image in fullscreenBefore and after satellite images showing damage to a building within the former Unamid compound in El Fasher, sustained between 15 and 18 September.Photograph: Maxar TechnologiesSatellite imagery released by the lab on Thursday showed RSF forces advancing in many areas, including around the Abu Shouk camp and the former peacekeeping base for United Nations-African Union Hybrid Operation in Darfur (Unamid), now used by anti-RSF joint forces.The city and the camp have been under an intensifying assault in recent months, experiencing artillery shelling and drone strikes.Brutal attacks there killed at least 89 civilians over a 10-day period last month, with the UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) saying some appeared to have been summary executions.View image in fullscreenBefore and after satellite images of the Abu Shouk IDP camp showing thermal scarring and damage to several structures that took place in recent days.Photograph: Maxar TechnologiesLast week, at least 13 people were killed in shelling of the city by RSF.A new reportby the OHCHR said at least 3,384 civilians were killed between January and June, mostly in Darfur – a figure representing nearly 80% of civilian casualties in Sudan last year.El Fasher mapMost of the killings were caused by artillery shelling and air and drone strikes in densely populated areas, and many deaths happened during the RSF’s offensive on El Fasher as well as the Zamzam and Abu Shouk camps in April, the report said.The UN and rights groups have in the past reported that some killings have been ethnically targeted.El Fasher is under a communications blackout, making it difficult to verify casualties or coordinate aid. At a briefing on Tuesday on the situation in the city organised by Avaaz, an advocacy group, participants talked of dire and deteriorating conditions in the city due to the assaults.Fatima, an artist and lecturer who works with displaced communities in North Darfur, said civilians in El Fasher were enduring deliberate shelling, rapid deaths, slow deaths, injuries, starvation, disease, intimidation and other inhumane practices daily. “This is a real catastrophe,” she said.Mohammad Duda, spokesperson of Zamzam camp in North Darfur, said people in El Fasher were “being forced to hide in buried shipping containers as makeshift shelters”. He appealed to the international community “to intervene immediately and save the people of El Fasher from this catastrophic humanitarian crisis”.Avaaz expressed concern that if El Fasher fell, RSF could carry out ethnically targeted attacks, as reported afer the capture ofZamzamthis year and inGeneinain 2023.The fighting in Sudan has created what theUN has describedas one of the worst humanitarian crises of the 21st century.More than 150,000 peoplehave been killed,more than 14 millionhave been displaced from their homes and a larger number arein need of humanitarian aid.Explore more on these topicsSudanMiddle East and north AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It was conducted through theTurkana Health and Genomics Project(THGP), an initiative bringing together researchers from Kenya and the US, including Kemri, theTurkana Basin Institute(TBI), Vanderbilt University in Tennessee and the University of California, Berkeley.The genomic analysis found eight regions of DNA that had undergone natural selection but one gene, STC1,expressed in the kidneys, showed exceptionally strong evidence of humans adapting to extreme environments. Evidence included the body’s response to dehydration and processing purine-rich foods such as meat and blood, staples of the Turkana people’s diet.View image in fullscreenTurkana women give water to their goats from a shallow well. The region is characterised by extreme heat, water scarcity, and limited vegetation.Photograph: Monicah Mwangi/ReutersTurkana stretches across a large swathe of northern Kenya, one of the most arid regions in the world, where shade is scarce and water even more rare. Rainfall arrives in short, unpredictable bursts, and securing enough water for themselves and their herds of cattle, goats and camels is a daily chore. Fetching water can involve journeys of many hours each day across hot terrain devoid of vegetation.About 70% to 80% of the community’s diet comes from animal sources, mostly milk, blood and meat, reflecting resourcefulness and adaptation to scarcity, which is common among pastoralist societies around the world living in environments where crops cannot grow and where markets are too far away to be accessed on foot.Yet, after years of documenting the Turkana people’s lifestyle and studying blood and urine samples to assess their health, researchers found that, although the community consumes too much purine, which should lead to gout, the condition rarely appears among the Turkana.“About 90% of the people assessed were dehydrated but generally healthy,” said Prof Julien Ayroles, from the University of California, Berkeley, one of the project’s co-principal investigators. “The Turkana have maintained their traditional way of life for thousands of years, providing us with an extraordinary window into human adaptation.”Genetic adaptations are believed to have emerged about 5,000 years ago, coinciding with the aridification of northern Africa, the study suggesting that as the region became drier, natural selection favoured variants that enhanced survival under arid conditions.View image in fullscreenA Turkana woman carries the leg of a cow as she migrates with Turkana people to find water and grazing land for cattle.Photograph: Goran Tomašević/Reuters“This research demonstrates how our ancestors adapted to dramatic climate shifts through genetic evolution,” said Dr Epem Esekon, responsible for Turkana county’s health and sanitation sector.However, as more members of the Turkana community move to towns and cities, the same adaptations that once protected them may now increase risks of chronic lifestyle diseases, a phenomenon known as “evolutionary mismatch”. This occurs when adaptations shaped by one environment become liabilities in another, highlighting how rapid lifestyle changes interact with deep evolutionary history.When the researchers compared biomarkers and gene expression – the process by which information encoded in a gene is turned into a function–in the genomes of city-dwelling Turkana people with their kin still living in the villages, they found an imbalance of gene expression that may predispose them to chronic diseases such as hypertension or obesity, which are more common in urban settings where diets, water availability and activity patterns are radically different.“Understanding these adaptations will guide health programmes for the Turkana, especially as some shift from traditional pastoralism to city life,” said Miano.As the world faces rapid environmental change, the Turkana people’s story offers inspiration and practical insights. For generations, the researchers said, this community has developed and maintained sophisticated strategies for surviving in a challenging and variable environment, knowledge that becomes increasingly valuable as the climate crisis creates new survival challenges.View image in fullscreenThe study has combined genetic findings with community insights on environment, lifestyle and health.Photograph: Luis Tato/AFP/Getty ImagesFor close to a decade, the project centred on co-production of knowledge, combining genomic science with ecological and anthropological expertise. The agenda emerged from dialogue with Turkana elders, scientists, chiefs and community members, conversations about health, diet and change, often in the evening around a campfire.Kenya’s ‘blood desert’: can walking donor banks and drones help more patients survive?Read more“Working with the Turkana has been transformative for this study,” said Dr Sospeter Ngoci Njeru, a co-principal investigator and deputy director at Kemri’s Centre for Community Driven Research. “Their insights into their environment, lifestyle and health have been essential to connecting our genetic findings to real-world biology and survival strategies.”Dr Dino Martins, director of the TBI, says the deep ecological connection and the adaptation to one of the Earth’s hottest and most arid environments provides lessons for how climate continues to shape human biology and health. “The discovery adds another important piece of knowledge to our wider understanding of human evolution,” he said.Researchers say other pastoralist communities in similar environments in east Africa, including the Rendille, Samburu, Borana, Merille, Karamojong and Toposa, are likely to share this adaptation.The research team will create a podcast in the Turkana language to share the study’s findings and also plan to offer the community practical health considerations that arise from rapidly changing lifestyles.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentPastoralismKenyaAfricaFarmingDesertsGlobal researchnewsShareReuse this content"

She said she would “continue to challenge any last-minute, vexatious attempts to frustrate a removal in the courts”.The returns agreement had faced growing scrutiny after reports of flights for removals being cancelled earlier this week.Another Eritrean man successfully asked the high court on Tuesday to temporarily block his deportation after the judge found there was a “serious issue to be tried” over whether his removal was lawful amid claims he had been trafficked.But on Thursday, in the second legal challenge brought against the Home Office over the deal, the same judge refused the migrant’s application for interim relief before a full legal challenge against the decision to deport him.Barristers for the man, who cannot be named, had argued that the decision was “procedurally unfair” as he had not been given sufficient opportunity to put forward evidence supporting his claim that he was an “alleged trafficking victim”.In a ruling, Mr Justice Sheldon said “there is no serious issue to be tried in this case” and that the man gave differing accounts of his allegations of trafficking.Ministers agreed the pilot scheme with the French government in July as part of efforts to deter the record number of arrivals by small boat.Hours after the first removal under the agreement, Trump urged the prime minister to involve the military.At a joint Chequers press conference with the prime minister, the president highlighted his own record in securing the US borders and suggested the UK faced a similar challenge.He said: “You have people coming in and I told the prime minister I would stop it, and it doesn’t matter if you call out the military, it doesn’t matter what means you use.“It destroys countries from within and we’re actually now removing a lot of the people that came into our country.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumFranceEuropeEritreaAfricaHome OfficeForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The UK announcement is now expected to come on Sunday withDavid Lammy, the deputy prime minister and former foreign secretary, taking a lead role. He will emphasise that UK recognition assumes Hamas will play no role in a future Palestinian government.What the UK’s recognition of Palestinian statehood will meanRead moreAbbas had intended to address the UN general assembly to thank those states that had come to recognise a Palestinian right to self determination and to set out his vision for a future Palestine free from the rule of Hamas.Iran’s nuclear programme will also be in focus at the UN with the apparent breakdown in talks between Tehran and European leaders on the reimposition of UN sanctions upon Iran.France, the UK and Germany – the three European states calling for the reimposition – claim Iran is failing to re-engage with the US on the future of its nuclear programme after theUS-Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear sites. There seems a growing likelihood that the UN sanctions will be reimposed next week, and that it will lead to further calls for a military strike on Iran by Israel, possibly with the US, citing the threat posed by Iran.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is due to address the general assembly on Friday and soon afterwards is set to hold talks with Trump in Washington.In a move endorsed byFranceand the UK, the security council on Friday rejected a resolution to permanently lift sanctions on Iran, but Tehran and key European powers still have eight days to try and agree to a delay, including through talks in New York. Iran described the actions of the three European powers as “illegal, unjustified and provocative”.Britain, France and Germany launched a 30-day process on 28 August to reimpose UN sanctions, accusing Tehran of failing to abide by a 2015 deal with world powers that aimed to prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon.Iran says it has sent messages to the US to discuss terms for reopening talks, but that it has received no response.Explore more on these topicsMahmoud AbbasPalestinian territoriesUnited NationsDonald TrumpCanadaFranceDavid LammynewsShareReuse this content"

But Trump offered no details about the agreement or when it would be signed.The American and Chinese leaders had connected over a phone call earlier in the day, the first direct contact between the two leaders since June.Chinaand the US have been at loggerheads over trade negotiations and the future of TikTok, a Chinese-owned social media platform that faces a ban in the US.Trump had said earlier this week that Washington and Beijing hadagreed a deal on TikTokunder which it would be transferred to US control, but details of the framework have been scant, and elementsreportedlyremain to be hashed out. Investors including the US software giant Oraclehave been in talksto take a large stake in TikTok’s US operations, which would dilute the amount of China-based ownership to comply with a law Congress passed last year.The Wall Street Journalreportedon Friday that investors in the TikTok deal would pay the US a fee in exchange for negotiating the agreement with China.Trump celebrates TikTok deal as Beijing suggests US app would use China’s algorithmRead moreIn the call on Friday, the Chinese president “emphasised the vital importance of US-China relations”, according to a Chinese readout of Friday’s phone call.“China’s position on the TikTok issue is clear,” the readout said. “The Chinese government respects the wishes of companies and welcomes them to conduct commercial negotiations based on market rules and reach solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and balance interests. China hopes that the US will provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies to invest in the US.”China described the call as “pragmatic, positive, and constructive”.In a post on Truth Social, Trump described the call as “very productive”. “We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,” Trump wrote.He said he and Xi would meet at the Asia-Pacificeconomic cooperation summit in South Korea in late October and he would visit China “in the early part of next year”. China has not commented on when Trump and Xi might meet in person.The TikTok deal was negotiated this week in Madrid, where the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and the Chinese vice-premier He Lifeng met to negotiate a trade deal. The US and China have agreed to a temporary pause in the trade war and the deadline to reach an agreement is 10 November.TikTok owner set to launch share buyback valuing company at $330bnRead moreThe call came as Trump returned from a state visit to the UK, which was accompanied by news of amultibillion-dollar investment dealfor US tech companies in the UK. Microsoft will invest $30bn while Nvidia will invest £11bn.US tech companies have been caught in the cross-hairs of the US-China trade war. This week it was reported that China had ordered its top tech firms to stop buying semiconductors from Nvidia, which makes the world’s most advanced chips. Nvidia’s most high-end models are already banned by the US from being exported to China, but it had developed less sophisticated chips specifically for the Chinese market.The Chinese readout of the call said Trump had praised Beijing’s recentmilitary parade– the biggest showcase of military might in decades – as “magnificent”. The second world war commemoration parade, which was attended by Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un, was widely seen in the west as being a show of unity from an anti-American bloc.However, China has been keen to stress its cooperation with the allied forces in the second world war. According to the readout, Xi on Friday “pointed out that China and the United States were allies who fought side by side during world war two”.China described US-China ties as “the most important bilateral relationship in the world”.Explore more on these topicsTikTokChinaTrump administrationDonald TrumpAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It should also refrain from targeting any third party or undermining its legitimate rights and interests.“We hope that the PNG side will continue to uphold independence and self-reliance, properly handle issues bearing on its sovereignty and long-term interests,” it said.Anthony Albanese fails to seal defence treaty between Australia and PNGRead moreThe statement comes after Australia and its former colony were expected this week to ratify thePukpuk mutual defence treaty.But Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, left Port Moresby on Wednesdaywithout signing the dealwith his counterpart,James Marape. Instead, Albanese sealed a communique that laid out the wording of the pact after Papua New Guniea’s cabinet failed to agree to the deal.Albanese said the text of the defence agreement had been confirmed but both governments had more work to do. If signed, the treaty is expected to lock the two countries into joint defence arrangements in the event of a military attack, and to allow citizens of both countries to serve in the defence forces of the other.“We will go through our respective cabinet processes and expect to finalise the signing of the treaty, the words of which have been agreed, in coming weeks,” Albanese told a press conference in Port Moresby on Wednesday.Speaking to the Guardian, politicians and several prominent ex-military figures in Papua New Guinea have expressed reservations about the defence deal, arguing that it could impinge on the country’s independence.The leader of the opposition, Douglas Tomuriesa, said Papua New Guinea “needs strong partnerships but not at the cost of our constitutional authority, legal protections for our citizens or independent decision-making”.In a statement, Tomuriesa said he welcomed cooperation to strengthen the defence force but any arrangement must contain safeguards and “review mechanisms to keep sovereignty intact”.Retired major general Jerry Singirok, commander of the Papua New Guinea defence force during the 1990s, described the treaty as a “violation” of the constitution. He noted that Papua New Guinea had an “important principle … of not being aligned to any countries in the face of threat”.“Because our foreign policy says that we are friends to all and enemies to none,” he said. “China is not a threat or enemy to Papua New Guinea. It’s [as] simple as that. This is the superpower rivalry in the region against smaller Pacific states.”‘We dreamed of a better future’: remembering the first moments of Papua New Guinea in 1975Read moreFormer Papua New Guinea defence force (PNGDF) commander Maj Gen Gilbert Toropo agreed there were “competing interests in the region”. He said Papua New Guinea “stands in the crossroads of the region … where Papua New Guinea is going to be the playground for our big players”.Toropo said Australia and Papua New Guinea should forge stronger ties, but not at the expense of his country’s “freedom to engage with other countries”.“As a sovereign nation, we should have the flexibility to reach out to the rest of the world for our prosperity,” he said, adding that every Papua New Guinean should be consulted and made aware of the treaty’s contents.Peter Ilau, PNGDF commander between 2001 and 2010, emphasised that Papua New Guinea could not compromise its sovereignty because of a “nice looking decree” that appeared to cover “all aspects of friendship, partnership, traditional friends”.Analysts have also joined the call for the deal not to be rushed through, as former commander Singirok urged Papua New Guinea to consider alternative ways to strengthen the alliance.“We have a very good close relationship with Australia,” he said. “But I’m sure there are other ways to develop our capabilities without absorbing our military into the Australian army.”Explore more on these topicsPapua New GuineaChinaPacific islandsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

From 2025 onward, no productive land can be converted into commercial facilities.”Famous for its lush, green rice paddies and stunning beaches, the “island of the Gods” has undergone rapid change over the past half-century with locals and tourists complaining about the traffic,pollution and badly behaved foreignersthat have come with the hotels and resorts that now swamp the island.Indonesia said last year that it would place amoratorium on new hotelsamid fears of overdevelopment, but the plan failed to eventuate. The new bylaws are expected to be brought into effect by the end of 2025.The move follows a warning from Indonesia’s meteorology and climate agency about the potential for an extreme rainy season this year, and a worsening waste crisis that has aggravated flooding in several regions, including Bali.Flooding is common in Indonesia during the wet season, which typically runs from September to March.However, scientists say the climate crisis is intensifying the rainy season, bringing heavier rainfall and more frequent flash floods. Overdevelopment and widespread deforestation are believed to be worsening the impact of flooding.Indonesia’s environmental minister, Hanif Faisal Nurofiq, said after the floods that the new bylaws were an important step for the island.“This is also crucial for Bali’s tourism as the recent flooding has drawn serious attention,” he said.“I actually told the governor last week that I really hope he will immediately stop the land conversions in Bali. This is extremely important.”Extreme rainfall is more common and more intense because of human-caused climate breakdown across most of the world,particularly in Europe, most of Asia, central and eastern North America, and parts of South America, Africa and Australia.This is because warmer air can hold more water vapour. Flooding has most likely become more frequent and severe in these locations as a result, but is also affected by human factors, such as the existence of flood defences and land use.Explore more on these topicsBaliIndonesiaExtreme weatherAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

They are angry, I’m angry. We should all be angry, because what is happening is not right.”Civil society and church organisations are among groups that have called for the joint demonstrations, which have parallels with outrage over alleged government corruption and privilege across the region.From Colombo to Kathmandu, the furious youth movements toppling entrenched elitesRead moreA gen Z-led protest movementtoppled the government of Nepalthis month, while a series of demonstrations alsoerupted in Indonesia, sparked by privileges afforded to lawmakers, which the government has since been forced to retract.This week angry young people in East Timor also took to the streets to demand that a plan to give lawmakers free SUVs be revoked. In the face of the unrest, the government has now scrapped the plan.In the Philippines, public anger has been intensifying over so-called ghost infrastructure projects after Marcos put them centre stage in a July state of the nation address that followed weeks of deadly flooding.Martin Romualdez, a cousin of President Marcos and the speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives, tendered his resignation on Wednesday.“The issues surrounding certain infrastructure projects have raised questions that weigh not only upon me but upon this institution we all serve,” Romualdez said.“The longer I stay, the heavier that burden grows.”In a speech before the plenary, Romualdez said he had tendered his resignation with “a full heart and a clear conscience”.“I do this so that the independent commission on infrastructure may pursue its mandate freely and fully – without doubt, without interference and without undue influence,” he said, adding that he unequivocally supported calls for accountability.Last week, the owners of a construction firm accused nearly 30 House members and officials in the department of public works and highways of taking cash payments.Marcos on Monday announced former supreme court justice Andres Reyes would head a three-person commission tasked with looking into the past decade of flood-control projects.Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesAsia PacificNepalSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Fossil fuel exports would continue, but be worth less than $30bn by 2050, according to the modelling.A chart of Treasury modelling showing that as Australia heads to net zero the value of fossil fuel exports plummetsA chart of Treasury modelling showing that as Australia heads to net zero, the value of fossil fuel exports plummetsThe amount of gas and LNG produced in Australia would fall between 24% and 27% by 2035, and between 66% and 68% by 2050.Coal output would drop between 42% and 51% between now and 2035, and between 71% and 74% by 2050 – a slower reduction than is required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the pace climate scientists say is required.Tim Buckley, the director of thinktank Climate Energy Finance, said it showed Australia’s “gift horse” of fossil fuel revenue could turn into a “resources curse”. “Treasury here is talking about fossil fuel exports reaching as low as $35bn in 2040,” he said.While the value of fossil fuel exports is predicted to crash, export values for commodities needed as the world decarbonises – including green ammonia, green iron, alumina, aluminium and critical minerals like lithium, nickel and cobalt – are expected to boom.The export value of these “green commodities” in the modelling climbed from about $30bn today to at least $80bn in 2035 and between $109bn and $178bn in 2050.“Part of the story of Australia becoming a renewable energy superpower is that we are still a resource extraction-based country, but it becomes a different set of resources,” Reeve said.But Buckley said while he believed green commodities “will boom”, it was not assured that Australia would share the benefits of the boom.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An earlier version stated that Australia’s earnings from coal and gas exports were forecast to fall by $50bn by 2035; in fact, they are set to fall by $60bn by 2030.Explore more on these topicsAustralian economyEnergyClimate crisisFossil fuelsAustralian politicsMiningnewsShareReuse this content"

They know how to raise money. They know how to get attention … but they lack the strategic knowhow to change votes,” they said.View image in fullscreenAdvance anti-immigration advertisement.Photograph: Facebook“That’s the problem with a hardline anti-immigration position in a country like Australia in the year 2025.”A senior Liberal member said the group’s anti-immigration campaign had “racial connotations” and it would not be embraced by the parliamentary party.“A lot of Liberals are very concerned about where Advance is going, and we’re not going to follow them there,” they said.“When you start playing with the fringes like that, you’re going to lose everybody. We won’t be going there. I’ve got no hesitation in saying that.“It’s a hot topic in theLiberal partyat the moment … because it’s very disturbing.”They said criticism of Australia’s migration program was important but it needed to be sensible and respectful.“You can’t do it this way … combining these themes – race and immigration – it will fail.”Another Liberal member said the anti-immigration language “used by a very small cadre” of Liberal colleagues was “not founded on any traditional conservative thinking”.“Everyone who has settled here has not ‘replaced’ anybody. Instead they have enriched our nation,” they said.“To suggest otherwise is not only morally wrong but also turning your back on communities that are looking to elect political leadership that will respond to the challenges faced by every Australian.”TheAustralian Bureau of Statisticsestimates that net overseas migration is below 316,000 in the year to March.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The poll also showed only 4% of respondents rated immigration as their main policy priority.The former prime ministerTony Abbott, an Advance board member, has also used a number of platforms to argue against “mass immigration” in recent months.In a newsletter titled “Mass Immigration Across the Anglo-Sphere Must Cease”, published to his Substack this month, Abbott wrote of his concern that high migrant numbers were “driving economic and social strain”, while also stressing the need for “a strong civic patriotism in the absence of an ethnic one”.In a July podcast with a former Canadian politician, Abbott said immigration numbers needed to be “radically” scaled back, with a focus on assimilation.“If they’re coming to Australia, they’ve got to join Team Australia. They can’t simply live in Hotel Australia,” Abbott said.“Australia has flourished as a country with a predominantly Anglo-Celtic culture and a country with an overwhelmingly Judeo-Christian ethos. They are both precious.“They have to be preserved, and no one should come to Australia without an expectation of living in an Anglo-Celtic culture, with the Judeo-Christian ethos. And we’ve got to be crystal clear about that.”The right-leaning thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs hassimilarly argued against mass immigration.In a media release on Thursday, the IPA’s deputy executive director, Daniel Wild, said “mainstream Australians” were “paying the price” for “the unprecedented surge of Australia’s population, underpinned by mass migration”.Explore more on these topicsAdvance AustraliaLiberal partyAustralian immigration and asylumAustralian politicsMigrationTony AbbottnewsShareReuse this content"

Battery rebates are great, but we still have one-third of households who rent and who can’t even get rooftop solar,” she said.“There has to be a real focus to make sure it’s not just well-off homeowners who benefit from that electrification story.”Explore more on these topicsEnergyAustralian politicsRenewable energySolar powernewsShareReuse this content"

A Nato spokesperson confirmed the latest incident, saying it had “responded immediately and intercepted the Russian aircraft” and describing it as“yet another example of reckless Russian behaviour”.Late on Friday Moscow denied violating Estonian airspace. The Russian defence ministry said three MiG-31s were conducting a routine flight from Karelia, east of Finland, to an airfield in the Kaliningrad region, a Russian exclave bordering Poland and Lithuania.The jets flew over neutral waters of the Baltic Sea, more than 3km (1.8 miles) from Estonia’s Vaindloo island, “without violating Estonian airspace”, it said.The Estonian defence forces earlier said the MiG-31s were intercepted on Friday morning by Italian F-35 fighter jets based in Ämari in Estonia as part of the transatlantic defence alliance’s air policing mission over the Baltic Sea.The Russian fighters entered Estonian airspace near Vaindloo island in the Gulf of Finland, the Estonian military said. The jets did not have flight plans, had turned their transponders off and were not communicating with air traffic control, it said.Estonia’s foreign minister, Margus Tsahkna, said: “Russia has already violated Estonia’s airspace four times this year, which in itself is unacceptable. But today’s incursion … is unprecedentedly brazen.“Russia’s increasingly extensive testing of boundaries and growing aggressiveness must be met with a swift increase in political and economic pressure.”Tallinn summoned Russia’s chargé d’affaires to protest against the violation.EU leaders will discuss their “collective response” to Russia’s violations of European airspace at a meeting in Copenhagen on 1 October, said the European Council president, António Costa. “Today’s violation of Estonian airspace by three Russian military aircraft is another unacceptable provocation,” he wrote on X.Estonia’s prime minister, Kristen Michal, said on Friday evening that the country had requestedNatoopen consultations under article 4 of the alliance’s treaty, which states that members will consult whenever the territory, political independence or security of any is threatened.In a post on X, he confirmed that three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets entered Estonian airspace, and were confronted by Nato fighters, before they were “forced to flee”. “Such violation is totally unacceptable,” Michal said.A Nato spokesperson, Allison Hart, said that the North Atlantic Council will convene early next week to discuss the incident in more detail.At the White House on Friday night, Donald Trump told reporters he would soon be briefed on Russia violating Estonia’s airspace and made clear he was not pleased with the situation. “I don’t love it. I don’t like when that happens. Could be big trouble,” he said.The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, earlier condemned Russia’s actions as “outrageous” as he urged allies to take “strong action” against Moscow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Incursions by Russian aircraft are fairly common in the area, but do not usually last as long as Friday’s incident, experts said.“This could be a test by Russia to see how Nato responds to this type of challenge, but it could also be purely coincidental,” Jakub Godzimirski, a researcher in Russian security policy at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs, told Reuters.“Still, this happens in a given context, having in mind what happened with the drone incursion in Poland a few days ago.”Earlier on Friday, the head of Britain’s foreign intelligence agency, MI6, saidthere was “absolutely no evidence” that Vladimir Putin wanted to negotiate peace in Ukraineand that the Russian president was “stringing us along”.Putin “seeks to impose his imperial will by all means at his disposal. But he cannot succeed,” Richard Moore said. “He thought he was going to win an easy victory. But he and many others underestimated the Ukrainians.”Tallinn, a staunch supporter of Ukraine, said in May that Moscow had briefly sent a fighter jet into Nato airspace over the Baltic Sea during an attempt to stop a Russian-bound oil tanker thought to be part of a “shadow fleet” defying western sanctions.Reuters andAgence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsEstoniaRussiaNatoEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But he alleged that the defamation suit against his publisher fit into a broader pattern of nationalist parties using legal means to intimidate critical voices in the arts.“What we are seeing is far-right parties using the arsenal provided by democracy in order to destroy it,” he told the Guardian.Strache, who served as Austria’s vice-chancellor between 2017 and 2019 butresigned over the so-called Ibiza affaircorruption scandal, has announced his intention to pursue a further defamation claim against Rau personally, for repeating the allegation in an interview with the Austrian playwright Elfriede Jelinek.Rau, meanwhile, said he intends to make his experience the theme of a new theatrical production at Hamburg’s Thalia theatre next February.The defamatory passage was part of a speech Rau made in Berlin in March, in which he spoke about the way the FPÖ has agitated against “woke events” such as Eurovision and the Vienna festival, which Rau has been the artistic director of since 2023.The speech was reprinted in a collection of Rau’s writing called Resistance Has No Form, Resistance Is the Form, which was published in May and withdrawn from sale last week, ahead of the trial.It says: “What can we learn from a period – our period – in which a member of the biggest Austrian party, the FPÖ, a man called H-C Strache, sings the song ‘We’ll manage the seventh million’ in the morning and in the afternoon goes on to visit the Yad Vashem remembrance centre, where the dead of the Holocaust are commemorated?”The mention of the song is a reference to a 2018 scandal where an FPÖ politician was found to have been a member of a fraternity orBurschenschaftwhose songbook made light of the Holocaust and glorified the Wehrmacht.Austria to dissolve Nazi songbook fraternity linked to Freedom partyRead moreOne of these drinking songs contained the line “Step on the gas, you ancient Germanic peoples, we’ll manage the seventh million”. Dating back to the 19th century, the song was sung in the 1930s by liberal fraternities to make fun of the SS but was then adapted by neo-Nazi groups after the war, when the line mocking the Holocaust was added.Rau said that while the specific allegation against Strache was incorrect, he still stood by the broader criticism it was trying to make: that the FPÖ, which was founded by former members of the Nazi party, was now pretending to act as protectors of Jewish interests.As leader of the FPÖ, Strache made several visits to Israel and caused a scandal in 2010 when he visited Yad Vashem wearing not a kippa but the traditional cap of a student fraternity.“Strache’s visit to Yad Vashem wearing the headgear of a German nationalist fraternity was more brazen than anything alleged in my book,” said Rau.While German-language student fraternities can range from far-right national socialists to liberal societies, Austrian fraternities have historically been located on a more narrowly nationalistic spectrum, and more vocal about their commitment to the idea of a “Greater Germany” based on ethnicity, precisely because they were located outside German borders.Explore more on these topicsBooksMilo RauAustriaEuropeHolocaustNazismSecond world warnewsShareReuse this content"

He has been assessed as being at a very high risk of suicide, and said hefeared for his lifeif sent to jail in the US, where he would have no family support. Last year, the then UK home secretary, James Cleverly, said the US request should take priority over Portugal’s.At the high court,Mr Justice Linden ruledthat Cleverly should have considered Coelho’s “proximity to family and friends, his connection with the respective legal systems, his rights and the likely outcomes in the criminal process, and his rights to support in relation to his mental health bearing in mind that he has been found to be a victim of modern slavery”.He added: “The fact that the claimant has been diagnosed with autism and has other issues with his mental health, and the risk of suicide, are also an important part of the circumstances.”Coelho said: “After years of feeling trapped in a nightmare, this judgment feels like the first ray of light. I feel as though I have been properly heard, the high court has looked at the real facts of my case, acknowledged the unfairness of the situation, and has given me hope that my life doesn’t have to be in this state of limbo for ever.“My position has always been clear and has never changed: I have consented to extradition to Portugal, my home country, and I am fully prepared to face the justice system there. I have never tried to evade responsibility, only to be treated with fairness and humanity. This decision has lifted a tremendous weight and I hope the home secretary will now respect the court’s clear judgment and allow this to happen.”The judge also found that Coelho should have been allowed to make representations before the home secretary’s decision was made and that Portugal and the US should make representations too.This means that when the current home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, retakes the decision, as required by the ruling, Coelho will be able to make representations to her as to why the Portuguese request should take priority.Linden further said the original decision was taken on the incorrect basis that all of the victims of the alleged offending were in the US, whereas a key victim was the Portuguese state.Coelho is accused of controlling and administering RaidForums, a hacking forum distributing data breaches facilitating fraud.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our client already consented to his extradition to Portugal. We are pleased that the court recognised the importance of ensuring the minister has both accurate information and considers relevant evidence before reaching such an important decision that will determine our vulnerable client’s fate.”The case has similarities to that ofGary McKinnon, who was also represented by Cooper and who fought a decade-long battle against extradition to the US for hacking into the Pentagon, before Theresa Mayblocked it on human rights groundsbecause medical reports said he was at risk of suicide.The Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases.Explore more on these topicsExtraditionHome OfficePortugalUK criminal justiceEuropeJames CleverlyShabana MahmoodnewsShareReuse this content"

Last year, a quarter of residentsdescribed their neighbourhoodas dirty or very dirty, rising to two in five in the city centre.Hester van Buren, city finance chief and responsible for waste collection, said “however illogical it sounds”, trials in busy shopping streets and parks have suggested that taking away some of the city’s 12,000 litter bins is the answer.“The broken windows theory is that rubbish attracts more rubbish,” she said. “People throw bottles with deposits on them into bins […] The bins are pulled open three times a day and, of course, the litter blowing around attracts vermin.”She said increasing the number of street cleans was a losing battle, adding: “We also need to look at changing behaviour.”Bins will be removed in streets full of takeaways, where businesses are legally required to provide litter collection and cleaning, and from areas where an underground rubbish container is easily accessible.The city is also experimenting with devices that swing shut when opened or have slots where people can “donate” empties, as inDenmark.After aviralLinkedIn post from the entrepreneur Victor Knaap complaining about “rubbish on every corner”, 9,099 locals have signed up for acommunity clean-up dayon Friday.Kor van der Bij, project leader at the Rubbiz foundation, said litter-picking demonstrated that people cared about where they live. “Of course, the government can do its work better and businesses can use less plastic,” he said. “But citizens need to roll up their sleeves too.”Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They have until Sunday to object, with appeals heard on Monday.The prime ministeris preparing to recognise Palestine as an independent statethis weekend, but many Labour members and MPs would like to see the government going further by ceasing all arms trade with Israel and withdrawing military cooperation.Two British MPs ‘denied entry’ into Israel during official West Bank visitRead moreThe Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC), which has support from some Labour MPs, accused party officials of attempting to stifle debate on Palestine at the party conference.The group argued that many of the proposed motions focused on events that took place after the NPF report was published, including the announcement of theIsraeli government’s plans to militarily occupy Gaza City on 8 Augustand thekilling of five Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza City on 10 August.The motions also raised new issues such as comprehensive sanctions and a ban on trade that aids or assists Israel’s violations of international law.There was a huge increase in submitted motions compared with the previous year, reflecting the priority given to the issue by Labour members and local parties.View image in fullscreenJohn McDonnell was among those within Labour calling for Palestine to be debated at conference.Photograph: Chris Bull/ShutterstockJohn McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor and a supporter of the PSC, said: “With more than 30 motions on Palestine submitted to this year’s Labour party conference, it is clear that party members see Israel’s genocide against the Palestinian people as a major issue that needs to be raised on [the] conference floor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Delegates must not be prevented from discussing these issues at conference.”Ben Jamal, the PSC’s director, added: “Just days aftera UN commission of inquiry confirmed that Israel has committed and is committing genocide in Gaza, it is shocking that Labour officials are trying to block a large influx of motions in solidarity with Palestine from being debated at this year’s party conference.”Israel has consistently rejected all accusations of genocide, citing its right to self-defence.Asked whether there would be any opportunity for delegates to debate Palestine at the Liverpool conference, a Labour spokesperson said: “A wide range of topics will be debated and discussed at annual conference.

The Israeli Defence Forces will continue to operate with unprecedented force against Hamas and other terrorist organisations.He added the only possible route south was viaAl-Rashid streetand urged residents to “take this opportunity and join the hundreds of thousands of city residents who have moved south to the humanitarian area”.Strikes by Israeli artillery, tanks and warplanes hit Gaza City again on Thursday as aUNofficial said “new waves of mass displacement” were under way, after about 60,000 fled the new assault in 72 hours earlier this week.Smoke rises after Israeli strikes during a military operation in Gaza City.Photograph: Ebrahim Hajjaj/ReutersIsraeli military officials said Gaza City was a “Hamas stronghold” and that as many as 450,000 civilians had left. The estimate was based on multiple sources, including drone surveillance, an official told the Guardian.Swathes of Gaza City, once a busy commercial and cultural hub, have been reduced to uninhabitable ruins. Until weeks ago, more than a million people were living there, many already displaced numerous times.More on this in a moment, but first here are a number of other key developments:More than a quarter of a million people have been displaced fromGaza Cityin the last month, according to figures from the UN, with tens of thousands more forced to flee makeshift homes and shelters daily in the face of a new Israeli offensive.UK prime minister Keir Starmer has insisted the timing of the UK announcement that it could recognise the state of Palestine as early as Friday has nothing to do with Donald Trump’s visit, even though the US president said at a press conference that he disagreed with Britain’s decision, without elaborating.More than 140 world leaders will arrive in New York next week for the annual United Nations general assembly summit, which will be dominated this year by the future of the Palestinians and Gaza.One world leader who will miss the gathering is Mahmud Abbas, the Palestinian president who Washington denied US visas to attend, along with his officials.The US once again has vetoed a UN security council resolution that had demanded an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages.It also expressed alarm about a recent famine report and Israel’s expanding offensive in Gaza City.

Acled’s researchers may also not have captured all combatant deaths over the six-month period, but their total does include Hamas political figures.The Guardian revealedlast month that internal data from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) indicated a civilian death toll of 83% between the outbreak of war in October 2023 and May of this year.The Acled report also found that incidents involving the demolition of buildings in Gaza had increased significantly since the renewal of hostilities in March, with 698 in the 15 months before, and 500 in the six months since. Many incidents involved more than one building, researchers said.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises from Gaza after an explosion, as seen from Israel.Photograph: Ammar Awad/ReutersA senior Israeli military officer told the Guardian last week that there was “a tension” between protecting civilians and the “demands of fast-moving military operations”.“We are fighting a very different war from any previous conflict anyone has fought anywhere in the world,” they said. “There are strict rules of engagement but what has changed is the policy that was designed for small wars where we wanted to deter [enemies] … We are now fighting in Gaza to ensure that Hamas is not ruling Gaza.”The IDF said on Friday that it would operate with “unprecedented force” in Gaza City, urging residents to flee southwards while announcing the closure of a temporary evacuation route opened 48 hours earlier.Acled said Israeli airstrikes had killed at least 40 commanders and key operatives in Hamas’s military wing since March. Only one senior official from Hamas’s pre-war military council is still in command, the report noted.“Hamas has been weakened undoubtedly and does not think they can now stop or defeat Israel and push them out of Gaza through military force,” said Ameneh Mehvar, Acled’s senior analyst for the Middle East and a co-author of the report. At this point Hamas is trying to “preserve what is left” of the movement”, he added.The monthly number ofHamas clashes with Israeli forceshas declined sharply since the end of the ceasefire as it relies more on booby-trapped buildings and roadside bombs to cause casualties.Four Israeli soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb in Rafah this week, bringing the number killed since March to 54.Mehvar said that although small cells of fighters were scattered across much of Gaza, Hamas was now largely limited to Gaza City and the central town of Deir al-Balah, with some presence in al-Mawasi, the undeveloped and overcrowded coastal area where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been ordered to go by Israeli forces.“These are areas where [Israeli forces] are not operating so logically that is where Hamas would be present. Hamas do obviously hide among civilians, but also in areas where there are none,” said Mehvar.The Israeli offensive in Gaza has killed more than 65,000 people, mostly civilians, and injured more than 160,000 since 7 October 2023. Swathes of the territory have been reduced to ruin, and almost 90% of homes damaged. Health services have collapsed and expert UN-backed monitors declared famine in the north last month.The war was triggered by a Hamas incursion into Israeli during which it killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. It also took more than 250 hostages back to Gaza, of whom 50 remain, though fewer than half are thought to still be alive.TheAcled reportsaid there was no evidence of Hamas systematically stealing aid that was delivered to Gaza by the UN as alleged by Israel, but that some assistance distributed by smaller NGOs might have been diverted by the organisation, which took power in Gaza in 2007.“Israel has created conditions of chaos and violence around aid distribution,” the report said. “At the same time, looting has sharply increased. The pattern of looting shows no evidence of Hamas’ systematic involvement. Hamas has probably diverted aid through other mechanisms and can continue to do so as long as it retains domestic influence.“With little prospect of eliminating Hamas entirely, [Israel’s] government is pursuing a long-term strategy of control: degrading Hamas while blocking alternative Palestinian governing arrangements, pushing Gaza toward unliveable conditions to encourage voluntary emigration and ultimately obstructing any path to Palestinian sovereignty.”Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

The couple were arrested in February as they travelled to their home in Bamyan province, central Afghanistan. They had been held since then without charge and for a long period were separated and detained in a maximum-security prison.They had lived in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, and ran a training and education organisation.Speaking to Sky News at ​Kabul international airport before boarding a flight to Doha, Barbie Reynolds said she was looking forward to “seeing our children and our families”. Asked if she would return to Afghanistan, she said: “If we can.”In a statement, their children and grandchildren said: “This is a moment of immense joy for our family.” They also thankedQatarfor its role in negotiating with the Taliban to secure their release. They said they would be “forever grateful to the Qataris for standing with us during this difficult time”.The statement said: “While the road to recovery will be long as our parents regain their health and spend time with their family, today is a day of tremendous joy and relief.”View image in fullscreenBarbie Reynolds hugs her daughter Sarah Entwistle after landing in Doha.Photograph: Karim Jaafar/AFP/Getty ImagesKeir Starmer welcomed their release and also thanked Qatar. “I know this long-awaited news will come as a huge relief to them and their family,” he said. “I want to pay tribute to the vital role played by Qatar, including the emir, His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani, in securing their freedom.”The minister for the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan, Hamish Falconer, said Qatar had played an essential role in the negotiations. “The government’s ability to help those in need of consular support in Afghanistan is extremely limited. Our travel advice is clear that individuals should not travel to Afghanistan,” he said.Accompanying the couple in Kabul, Richard Lindsay, the UK special envoy to Afghanistan, told Sky News: ““It’s up to the authorities here [in Kabul] to determine why they were detained. We’re grateful at least today is a great humanitarian day and they will be reunited with their family.”Pushed on why they were detained, Lindsay said: “They’ve been released now. I’m not clear what grounds they were held on.”Asked about their health, he said: “I’m not a doctor, but they are very happy. They are very relieved to be going home, they’re just delighted to be reunited with their family.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a very good moment for us to show our appreciation to make sure that this is the way we deal with problems and conflicts and how to resolve it with good manners and with peaceful solutions.”In aninterviewin July with the Guardian, the couple’s son Jonathan Reynolds, who lives in Chicago, said their condition was deteriorating and he feared they would die in prison.Reynolds said his parents had decided to stay after the Taliban returned to power in 2021, despite the security risks. “They said: ‘How could we possibly leave these people we love in their darkest hour?’ But the warning was, ‘if you stay, you’re on your own’,” Jonathan said. “They knew full well that something like this could happen.“We’ve counted the cost as a family for that. They have always said, ‘If this does happen, don’t trade us for some terrorist who’s in prison, and don’t pay a penny in ransom money’. But they never told us what they did want us to do, which has been really, really difficult.”The couple had five children, 17 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, who live in the UK and US. Their eldest son, Simon, died in 1993.The couple published a book,The Sound of a Trumpet, in 2020, which details their early life as Christian missionaries and their evolving faith. Their Christian background raised fears the Taliban had targeted them for their beliefs.The family, however, pointed out that they were not aligned to any faith at the time of their arrest.Their daughter Sarah Entwistle said in March: “Mum and Dad have made it clear in their book that they do not align with any specific organised religion. While their Christian backgrounds are acknowledged, their message transcends labels.”The couple were among the first to be married in a newly built church in Kabul in 1970.

But even as the neighbours fought wars against each other, carried out rival nuclear tests and conducted nightly shows of strength along their heavily militarised border, there was always one thing that brought them together: cricket.But as the two sides came together on Sunday for a match in the Asia Cup tournament, the camaraderie that wasonce celebrated as cricket diplomacyhad vanished.At the end of the game – afterIndiahad won a crushing triumph – instead of the usual respectful handshake between the two sides, the Indian team simply walked off the field.The match was the first meeting of the Indian and Pakistani teams since Delhi accused Islamabad of mastermindinga terrorist attack in the disputed Indian region of Kashmirin April, which killed 26 people. Pakistan denied any involvement.India launched an armed response andfired missiles into Pakistan, leading to four days of tit-for-tat hostilities and exchanges of fire in May that pushed the two nuclear-armed countries closer to all-out war than they had been in decades.Speaking after the match, India’s captain, Suryakumar Yadav, said the decision not to shake hands had been a “team call”.“We had come only to play,” Yadav told Indian media. “Some things are beyond sportsmanship. We dedicate this victory to our armed forces who took part in Operation Sindoor and stand with families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack.”In response, Pakistan’s captain, Salman Ali Agha, did not attend the post-match ceremony. Pakistan’s coach, the New Zealander Mike Hesson, said their side had been “ready to shake hands at the end of the game. We were disappointed that our opposition didn’t do that.”India’s actions were met with outrage in Pakistan. The team lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council, calling for the referee to be removed – a demand the ICC refused.In a statement afterwards, the chair of the Pakistan Cricket Board, Mohsin Naqvi, said it was “utterly disappointing to witness the lack of sportsmanship today”.“We have always advocated for sports and politics to be kept apart,” Naqvi said in an interview with the Guardian. “Cricket is a global sport that should unite rather than divide. Our concern has never been about individuals or governments, but about ensuring clarity, fairness in match protocols, and upholding the spirit of the game.”On Wednesday night, amid threats by the Pakistan team to boycott the rest of the Asia Cup tournament, the match referee, Andy Pycroft, apologised to Agha, describing the handshake incident as a “miscommunication”.After both sides qualified for the second group stage of the tournament, they will meet again on Sunday.Observers said last week’s incident signalled the clear demise of cricket diplomacy – which until recently had helped keep politics off the field even at the lowest moments – and was evidence of just how much Indo-Pakistan relations had soured.In 1987, Pakistan’s president, the army general Zia-ul-Haq, made a surprise visit to India to watch a Test match – part of what he called a “cricket for peace” initiative – as tensions were rising between the two countries.Between 2004 and 2007, the two countries played four successful Test series on each other’s turf. In 2004, as the Indian team travelled to Pakistan, the Indian prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee told them: “Whether you win or lose doesn’t matter to me, but while you are there, you must win the hearts of the Pakistani people.”However, since theMumbai attacks of 2008, which were orchestrated by terrorist groups operating from Pakistan, such cross-border sportsmanship has been increasingly rare, with cricket and politics becoming visibly intertwined in both countries.View image in fullscreenNarendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.Photograph: Saurabh Sirohiya/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockUnder India’s Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, who was elected in 2014, cricket has become increasingly utilised as a political tool. The country’s largest cricket stadium was named after the prime minister, while the ICC, the sport’s powerful global governing body, is run by Jay Shah, the son of India’s home minister and Modi’s closest ally, Amit Shah.In Pakistan, where the heavily jingoistic and anti-India military governs behind the scenes, the cricket board chair, Naqvi, is also the minister of the interior.Sushant Singh, an Indian defence analyst who previously served in the Indian army, said that “instead of building fraternal ties and people-to-people contact”, the cricket field had now become “the site of playing out nationalist fantasies”.The former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi, who travelled to India several times for matches and described himself as a “staunch supporter of cricket diplomacy” lamented its loss. He said every time he had played over the border he “received a lot of love and support from Indians” and that in his two decades of playing, had “never witnessed such off-the-field behaviour from Indian players”.“In the past, the wars and conflict between both countries did not stop cricket matches,” said Afridi. “We greeted each other with respect on the field and we did not see hatred among players. Even during tough times such as theKargil conflict, we remained welcoming to each other and enjoyed meeting off the field as sportsmen.”Osman Samiuddin, a senior editor at ESPNCricinfo and author of The Unquiet Ones: A History of Pakistan Cricket, said the two countries were now in an era where “the opposite of cricket diplomacy is happening”.Citing other recent examples, such when Indiarefused to travel to Pakistan for this year’s Champions Trophy, he said: “They are actually now taking out their hostility through cricket – it’s become both a vehicle and a proxy for the tense relations between the two countries.”He warned that India’s actions at Sunday’s match, and the refusal by the ICC to censure the captain for it, could set a “a dangerous precedent for other players in the future” when it came to keeping politics out of the game.Samiuddin said that given the regimes in both countries, he did not see a return of the old sporting camaraderie, on or off the field, anytime soon. “I just don’t think the political conditions in either country are encouraging enough for it.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

More than 1,000 images were category A – the most serious kind – which includes “sadistic” sexual acts or activity with animals.DS Simon France, of Greater Manchester police (GMP), said Latham was “one of the most dangerous offenders” he had encountered in 14 years investigating sexual offences. He said “potentially hundreds” of young girls had been exploited by the “abhorrent” Latham.Sentencing Latham to a minimum of 14 years in prison on Friday, the judge, Philip Parry, said: “You are a highly dangerous individual. You are a predatory sex offender with little to no remorse. Young girls who come within your orbit, either in person or online, are in danger of being sexually abused by you.”Latham, who was not previously known to police, had admitted 49 offences in relation to at least 41 victims, of which eight are unidentified. GMP said the case was one of the biggest online child sexual abuse investigations it had ever undertaken and appealed for other potential victims to come forward. At least three girls have been identified in the US.Preston crown court heard how he posed as a 14-year-old boy named Josh, sending out hundreds of messages at a time to young girls on Snapchat and other social media.He would quickly steer the conversation to request sexual images, sometimes offering money. When victims refused to send more, he threatened to post their images online, telling one girl: “I guess I’ll leak these to your friends or family.”Latham struck up a relationship with a 12-year-old girl who initially told him she was 14, believing him to be 15. He was 19 at the time. He bought her sex toys and erotic outfits, the court heard.Teachers at the victim’s school became aware of the relationship and alerted Lancashire constabulary.After his arrest in December 2023, Latham admitted sexual contact with the girl but denied knowing she was 12, claiming he believed she was of legal age.The court heard that he attempted to arrange a threesome with the girl and one of her friends, who he had also sexually assaulted.Latham continued his sexual relationship with the 12-year-old when he was released on police bail, according to videos later found on his phone.Asked by police why he had carried on abusing the girl when he knew it was wrong, Latham said he “knew he was already in trouble for physically abusing the two girls and just thought that he couldn’t be in a worse situation”.The judge was told how one 11-year-old girl had been left “distraught” and “crying in the corner of her room” after being targeted online by Latham.The mother of another of his victims said: “This entire ordeal has taught our daughter that her body is up for grabs, for whoever wants to grab it.”Nicholas Clarke KC, representing Latham, told the court that online sexual abuse the defendant experienced a decade ago had influenced his offending.Clarke said the 22-year-old’s emotional age was not too distant from his victims and that his level of maturity had improved since his arrest – a claim that provoked angry reactions from the friends and families of the victims in court.The judge said Latham “struggled to show any meaningful empathy” for his crimes and that he attempted to “appear naive in order to minimise his responsibility”. “[It is] no exaggeration to say you have left emotional wreckage in your wake in the offending that you have committed against multiple girls,” he added.France said many people assume child sexual abuse images were limited to the dark web, away from easily accessible parts of the internet. He described Snapchat and other popular sites as a “hive of activity for people who are committing these sort of offences”.He said social media companies should have stricter protocols for verifying the age of users and urged parents to keep a closer eye on their children’s online activity. “It’s just horrific,” he said. “The level of offending on this scale, I’ve never seen before.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Ross had accused the government of dithering over plans for a summit to tackle “out of control” gulls.Swinney had defended Hepburn, who is widely liked within the Scottish National party and respected by opponents.Ross, who quit as Scotland’s Tory leaderin a row over his bid to become an MP at the last election, is known for trying to goad ministers.In his resignation letter, Hepburn acknowledged his behaviour was inappropriate and said it was “quite out of character”. He said: “Irrespective of whether or not the ministerial code has been breached, even if there had been no complaint made, I believe I have not acted in accordance with my own personal code of practice.“I hope it would be felt by most … that in my personal and professional undertakings I have always tried to act courteously in interacting with colleagues, either of our own party or others. There is no denying that my interaction with Douglas Ross fell well short of that standard.“Despite whatever annoyance I felt at that particular moment, there is a manner in which that might have been conveyed, or indeed shouldn’t have been conveyed. That is not in utilising the language that I did.”He added: “With no sense of personal pity, having served continuously in government for almost 11 years it is a source of regret that my tenure in ministerial office comes to an end in this fashion.”Ross said Hepburn had contacted him after his resignation to apologise in person about his conduct. Quitting was the “correct decision”, Ross said, adding that Swinney should have acted sooner by sacking Hepburn immediately after he heard about the incident.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Several have been forced to quit, includingthe former health secretary Michael Matheson– who faced a parliamentary investigation into how he racked up a near-£11,000 bill on his work iPad – only after serious and substantiated allegations of misconduct came to light.Swinney said he accepted Hepburn’s resignation with “much personal regret” but said he was leaving office with “my warmest thanks”.

It’s great, but in this case it won’t help us’View image in fullscreenDave Ricketts: ‘I was a member of theLabourparty until two years ago but I can’t go back to them at the moment.’Photograph: Dave Ricketts/Guardian CommunityI’m a member and I’m not surprised by what’s happened. My dad was a south Welsh miner and my first involvement in politics was the miners’ strike when I was a teenager. I have always been left wing. I joined the new party yesterday before it all kicked off. It was them or the Greens but I feel the Greens are primarily focused on the environment. The thing is, Corbyn and Sultana are people who are not afraid to speak up. It’s great of course but in this case it won’t help us.There will be a new leftwing party in whatever guise. It might not be this one right now but there will be something – there has to be for people like me. I was a member of theLabourparty until two years ago but I can’t go back to them at the moment. Like many others, I need a voice and this new party is that for me, whatever form it takes.Dave Ricketts, 56, logistics manager, Warrington‘I still want to join the party, but I’ll wait’I still want to join the party because I think Jeremy Corbyn’s great, but I want to wait until it’s more stabilised and they’re not fighting. It just seems crazy to me. It is disheartening that egos and arrogance come before rising to the challenge of creating a potentially huge, all-changing movement that so many people have been desperately waiting for. Why didn’t they sort it out behind the scenes and then present something? ForZarah Sultanato publicise the infighting seems to be unprofessional. Aren’t they trying to achieve something bigger than that?Gina, 68, Devon‘If this party can’t run a membership portal, how can they challenge the far right?’I am a former Labour member and voted Green in the last election in a safe Labour seat. I would have voted Labour in a swing seat, but now I feel somewhat politically homeless on the left. That Corbyn and Sultana could not agree over a membership portal seems symptomatic of the two core difficulties that the left seem unable to escape: factionalism and poor organisation.It is essential that the left jettisons Corbyn. I was sympathetic to many of his domestic policies at the time of his leadership, and voted for him at the time. But he is an electoral liability. If this party can’t run a membership portal, how on earth are they meant to convince an electorate that they can manage major political and economic challenges involving complex trade-offs, deliver for working people, and challenge the rise of the far right?Richard, 26, Cambridge‘The party offered nothing – it was childish and egotistical on the part of both of those involved’View image in fullscreenCathy: ‘Trust is important and they proved to me they weren’t worthy of mine.’Photograph: Cathy/Guardian CommunityI signed up for their emails and received the first one yesterday. There was so little information that I was suspicious. It seemed to come from the right site but when clicking on the link the rest of the site wasn’t accessible. When I received the second email saying legal advice was being sought, I started to feel annoyed. What was going on? It seemed farcical – like they didn’t respect those who were interested in the party.It was then that I discovered this new party offered nothing – it was childish and egotistical on the part of both of those involved. The left just seems to be really good at self-sabotage. I had high hopes for the party being a real, viable option. A true leftwing party that listened, wanted shared ownership, and could challenge and address the mess politics is currently in. But trust is important and they proved to me they weren’t worthy of mine so I asked to be removed from the mailing list.Cathy, artist and retired psychotherapist, East Sussex‘When you’re building anew party, moments like this matter’View image in fullscreenAsma Razaq: ‘The split between Corbyn and Sultana over the membership portal is disappointing.’Photograph: Guardian CommunityI previously voted for Labour and then the SNP after I moved to Scotland from Yorkshire in 2013. But whenJeremy Corbynand Zarah Sultana announced this party, it was refreshing. It’s natural for people in politics to have different views – we see disagreements all the time in both Labour and the Tories. But when you’re building a new party that claims to be a home for people across the country, moments like this matter.It didn’t put me off voting for them because I’m grateful to Corbyn for speaking up on Palestine. But the split between Corbyn and Sultana over the membership portal is disappointing – not just because of the disagreement itself, but because of how it’s playing out in public. If this new movement is serious about being the people’s party, it needs to show it can handle internal challenges better than the old ones.Asma Razaq, 45, Edinburgh‘The last hope we have must now lie with the Greens’Even before this fallout, the launch of the party has been marred by bad comms and a lack of clarity about what the party stands for. But it has made me more sceptical. This is a tragedy for those who have been crying out for real economic change – a change that would include everyone in society. As we face down a resurgent far right, I wonder how many people would fall for the anti-immigration rhetoric if they had warm homes, secure employment and a sense of purpose in a society that works for everyone. This kind of infighting benefits nobody. The last hope we have must now lie with the Greens.Nick, 38, KentExplore more on these topicsPoliticsLabourJeremy CorbynZarah SultananewsShareReuse this content"

As is usual in the Lords at second reading, there was no division.Luciana Berger, theLabourpeer, has just proposed an amendment that she has tabled that says a select committee should be set up to consider the details of the bill. She said that was necessary because the text of the bill had changed since it was in committee in the Commons, where it was also subject to expert scrutiny.She said the committee would conclude its work by 7 November.Berger’s proposal was agreed without division.Berger, who is opposed to assisted dying, agreed the terms under which the select committee would be set up ina dealwith Charlie Falconer, the Labour former lord chancellor who is the sponsor of the bill in the Lords. That is why there was no need for a vote.Inits briefingon this, theHansard Societysays Berger made two significant concessions to Falconer.A shorter deadline:Her original proposal required the select committee to report by 31 December, delaying the Committee Stage, scheduled to begin on 24 October, by more than two months. The revised motion sets a much tighter deadline of 7 November.A limited reporting remit:Normally, when a bill is sent to a select committee, the committee gathers evidence and recommends whether the bill should proceed, and if so what amendments it might need. If the committee advises against the bill it cannot proceed any further unless the house votes specifically to allow the committee stage to go ahead. If the committee does not recommend against the bill, then it will proceed to committee of the whole house. The revised motion breaks with this normal practice of the house. The select committee is not required to recommend changes or pronounce on the assisted dying bill’s future. It may simply publish the evidence it gathers – from professional bodies, those with professional experience of coronial services, and ministers–without drawing conclusions.Share"

One agent stood with what appeared to be an unholstered firearm. The facility is lined with razor wire, and its windows are boarded with plywood.Kat Abughazaleh, a progressive candidate for Illinois’s ninth congressional district, had sat at an entrance to the facility, alongside dozens of other protesters, before teargas was launched into the crowd. Earlier in the morning she was shoved to the ground by a masked agent as a group of vehicles entered the facility.She described the episodes as a “violent abuse of power” in alater poston social media, adding: “It’s still nothing compared to what they’re doing to immigrant communities.”Video of the incident was later reposted by the Department of Homeland Security’s [DHS]official account on Xwith the caption: “Individuals and groups impeding Ice operations are siding with vicious cartels, human traffickers, and violent criminals.”Illinois’s lieutenant governor, Juliana Stratton, a frontrunner in the race for US Senate next year, was also present earlier on at the protest, although had left before law enforcement officers deployed teargas.“Protesters showed up today with handmade signs and cellphones. They were singing, chanting, praying, and linking arms to stand up for their neighbors and to speak out against the cruelty happening inside Ice’s Broadview facility and across Illinois,” Stratton said in a statement.“The fact that DHS responded with tear gas and by throwing protesters on the pavement tells you everything you need to know – this isn’t about safety. This is about fear, control, and the Trump administration’s attempt to intimidate Illinoisans into silence. We will never be silent.”Bushra Amiwala, another candidate for Illinois’s ninth congressional district, was also present when agents fired teargas.“There was no justification for using such violence against peaceful demonstrators,” she said. “What happened in Broadview today is an affront to our democracy.”Protesters chanted the name of the Silverio Villegas González, a 38-year-old father of two who wasfatally shotby an immigration officer during a traffic stop in the Chicago area last Friday.Earlier in the morning agents arrested a protester after a group swarmed out from the facility to escort another vehicle. The protester was dragged inside by two masked agents after being slammed to the floor and pinned to the ground after he moved what appeared to be teargas canister that had fallen out of a masked agent’s belt.Later in the afternoon, as the crowd gradually dispersed, news reporters who remained at the sceneobserved protesters slashing the tyre of a minivan entering the facility. Reporters also documented another arrest, as a group of agents swarmed on afemale protester in front of a media scrum.The demonstration comes as immigration enforcement inChicagoramped up after the city was targeted by Donald Trump’s administration in a crackdown involving Democratic cities. Although Trump has not sent the national guard to Chicago, as he has to Washington DC and Los Angeles, the city has seen a surge of Ice raids in several neighborhoods.The operation has led to almost 550 arrests, according to DHS statisticsreported by the Associated Press. Marcos Charles, the acting head of Ice’s enforcement and removal operations, told AP: “We’re going to be conducting this operation until we feel that we’ve been successful. He added: “There’s not an end date in sight.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationChicagoIllinoisProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

Out of an abundance of caution for the safety of both the artist and audience, tonight’s engagement at Foxwoods has been cancelled. We appreciate your understanding.”Asecond postsaid both the shows had been cancelled due to “recent events and out of an abundance of caution for the safety of both the artist and band”.The British singer, whose full name is Steven Patrick Morrissey, is on a world tour and due to appear in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday, with performances booked across the US before heading to Mexico for a show on 31 October.Earlier this week a 26-year-old man from Ottawa, Canada, was released on bail after allegedly threatening to kill Morrissey at his performance in the city.The man is accused of issuing a threat against Morrissey on Bluesky on 4 September, theOttawa Citizen reported, citing court documents.According to the news outlet, a post on the social media platform read: “Steven Patrick Morrissey when you perform at TD Place here in Ottawa next week on the evening of September 12th, 2025 at about 9pm, I will be present at the venue in the audience and I will attempt to shoot you many times and kill you with a very large gun that I own illegally.”The show in Ottawa went ahead as planned.The Instagram post on Morrissey’s account did not elaborate on what “recent events” it was referring to, but it comes after the prominent conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot dead during a speaking event in Utah last week.Morrissey announced this month that he had “no choice” butto put up for sale the entirety of his business interests in the Smiths.The deal, announced on his website, Morrissey Solo, in a post titled“A Soul for Sale”, would include the band’s name and artwork, which he created, as well as his share of merchandising rights, lyrical and musical compositions, synchronisation, recordings and publishing contractual rights.Explore more on these topicsMorrisseynewsShareReuse this content"

Similarly, they have waged pressure campaigns urging employers to take action against the individuals.JD Vance backs mass ‘doxing’ campaign to find and harass Charlie Kirk criticsRead moreCivil liberties groups and free speech advocates havewarnedthat the wave of firings and expulsionsrisks chilling free expressionand couldinfringe onfirst amendment protections.Here are some of the people who have reportedly been affected by the crackdown so far:Government workersThe US Secret Service placed an employee on leave last weekafter reportedly writingin a Facebook post that that Kirk “spewed hate and racism on his show”, adding: “At the end of the day, you answer to GOD, and speak things into existence. You can only circumvent karma, she doesn’t leave,” according toCBS News.A spokesperson for the agency confirmed to the Guardian: “This employee was immediately put on administrative leave, and an investigation has begun.”The Secret Service “will not tolerate behavior that violates our code of conduct”, the spokesperson added.Fox Newsalso reported that an employee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) was placed on administrative leave over an Instagram post describing Kirk as “the literal racist homophobe misogynist”.A Fema spokesperson told the Guardian that the “employee’s words are revolting and unconscionable” and that the employee “was immediately placed on administrative leave”.“We expect all public servants to uphold the highest standard of professionalism, respect and integrity,” they added.The US Coast Guard alsosaidlast week that it was “aware of inappropriate personal social media activity” made by one of their employees “regarding recent political violence” and that they were “actively investigating this activity and will take appropriate action to hold the individual accountable”.Media and entertainmentOn Wednesday evening, news broke that Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show had beensuspended “indefinitely”after comments he made about the shooting of Kirk.In a recent broadcast, Kimmel hadsuggestedthat “many in Maga land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk”, which prompted complaints from the Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr.Carrsaid: “These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action on Kimmel or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”Hours later, ABC, owned by Disney, announced that Kimmel’s show would be “pre-empted indefinitely” after the affiliate operator Nexstar called Kimmel’s remarks “offensive and insensitive”.This came as last week MSNBCfiredits senior political analyst Matthew Dowd after he suggested on air that Kirk’s own rhetoric may have contributed to the shooting that killed him. Dowd’s remarks were condemned by MSNBC as “inappropriate, insensitive and unacceptable”.‘Censoring you in real time’: suspension of Jimmy Kimmel show sparks shock and fears for free speechRead moreIn a subsequentSubstack articleon Friday, Dowd confirmed that MSNBC had fired him and said: “The Right Wing media mob ginned up, went after me on a plethora of platforms, and MSNBC reacted to that mob.”The Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah said on Monday that shewas also firedover a series of social media posts “speaking out against political violence, racial double standards, and America’s apathy toward guns” following Kirk’s killing.Meanwhile, PHNX Sports, an Arizona sports network,confirmedthat it had parted ways with one of its employees over comments related to Kirk’s death, according tomultple reports. Severaloutletshave reported that it was one of PHNX’s sports writers.AcademicsAcross the country, US educators and employees of educational institutions are beingfired or placed on leaveover social media posts about Kirk and his death.At Clemson University in South Carolina, the universitysaidon Monday that it had fired an employee “due to their social media posts” and also laterannouncedthat two faculty members had been dismissed over social media posts in response to Kirk’s killing that the school deemed “inappropriate”.The university did not disclose the content of the posts.Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina, hadpublicly urged the universityto terminate the employees.“Free speech doesn’t prevent you from being fired if you’re stupid and have poor judgment,” Graham said.In Tennessee, the Republican senator Marsha Blackburncalled foran employee at Middle Tennessee State University to be fired for reportedly writing in a post that they had “ZERO sympathy” for Kirk’s death.The universityconfirmed to the Tennesseanthat the employee was terminated.Texas State Universityended the enrollmentof a student who mocked Kirk’s assassination during a campus memorial event.At Texas Tech University, a student wasalso reportedly expelledafter a video showed her disrupting a vigil for Kirk and shouting “F--k y’all homie dead, he got shot in the head.”The Texas Education Agency reported that it was investigating about 180 complaints against teachers accused of posting inappropriate remarks online about Kirk’s death, according tothe Texas Tribune.The state’s teachers union called the investigations a“political witch-hunt against Texas educators”.‘Inappropriate’ comments about Charlie Kirk shooting lead to university firingsRead moreThe University of Mississippifireda staffer who they said “re-shared hurtful insensitive comments on social media” regarding Kirk’s killing. Florida Atlantic University also reportedly placed a tenured professor on leave over sharing posts about Kirk’s politics in the wake of the assassination, according tothe Palm Beach Post.The American Association of University Professorshas condemnedthe wave of disciplinary measures.“The AAUP notes with great alarm the rash of recent administrative actions to discipline faculty, staff, and student speech in the aftermath of the murder of Charlie Kirk” they wrote. “We write to remind leaders of colleges and universities of their fundamental duty to protect academic freedom and the absolute necessity to ensure that the freedom to discuss topics of public import without constraint is not curtailed under political pressure.”And not only universities have been affected. Public school teachers in at least 15 states includingIowa,Kansas,Wisconsin,North Carolina,Pennsylvania,South Carolina,Idaho,Ohio,Oregon,Massachusetts,Michigan,FloridaandMissourihave also been suspended or fired over posts about Kirk after his killing.And in New Jersey, local outletsreportthat a​​ school district was forced to shelter in place last week afterreceiving violent threatsfollowing a controversial social media post about Kirk’s killing falsely attributed to a district employee.Visa holdersThe US secretary of state, Marco Rubio,hasannouncedthat “visa revocations are under way” for individuals in the country on visas who are “cheering on the public assassination of a political figure”.“Prepare to be deported,” Rubio said. “You are not welcome in this country.”The state department did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for details on whether there have been any visa revocations in connection with comments about Kirk.AirlinesOver the weekend, the US transportation secretary, Sean Duffy,saidthat American Airlines had “immediately grounded” pilots accused of celebrating Kirk’s death and “removed [them] from service”.“This behavior is disgusting and they should be fired,” Duffy said. “Any company responsible for the safety of the traveling public cannot tolerate that behavior.”He added: “We heal as a country when we send the message that glorifying political violence is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!.”In a statement to the Guardian, American Airlines said it condemned “violence of any kind” and that “hate-related or hostile behavior runs contrary to our purpose, which is to care for people on life’s journey.“Employees who promote such violence on social media were immediately removed from service,” they added. “We will continue to initiate action with team members who display this kind of behavior.”Duffy alsopraisedUnited Airlines for taking similar action and placing one of their pilots out of service for reportedly celebrating Kirk’s death.“They must be fired,” Duffy said. “There’s no room for political violence in America and anyone applauding it will face the consequences. ESPECIALLY those we count on to ensure the safety of the flying public.”United Airlines told the Guardian that they have “been clear with our customers and employees that there’s zero tolerance for politically motivated violence or any attempt to justify it” and that they’ve “taken action on employees in this regard”.CNNalso reported that Delta Air Lines also suspended employees “whose social media content, related to the recent murder of activist Charlie Kirk, went well beyond healthy, respectful debate”.The airlines did not disclose details about the posts.Healthcare workersOn Saturday, the University of Miami’s health system announced that it had fired an employee over what they described as “unacceptable public commentary”.“Freedom of speech is a fundamental right,” the health systemsaid. “At the same time, expressions that condone or endorse violence or are incompatible with our policies or values are not acceptable.”The statement did not elaborate on the remarks made.In Michigan, a nurse wasreportedly placed on leavefor making controversial remarks about Kirk’s death, and another healthcare worker in Virginia was also reportedly fired over for similar reasons.TheBoston Globereported that a Massachusetts-based biomedical research center fired an employee who allegedly posted a “deeply offensive” comment about Kirk’s killing.Other workersEmployees in various other industries are also facing backlash over social media posts related to Kirk’s death.The Carolina Panthersreportedlyfireda public relations staffer for social media posts about Kirk and his death.Several people fired after clampdown on speech over Charlie Kirk shootingRead more“The views expressed by our employees are their own and do not represent those of the Carolina Panthers,” the organizationsaid. “We do not condone violence of any kind.

In the cartoon, Trump claims: “I hold the cards”, to which Xi responds: “The cards are made inChina.”The email, seen by the Guardian, appears to have been sent in April by an administrative assistant on Liz Uihlein’s behalf. Uihlein prefaced the cartoon with a short remark: “All – The usual. Liz”.The barb is significant because it was sent by an important political ally to Trump and his movement. Liz and Richard Uihlein were the fourth largest political donors in the presidential election cycle, having given $143m toRepublicans, according to Opensecrets, which tracks political giving.Republican mega-donors asked their employees who they will vote for in surveyRead moreA Uline spokesperson said Liz Uihlein had no comment. A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.Uline is a privately held company, and it is difficult to gauge the exact impact Trump’s tariff and other trade policies have on the office supply company. But people who spoke to the Guardian say Uline imports a significant amount of its merchandise from China and other parts of the world. It is not the first time Uihlein has weighed in on trade policy. Lamenting how the Covid-19 pandemic had hit the global supply chain, Uihlein wrote ina letter published in the Uline catalogafter the 2020 election that “America sorely needs a coherent, largely united trade policy, if we don’t get it done, this century belongs to the Chinese.”She is not the only mega-donor to havepreviously been critical of the president. Ken Langone, the co-founder of Home Depot and a longtime Republican donor, said in an interview with the Financial Times in April that the tariffs the White House had announced at the time – which have since been rolled back – were too high and implemented too quickly, adding that the president had been “poorly advised”.Langone reversed himself a few months later, in July, when he told CNBC’s Squawk Box that he was not longer concerned that Trump could use his position in the Oval Office to engage in retribution.“I’m happy to say that I’m comfortable he’s not doing that. He’s acting presidential. I’m impressed with the people he’s got around him,” Langone said.Trump has touted the US as having an edge in negotiations with China as recently as last month. In comments in the Oval Office he said the US and China would have a “great relationship”, but also noted that he could “destroy China” by playing “incredible cards” if he wanted to.Trump is due to speak to Xi on Friday in the wake of a deal agreed by both countries that would keep the TikTok app running in the US.Both sides have for now suspended the toughest tit-for-tat economic measures lobbed against each other since Trump’s second term began, when the US threatened tariffs as high as 145% against China. The US and China reached a pact to decrease the tariffs in May and renewed the lower rate in August in the wake of a new round of negotiations. That extension will expire in mid-November.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpRepublicansUS politicsChinaTrump tariffsUS political financingnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump seemed to suggest that court rulings that blocked his beloved tariffs would have the destructive power of, say, 100 hydrogen bombs.Call me naive, but I never cease to be amazed when Trump says such egregiously false and ludicrous things. OK, I sometimes forget that he’s the guy who said thatnoise from wind turbines causes cancer. After narrowly winning the presidency a second time notwithstanding the30,573 Trump lies, falsehoodsand misleading claims in his first term, Trump evidently thinks he can say anything, no matter how false or foolish, and get away with it. As part of his tariff fight, Trump also blurted this absurdity: if the courts don’t uphold his tariffs, “we would become a Third World Nation.”Trump’s statement that ending tariffs will destroy the US is totally bonkers because the US became the world’s richest nation and has largely prospered for nearly 250 years (despite occasional slumps) before Trump imposed his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. In the months before then, the US had solid GDP growth, low unemployment and declining inflation – the Economist magazine even called the US economy “the envy of the world”. But now Trump says that if the courts give a thumbs down to his favorite plaything – I mean weapon – to bang other countries over the head with, it would end the US. Even Ramesh Ponnuru, editor of the conservative National Review, called that “lunatic stuff”.The truth is that if the courts block Trump’s across-the-board tariffs, that would be good news for theUS economy. It would prevent Trump’s tariffs from further pushing up inflation and slowing economic growth. By giving a thumbs down to Trump’s tariffs, the courts might be doing him a huge economic and political favor because his tariffs, and the inflation they are fueling, have been dragging his dismal approval ratings even lower.On 29 August, the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington DC ruled that Trump overstepped his authority when he invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose his Liberation Day tariffs. The court said that act doesn’t give presidents the authority to slap sweeping tariffs on other countries. Trump has appealed the ruling to the supreme court, which might rule on the tariffs this fall.The court of appeals repeatedly noted that the constitution gives Congress, not presidents, the power to impose tariffs. It further noted that the Emergency Act doesn’t mention the word “tariffs” even once among the tools the act authorizes presidents to use to deal with emergency trade problems. (That appellate ruling overturned the bulk of Trump’s tariffs: the blanket 10% to 50% tariffs on exports from more than 70 countries. The court didn’t rule on Trump’s product-specific tariffs on steel, aluminum and auto parts.)As part of his conniptions over the appeals court ruling, Trump also warned of fiscal disaster, complaining that the US would lose hundreds of billions of dollars if his tariffs were halted. But Trump conveniently forgets that it’s embattled US consumers who will be paying most of those hundreds of billions as they pay Trump’s tariffs, essentially import taxes on furniture, cars, coffee, electronics and other foreign goods.In using his hysterical language, Trump evidently had one audience in mind: the supreme court’s six conservative justices who have repeatedly ruled his way. Trump’s goal is evidently to scare the bejesus out of those justices – he hopes that by shrieking “You’ll Destroy the Country If You Rule Against Me,” that will persuade them to overturn the appellate court’s decision and uphold his tariffs. (The appellate court let the tariffs remain in force to allow time for appeal.)So far in his second term, Trump has a remarkable batting average with the supreme court’s six rightwing justices, who seem astonishingly subservient and supine vis-a-vis the most authoritarian, power-grabbing president in US history. The justices have used their emergency docket to grantTrump administration requests 18 times in a row, often vacating injunctions that lower courts put in place to stop what they saw as Trump’s rampant lawlessness. In repeatedly siding with Trump, the supreme court has scrapped lower court injunctions in several highly controversial cases, provisionally letting Trumpfire the chair of the National Labor Relations Board,gut the federal Department of Education, andgive Doge– with itsstaff of twentysomethings– access to thehighly private social security informationof hundreds of millions of Americans.Trump is no doubt worried that the supreme court, though submissive so far, will overturn his tariffs. Many conservative and libertarian scholars and lawyers oppose his tariffs as both harmful and illegal. Not only do they dislike the tariffs for pushing up inflation and disrupting global supply chains, but they see Trump’s tariffs as anti-free market and mucking up the US and world economies.When Trump announced his Liberation Day tariffs, he invoked a national emergency, saying the US trade deficit and other countries’ tariffs were urgent problems undermining the US economy. Admittedly the trade deficit and other countries’ tariffs are a problem, but in no way do they constitute a national emergency, especially since the US economy was seen as “the envy of the world” before Trump went hog wild with his tariffs. (There’s no denying that the flood of imports from China and other low-wage nations badly damaged many communities in America’s industrial heartland two and three decades ago.) Wouldn’t it be great if, in this tariff litigation, the supreme court stood up to Trump and issued a candid ruling that told him: “Sorry, Mr President, your supposed national emergency is hogwash, a pretext for you to pursue your destructive tariff obsession”?The supreme court’s justices shouldn’t let themselves be cowed, bullied or fooled by Trump’s talk that the nation will be destroyed if they nix his tariffs. Trump is like the boy who cried wolf, forever crying catastrophe if he doesn’t get his way. It’s time for the court and the nation to wise up to Trump’s lies, hype and shenanigans.Virtually every non-Trumpian economist agrees that Trump’s tariffs have hurt the US by increasing inflation, undermining GDP growth, creating huge headaches for corporations and seriously damaging the US’s relations with other nations. The justices shouldn’t buy Trump’s calamitous warnings that if they overturn his tariffs, the world will end.If the justices declare his tariffs illegal, it certainly won’t be a “disaster” for the US, as Trump has claimed. But it might be a disaster for Trump’s ego and for his dangerous dream of having an authoritarian presidency wholly unchecked by the other branches of government.If the supreme court rules against Trump’s tariffs, let’s hope that will serve as a much-needed first step to the court’s developing the backbone to rule many times more against Trump’s authoritarian and lawless actions.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTariffsUS economyTrump tariffsTrump administrationInflationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

By the 1970s, the newly independent republic was producing278,000 barrels of crude oil a day. For a country of just 1 million people, after the collapse of its sugar and cocoa industries, oil proved to be transformative.Today, witha population of 1.5 millionand oil productiondown to less than 54,000 barrels a day, Trinidad and Tobago is at a crossroads. The country’sonly petroleum refinery closedin 2018 due to mismanagement and declining production by the state-owned Petrotrin company.A recent analysisnoted that the energy revenues plummeted 48.4% to $14.7bn (£10.9bn) in the last fiscal year, while non-energy revenues grew by 26% to $32.7bn.View image in fullscreenTrinidad and Tobago’s only oil refinery in 2015. The state-owned plant was closed in 2018, when local production fell so low that oil had to be imported to supply it.Photograph: Andrea De SilvaWith crude oil production declining since the 2000s (while gas increased, then sharply decreased), the country faces a standoff. Environmentalists are calling for a greener economy, while the new government, like its predecessors, pushes for more deepwater exploration.“We have fallen victim to ‘Dutch disease’ – a dependence on one single sector – which has defined who we are from an economic and social perspective,” says Indera Sagewan, an economist and director of theCaribbean Centre for Competitiveness.We have fallen victim to Dutch disease – a dependence on one single sectorIndera Sagewan“Non-energy economic diversification is imperative as the way forward forTrinidad and Tobago. We are living a defining moment.”Unlike other oil-dependent states, such as Norway, the UAE and Qatar, Trinidad and Tobago has failed to maximise the benefits of theHeritage and Stabilisation Fund, which was established in 2007 to invest surplus revenues as a means of consolidating the legacy of oil wealth.Now, the country faces the prospect of chronic low growth, according toan OECD reportpublished in December. Last year, GDPgrew by an estimated 1.7%, up from 1.4% in 2023. The government also faces rising unemployment rates and fiscal pressures, with public debt reaching64.5% of GDP in 2024– higher than theaverage of 51.9%in Central America and the Caribbean, according to the OECD.A chart showing the decline in oil and gas productionTo escape the low-growth trap, experts such as Sagewan have long argued that Trinidad and Tobago should diversify its economy, a challenge for a commodity-exporting country reliant on oil and gas.You can find new reserves using new technology … or drill deeperDax DriverIntroduced in 2022, the country’sgreen hydrogen strategyis a step in that direction, aiming to overhaul the energy sector by shifting from grey to green hydrogen (the former produced from gas, which creates CO2emissions; the latter splitting water using renewable energy), using existing petrochemical infrastructure, and producing 4m tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2065. The country has also announced plans to install 57GW of offshore wind capacity by 2065 with the aim of achieving 30% renewable electricity generation.Yet, all of that remains just a “very early-stage” plans, according to Sagewan.On 13 August, the government of the prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, signalled its intent to press on with fossil fuels bysigning a deal with ExxonMobilto explore a vast ultra-deepwater block off the country’s east coast, covering more than 7,000 sq km in waters more than 1.2 miles (2km) deep.View image in fullscreenPort of Spain: the skyline of Trinidad and Tobago’s capital reflects the boom years the country enjoyed from fossil fuels.Photograph: Andrea De SilvaIf reserves are found, the investment could reach up to $21.7bn, according to the energy minister, Roodal Moonilal.The deal underscores the new government’s commitment to deepwater drilling, seeking new discoveries in unexplored Atlantic waters like theoil rush in nearby Guyanaand Suriname.“There is no real strong stakeholder movement here that says: ‘Stop exploring for oil and gas in Trinidad and Tobago’,” says Dax Driver, chief executive of theEnergy Chamber, the industry’s lobby group.From the first oil well drilled in the 19th century to the discovery of offshore gas fields in the 1990s, fossil fuels have been Trinidad and Tobago’s economic lifeblood, bringing infrastructure and wealth far beyond Caribbean neighbours.The oil money transformed lives for the better in many ways: free university education, extensive public-sector employment, subsidised electricity, gas and water that were among the cheapest utilities in the world, andpetrol prices at a third of UKlevels. A thriving middle class and a wealthy elite emerged; highways, hospitals and airports were built.But wealth also fuelled corruption, inequality and violent crime. The country remains heavily dependent on oil, while drilling and spills threaten the fragile ecosystems.View image in fullscreenAn oil rig operating in state-owned Petrotrin’s Soldado field off the coast of Trinidad in 2014.Photograph: Andrea De Silva/ReutersNow, experts question how close Trinidad and Tobago is to a crunch point. A 2019 report by a US consultancy estimated there were10 years of gas reservesleft.Last year, Stuart Young, then energy minister, said reserves hadrisen to 11 years, or potentially 20 with efficient extraction. However, the oil cartelOpec’s data indicatesthat crude oil output is in freefall, and gas production is also declining.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The discoveries raised hope that new fields could also be developed in Trinidad and Tobago. “You can find new reserves using new technology,” says Driver. “Or drill deeper.”A recent gas find between Tobago and Barbados has increased optimism among fossil fuel advocates. But uncertainties persist since much of the deep Atlantic remains unexplored. Offshore acreage extends 125 miles into the Atlantic, though recovery rates are low – about 10 to 15% for each oilfield.View image in fullscreenRoodal Moonilal, the new UNC government’s energy minister, being sworn in this year.Photograph: Andrea De SilvaStill, investing heavily in oil and gas exploration has once again become a priority afterApril’s elections in Trinidad and Tobagorestored the United National Congress (UNC) party to government under Persad-Bissessar.Moonilal says the government supports decarbonisation initiatives, such as theBrechin Castle solar farm, the largest in the region, which could supply 10% of the nation’s electricity. However, fossil fuels remain the priority. “We need to be finding more natural gas,” the energy minister says.“Natural gas production declinedby 34% from 2015 to 2024, and oil declined by 35% over the same period,” he says. “At the end of 2022, proven gas reserves stood at57tn cubic feet[1.14bn tonnes]. That represents significant potential for future discoveries, particularly in deepwater acreage. Deepwater exploration is important to us.”Moonilal adds that Trinidad and Tobago hopes to also export its energy expertise. “Guyana, Suriname and Grenada are at different hydrocarbon development stages. We have great human resource expertise and infrastructure. We also have plants that need raw material,” he says. “We see a win-win scenario.”View image in fullscreenThe Brechin Castle solar farm is the largest energy project of its type in the regionGoing against this enthusiasm for oil and gas, environmentalists and economists warn that such reliance on fossil fuels exposes Trinidad and Tobago to ecological harm, price shocks and socioeconomic collapse in a region vulnerable to extreme weather events.The climate crisis has cost Caribbean countries an average of2.13% of regional GDPannually from 1980 to 2020, according to the OECD. Meanwhile,Trinidad’s per capita emissions rank eighth highestglobally, at 22.8 tonnes, which is more than five times the rate of the UK.‘Will you stop exploring yours?’: Latin America forges ahead on new oil frontierRead moreAidan Farrell, of the University of the West Indies, says the Caribbean has warmed by about 1C (1.8F) since 1960, with a similar rise expected by 2050.“There is a lot of attention on how we will be able to produce enough food. The government is preparing for more frequent tropical storms, sea-level rise and coastal erosion, where most economic activity, including oil and gas, is located,” he says.Environmentalists argue that the ecological toll is already high. “Oil spills, gas flaring and industrial waste have degraded ecosystems, impacted fisheries and exposed coastal communities to real harm,” says Dizzanne Billy, regional director ofClimate Tracker Caribbean.“We’re faced with a troubling paradox: a small island bearing the brunt of climate impacts while contributing significantly to the problem.”The country has faced several environmental disasters in recent years. In 2024, a capsized barge triggereda national emergency, with oil spreading hundreds of miles to the island of Bonaire, contaminating beaches, mangroves and coral.We need policies empowering workers to transition with dignity … into new industriesDizzanne BillyBilly stresses the urgent need to pivot away from fossil fuels. “The urgency isn’t just environmental; it’s economic, social and generational,” she says. “Fossil fuel wealth hasn’t trickled down equally. Frontline communities face underinvestment while absorbing environmental fallout. That’s not just economic – it’s a climate justice issue.”For campaigners such as Billy, a continued focus on fossil fuels is shortsighted. “Our dependence leaves us vulnerable to global price shocks,” she says.The problem is that diversification remains at an early stage. Tourism is marginal outside carnival week in spring, and agriculture needs a dramatic boost to fill the oil void.View image in fullscreenWorkers clean a beach in La Brea, Trinidad, in 2013 after an oil pipeline leak.Photograph: Andrea De SilvaStill, Sagewan sees the country as a potential exporter of food globally. Michael J Cooper, an expert in energy finance and a former economist at the energy ministry, sees banking and insurance expanding with a development strategy over the next decade.He lists manufacturing, tourism, film, entertainment, shipping, shipbuilding and ship repair, as well as food production, as viable alternatives.‘Like dropping a bomb’: why is clean energy leader Uruguay ramping up the search for oil?Read more“We have a very educated workforce, with many highly skilled people relative to other developing countries,” he says. “While energy production decline is slow, the government should act early to stimulate other sectors.”Billy calls for a new model that focuses on renewables, regenerative agriculture, digital services, community tourism and the creative economy.“We need policies empowering workers to transition with dignity through re-skilling, support systems and clear pathways into new industries,” she says. “It means shifting power to communities most affected by our current economic model, placing them at the heart of the redesign.”Explore more on these topicsTrinidad and TobagoThe Latin and Caribbean oil rushAmericasFossil fuelsEnergyOilClimate crisisEnergy industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The total was £16bn higher than in 2024 and above a £72.4bn forecast from the OBR.The pound fell against the dollar after the figures were released on Friday morning, slipping by half a cent to trade at about $1.35, while UK government borrowing costs rose on the financial markets.The OBR said the overshoot in the August data was mainly driven by upward revisions to estimates of local authority borrowing. In addition, VAT and other receipts were lower than expected last month.The independent Treasury watchdog said it expected a lower level of borrowing in the second half of the financial year, amid predictions for a rise in capital gains tax receipts and lower levels of debt interest.UK borrowing graphicHowever, economists warned that a weak economic outlook, elevated borrowing costs and anexpected downgrade in the OBR’s productivity forecastswould force Reeves to raise taxes or cut spending if she wanted to keep within herfiscal rules.“Taxes will almost certainly need to rise if the fiscal rules are to be met,” said Matt Swannell, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. “A combination of gilt market stress and reversals on welfare reform has used up the thin margin for error in the government’s current spending plans.”The consultancy CapitalEconomicsforecast the chancellor would need to raise about £28bn, mostly through higher taxes, if she wanted to maintain the £9.9bn buffer held against the fiscal rule at the spring statement.James Murray, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government had a plan to bring down borrowing. “Our focus is on economic stability, fiscal responsibility, ripping up needless red tape, tearing out waste from our public services, driving forward reforms, and putting more money in working people’s pockets,” he added.The latest snapshot from the ONS showed the exchequer benefited from rising national insurance receipts, reflecting the chancellor’s £25bn increase in the rate paid by employers at her first autumn budget.However, the increase was outstripped by higher spending on public services, benefits and debt interest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Economists warned this could contribute to the UK’s rising borrowing costs.On Thursday the central bank said it would scale back its plan to £70bn for the year ahead. However, fewer bonds will mature in the next 12 months. As a result, the Bank is increasing its active sales to £21bn even though it has a lower target overall.Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said: “Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are too weak and distracted to take the action needed to reduce the deficit.

Being patient was the most important thing. I controlled the race.

Facing PSG was like “choosing a method of execution”, said Juric. “The difference between the teams was enormous, an abyss.” Inter, last season’s losing finalists, now coached by Cristian Chivu, beat Ajax, another club the Romanian once starred for, with Marcus Thuram heading both goals in 2-0 win. Pio Esposito, 20, proved an able deputy for Lautaro Martínez, the club legend unfit to start.Union Saint-Gilloise’s 3-1 win at PSV Eindhoven reflected a growing trend. Dutch football has largely dominated its Belgian neighbor since the 1960s but a sea change is now afoot. Belgium’s Pro League has become a more trusted breeding ground for talent than the Eredivisie, previously a hotbed. Union SG’s owner is Tony Bloom, whose data-led approach made Brighton into a Premier League force. His Belgian club took apart PSV, the first goal arriving after Ricardo Pepi had conceded a penalty. Fellow USMNT player Sergiño Dest meanwhile looked far more effective in attack than defense. “Total football,” said Union coach Sébastien Pocognoli, throwing what the Dutch gave to the game back at them. Club Brugge’s impressive 4-1 defeat of Monaco on Thursday further suggests the rise of the Belgians.In recent years, Eintracht Frankfurt have made a huge net transfer profit in selling on strikers, Hugo Ekitike, Randal Kolo Muani and Omar Marmoush each cashed in. Their current striker, Jonny Burkardt, has much to live up to. The summer signing from Mainz scored his first Eintracht goal in a 5-1 thumping of Galatasaray that pushed his new club top of the 36-team table. In midfield for Galatasaray, and back on German turf was İlkay Gündoğan but his new club suffered their first defeat after 13 consecutive wins. Also on the mark for Eintracht was teenage Turkish international Can Uzun, a childhood friend from Regensburg, Bavaria of Kenan Yıldız, a scorer for Juventus against Dortmund.Player of the weekMarcus Rashford.There had been wild rumours that Barcelona already wanted to send Rashford back to Manchester United but two beautifully taken goals at Newcastle reminded of his latent, enigmatic talent. The first a rare header, his second was a lash of the ball Alan Shearer would have been proud of. No Lamine Yamal for Barca, no problem with Rashford on such form. “I am very motivated and determined,” he said, qualities that appeared lost in his dog days at United.They said it‘When I was faced with the possibility of coaching Benfica, I didn’t think twice about it, saying, ‘I’m interested, I’d like it’.’José Mourinho is back in the game, at the club he left under a cloud 25 years ago. Benfica’s loss to Azerbaijan’s Qarabag hastened the exit of Bruno Lage and may yet unseat embattled club president Rui Costa. There was brief speculation Portugal’s biggest club might rescue Ruben Amorim from his Manchester United purgatory. Instead, the return of Portuguese football’s prodigal; Mourinho last managed in his home country in 2004.The pundit’s chair“Beautiful, important signs from a team that believes in itself. In the standings, a point is worth one, but it’s much more. In terms of awareness, it’s three.”Alessandro Del Piero, Juventus legend, enthuses after his club mount a famous comeback to draw 4-4 with Borussia Dortmund in the week’s most enthralling game. Juve followed up Saturday’s 4-3 win over Inter with another late show, full of attacking verve.Looking aheadWith the second round of matches now reverting to the usual Tuesday/Wednesday schedule, 1 October sees a meeting of European aristocracy as Barcelona welcome PSG and their former coach Luis Enrique to Catalonia. The final many wished for last season was denied by Inter denying Barcelona in the semis.Mourinho taking on Benfica will convert their visit to Chelsea on 30 September into a media circus, a revival of greatest hits. If Benfica is him taking on unfinished business, his legacy at Chelsea is somewhat more mixed than it might be for the manager who helped establish the club within Europe’s elite. There was bad blood when he departed the second time a decade ago though nostalgia cures many ills. His record against Chelsea is also mixed; Benfica will be the fourth opponent he leads against them, following Inter, Manchester United and Tottenham. His record is five wins, two draws and seven defeats. After losing 3-1 at Bayern Munich in a highly open encounter, Chelsea require a further win over their formerly Special One.The second round of action will begin with Real Madrid travelling almost 4,000m to Kairat in Kazakhstan, just 200 miles from the Chinese border. It would take an 87-hour drive to make the trip, and the flight 12 hours to Almaty will take 12 hours. On Thursday, Kairat, who qualified by beating Celtic on penalties in the qualifiers, opened their campaign by travelling the longest distance of the entire group stage to lose 4-1 to Sporting Club in Lisbon. Madrid’s win on Tuesday saw them ride out a 2-1 win over a spirited Marseille, for whom Tim Weah scored the opener. Who fills in at right back, with Trent Alexander-Arnold hamstrung and Dani Carvajal suspended after his red card for a headbutt, is a leading question.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueChampions League reviewfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For those who choose the latter, this part of the season is for you. The race to claim the title for best regular-season record is coming to a head with several teams still in serious Supporters’ Shield contention – it’s shaping up to be the wildest finish in recent memory.As evidence of this: The standings are led by a team who lost their most recent match 7-0. Behind them – by just one point – are an expansion side. Then it’s a team who have won just two of their last six games followed by an outfit on a record-tying nine-game winning streak. And then there’s the team lurking in the shadows, boasting the greatest player of all-time, still within striking distance thanks to games in hand.So many teams can still win the Supporters’ Shield, yet only one will. Here are the cases for and against each contender.Philadelphia Union (currently 1st, 57 points)Why they’ll win it:A cohesive vision. No matter how the regular season finishes, the Union’s managerial gamble for 2025 paid off. By firing Jim Curtin and hiring Bradley Carnell in his place, sporting director Ernst Tanner fully leaned into his plan for the club – and his vision has been realised by a team that favours direct, vertical attacks and a high-tempo style. They boast a go-to striker in Tai Baribo, whose 16 league goals go a long way to explaining Philadelphia’s Shield standing.Why they won’t:Philly are known for beating up on weaker teams, but against playoff-level opponents, they have struggled to impose themselves, a trend encapsulated most brutally by Saturday’s 7-0 humiliating loss to the Vancouver Whitecaps. Carnell’s squad rotation ahead of the US Open Cup semi-final against Nashville was a factor, but the worst defeat in Union history may have left a mark.Any sort of drop in form from Baribo would have an impact. The pre-emptive signing of Milan Iloski hinted at a nervousness about this, but for the time being Philly are just about maintaining their overachievement.View image in fullscreenMinnesota United won against San Diego in a recent matchup between Shield hopefuls.Photograph: Jeremy Olson/ISI Photos/Getty ImagesSan Diego FC (2nd, 56 points)Why they’ll win it:Mikey Varas’ brand of aggressive possession-based soccer is the sort of thing many previously believed to be beyond a side in their first year, but MLS’s 30th team already have coherence many of their rivals can only dream of. They have a favourable run-in that includes games against Atlanta United, San Jose, Houston and Portland.Why they won’t:If they fall short, it could be due to a lack of cutting edge up front. The decision not to sign Iloski permanently could prove costly. The recent loss toMinnesota United(despite an xG of 2.16 compared to Minnesota’s 0.5) shows this a bit, and may also have provided the blueprint for teams to take points off San Diego. And then there’s history: No expansion team has won the Supporters’ Shield before.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

FC Cincinnati’s defensive work coupled with the attacking quality of Evander, Luca Orellano and Kévin Denkey gives them a formidable profile – teams that are strong at the back and dangerous up front have a habit of winning stuff. The summer move to bring back Brenner bolstered Cincy’s forward line for the run-in. A run of very winnable games down the stretch could help.Why they won’t:Lack of balance. Pat Noonan’s team have been difficult to work out this season. Most recently, and at various other points of the campaign, Cincy have been defensively vulnerable and predictable in attack. What’s more, they have suffered from stage fright in the biggest matches more than once – see defeats to Philly,Charlotte FCand Columbus in the last two months alone. Brenner’s acquisition will only be worth something if they can do a better job of progressing possession through midfield and into the final third.Minnesota United (4th, 54 points)Why they’ll win it:Set pieces. “The long throw is back,” according to Thomas Tuchel, and Eric Ramsay is clearly on the same wavelength as the England manager. Minnesota United have made chucking the ball into the mixer a key part of their attacking approach under the former Manchester United assistant, who has established the Loons asthe most aggressive set-piece team in the world. Hanging on to Joaquín Pereyra also helps. Minnesota turned down a substantial offer for the Argentinian playmaker in an attempt to strike a balance between planning for the future and staying competitive in the present.Why they won’t:A big transfer away. Until recently, Minnesota still had Tani Oluwaseyi as another part of their attacking approach. Now, the Canadian international is playing in Spain after an €8m switch to Villarreal. Whether or not Ramsay can compensate for the loss of Oluwaseyi’s output (10 goals and seven assists) could determine Minnesota’s final league position.View image in fullscreenCharlotte FC could set a league record with another win.Photograph: Erik Verduzco/APCharlotte FC (5th, 53 points)Why they’ll win it:Insanely good form. Charlotte have won nine straight, tying the 2018 Seattle Sounders for the longest winning streak in league history (counting shootout wins from the league’s early years as draws). Saturday’s demolition ofInter Miamiwas a full demonstration of why Dean Smith’s team can’t be discounted. Big performers are performing: There was a penalty save from Messi by Kristijan Kahlina, who has rediscovered his Goalkeeper of the Year form from 2024. There was a hat-trick for Idan Toklomati who has stepped into the void left by Patrick Agyemang this summer and elevated Charlotte’s forward line to an even higher level.Why they won’t:The underlying numbers don’t love Charlotte despite this winning run, and the team can cool just as easily – they lost five straight earlier this year, and still have more ground than almost anyone else to make up in the race.Inter Miami (9th, 49 points)Why they’ll win it:Games in hand. There are seven teams with more points on the board than Inter Miami, but Messi and Co still have three games in hand that could propel them into serious Shield contention. A relatively favourable run-in makes it possible that the Herons could come from way back to cross the line before anyone else. Messi and the fact he is still the Goat also makes that possible.Why they won’t:Form and availability. Luis Suárez sat out on Tuesday, suspended for the 3-1 win over the Seattle Sounders after a spitting incident against the same team in the Leagues Cup final. In fact, the team continues to have disciplinary problems all over the field. And as for Messi, the 38-year-old was somewhat lethargic in the 3-0 defeat to Charlotte FC in which he had a panenka penalty saved (though he was more characteristically impactful in the midweek win over the Sounders, registering a goal and an assist). As long as Messi is in pink, Inter Miami have a chance, but they’ll be playing a lot of games between now and Decision Day.Explore more on these topicsMLSInter MiamiCharlotte FCPhiladelphia UnionSan Diego FCFC CincinnatiMinnesota UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To luxuriate even, in the contentment so sparingly yielded at the highest level. None of which, strikingly, is the case for Laurent Mekies,the new team principal of Red Bull, who concedes only to an overwhelming, almost Sisyphean, commitment to moving ever forward, ever upward.“There is no such thing as having made it, you always feel you are surviving,” he says. “You always feel that you should have done more yesterday, more a week ago. To step up next week, next month. You never feel you made it – never, never, never.”The Frenchman leads one of one of the most successful teams in Formula One’s modern era, a role he took on two months ago after the former team principalChristian Horner was sacked. It is one of the most high-profile and high-intensity positions in the sport, what might be considered a herculean task for the 48-year-old to go with his own self-imposed boulder rolling.Atthe last round in Monza, Max Verstappen took Red Bull’s first GP victory under Mekies, his first major achievement with the team duly ticked off as they go into this weekend’s Azerbaijan Grand Prix. With over 20 years in the sport there must have been similar occasions when he could allow himself a sense of satisfaction?Piastri and Norris ‘in control of own destiny’ in F1 world championship battleRead more“If you feel you made it, you feel like that on the evening of a win. Then on Monday morning, it’s over,” is as much as he will allow.Mekies is a fascinating character, at ease in theRed Bullmotorhome for his first full interview with any British media since he took over from Horner in July. Notably he chooses to sit alongside me, rather than behind the desk in his office.There is a palpable sense he feels the need to communicate earnestly and honestly. His answers are not rehearsed but thoughtful, with the careful precision that might be expected of a man from an engineering background. He is clearly interested in a desire to connect, a distance from the more businesslike approaches of some of his contemporaries. He will lean in almost intimately to make a point, occasionally touching my arm to emphasise, to ensure he is being understood.Perhaps this desire to connect is what he is now bringing to Red Bull and while adamant in his determination to keep striving, he is also pleasingly human enough to know he has one hell of a gig.“When I go to the pit wall, every single race weekend you feel the most privileged. You know you have the best seat in the house,” he says. “I’m excited. I can’t wait to get the car ready to go, I’m like a kid, just sitting with Max, I just want to see the car running. So you see the contrast between the two? You never feel you made it, but you always feel privileged.”The kid, who never believed he would make it to F1 then, is still peering out through the man’s eyes. “I was just a little boy playing with his cars, watching the races with my father,” he says of growing up in France. “The first race my parents took me to was in 1988 at the French Grand Prix. It was in the heat of the Prost-Senna battle. You get submerged by that atmosphere that feels like it’s the most fantastic sport in the world but it feels so far away.“You don’t think you will be ever entering a paddock, let alone work inFormula One.”Yet he was far from deterred. Mekies studied mechanical engineering at the ESTACA school in France before gaining an internship with the Signatech F3 team, a moment he describes as “life-changing”.He went on to enter F1 with Arrows in 2001, stints at Minardi and Toro Rosso followed before he became safety director at the FIA in 2014, the year Jules Bianchi suffered injuries in an accident at Suzukathat proved fatal nine months later.Mekies was at the helm in the difficult years that followed as the sport’s governing body oversaw the introduction of the halo cockpit protection device. He noted, with typical determination given the opposition to it at the time, that there could be no room for complacency in safety.View image in fullscreenLaurent Mekies (centre) with Max Verstappen (left) and Yuki Tsunoda at Monza – Verstappen’s Italian GP victory was Red Bull’s first race win under the new team principal.Photograph: Jay Hirano/ShutterstockFerrari brought him on board in 2018 and he became racing director in 2021 before Red Bull headhunted him to return to their sister team, now known as Racing Bulls, as team principal in 2024.There he was witness to the turmoil that went on to embroil Red Bull that season. The controversy that surrounded Horner after accusations of inappropriate behaviour by an employee – for which he was later cleared by an investigation – was followed by the loss of a number of key personnel, including the design guru Adrian Newey.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mekies will have no easy pass from them and that too is part of his challenge. Here he offers a straightforward, if necessarily diplomatic, solution.“I’d like to oversimplify the situation. We are here to conceive, to design, to produce the fastest car possible,” he says. “When you do that, everything gets sorted. So that’s where the focus goes, not in terms of: ‘Do I need to manage that? … or that?’.“Max is a huge asset in the car, he’s a huge asset outside of the car. He’s part of the project, he’s not judging the project from outside, he’s pulling the project every day from inside.”Certainly in these early days Mekies is winning hearts and minds, earning praise from the world champion and Marko.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen ahead of Lando Norris during the Italian GP – the Dutchman’s third race victory of the season.Photograph: Alessio Morgese/NurPhoto/Shutterstock“What I like is the technical questions throughout the weekend, back at the factory, useful meetings. It seems like that’s all working well,” saidMax Verstappen.“The whole technical team is more open and they discuss things,” Marko said. “Appointing him was the right decision. Given the complexity of F1, having a technical expert at the top is probably the better solution.”Mekies is also seemingly less inclined towards the somewhat adversarial approach of Horner, who revelled in rubbing up against other teams and bosses. Yet Horner also inspired great loyalty and was much loved by many at the team. His dismissal after 20 years in charge was both shocking and upsetting for many staff. How Mekies dealt with that moment of upheaval is instructive.“‘Why are we changing? Why now?’ were all questions I didn’t have an answer to,” he says. “So I told them exactly as I’m telling you now. The why and the why now are not questions for me. I don’t have the answer to them. There is no other way than to be honest. My focus is on the future and the next phase.“Of course it is the biggest challenge. But if I go back, the one before was the previous biggest, and the one before was the previous biggest. There is only one objective we have been given, to go back to winning and to do it the Red Bull way. That’s the only brief.”Explore more on these topicsRed BullFormula OneMax VerstappenMotor sportinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Buffalo have won seven straight and 14 of the past 15, including playoffs, against their AFC East rival.Miscues and a lack of discipline continued to hurt the Dolphins (0-3). Their worst start since 2019 will lead to more questions about coach Mike McDaniels’ job security.The Dolphins, who reached the playoffs in each of McDaniel’s first two seasons, dropped to 8-13 since a wildcard loss to Kansas City in 2023.Allen finished 22 of 28 for 213 yards and improved his record to 14-2 over Miami, with 43 TD passes in those games.

The Dolphins had a first down at the Buffalo 21 when Bernard jumped a pass intended for Jaylen Waddle. It was the game’s only turnover and a critical play for a Bills defense that had struggled to get Miami off the field. The Dolphins converted 10 of 15 third-down opportunities.Matt Prater sealed the win on Buffalo’s next possession by hitting a 48-yard field goal.

The five-time Dutch champion’s key game was in the final round against Hans Niemann, when the controversial American, who himself needed to win, had his attacking ideas thwarted in the opening.Giri gained the bishop pair, thensystematically swapped piecesinto an endgame where his bishops had maximum impact. The Dutchman has long had a reputation as a draw specialist, but given a small edge he can be deadly.The runner-up, Matthias Blübaum, seeded only 32nd, has been twice European champion yet has never attained an elite 2700 Fide world rating. The 28-year-old German No 2 played pragmatically in critical moments, especially in the penultimate round when his compatriot Vincent Keymerhad a winning endgamebut missed the tactical resource 54…Nxg3! In Blübaum’s post-game interview, he declared himself “insanely lucky”.View image in fullscreen3990:Maria Klimova v David Spence, Gibraltar 2006. Black (to move) is two pawns down, and apparently without compensation, so he resigned. Can you do better?On the face of it, Giri has a chance in the eight-player Candidates, but Blübaum is a likely also-ran. In his two previous appearances there, Giri drew all 14 games in 2016, but was a second-half threat to Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2020, while Blübaum may be earmarked as the opponent who all the favourites expect to beat (the current in-word for this is “ farming”).Final leading Grand Swiss scores at Samarkand were Giri 8, Blübaum and Keymer, Alireza Firouzja (France) all 7.5. Firouzja, after being narrowly edged out, did not attend to receive his bronze medal at the final victory ceremony.The 15-man group who tied on seven points, and were separated for prizes by tie-breaks, included five Americans. That represents a significant success for the St Louis billionaire Rex Sinquefield’s project of creating a group capable of winning world team events in the 2030s.Abhimanyu Mishra, 16, fifth on tie-break, and Andy Woodward, 15, seventh, are teenagers, while the fanatically ambitious Niemann, eighth, Awonder Liang, 11th, and Sam Sevian, 18th, are all in their early 20s. So a success for the US, even though its main hope, Levon Aronian, finished down the course in 84th place.England’s Nikita Vitiugov, a former Russia champion before he switched federations, had a solid performance close to his rating with two wins, seven draws, and two defeats.When there are winners, there must be losers. India had the top three seeds in Samarkand, but they all underperformed. Arjun Erigaisi was close but no cigar in sixth place, while the world champion, Gukesh Dommaraju, lost three games in a row, two of them to teenagers, and dropped out of the world top 10; Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu was not at his best.Gukesh probably regrets entering the tournament but still has his battered world crown and can now concentrate on his 2026 title defence, which he is likely to start as the underdog against whoever is his challenger.Praggnanandhaa still has an excellent chance to qualify for the Candidates via the 2025 Fide tournament circuit, where he has a clear lead. The US champion and world No 3, Fabiano Caruana, has already qualified via the 2024 Fide circuit, while the world No 2, Hikaru Nakamura, is set to take the Fide rating spot with the aid of his recent maximum scores against weak opposition in the Louisiana state championship and the Iowa Open.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The World Cup is a knockout, with best of two classical games followed by speed tie-breaks, so the chances for upset results are significant.Prominent contenders who have not yet qualified include the double world title challenger, Nepomniachtchi, the world top 10 players Erigaisi, Firouzja, Keymer, Wesley So and Wei Yi, Uzbekistan’s Nodirbek Abdusattorov, and Niemann. Elementary arithmetic confirms that most of these will be disappointed.In the $230,000 Women’s Grand Prix, India’s Vaishali Rameshbabu, who won the 2023 Grand Swiss, repeated her victory with 8/11, while Russia’s Kateryna Lagno also qualified for the Candidates on the same score. The pair were half a point ahead of Bibisara Assaubayeva (Kazakhstan) who was placed third on tie-break ahead of Tan Zhongyi and Yuxin Song (both China) .Overall, the open world title is now in a state of flux, while in contrast China’s Ju Wenjun has a firm grip on the women’s throne. The 34-year-old has held the world title since 2018, has defeated five challengers, and continues to hone her game through participation in grandmaster tournaments. She is now part of the all-time women’s elite consisting of Hungary’s three Polgar sisters, China’s Hou Yifan, and Georgia’s Nona Gaprindashvili. None of the current women’s candidates look likely to defeat Ju, who should see off her next challenger comfortably.3990:1…Qg7+! 2 Rxg7 Rxh3+! 3 K or gxh3, draw by stalemate.Explore more on these topicsChessLeonard Barden on chessnewsShareReuse this content"

With Pep Guardiola this is always going to be meant as a positive thing, a sign of a team starting to fizz.These are benevolent machines: not so much joyless droid-football, more perfectly functioning jam factory assembly line, interlocking units, systems in perfect concert. A chess computer playing padel against a chess computer, coached by 25 even more powerful chess computers. A conversation about Bauhaus architecture in a New York food-science restaurant where dessert is a cube of fibreglass flambéed at your table by a hologram.Garnacho’s return is a referendum on Amorim – he cannot afford to be embarrassed | David HytnerRead moreSomething like that anyway. It is acceptable to get a little carried away, a little purple prose at the spectacle of a high-functioning Guardiola team. If only because Guardiola himself is such a paradox.Here we have the ultimate control coach, whose ideal game of football is the million-man midfield plus infinite possession, but who is simultaneously gripped by an almost comical degree of unfiltered passion, leaping on the touchline, carving wild human shapes in the air with his cold metal robot hands.Either way machine-level excellence was clearly a theme of the post-match chat in a very happy Manchester City dressing room aftera fine, fluid 3-0 winagainst a non-fine, non-fluid Manchester United last weekend.Guardiola’s eyes boggled with pleasure as he spoke about the relentlessness of his players. “Erling is a machine,” was Jérémy Doku’s verdict afterErling Haalandhad scored two fine goals and in between spent much of the game running over the various portions of sullen human flesh acting as the United defence.Although, arguably, the parts that stood out most were when Haaland was less not more of machine, and in ways that may – repeat: this was against the outdated software, the systems crash of Amorim-era United – point to a change in City’s attacking patterns.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland’s goal past Manchester United’s Altay Bayindir in the derby victory for City had an air of assuredness.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersThe usual elite Haaland qualities were there. The sniper’s eye. The miss-one-score-two fearlessness. The preternatural height-to-speed agility ratio, a physical gift, but one that also requires constant maintenance, aged 25, and is perhaps a little taken for granted in his fourth season at City.It is easy to overplay the nature of the Haaland style. He remains an unusual elite footballer, albeit one who is either a single-cell Viking goal-zombie with the first touch of a League Two carpet-fitter; or the complete centre-forward every time he manages to complete a through ball.But there was also a slight sense of pattern-shift to the way Haaland led City’s attacks, and an ominous note forArsenalbefore Sunday’s unavoidably massive early season meeting at the Emirates. Liverpool play their home derby against Everton on Saturday. Their record in that fixture reads played 12 and lost one with an aggregate score of 24-7 over the past decade.By the time Monday rolls around, defeat by City at home could leave Arsenal six points behind the champions before the early season fumblings have ironed themselves out. You can’t win the title in September. But you can do quite a lot to stop Arsenal from winning it.And for Haaland in particular the chance to inflict a lung-crunching early body shot may just represent an interesting side-project. Is it personal with Arsenal now? Surely not. Football moves too quickly, players see each other constantly. There isn’t really time for genuine old-school grievances to fester. But it is also easy to forget that the last meeting of these teams in February was a strange occasion, a statement-style Arsenal result that ended up meaning very little, and also, in its optics, something of a grudge game.View image in fullscreenMyles Lewis-Skelly replicated Erling Haaland’s yogic celebration after scoring in Arsenal’s thumping 5-1 win over Manchester City in February.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersA5-1 Arsenal wincould have felt like a corner turned given their poor league record against City across the entirety of the Guardiola mega-era. Five Arsenal players scored that day, including two teenagers. But what might have been a note of ignition became instead a moment of vertigo.Arsenal went out of the Carabao Cup three days later. The next home game was the1-0 defeat by West Hamthat killed the league season. After the City game they dropped 18 points in their next 12 games and were 10 off the top at the end.Scroll back and the key snapshot that day wasMyles Lewis-Skelly doing the Haaland yogic celebrationafter scoring, a follow-up to the “Who the fuck are you?” interplay between the twoin the previous game at the Etihad. This is all fine, fun, normal stuff. Lewis-Skelly is a very good and confident young player. Haaland probably found it funny. All human life is banter now.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yes, you’re nine points ahead of your closest recent rivals. But this was actually the chance to win the league in City’s season of drop-off. And Haaland now has the opportunity to open another chapter in a game that actually does count for something, going into which he is also in a rare run of form.View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola was effusive in his praise of Erling Haaland after the striker’s display against Napoli in the Champions League this week.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAHis current goalscoring run is modern-football craziness: 18 in his past 14 games from May to September, scored across four competitions against opponents from eight countries. We can probably say it now. This guy, well, this guy knows how to do this.Haaland has also been playing a little differently, at least at certain times and against the right opponents. In the Manchester derby he had 31 touches, five of which were shots, six headed clearances. His control has just got better, his passing quicker and more City-like.This should happen. He is being coached by Guardiola every week. But there is also a sense the team shape and the available spaces have shifted a little. Two things were apparent on Sunday. First Haaland dropped deeper, linking the transitions well. Late in the second half he took the ball in the centre circle, sniped into space and nudged a perfect pass to put Tijjani Reijnders in on goal, De Bruyne-style.Pep Guardiola unsure if Rodri will be fit enough to start for Manchester City at ArsenalRead moreAnd second, he got to run at the centre-backs, using his speed facing goal as a weapon as it was in his Borussia Dortmund years. Even his close-range opener had him running away from a mildly interested Luke Shaw, before producing a super-delicate finish. His second involved romping like a wild mustang from halfway. And yes, outpacing Harry Maguire over 40 yards may be the elite football equivalent of defeating a pot plant in a bare knuckle fist fight, but the finish also had a lovely air of inevitability.Haaland is just very, very good at this, in a way that has at times got lost in City’s blitz attack. It helps to have the right opponents. United’s centre-backs repeatedly stepped up to fill holes left by an outmanoeuvred central pivot, leaving gaps to sprint into, another example of how easy it is to plan against a manager who tells you exactly what he’s going to do every time.Haaland could be in his familiar pared-back form against Arsenal, who have excellent, mobile centre-backs and a swarming midfield block. But he has also produced outstanding all-round games against the same opponents, most notably inthe 3-1 win in February 2023.And on days like these he really can look, not just like an actual centre-forward, but like the best centre-forward in Europe. For Arsenal he presents a highly motivated note of danger in a game that already feels like an eliminator for the right to chase Liverpool through the autumn.Explore more on these topicsErling HaalandManchester CityArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In order to change the record, it may be time to do something different with Everton on Saturday. The club won at an empty Anfield underCarlo Ancelottiduring Covid but have not silenced the stadium since 1999.Your Guardian sport weekend: Women’s Rugby World Cup semis, Azerbaijan Grand Prix and moreRead moreWith Everton emboldened by positive beginnings to the campaign, starting the weekend sixth, this could be the moment for Moyes to be more adventurous. The arrival on loan of Jack Grealishhas brought new lifeto his forward line. The England international looks revived after becoming a bit-part player at Manchester City. Four assists in as many games show the threat he offers.A goalless draw last Saturday against Aston Villa did not reflect the quality of Everton’s attacking but did show their continued defensive fortitude, three goals having been conceded this season. Everton’s expected goals (xG) was 2.08 but they got only two of 20 shots on target. The salient point is that they are creating opportunities and attacking with urgency. Grealish manufactured five chances against Villa, offering a creative spark not heavily associated with the team over recent years.Iliman Ndiaye and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall enhance Everton’s armoury. The Senegal international brings his own brand of trickery and an uncertainty with the ball at his feet regarding what will happen next, an attribute that confuses and scares opponents in equal measure. Dewsbury-Hall has guile and intelligence, wanting to play progressive vertical passes when he can to keep Everton moving forward. There is even the enticing prospect of giving Tyler Dibling a debut off the bench to test the Liverpool full-backs.Only three players in the Premier League have completed more take-ons than Grealish and Ndiaye, who have eight. Although Liverpool are top, there is an acceptance that they are vulnerable, and a more expansive Everton could exploit them. “We have got to be careful,” Moyes says. “We have to watch we don’t open ourselves up. We lost narrowly at Anfield and had a draw at Goodison [last season], both close games. So I think Liverpool’s signings have improved them. It’ll show, maybe not immediately, but it will show in time. We are improving as well. It is difficult to show improvement at the top for Liverpool, but we have a real chance to show we have made a step up. It doesn’t mean we are close to Liverpool yet but I am going to see if we can get a positive result if we can.”View image in fullscreenIliman Ndiaye brings his own brand of trickery to Everton’s attack.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Ed Sykes/Apl/SportsphotoOne clear issue is the centre-forward. Thierno Barry is still settling and Beto has never given the impression of being prolific, though eight goals in 30 Premier League appearances last season give a faint indication he could be a useful striker.When Everton drew with Liverpool at Goodison Park last season, Beto was dominant, causing Virgil van Dijk regular problems. He may not often be in the same league as the Liverpool captain but he has the ability to raise his game for box office events.“Liverpool have played at a different level to us for the past few years and against teams that have been at a different level and they did in midweek as well,” Moyes says, referencing the Champions League and Wednesday’swin against Atlético Madrid. “I think we will go and try and do the best we can and we always have done. I don’t think there is any game we haven’t done that. At the moment I wouldn’t care how I won at Anfield. I would take any sort of victory I possibly could; it wouldn’t matter whether I played great expansive football or defended with a low block.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Keane was close to providinga winner against Aston Villaand the same level of intent in the box would be problematic for Liverpool. Variety is advantageous, to keep opponents needing to deal with consistent problems.Liverpool have had issues at full-back. On the right, fitness concerns have limited the game time of Jeremie Frimpong and Conor Bradley, forcing Dominik Szoboszlai to learn a new position. On the opposite flank, Milos Kerkez has provided mixed results and Andy Robertson replaced him against Atlético. Liverpool looked vulnerable down their left, from where the Spanish side got numerous crosses into the box. Everton will feel they can exploit the lack of consistency in the lineup of Liverpool’s back four.History shows how difficult it is for Everton to win at Liverpool.

The Portuguese has insisted throughout that run that he is not for turning, a message he reiterated in emphatic, dramatic fashion prior to Chelsea’s visit to Old Trafford this evening.“Not even the pope will change [my thinking on] this. This is my responsibility. This is my life,” he said. “If I’m a player and I have a coach that with a lot of pressure all around the world is being told: ‘You need to change the system’ and I’m going to change – they [the players] will look at me in a different way. So, I will not change that, but there will be an evolution. But we need to make all the good steps [first].”Garnacho’s return is a referendum on Amorim – he cannot afford to be embarrassed | David HytnerRead moreBenjamin Sesko is yet to score in five United appearances since his £73.5m summer arrival from RB Leipzig. In part that has been down to a lack of service, something that also held back Rasmus Højlund prior to the Denmark striker’s loan move to Napoli. Amorim, however, is unconcerned about history repeating itself: “If you remember Arsenal [in the opening game of the season] we missed a lot [of chances]. Burnley, we missed a lot. Fulham in the beginning, we missed a lot”.Amorim did admit a lack of service to the striker was an issue in last weekend’s 3-0 loss at Manchester City, Sesko’s first start for United. “Against City, Sesko looks like he’s alone in the box, I agree,” said the head coach. “In the final third we get there many times [but] when I look at the box, Ben was alone. We cannot score in that way. But [overall] I think it’s not the same team in that department compared to last year.”Amorim also defended deploying Bruno Fernandes in midfield. “I want Bruno deeper, to have more possession, to try to control the game more. And we are doing that,” he said. “Sometimes we miss Bruno a little bit up front. Maybe because [Mathues] Cunha is not there. But if Cunha is there, we have one extra player.”Meanwhile, Amorim has revealed he received a show of support from SirJim Ratcliffeafter Manchester United’s co-owner flew in for a meeting on Thursday.The Portuguese met Ratcliffe after he arrived at United’s Carrington training ground in a helicopter, along with the chief executive, Omar Berrada, and the football director, Jason Wilcox, and insisted the discussions were positive. “He was offering me a new contract,” joked Amoim of Ratcliffe. “[No], it’s normal things, just to show the support. Explaining that it’s a long project. He said many times: ‘This is my third season.’ For me it’s not. I spoke with him, with Omar, with Jason. Just trying to see all the data around the team. So a normal meeting and we had several, but at this moment it’s normal people pay attention to that.”View image in fullscreenSir Alex Ferguson (top left) behind Jason Wilcox, who is next to Omar Berrada and then Sir Jim Ratcliffe, during Manchester United’s 3-0 defeat at City on 14 September.Photograph: David Blunsden/Action Plus/ShutterstockAmorim acknowledged he has to win more matches. “This is football and this is the club with more pressure in the world,” the 40-year-old said. “But we want to win. Last year I was very critical of the way we play. [This year] we are playing well until the boxes. Defending and attacking. We need to be more aggressive in the boxes. We need to be more clinical.“The rest I think we are improving. Comparing to last year we are in a better place. But again we need to win. We lost against Arsenal and we lost against City. And here losing, especially in the beginning after last season [finishing 15th], is a problem.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I came in last April, around 18 months ago, and it’s been a real challenge – I can’t lie.“I thought the club was in a much better place than it was. We had no football identity, we lacked alignment between ownership, the CEO, football and the academy and we’ve just been working so hard behind the scenes.”Amorim will have Cunha and Mason Mount available for the game against Chelsea and he brushed aside questions regarding Alejandro Garnacho’s return to the venue. The wingerjoined Chelsea for £40m last month.“Garnacho is not our player,” said Amorim. “I’m focused on our players – I’m really happy with Mase and Cunha returning. That is my focus.

They have been told they cannot use the first-team facilities, which has meant training on a different pitch, changing in a different dressing room and eating in a different area.Garnacho’s return is a referendum on Amorim – he cannot afford to be embarrassed | David HytnerRead moreSterling revealed in an Instagram post at the start of the week that he was training at 8pm, which is plainly not ideal for a father of four young children and led to an intervention from the Professional Footballers’ Association. The organisation has worked withChelseato try to arrange a more amenable schedule for Sterling and Disasi, which has featured lunchtime sessions with the under-21s.Maresca, who said he knew from his playing days what it was like to be out of favour at a club, did not appear to have much sympathy. “My father is 75 years old and for 50 years he has been a fisherman, working from two o’clock in the morning to 10 o’clock in the morning,” Maresca said. “This is sad in life – not a player and the way that they work.“I’ve been in Raheem’s situation and Axel’s situation as a player and for sure I know that it’s not the best feeling for a player because you want to train and play and then, for a different reason, the situation is the situation. I know that the club is giving them the opportunity to work in the right way and this is the only thing I can say.“It’s not just Chelsea, it’s any club in the world, I can promise you. Italy, Spain, England, France, USA, Brazil, any club in the world … when, for any reason, the player and the club doesn’t find any solution and you give the player all the tools to do training sessions and do everything. But if you are not involved in the squad, you are not involved in the squad.”View image in fullscreenRaheem Sterling turned down loan moves to Napoli, Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich during the summer.Photograph: Marcel van Dorst/DeFodi Images/REX/ShutterstockSterling signed for £50m from Manchester City in 2022 and has two years to run on his £325,000-a-week deal.

But if they seemed like good options for Chelsea, they were not so for Sterling, who did not favour a loan to an overseas club. MunichBayern’s move also came very late on deadline day – too late for Sterling to make a composed decision.Sterling’s priority was a permanent transfer and he made clear that a switch to Fulham would have been his preference only for the clubs to fail to agree terms. It is understood that his salary was not an obstacle. Disasi wanted to get a move back to France.Explore more on these topicsChelseaRaheem SterlingnewsShareReuse this content"

Could the Europa League offer a boost?Ben FisherFri 19 Sep 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 19 Sep 2025 15.02 EDTShareThe statistic doing the rounds this week was that Chris Wilder has been sacked andreappointed as the Sheffield United managersinceBoubacar Kamara scored Aston Villa’s last league goalfour months ago. Villa have been slow out of the blocks and this is unusual territory for Unai Emery, who has spent the best part of three years almost exclusively exceeding all expectations, elevating a team who were near the bottom of the Premier League into one capable of bloodying the noses of European superpowers in the Champions League.But a sticky start, of four Premier League matches without a victory or goal – they are the only team in the English professional pyramid to carry that ignominious mantle – and amidweek Carabao Cup exit, has been rather in keeping with a difficult few months. Villa headed into the summer knowing incomings would be limited owing to the financial picture andthey sold Jacob Ramsey, a homegrown and well-regarded player, plus some on the fringes, to help balance the books. But uncertainty lingered around key players until the September transfer deadline, none more so than their goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez, who had been keen to move. Theadditions of Harvey Elliott, who will join permanently next summer,Jadon Sancho and Victor Lindelöfbelatedly provided a much-needed boost.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreConsidering Villareached the Champions League quarter-finalslast season, they have arguably improved year on year sinceNassef Sawiris and Wes Edensacquired the club. So, has it been a strange time? “A little bit, but we keep going,” Emery says. “Because I had a lot of [difficult] moments. Two and a half years ago we lost three matches in a row [against Leicester,Manchester CityandArsenal], and in that moment I was focused on the reaction. Today is the same. The last two matches, I felt our progress.”Is it too early to think this could be a defining week for Villa? On Sunday they visit the Stadium of Light – where Sunderland have won both games since returning to the top flight – in need of a fillip and a week later host Fulham, another side they will be expected to overcome, in between hosting Bologna in the Europa League on Thursday. Emery recently watchedSunderland ’Til I Die, the Netflix documentary taking in their journey down to League One and back up, and it is worth remembering the strides Villa have taken in recent years. Equally, that does not mean Emery is immune to scrutiny.“Circumstances” was the buzzword for Emery on Friday and, really, it is a euphemism for the financial rules the Villa hierarchy believe hinder clubs with naked ambition from progressing. The parameters have been compared by Villa’s senior figures to the tightening of not one but two belts. Qualifying for a European competition for the third successive season ensures another set of hurdles, with Uefa’s squad cost rule (SCR) – which limits spending at 70% of revenues – as pertinent an issue as the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules. Villa’s wages-to-revenue ratio in 2023-24, covering a 13-month period, was a league-high 91%. Villa were fined £9.5m in Julyfor breaching SCRand agreed a “glide path” with Uefa to move in line with the rules, acutely aware the ultimate punishment is they could be kicked out of continental competition for repeated transgressions.At the time Villa felt adamant they could strengthen despite the rules but it has proved trickier than envisaged. Senior players acknowledge more signings would have invigorated the squad, with Ezri Konsa, one of Villa’s most consistent players, suggesting the ruleshad “killed” Villaand another, Youri Tielemans, noting there is a balance to strike. “Sometimes it’s good to have new players because it brings some freshness and you get different qualities, but in my experience, when I was coming in as a new player I took some time to put the system in my body because it can take some time,” he said last month.View image in fullscreenNew signing Harvey Elliott (No 9 in picture) scored Aston Villa’s only goal of the season so far in the Carabao Cup defeat by Brentford.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersIt may explain why Villa’s bigger signings have struggled to enhance the team. Donyell Malen has made three league starts since arriving in January from Borussia Dortmund in a £20m deal, Ian Maatsen has not displaced Lucas Digne at left-back since joining for £37.5m from Chelsea – instead Digne signed a new contract this summer – and Amadou Onana, after a fast start, scoring twice in his first three matches, has been on the periphery of Villa’s success, partly owing to injury. Moussa Diaby also faded before Villa recouped their £50m outlay after a single season. Villa believe there is more to come fromEvann Guessand, a £30m summer buy.It is also worth remembering that this time last season Villa’s start was not as flawless as it seems. Villa won six of their first seven matches in all competitions but in that run Emery turned to his bench and, chiefly, Jhon Durán. The Colombia striker, on loan at Fenerbahce after leaving for the Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr in January, scored five goals in that period, four as a substitute, including three winners. Emery moved for Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio in January to quicken the pulse of his side and maybe Elliott and Sancho will yet do similar.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Failure to score at Sunderland would make them the third team in English top-flight history not to score in their first five league games, joining Ipswich in 1970-71 and that Palace side. The dismal start eight years agocost Frank de Boer his joband though Palace roused under Roy Hodgson, who led them to mid-table, they had to wait until after the October international break for their league first goal and victory. Emery is not under any internal pressure but the expectations are significantly greater at Villa. “Genuine expectations are now in a difficult place,” said Damian Vidagany, Villa’s director of football operations, recently.It is too easy to blame PSR and SCR for stunting Villa’s growth, though rapid progress has meant they are, in part, victims of their own success. Some at Villa recognised a drop-off was inevitable but few predicted this season. Did Emery expect a dry spell? “We are Aston Villa, with our circumstances,” he said. “We have a lot of positive things in front of us and I’m excited to recover our consistency in the Premier League; this is the first objective. And then it is another competition: theEuropa Leagueis something so, so special for us.”He is, of course, a Europa League specialist, having won it on a record four occasions – three years in a row with Sevilla from 2014 and more recently with Villarreal in 2021 – and it would not be a surprise if Villa dispatch Bologna on Thursday and go deep into the competition or even win it in Istanbul. Monchi, Villa’s president of football operations, has a tattoo of the Europa League trophy on his left wrist to commemorate those wins with Sevilla, and Vidagany said he will follow suit if Villa triumph this season. For now, though, there are other priorities.Explore more on these topicsAston VillaUnai EmeryEuropa LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The quintessential Gen Z footballer, who appears to divide his time evenly between having his head up on the pitch and his head down in his phone off it, had made one faux pas too many on social media.The 21-year-old’s attitude had been slated: he was petulant, self-absorbed; he played for himself and not the team, failing to follow tactical instructions. It was certainly the view ofRuben Amorim, who did not take long after his arrival at United last November to feel the hackles rise when it came to the young Argentinian.Maresca short on Sterling sympathy, Arsenal make boardroom reshuffle: football – liveRead moreThe head coach’s view would only harden. He wanted Garnacho out, casting him into his bomb squad at the beginning of the summer. It was a move endorsed by the hierarchy. So when Garnacho returns to Old Trafford withChelseaon Saturday – the haste dramatic, indecent – it is likely there will be a negative reaction.It is because, first and foremost, the match-going United fans back their manager. Even one who is averaging a point a game in the Premier League. Especially one who is averaging a point per game in the Premier League. The boos for Garnacho would be a representation of their support for the club. And yet it is some distance from being that simple.The reason is that there is a constituency of United fans who retain a good deal of affection and appreciation for Garnacho, who has been central to some of the club’s better moments in recent times after his first-team breakthrough in 2022-23 under Erik ten Hag.They loved singing “Viva Garnacho” to the same tune as their old serenade for Cristiano Ronaldo – Garnacho’s idol. They were energised when he tore in from the left; quick, skilful, direct, capable of the spectacular. To them, he is what a classic United winger should be. And if he was a bit cocky with it, then good. Garnacho aspired to wear the club’s No 7 shirt, the previous property of Ronaldo among other icons. Brashness is a part of the package.View image in fullscreenAlejandro Garnacho takes on Bayern’s Sacha Boey on Wednesday. He is in the Champions League, Manchester United are not.Photograph: Marcel Engelbrecht/firo sportphoto/Getty ImagesIt is possible to see Garnacho’s return as a kind of referendum on Amorim, who was allowed by the higher-ups to sell an academy-polished jewel because of the faith they have in him and his methods. Do the United hardcore hate Garnacho? Absolutely not. Any boos for him would be of the pantomime variety. It is not exactly Fernando Torres returning with Chelsea to face Liverpool.Where it could get interesting – or uncomfortable – for Amorim would be if Chelsea won well and Garnacho was brilliant. The United fanbase are worried about Amorim; they are questioning him despite the outward support. It would be easy to imagine some using Garnacho as a stick with which to beat him if the player thrived at Chelsea.There had to be a few pangs at United when they watched Garnacho’s unveiling video at Stamford Bridge, which ended with him perched on a pitch-side hoarding. It was one of the goal celebrations he performed at United, copied of course from Ronaldo – like so many of the rest. Garnacho did the siuuu, the calma, the pointing down at the pitch, the sleeping celebration, the chest-out-and-hands-on-hips.But when he popped himself on to the Old Trafford hoarding after scoring the first of his two goalsagainst West Ham in February 2024and was joined by Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Højlund, it was an image that endured, hinting at youthful possibility. Mainoo is now out of the starting XI and Højlund has gone to Napoli.How have we got here with Garnacho? There were flashpoints under Ten Hag, starting with when Garnacho was disciplined on the summer tour of Thailand and Australia in 2022 after he turned up late to a pair of team meetings. Ten Hag did not play him in any of the matches there. Garnacho would react badly to being substituted at half-time at Bournemouth in April 2024, posting a shocked emoji on his Instagram story andliking tweets that criticised Ten Hag’s decision. In September of that year, Garnacho liked a post thatdetailed criticism of Ten Hag by Ronaldo.View image in fullscreenAlejandro Garnacho will not have found any notifications about a Manchester United European campaign on his phone before Chelsea’s game at Bayern.Photograph: Ulrik Pedersen/NurPhoto/ShutterstockYet Ten Hag liked Garnacho. He would admonish him, rather like an exasperated parent, but he played him, trusted him and was rewarded, Garnacho becoming a mainstay, providing plenty of good memories. The best was surely theoverhead kick at Everton in November 2023, which would win the Puskas award. Or perhaps it was his goal and role inthe FA Cup final triumphagainst Manchester City in 2024.Amorim was less tolerant and the first crack in his relationship with Garnacho was evident after theEuropa League tie at Viktoria Plzenlast December. He introduced him as an 81st-minute substitute but as he imparted some last-second advice, he perceived that Garnacho had turned away; he was not listening. Amorim dropped him from the squad for the next game, which was the derby at City, and, thereafter, there was rarely a positive feeling.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Garnacho apologised to the squad, according to Amorim, and paid for a dinner out with them. But everything was completely broken when Amorim used him only asa 71st-minute substitute in the Europa League finalagainst Tottenham in May.Garnacho knew what he was doing when he complained to Spanish broadcasters in the mixed zone after, saying that “the final will influence [what he did next] but it’s the whole season, the situation of the club”. His brother, Roberto, would pile in on Instagram, saying Garnacho had been “thrown under the bus” by Amorim. In late June, when Garnacho uploaded a picture of himself in the shirt worn by his fellow United outcast Marcus Rashford on loan at Aston Villa, it was nothing more than a parting shot.View image in fullscreenAlejandro Garnacho with Ruben Amorim after being substituted against Ipswich following Patrick Dorgu’s red card. The player walked straight down the tunnel; he later apologised.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersWhere Garnacho had starred in Ten Hag’s 4-3-3 system, which prioritised pure wingers, he found himself squeezed out in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 – a square peg in a round hole at No 10 or wing-back. Garnacho has to take the responsibility for his behaviour, the inability to deal with frustration that has led some to label him an egomaniac.Yet an alternative view persists about the fiercely ambitious kid who, at 16, went from Atlético Madrid to United, moving into digs in a new country, with little of the language and at a time when the world was in the grip of the coronavirus pandemic. He is just a kid, who sometimes makes bad judgments. If Garnacho is unable to look up from his phone to say hello, then maybe it is a generational thing. Could he be misunderstood?United have received £40m from Chelsea, making Garnacho their fourth-highest sale behind Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Ángel Di María in that order. It was below the market rate for a player who finished last season with 21 goals and assists. Blame the bomb-squad status.Garnacho’s Chelsea debut at Brentford last Saturday did not go as he dreamed it. On as a 79th-minute substitute, he would lose Fabio Carvalho at the far post for the concession of a stoppage-time equaliser and Enzo Maresca made the point on Friday that Garnacho had switched off minutes earlier in the same defensive situation only to get away with it. Must adapt and do better, was the manager’s sentiment.But Maresca can feel Garnacho’s motivation in the countdown to Old Trafford. Would he take it into account when he considered his starting lineup? “Probably it is something that we have to think about,” he said.Maresca believes in the power of the narrative arc and for Garnacho it contains a quirk. When he made his United debut in April 2022 under Ralf Rangnick, it was as a last-minute substitute at Old Trafford against Chelsea. So much has changed. His desire to prove a point has not.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimChelseaanalysisShareReuse this content"

He will touch the No 24 on his shirt, chosen to commemorate the day Jeremy died, aged 18. And then he will head out to where it all comes to him and it all leaves him too. “I feel nervous every game,” Dolan says, “but when I’m walking though the tunnel it’s like it’s all dropping off me, the shackles fall. All the graft, everything you gave to get here, this is it, now you’re free. You have responsibility, but it’s like the playground again.”Some playground. This is not the Dales Estate, Salford. This time the Santiago Bernabéu awaits. “These are the stadiums any kid dreams of, but it’s not even for me. I’m quite selfless,” Dolan says. “I’ve always got satisfaction from other people’s enjoyment. It’s a moment for everyone around me, friends and family, to be there, to see these places and say: ‘Remember when he was in the park,’ to look back and think: ‘We’ve been through so much, now we’re here.’”‘Mourinho is more than a man – he’s a global brand’: coach returns to Benfica with plenty to proveRead moreThe third of seven siblings, born in Manchester and signed byEspanyolin July, Dolan sits at their training ground in the Barcelona sunshine, talking eloquently about the pathway, the pressure, loss and love, friendship. He thinks about the Manchester City team he joined at seven and left soon after, told he was too small. He thinks about Burnley and City again, whom he rejoined at 13 and where he was cut for a second time. He thinks of Preston, non-League Clitheroe, all the kids who played with him, about Jeremy especially.Now here he is in Spain. He has come a long way the hard way, acutely aware of those he wishes could have got there with him, and grateful to those at his side. “You can’t imagine how tough it is,” Dolan says. “I was lucky, but 99% aren’t. It’s scary; I think what would I have done if I hadn’t [made it] and I genuinely don’t know. You’re labelled as a footballer. When that’s stripped from you, you think: ‘Who am I?’ I remember taking ‘Man City’ out of my Instagram bio. You feel you’ve lost your identity and without that the world is a scary place. I was lucky I have a real supportive family. Some people have no one, constantly battling their own thoughts.”Football doesn’t do enough for those who don’t make it, which is almost all of them. In October 2020, two weeks after his birthday, Wisten was found dead in his bedroom at home, the coroner concluding the teenager had killed himself. Released by City after suffering a knee injury, Wisten struggled to find a club. Dolan was broken, his best friend taken from him. A pall-bearer at the funeral, he wrote and read a poem during the service. An ambassador for the mental health charityGo Again, he takes calls, offers support and perspective.View image in fullscreenTyrhys Dolan says it was a ‘no-brainer’ to sign for Espanyol after he was offered a move.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./Alamy“It shouldn’t take losing someone to see that football needs to take action,” he says. “Jeremy had come to Preston but he didn’t get the scholarship. At the time he got released a lot of his friends, including me, were succeeding. I don’t know the reason and I don’t want to say it’s football, but it must have been so hard for him. You see your friends [playing] and feel: ‘Who am I? Now that I’m not a footballer, what am I?’“Football is a highlights reel. I’m not posting a picture on Instagram not looking my best; I’m posting when I’m fresh. They think, ‘Oh, he’s blessed’, that football solves everything. They don’t know what’s behind it. There are more dark days than light. I try to help young players understand.”Even after he reached Blackburn, a first professional contract signed in 2020 having been three months without a team, there were tears. At times, Dolan admits, you wonder where the joy is. Until you get into the tunnel, and on to the pitch, that is. “After the rain, the sun comes. You wouldn’t appreciate the sun without the rain.” There’s a moment’s quiet. “Sometimes you get survivor’s guilt. My friends were at City. Now they go to every game and they buzz off it. They’re like: ‘We’re living the dream through you, Ty.’ It’s bittersweet because you’ve grafted so hard to get there and you just want everyone with you. Maybe I’m the way I am because I lost Jeremy.“We’re not macho guys and they support me always, they would if I was on the other side of the world. When Espanyol called, they were like: ‘Get your bags packed. We’ll miss you but, click a finger, you need us, we’re there.’ I needed that. There was one thing, though: Jeremy’s cemetery. I go every Sunday. I felt I was leaving him. He would have told me himself: get on the plane and go, this isLa Liga. But I was thinking: ‘Who’s going to take flowers? Who’s going to go?’ My boys were like: ‘We’ll cover that, we’ll clean the headstone, we’ll take flowers.’ It brought me to tears. I’m 23, still young, but I needed to take steps. Espanyol was a no-brainer. I don’t know how many have made that step from the Championship.”View image in fullscreenTyrhys Dolan celebrates acrobatically after scoring for Blackburn against Stoke last year in the Championship.Photograph: Craig Galloway/ProSports/REX/ShutterstockThere’s a smile. “To be truly honest, that first week training, I thought: ‘Pfff, this is …’” Dolan laughs. “I didn’t tell anyone because I didn’t want them to worry, but I was like: ‘Am I up to this?’ Genuinely. The standard was … honestly, it was unbelievable. But I love that. It’s a wake-up call: you wanted this, raise your game.”Introduced as a substitute against Atlético Madrid, Dolan helped Espanyol to a comeback victory on the opening weekend of the season. A starter since, he set up the winner against Osasuna with a flick and provided an assist against Mallorca. Espanyol are third, their best start in 30 years. Fans are calling him Dolandinho or Maradolan. No wonder he’s cracking up.“It’s crazy. I knew what I could do but this quick?” Dolan says. “Against Osasuna I had been nervous in the first half. I couldn’t explain it. At half-time I thought: ‘I could be coming off here,’ but the manager said – well, he had it translated – ‘Just be yourself’. I thought: ‘He’s right.’ I did that little trick, we scored, everyone was buzzing.

You see it in the nicknames and clips. I was saying to my dad: that feeling when you get the ball and you hear the ‘Dmm-dmm-dmm-dmm-dmm’ of seats flipping up, feel the anticipation. People spend their money and time; it’s only right I give them that. I don’t want to just do a pure bunch of skills and not add anything, but I do want to put on a show. I want them to enjoy watching Espanyol, to know that when Ty gets the ball something can happen. After Osasuna, I was sitting on the balcony with my mum and dad, looking at the videos, talking. And I wished that moment could last for ever. But football is relentless, constantly turning another page.”And so to the Bernabéu, another playground. “I’m the same person I was in the park, the kid my dad made run up hills until I couldn’t breathe,” Dolan says. “I would go home crying and my mum would give me a cuddle. You think of everything you endured, how many miles my dad’s driven, how many tears my mum has wiped off my face. Football is such an emotional game. We’ve had an unbelievable journey. My family and all my friends. The players only got two tickets so my mates have theirs in the Madrid end. It’s all right, they’re not hooligans. This is for them.”Garnacho’s return is a referendum on Amorim – he cannot afford to be embarrassed | David HytnerRead moreIt’s also for Jeremy. “I’d said to my mum: ‘I want my next shirt to be for him’,” Dolan says. “He was born on the ninth [of October] and you’re not going to get the No 9. When we got to Espanyol they said they had 16 and 24 available; 24 is the day he passed away, and my mum’s eyes started filling up. It felt like he was with us. All the numbers you could get, and we got the one we needed.“He’s always here. I feel him with me, like I’m living this for him as well. Would I trade all my career to have Jeremy back? I would. I put everything into it but some things are bigger. Try to enjoy the journey and if I can take it to the heights, that’s Jeremy’s dream and all my friends’ dreams. That’s probably why I work as hard as I do. It is a responsibility because so many people truly want me to do well and there’s that pressure of ‘What if I don’t?’“I’ve come to Spain and I love it. Now let’s see where it will take me. And I’m sure he’s proud, man. He’s definitely looking down buzzing, and he’s getting to go to some top stadiums.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

However, Borggräfe is understood to have denied the allegations during the course of the proceedings.The club’s investigation was ongoing at the time when Borggräfe – who signed for the English team this summer on a free transfer from SC Freiburg – missed their first competitive match of the season,the WSL Merseyside derbyat Anfield.When speaking in relation to that loss to Everton, explaining the German keeper’s absence, the Liverpool head coach, Gareth Taylor, said that was down to an “internal club issue”.Speaking later in September, when discussing her availability before last Sunday’s away loss against Leicester City, Taylor said of Borggräfe: “She’s back in with us. There’s nothing further to report but she’s back training with the team so she comes into contention for the weekend.”Borggräfe was then included in the Liverpool squad at the King Power Stadium, as an unused substitute.A club statement on Friday said: “Liverpool Football Club is aware of an alleged use of discriminatory language by an LFC Women’s player. The club has followed its protocols to the fullest extent and the alleged incident has been reported to the FA, which is conducting an investigation with our full support. We condemn all forms of discrimination; it has no place in football or society. We are unable to comment further while the investigation is ongoing.”The 25-year-old Borggräfe, who spent more than 10 years on Freiburg’s books after joining their academy, is in her first season in English football but is yet to make her debut for Liverpool.Taylor was asked on Friday whether Borggräfe was available for selection at Aston Villa on Sunday and replied: “At this moment, yes, she is.” It is understood she did not train with the team on Thursday but that this was down to family reasons and unrelated to the investigation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But we have to be respectful of the process and make sure we follow the right process.”Liverpool are one of three WSL sides yet to pick up a point, along with West Ham and the bottom-placed, promoted side London City Lionesses.Explore more on these topicsLiverpool FC WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballThe FAnewsShareReuse this content"

Each team plays three games at home and three games away, having been handed one home match and one away match against different teams from each of the three pots, meaning that, for example, everybody knew they would face one pot 1 team at home and another pot 1 team away, setting up a number of exciting-looking contests.The league phase will take place across six separate rounds of midweek fixtures: on 7-8 October, 15-16 October, 11-12 November, 19-20 November, and 9-10 December, concluding on 17 December when all 18 teams play simultaneously.

The German playmaker said recently he was still adapting to the intensity of English football but that the challenge of doing so was one of the key reasons behind his move from Bayer Leverkusen.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreThe 22-year-old is poised for his first taste of a Merseyside derby on Saturday when Everton visit Anfield and it will be an important test of Wirtz’s attributes. He has helped Liverpool start the season perfectly but is yet to contribute a goal or an assist. His performance in the3-2 Champions League win over Atlético Madridin midweek was his best, suggesting he is beginning to settle.“To say that he’s an artist doesn’t do him justice,” Slot, the head coach, said. “He is an artist, but he can be mean as well. Otherwise, you can’t reach the levels he’s reaching. He works incredibly hard here in this building to get better and better and better. So that mentality he has inside of him and you also see that mentality when he loses the ball once or twice. He’s not going to hide, he wants the third one, he wants the fourth one.”Wirtz, who made his name as a dynamic creator in his homeland, plays as a No 10 and is learning the idiosyncrasies of Hugo Ekitiké, Alexander Isak and the other forwards.“He’s adjusting, in my opinion, very well,” Slot said. “It gets better and better every single game. He always wants to have the ball, even if he has a few moments where we feel like he could do better. He just always wants to keep the ball, always keeps on trying. And he gets better and better, and fitter and fitter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This was a masterclass by Kévin Rouet’s team who used pace, patience and instincts to knock the Blacks Ferns out and book their spot in the final for only the second time.The match had already been picked out as one that would go down in history but the result certified that. Sophie de Goede excelled once again for Canada. Whether affecting breakdown turnovers, kicking conversions or tearing through the opposition defence, she was the linchpin. The trust Canada had in each other when they had front-foot ball allowed them to play with pure freedom that downed New Zealand and set up a final against England or France next Saturday.England and France ready to fight for a shot at Women’s World Cup gloryRead moreThis is the first time since 2014 New Zealandwill not be in the final, their first tournament loss since Ireland defeated them 11 years ago and just the second semi-final they have lost. Canada, who crowdfunded their preparations for this tournament and are semi-professional, went in as underdogs, a title they will surely not be labelled with again after a performance for the ages.“The confidence in this team, we arrived at the game not being stressed by the event and not being stressed by playing the Black Ferns,” Rouet said. “That is a big gamechanger for us, especially with the way we want to play the game. If we don’t have the confidence it is going to be hard for us. I like to see that in this team now. I am pretty confident I will see the same behaviour arriving at the final.”Ashton Gate was almost sold out and the tension was palpable. There were perfect conditions with no rain all day and clear skies at kick-off. Canada laid no challenge in response to the haka, they simply watched in a tight-knit line as the Black Ferns electrified the atmosphere.The first blood came from a well-worked Canada try with the captain, Alex Tessier, collecting a chipped kick and the player of the match, Justine Pelletier, evading defenders to dive over. The crowd were treated to more moves from Canada as they constantly broke the line and they next scored through Asia Hogan-Rochester. The wing jumped on a huddle of her teammates in celebration with the Black Ferns looking shocked by how fast Canada were converting.View image in fullscreenNew Zealand’s Stacey Waaka loses control of the ball under pressure from Canada’s relentless defence.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianEach of the Canadian tries came after they won a penalty and kicked to the corner and their third was no different. A rolling maul and 15 phases later Florence Symonds scored and the defending champions congregated under the sticks trying to figure out how to get back into the game.Whatever was said in that huddle worked: less than two minutes later Tanya Kalounivale was over. It set fire to New Zealand’s attack but one move went begging with a forward pass and then another through a dropped ball. The injurythat sidelined Jorja Millerin those moments was keenly felt: in previous matches she was the player to create something from nothing. Not taking their chances cost New Zealand as Canada were in again, this time through the formidable De Goede.The Black Ferns knew they had to be the next to score after the break but Canada did not take their foot off of the gas, with Tessier going over. A whiff of a comeback began with tries from Liana Mikaele-Tu’u and Braxton Sorensen-McGee, who added her ninth of the tournament, but it was snuffed out with a De Goede penalty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rouet’s side proved themselves before this semi-final as the world No 2 team but this will have woken everyone up to the level they are capable of.

You can be the best at everything.”But as Hunt, a 23-year-old ­Cambridge University graduate, told her story it became clear that she has had it anything but easy. A few years ago she ruptured her quadriceps so badly that her mum needed to lift her out of the shower. She ­struggled with her mental health too, and imposter syndrome. Yet she kept finding a way back.So when she found herself sixth coming around the bend of a stacked world 200m final, she embraced the challenge. At that stage, the American superstar Melissa ­Jefferson-Wooden was powering clear to win gold in a world-leading time of 21.68sec. But you could have thrown a blanket over everyone else.World Athletics Championships 2025: Lyles and Jefferson-Wooden take 200m titles, Benjamin and Bol win 400m hurdles – liveRead moreYet Hunt was gaining. With 50m to go her power and immense ­fitness drove her past Dina Asher-Smith, the 2019 world champion, who would take fifth. Then ­Shericka ­Jackson, winner at the last two worlds, who had to settle for bronze. There was a dip for the line. And then a loud scream when Hunt saw the stadium ­scoreboard showing that she had won silver in 22.14.“My mantra on the start line was ‘no fear’,” she said afterwards. “I knew I just had to be aggressive. I was with them coming off the turn then it was game on. Maybe I’m never going to be the underdog again after getting a medal. But I was just like: ‘It’s time to go hunting.’Six years ago, Hunt was ­making waves having broken the world under-18 record. The next year she began her studies at Cambridge. And she was being hailed by Vogue as “one of the faces to define the decade”.Then her world fell apart. In the first year of university she got ill, didn’t sleep because she drank too much caffeine, and found her ­mental and physical health deteriorating. Then she ruptured a tendon and needed surgery on her leg.But she never gave up, even at the lowest points. “I really have that radical utter insane belief in myself,” she said. “And my ­family really helped me through that and supported me, with lifting me out of the shower and redressing my wounds.”Even after she recovered she found her English tutors at Corpus Christi college weren’t always the most ­supportive when it came to her ­athletic pursuits.“I think Cambridge is an ­especially unique experience,” she said. “It exists in its own crazy world with so many different random made-up words. And the dining hall is ­something out of Harry Potter, you’re wearing your robes and the gong sounds and you have to stand up and recite Latin.

Hillsin travelled smoothly from the off and still clearly had plenty of running left when he jumped the last within a length of the lead, but Kitts remained motionless all the way to the line without asking his mount to quicken, before eventually finishing third, a length-and-a-quarter behind the winner.Kitts told a recent disciplinary hearing into the case that he had deliberately prevented Hillsin from winning, due to the “perception of a threat” from Higgins if he did not. He has not ridden in public since the Worcester race and has left the sport. Higgins, like Barnes, refused to co-operate with the investigation and declined to appear at the hearing, on the grounds of ill-health.Despite Kitts’s suggestion that he had been threatened, the panel said in its initial finding on Friday that the jockey’s “life or personal safety was not threatened in the event that he failed to comply with the instructions which he received from John Higgins”, adding that he “had ample opportunity to refuse to comply with Mr Higgins’ instructions, had he been minded to do so.”Honour was found to have misled the local stewards after the racing, telling them that Kitts had told him that Hillsin had been “hanging” in the closing stages. In the panel’s view, “while it was a lie which could have been construed as the lie of a co-conspirator… it was far more likely to be attributable to a desire to defend a young jockey who had been found wanting in how he should have run his race.”The penalties for Kitts and Higgins will be decided at a later date.The British Horseracing Authority said in statement that it was “pleased” by the independent panel’s decision, adding: “The actions of those involved in this case are fundamentally incompatible with British racing’s values and are an affront to the many thousands of people, up and down the country, who dedicate their lives to this sport and to competing fairly.“The outcome of this hearing demonstrates that our sport will not accept this sort of behaviour, and we will always do what we can to uphold our values and ensure everybody who loves racing can be confident in its integrity.”Electrics has spark for Gold Cup sprintJim Goldie registered the first Group One success of his 30-year training career when American Affair took the King Charles III Stakes at Royal Ascot in June, but the Lanarkshire trainer might well draw even greater satisfaction from a first success in the Ayr Gold Cup on the final day of the track’s Western meeting on Saturday.Goldie has turned his stable into a northern powerhouse over the last four seasons, posting a new record for prize money won in every campaign since 2022, and has already moved into seven figures for the first time this year.He has had little to celebrate in Ayr’s historic sprint handicap, however, with the long-time stable stalwart, Hawkeyethenoo, failing to make even the first 10 home in five attempts from 2010 to 2014, while American Affair, racing off a mark of 97, was only 16th after setting off as 11-4 favourite 12 months ago.Goldie relies onJordan Electrics(3.35), fifth home as the stable second-string last season, in this year’s renewal, and while it is, as ever, an intensely competitive handicap, the nine-year-old could prove to be the horse to end the trainer’s long wait for a win.It is, admittedly, an unusually advanced age for a potential Ayr Gold Cup winner but Jordan Electrics is an unusual sprinter who notched no fewer than seven handicap wins as an eight-year-old last year.There are valid excuses for a couple of lesser efforts this year and Jordan Electrics, who is priced up at around 20-1, was just over half a length behind Northern Ticker, the likely favourite, at York last month.He is 5lb better off with that rival on Saturday and also has Goldie’s excellent apprentice, Lauren Young, who was aboard last weekend’s Portland Handicap winner at Doncaster, taking off a potentially invaluable 7lb.Ayr 1.15Mr Kinghad no luck in running last time and is weighted to go close with a better passage.Newbury 1.30Montassib drops to five furlongs for the first time on his seasonal debut andCover Upcould could exploit any rustiness in last year’s Group One Sprint Cup winner.Ayr 1.50The lightly racedAlmericshould find further improvement for the step up to 10 furlongs.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday tipsShowNewmarket:1.00 Annastarzy 1.35 Queen Of Atlantis 2.10 Dapper Guest 2.45 Golden Redemption 3.20 Bob Mali 3.55 Almuhit 4.30 Warrant Holder 5.05 Triple Force.Ayr:1.15 Mr King 1.50 Almeric 2.25 Fivethousandtoone 3.00 Catching The Moon 3.35 Jordan Electrics (nap) 4.10 Red Spells Danger 4.40 Jannas Journey 5.15 Rock Melody.Newbury:1.30 Cover Up 2.05 Majestic Warrior (nb) 2.40 Night Step 3.15 Into The Sky 3.50 Sticktoyourguns 4.25 Linwood 5.00 Stem.Chester:1.55 Go Victor 2.30 Callahan 3.05 Al Shabab Storm 3.40 Paws For Thought 4.15 Jer Batt 4.45 Solar Pass 5.20 Imperial Trooper.Wolverhampton:4.19 Dunkeld Dreamer 4.50 Highlighting 5.25 Ten Sixty Six 5.55 Queen Kassi 6.30 Hilltop 7.00 Under Curfew 7.30 Karakula 8.00 Jimmy Mark 8.30 Dragonfly In Amber.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Newbury 2.05A slight drop in trip could be just whatMajestic Warriorneeds after a solid run in the Ebor last time.Ayr 2.25Fivethousandtooneis 4lb below his last winning mark on turf and can build on a promising run last weekend.Newbury 2.40Owen Burrows’s three-year-oldNight Stepmaintained his progression in defeat last month and remains fairly weighted on a 2lb higher mark.Ayr 3.00Catching The Moonshowed a fine turn of foot at Beverley last month and looks ready for this step up in grade.Newbury 3.15Jim Boyle’sInto The Skywas an 80-1 shot on debut but powered nearly eight lengths clear of his field and the bare form was backed up by an excellent time.Explore more on these topicsBritish Horseracing AuthorityTalking HorsesHorse racing tipsHorse racingnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s sad because we spend so much time together. You have to move on and maintain that personal relationship for sure and then people have gone on to do various jobs, some of them have been very successful in other places, and wish them all the best.”Martin Ødegaard has not trained ahead of Sunday’s game against Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium due to a shoulder injury but Arteta said there was a chance Arsenal’s captain could still feature.The manager must also decide whether or not to recall William Saliba after the Frenchman recovered from an ankle injury as the hosts attempt to make it five matches unbeaten against Pep Guardiola’s side in the Premier League – a streak that no other team has managed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.LED face masks are booming in popularity – despite being one of the most expensive at-home beauty products ever to hit the market. Many masks are available, each claiming to either reduce the appearance of fine lines, stop spots or calm redness. Some even combine different types of light to enhance the benefits.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But it’s wise to be sceptical about new treatments that are costly and non-invasive, and to do your research before you buy. With this in mind, I spoke with doctors and dermatologists to find out whether these light therapy devices actually work.They’re not a miracle cure for deep-set wrinkles, but experts say the best light therapy masks can promote collagen production, improve elasticity and help smooth skin with sustained use. And while it might seem like a new technology,research dating back to the 90sshows the efficacy of light therapy in wound healing, acne treatment and skin rejuvenation.Red and infrared light are safe to use on all skin types, but be warned that blue light can worsen hyperpigmentation on darker skin tones.I’ve tested some of the most popular devices on the market – including infrared masks – to narrow down my favourite LED face masks for treating a range of skin concerns.At a glanceBestLED face maskoverall:CurrentBody Series 2£399.99 at CurrentBodyBest budgetLED face mask:Silk’n facial£99.99 at CurrysBest for targeting multiple skinconcerns:Shark CryoGlow£299 at John LewisBest LED device for acne-prone skin:Lustre ClearSkin Solo£50.40 at AmazonWhy you should trust meI’ve been reviewing health and beauty tech for the past four years. During this time I’ve witnessed many beauty fads come and go. Naturally tight-fisted and a bit of a sceptic, I was initially struck by the cost of these masks. How on earth can an elaborate LED light strip set you back over £300?But after testing multiple light therapy masks, I’ve come to understand the technology behind them, and sadly you won’t be able to engineer your own light therapy system with a costume mask and a set of LED string lights.I don’t have many fine lines or wrinkles to test on, but I can comment on how blue light treatment affects acne because I’ve suffered from it since I was a teenager – despite my mum’s assurances that it would clear up after puberty. The experts I spoke to agreed on the efficacy of red and infrared light for anti-ageing.Are LED face masks actually worth it?Light therapy masks are fantastic additions to a skincare routine, helping to smooth, firm and reduce blemishes. Since I started using one almost a year ago, my skin is calmer, less prone to redness, and has a more even tone.However, LED masks can be expensive, and if you’re not disciplined enough to use one regularly, you won’t see results. Before you jump in and splash between £100 and £400, keep in mind that light therapy masks are most effective when paired with a good skincare routine. It’s crucial to make sure skin is properly cleansed before treatment and protected from sun damage afterwards.If you don’t already have askincareroutine nailed down, don’t buy a light therapy mask just yet. Consider starting out using a gentle cleanser and moisturiser, with anSPFfor daytime. You could also incorporate targeted skincare serums, such asretinolandvitamin C, to help firm and brighten the skin without the need for an expensive light therapy mask.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I tested the fit, comfort levels and usability of 10 of the most popular light therapy masks.’Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianSince LED treatments take a while to show visible results, it’s difficult to test multiple light therapy masks at once (at least, without spending a few years testing them), so I enlisted the help of expert dermatologists who were familiar with light therapy treatments long before they were commercially available.I spoke with Dr Barbara Kubicka, an expert in aesthetic medicine; Dr Derrick Phillips, a consultant dermatologist and spokesperson for the British Skin Foundation; and aesthetic doctor Dr Priya Verma, an authority on the science of skin ageing.I asked the experts to identify which features of a light therapy mask – such as bulb quality and quantity, light wavelength and treatment time – matter the most, to inform my choices. They also outlined the suitability of light therapy for different skin types and its associated risks.Armed with their advice, I tested the fit, comfort levels and usability of 10 of the most popular light therapy masks and other targeted LED devices. Getting hands on with the masks allowed me to pinpoint any of the key features the experts recommended, as well as useful features I found helpful as a consumer.I’ve been using a light therapy mask regularly for the past 12 months, so I can identify a good mask from a bad. My tests also included monitoring how well the treatments worked after four nightly sessions, with the obvious caveat that only very minimal results could be observed after such a short-term treatment. I then tested my favourite masks over several months, too, helping me to verify any unique treatment claims – as well as giving me plenty of opportunities to scare my boyfriend by sneaking up on him wearing each one.Only masks that use the brightest, flicker-free bulbs, fit comfortably and are easy to use made the final cut. After testing, I returned the masks sourced for this article to the manufacturers. Where that wasn’t possible, I cleaned the masks and donated them to theRedbridge Reach Outservice, a local charity that supports anyone experiencing domestic abuse.The bestLED face masks in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianBestLED face maskoverall:CurrentBody Series 2View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£399.99 at CurrentBody£399.99 at AmazonThis is the second red light therapy mask from CurrentBody, and it’s easily the brightest and best-fitting mask I’ve tested. If you want the most powerful red light mask money can buy, I believe this is worth the cost.The mask has 236 LED bulbs that blend red, near-infrared and deep near-infrared light, the latter of which is exclusive to the Series 2 mask. Theoriginal mask, which is £100 cheaper, has only the former two light frequencies.The deep near-infrared lights penetrate deeper than the other two types of light, CurrentBody claims. This leads to more effective treatment where it’s needed most – the deep near-infrared bulbs are positioned under the eyes and around the lips to better target areas where ageing is more pronounced. Add surface-level red light and near-infrared light, and you’ve got a face mask that works harder than most.Why we love itI loved how simple the mask was to use. After attaching it to my head using the adjustable straps, I turned on the mask to activate a 10-minute treatment. It offered brilliant facial coverage, wrapping all the way under my chin. And its eye guards were highly effective, blocking any glare from the bright lights and allowing me to continue doing my daily activities – or endlessly scrolling – while wearing the mask.I used this mask for three months, and was pleased to notice my skin tone looking calmer and more even than usual, with less undereye inflammation. As it’s a red light mask, it didn’t have much effect on my acne, but it did help to reduce redness.If you have blemish-prone skin, CurrentBody does sell ablue light maskfor the same price. It has the same comfortable, high-coverage fit and high-quality bulbs, but uses blue and red bulbs (slightly fewer: 220) to target acne-causing bacteria and reduce inflammation.It’s a shame that …the mask offers only one treatment setting and there isn’t a screen displaying the treatment time. Neither is a dealbreaker, but it’s nice to be able to choose different treatments, and almost every other mask includes a countdown timer.Number of LEDs:236Number of settings:oneTreatment time:10minsLight frequencies:red (633nm), near-infrared (830nm), deep near-infrared (1,072nm)Timer countdown:noBest budgetLED face mask:Silk’n facialView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£99.99 at Currys£160 at FenwickIf you want to try light therapy without remortgaging the house, the Silk’n facial LED mask is a good choice. It has 100 LED bulbs with good facial coverage, is comfortable to wear and offers a good range of light colours. It doesn’t have near-infrared lights like the pricier options, but it covers the basics at a decent price.Why we love itThis mask offers four colour modes: red, blue, yellow and purple. Red light helps stimulate collagen to reduce the appearance of fine lines, while blue light helps to soothe breakouts. The purple light comes from mixing the aforementioned blue and red lights, combining the effects of both to boost the skin’s overall evenness.Although less widely researched (and with limited clinical evidence to suggest efficacy), the experts I spoke to said the yellow light treatment could help improve hydration levels in the skin. I didn’t notice a huge hydration hit when testing this feature, so if your skin is crying out for hydration, I recommend using the other light settings alongside ahydrating serum.Each colour can be selected individually for a 10-minute targeted session, or you can select automatic mode, which cycles through the colours over 15 minutes to provide all the benefits at once.I found the Silk’n light therapy mask simple to use and comfortable to wear. Its flexible silicone build didn’t feel quite as sturdy as more expensive options, but I didn’t really notice this when using the mask. The built-in eye shields weren’t as bulky as others, but they still blocked out the light and protected my eyes well.The automatic mode left my skin feeling completely comfortable, with a slightly glowier finish than usual – just what I’d expect from an entry-level mask like this one.It’s a shame that …there’s no timer and it has fewer than half the bulbs of the CurrentBody, with no near-infrared light treatment for effective collagen stimulation deeper in the skin. This means it’s better for light-touch anti-ageing, and for soothing, acne-busting blue light treatments.Number of LEDs:100Number of settings:5Treatment time:10 or 15minsLight frequencies:red (633nm), purple (463-633nm), blue (463nm), yellow (592nm)Timer countdown:noBest fortargeting multiple skin concerns:SharkCryoGlowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£299 at John Lewis£299.99 at SharkMany will be familiar with Shark’s vacuum cleaners and hair-styling gadgets, but the brand’s latest venture is in skincare. The Shark CryoGlow is the only LED face mask to offer built-in undereye cooling alongside targeted light therapy for anti-ageing and acne repair.Why we love itThe CryoGlow offers three different wavelengths of light: blue, red and deep-infrared. It has three presets for “better ageing”, “blemish repair” and “skin sustain”. If these aren’t clear enough, the control screen explains exactly what each mode is designed to do, making it really user-friendly.I found the lights incredibly bright during my tests – though for safety they automatically dim when you remove the mask from your face – but I was happy with how the mask shielded my eyes.During every treatment, you can choose to switch on the cooling undereye patches, which aim to de-puff and soothe your skin. The cooling can also be used on its own, without the LEDs. There are three levels, the coolest of which felt startlingly cold at first but did a great job of calming down my eyes on a particularly bad hay fever day. Likewise, the blemish mode did a brilliant job of calming spots and redness with sustained use. I also liked using the skin sustain mode for a quick pick-me-up to brighten my skin before a night out.As you might imagine, using the cooling feature on full blast drains the battery more quickly. I performed two battery-rundown tests on the CryoGlow without cooling, and it managed 17 treatments. With maximum cooling enabled, however, this dropped to just seven. That’s still a decent number of treatments in between charges, but it’s something to bear in mind.It’s a shame that …since it’s made of plastic, it’s noticeably heavier than its silicone competitors. Thankfully, Shark has made the mask fit comfortably by using cushioned inserts at the forehead, brow and nose area.That’s when you’re sitting up, at least; when lying down, the metal cooling patches pressed into the delicate area under my eyes. Another unfortunate side-effect of the cooling is the whirring noise it makes – inaudible from far away, but pretty noisy when pressed on to your face.Number of LEDs:160Number of settings:fourTreatment time:4-8mins light therapy; 5-15mins under-eye coolingLight frequencies:red (630nm), infrared light (830nm), blue light (415nm)Timer countdown:yesBest LED device for acne-prone skin:Lustre ClearSkin SoloView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£63 at Lustre£50.40 at AmazonAcne can be a real pain, and many cosmetic treatments that target it leave skin feeling irritated, dry and flaky. These nifty adhesive LED patches from Lustre use blue light, which the company claims reduces acne-causing bacteria.Why we love itEach Solo patch has 15 pure blue LEDs at theproven wavelength for treating acne, 415nm. The patches cover a targeted area of skin about 2.5 x 5cm, which is perfect for treating problem areas such as the chin, cheeks and forehead. Since they’re rechargeable and far smaller than a typical LED face mask, they’re highly portable, making it easy to stay consistent with treatments wherever you are.I found the targeted treatments very effective for minimising breakouts in my chin area – somewhere I often struggle with spots. My skin was also quicker to heal, with fewer breakouts, the longer I continued with treatments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

This also means, unlike typical light therapy masks, they can be safely fixed anywhere on the body.If you’re worried that the adhesive will feel uncomfortable or be tricky to remove from breakouts, don’t be. The patches are so lightweight that the adhesive doesn’t need to be very strong. I found it easy and comfortable to peel off the patches after the recommended 20-minute treatment time.It’s a shame that …you need to buy the sticky patches when they run out. These cost£18 for a pack of 60, or 30p each. They also look a bit like leeches – only you can decide if that’s more palatable than the Hannibal Lecter look of the full-face LED masks.Number of LEDs:15Number of settings:oneTreatment time:20minsLight frequencies:blue (415nm)Timer countdown:noThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘You can choose which kind of light you want to use in four areas of your face’: the Lustre ClearSkin Renew Pro Facewear.Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianZkin light therapy maskView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£499 at ZkinBest for:anti-blemish and anti-ageing in a flexible maskIf the Shark CryoGlow listed above tempts you but you don’t want to use the noisy cooling patches, this mask from Zkin is a brilliant alternative. You may not recognise the brand, but it’s the brainchild of medical consultant Dr Ifeoma Ejikeme.The mask comes with the most widely researched red, blue and near-infrared light, with three modes: red, blue and combination. Whichever you choose, the mask uses near-infrared light tostimulate repair below the skin’s surface and boost circulation. Since it’s made from flexible silicone with removable eye inserts, I found it very comfortable to wear during testing.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s pretty expensive. You’d be better off buying the CurrentBody mask if you’re after very powerful red light treatment and coverage. It also has fewer bulbs than masks of a similar price.Number of LEDs:122;number of settings:three;treatment time:10mins;light frequencies:blue (460nm), red (630nm and 660nm), and near-infrared (850nm);timer countdown:yesFlikezePhotonMask QuintView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£179 at Flikeze£259.95 at AmazonBest for:a comfortable fitThe Flikeze light therapy mask offers a wide range of light colours: red, near-infrared, blue, green and yellow. Its settings include anti-ageing (red light), repair (yellow), brightening (green) and acne care (blue and red), and you can choose to do a 10- or 15-minute treatment. These all use near-infrared rather than deep infrared light.The best thing about this mask is how comfortable it is. It has two straps that wrap around the top and bottom of your head, holding it to your face without the mask ever feeling weighty or digging in. Its eye shades fit like diving goggles and kept my eyes completely shaded from light during treatment (you can see how little light leakage there is in the haunting photograph from testing).It didn’t make the final cut because …for the cost, it has fewer bulbs than average and the bulbs don’t cover the bridge of your nose – not a likely problem area for wrinkles, but spots can be a problem there. It also looks particularly disconcerting when worn.Number of LEDs:92;number of settings:four;treatment time:10-15mins;light frequencies:red (660nm), near-infrared (850nm), blue (415nm), green (532nm), yellow (590nm);timer countdown:yesLustre ClearSkin Renew Pro FacewearView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£449.99 at Boots£450 at LustreBest for:wireless controls and customised treatmentMost light treatment masks have wired controls. That doesn’t mean you need to remain tethered to a single spot, but it does mean there’s a remote that you have to carry around with you. This mask from Lustre, on the other hand, is controlled via a mobile app.It has two programmes, called Energise and Revitalise, and uses blue, red and near-infrared light. Unusually, you can choose which kind of light you want to use in four areas of your face: forehead, eyes, nose, cheeks and chin. In my tests, I liked being able to treat spots on my chin with blue light while using red light on the rest of my face.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not very comfortable. Since the battery is on the mask itself, it’s a little top heavy, and the eye protectors don’t do a great job of shielding your eyes. I also hate having lots of apps on my phone – it’s up to you whether the wireless freedom is worth the app installation.Number of LEDs:80;number of settings:two presets, with in-app personalisation options across five facial zones;treatment time:10mins;light frequencies:red light (630nm), near-infrared light (830nm), blue light (415nm);timer countdown:yesSilk’nLumiLips LED lip maskView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£79 at LookFantastic£80 at BootsBest for:targeted lip treatmentsIf your main area of concern is the lip area, you might not need to buy a full mask. The Silk’n LumiLips has 30 LEDsconcentrated in the lip area, covering smile lines and the chin. It has five light frequencies – amber, red, dark red, near-infrared and deep near-infrared. The only other mask on this roundup offering deep near-infrared light is the CurrentBody 2 mask, which gives you a good idea of how much value it offers.The mask has two modes, both of which use dark red, near-infrared and deep near-infrared light. The red-light mode claims to promote lip volume and firmness,while the second mode adds in amber light to reduce pigmentation and redness. I love that the mask requires only a five-minute daily treatment, making its less-than-comfortable mouthpiece slightly more bearable.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s built like an adult pacifier and feels like one too. You have to bite down on the mouthpiece to keep it in place, which is far less comfortable than just wearing a mask with a strap around your head.Number of LEDs:30;number of settings:two;treatment time:5mins;light frequencies:amber (605nm), red (633nm), dark red (660nm), near-infrared (830nm), deep near-infrared (1,072nm);timer countdown:noWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianWhat is LED therapy, and how does it work?“LED (light-emitting diode) therapy is a non-invasive treatment that uses specific wavelengths of light to stimulate various cellular processes in the skin,” says aesthetic medicine expert Kubicka. “Depending on the colour or wavelength, LED light can target inflammation, promote collagen production, accelerate healing and even kill bacteria.”Light therapy is a great addition to your skincare routine – for me, it’s helped reduce breakouts, improve healing and reduce the appearance of my acne scars. LED face masks are quick, gentle and non-invasive, and suitable for most skin types (although as mentioned above, blue light can worsen hyperpigmentation on darker skin tones, according to the experts I spoke with). The masks are effective and foolproof to use, and the daily treatments also force you to take a little time for yourself – perfect for a morning pick-me-up or an evening wind-down.Does red light help with anti-ageing?“Red-light therapy can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles through a process called photobiomodulation,” says consultant dermatologist Phillips. “It energises mitochondria, which are the batteries of the cells, powering the production of collagen and elastin by fibroblasts, the factories of the skin.”Elastin and collagen are “the building blocks of firm, youthful skin”, says Kubicka. Stimulating the production of these molecules can “improve skin density, elasticity and overall smoothness” as long as you complete treatments regularly.I have yet to develop fine lines or wrinkles, but I’m keen to avoid them by using red-light therapy for “preventive ageing”. However, “most of the clinical evidencefocuses on treating visible signs of ageing or repairing damaged skin, rather than long-term prevention in younger skin,” as aesthetic doctor Verma explains.Still, Verma reassured me my efforts wouldn’t be in vain. “Using LED light consistently and appropriately may help support overall skin health […] especially when combined with sun protection and a good skincare routine.”What different colours of light therapy are available?Several colours are available, with each wavelength claiming to target a different skin concern. These colours correlate to the visible light spectrum, and each can have a different effect on the skin.Red light has a wavelength of between 630 and 700nm and is the most widely known form of light therapy, loved for its non-invasive potential anti-ageing benefits. Near-infrared light above 700nm “penetrates the skin more deeply to support tissue repair and reduce inflammation”, according to Kubicka. Blue light therapy (415nm), on the other hand, has been proven to target acne-causing bacteria, leading to a reduction in breakouts over time. Kubicka also says blue light can help regulate oil production – another common problem for those with acne.The effect of some types of light on the skin are better researched than others.Near-infrared,red lightandblue lightare backed by scientific studies that identify the biological processes that each type of light triggers in the body.Meanwhile, research into green and yellow light is more limited. One study questions theefficacy of yellow lighttherapy and claims that a previous study may have been influenced by the placebo effect. Similarly, a study ongreen light therapysuggests that more research is needed to provide a solid recommendation for use as an anti-ageing treatment.How and when would you recommend using light therapy?The “how” is simple: always use light therapy masks on freshly washed, dry skin, before applying serums and creams. This will give the light the most direct access to the skin.Despite what some instruction manuals advise, don’t jump into daily treatments straight away – you may end up with slightly irritated skin. Start by introducing treatments two to three times a week, and monitoring the impact on your skin. If you don’t notice any sensitivity, you can incorporate more treatments, if permitted by the manufacturer’s guidelines.Once your skin is used to the treatment, “home devices should be used three to five times a week, for 10-20 minutes a session,” says Phillips. Don’t expect instant results, though. If you’re hoping to treat breakouts, you should “see a reduction in redness and the frequency of acne breakouts within two to four weeks”. Those using red light for anti-ageing benefits will need to wait a little longer: “It typically takes six to eight weeks to see visible changes.”Is light therapy safe for all skin tones?“LED light therapy is generally very safe when used correctly,” says Verma. This is because, unlike laser hair removal, it only uses low-level, non-thermal light. “The most common side effects are mild and temporary, such as slight redness, dryness or irritation.”“People with known photosensitive disorders or taking medications that make them more sensitive to light (eg certain antibiotics) should consult their doctor,” says Phillips. He also warns that those with darker skin tones should exercise caution when using blue light, since “some blue wavelengths have been associated with hyperpigmentation”. The Lustre ClearSkin Solo patches recommended above offer exclusively blue light, but the other masks on this roundup have blue-light-free settings if you do find that it causes sensitivity.How much should I spend on an LED therapy mask?There are hundreds of light therapy masks available at different prices, but the quality varies wildly. You may see results from a budget-friendly mask, such as the£100 Silk’n mask, but spending more will generally get you a larger quantity of bulbs that offer a greater range of wavelengths. You’re also more likely to get a mask with a better fit and coverage.The best mask for you will depend on your skin concerns and budget. Those hoping to invest in a mask with anti-acne properties will be able to spend less, since blue light is more widely available, but if you’re looking for the best anti-ageing deep near-infrared light therapy, you will need to part with more cash.High-end red light therapy masks can cost up to £500; if you spend that much, just make sure you use it regularly, or you won’t see results.Sarah Matthews is a consumer journalist who specialises in health and beauty reviews.

He’s yet another casualty of corporate kowtowingFri 19 Sep 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 19 Sep 2025 10.22 EDTShareWhen the history of this era is written, there will be much to say about the behavior of large corporations. And none of it will be good.As the Trump administration has ramped up its assault on American democracy, many corporationshave chosen to look the other way or to curry favor with the president. They have fired employees who were too outspoken in their criticism of Donald Trump–ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night talkshow, after Kimmel’s remarks about Maga’s reaction to the killing of Charlie Kirk, is the latest example.Or corporations have muted their brand’s identification with progressive causes.One casualtyis Jerry Greenfield, co-founder and namesake of Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream. This week, he resigned from the company.He did so because, hesaid in a statement, the politically outspoken company had been “silenced”.The consumer goods company UnileveracquiredBen & Jerry’s in 2000, for a reported $326m. At the time, it agreed to respect the company’s independence.Ben & Jerry’s co-founder quits, accusing Unilever of silencing social missionRead moreNo more, according to Greenfield.“Standing up for the values of justice, equity, and our shared humanity has never been more important,” Greenfield noted in explaining his resignation. But, he said: “Ben & Jerry’s has been silenced, sidelined for fear of upsetting those in power.”Ben & Jerry’s crossed swords with Unilever last year when itsuedthe company for allegedly fighting its calls for a Gaza ceasefire and an end to US military support for Israel.The 2024 suit claimed that Unilever had threatened to dismantle the ice-cream company’s independent board and punish members if Ben & Jerry’s issued a call for a ceasefire. (Unilever said it rejected “the claims made by B&J’s social mission board”. Its motion to dismiss the lawsuit is pending.)Another flare-up occurred in March of this year, when, according to Ben & Jerry’s, Unilever fired its chief executive, David Stever,over his workto advance the company’s “social mission”.If those allegations are true, Unilever would not be alone in trying to avoid offending theTrump administrationor its supporters. This is just the latest sign that the era of corporate social and political responsibility is over.Ice-cream lovers will now have to choose between their taste buds and their consciences.Corporate social responsibility (CSR) requires that business leaders recognize, as Harvard Business Schoolexplains, that they “have a responsibility to do more than simply maximize profits for shareholders and executives. Rather, they have a social responsibility to do what’s best – not just for their companies, but for people, the planet, and society at large.”The CSR movement reallytook off about 40 to 50 years agowhen businesses realized that they could carve out a niche and attract investment from people who wanted to make money and stay true to their values. Ben & Jerry’swas foundedin 1978 during the heyday of CSR, by Greenfield and Ben Cohen.Itwas upfrontabout the issues it cared about and the values it sought to promote. The list was long, but it included racial justice, refugee rights, climate, LGBTQ+ rights and democracy.The Association of Corporate-Citizenship Professionalstracesthe roots of CSR back to the 18th century. At that time, religious groups would not invest, and would urge their members not to invest, in businesses that did not advance their values. Those included the slave trade and businesses that supplied the instruments of war.Fast forward to the start of the 20th century, when in 1928, the Pioneer Fundbecame one of the first mutual fundsto promote socially responsible investing, which meant avoiding companies producing alcohol or tobacco, or promoting gambling. Almost a century later, theBusiness Roundtable includedin its statement on the purpose of a corporation the following: “We commit to … supporting the communities in which we work. We respect the people in our communities and protect the environment by embracing sustainable practices across our businesses.”Some progressiveshave criticizedCSR, describing it as a charade and a public relations tactic that left the profit motive intact and did not require substantial changes in the way companies did business. But Ben & Jerry’s did more than brand itself as interested in social justice and political equality.As its 2024 lawsuit made clear, Ben & Jerry’s has wanted to take political stands even if it meant that it would lose some customers. A year earlier, in March 2023, as Newsweekreports, Cohen “shocked many” by speaking out against the US providing military aid to Ukraine.” (An ally said he opposed Russia’s invasion butwanted a diplomatic solution.)While from time to time, the companyhas been accusedof not living up to its values, not surprisingly, conservatives have targeted Ben & Jerry’s for being “woke”. Some havetried to organizea boycott to protest what they see as its radical left politics.That’s perhaps why Unilever apparently wanted to pull back Ben & Jerry’s activism.What we are witnessing now in the way of corporate acquiescence to the rise of authoritarianism is a familiar story. There are plenty of examples.Take Viktor Orbán’s Hungary. There, as the political economist Gábor Scheiringargues: “Since 2010 Orbán has been using the momentum created by popular anger at the failures of liberal policies to build up his own system: authoritarian capitalism. A system that is deeply illiberal but capitalist: private property and the profit logic still dominate, but the state bureaucracy and its institutions are subdued to the enrichment of the preferred national economic elite.”There is ample evidence that Trump is succeeding in that same endeavor. That’s why the era of corporate social responsibility is over. Greenfield’s departure is just the latest evidence.Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsActivismOpinionUS politicsIce-cream and sorbetFoodTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Are Democrats up to the moment?Lloyd GreenThe president’s approval rating is underwater, with a new poll showing plunging Latino supportFri 19 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 19 Sep 2025 12.08 EDTShareThe 2024 presidential election was a disaster for the Democrats.Donald Trumpmanaged to shake loose the party’s base. Latino voters, Black voters and young Americans swung away from Kamala Harris, resulting in Trump’s first popular vote plurality in three tries. Less than a year later, the shifts may yet prove transitory. Looming cuts to healthcare, rising unemployment and sticky inflation may be yielding buyers’ remorse. Whether the Democrats are up to the moment is an open question.Regardless, the new “American Golden Age”, promised by the president and his minions, is looking more like stagflation for the many and a booming stock market for the few. Topline youth unemployment stands at 10.8%,according to the Trump-maligned Bureau of Labor Statistics. Unemployment rates for young men (11% ), Black youth (14.3%), and Hispanic youth (12.6%) are even higher.With midterms less than 14 months away, the president and his party ought to be concerned. The Democrats narrowly lead onthe generic ballot, despite being unloved, incompetent and in disarray. Meanwhile, Trump’s approvalremains underwater, hovering between -7% and -8% on average,according to the Silver Bulletin.Disapproval among Latino voters is starker. Immigration and masked Ice agentshave soured voterson the administration’s real gains in securing the border: according to one new poll, the incumbent stands20 points underwaterwith Latinos.The latestYouGov poll, meanwhile, pegs Hispanic disapproval of Trump at 65%. Among Black Americans, the figure is 84%. White Americans disapprove of him, 50-47. AReuters/Ipsos poll from Augustreports that only one-third of Hispanics approve of Trump.Yesterday seems so far away. In November,Trump fought Harris to a near drawamong Hispanic voters, 48%-51%. In 2020, they went for Joe Biden 61%-36%.Hispanic people were not alone in moving toward Trump. Americans under 50 and Asian Americans markedly shifted, too. Black communities demonstrated political restlessness as well. Against Harris, Trump garnered 15% of Black voters – up from 8% four years earlier. Among Black men, the change was even more glaring.Hispanic voters do not, of course, march in lockstep with the Democratic party or its establishment. George W Bush won four in nine Hispanic votes in 2004. John Kerry proved a dud. In 2008, Hispanic voters opted for Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama, the eventual nominee. In both the 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, they showed greater early preference for Bernie Sanders, a proponent of Medicare for all.A commanding win by the senator from Vermont in the 2020 Nevada presidential caucus sent the Biden campaign reeling. The failed one-term President Biden finished 25 points behind Sanders in that contest.The Great Recession and Covid-19 left deep scars. In June 2022, the Democrats lost a key race in south Texas. Mayra Flores, a Republican newcomer,triumphed in a special electionand flipped control of a long-held Democratic seat. A coda, Flores failed to win re-election the following November, and again lost in 2024.Fast forward to the current New York City mayoral race. There, younger voters and Hispanic voters comprise Zohran Mamdani’s political core. His victory in the Democratic primary was as much about economic dissatisfaction and uncertainty as demographic and generational change.Overall, Hispanic Americans showthe highest workforce participation rates. Lunch-bucket issues possess greater salience. Social issues generally receive less attention fromnon-college graduatesthan they do from white Democratic PhDs. As a corollary, whatplays well in the faculty loungeis seldom a winner outside those Ivy-covered precincts.The Latino vote is in flux. Trump’s promises to secure the border and crack down on illegal immigration proved less controversial among large swaths of Hispanic voters than Democrats had hoped. Rather, inflation and the kitchen table concerns carried the day for the GOP as Harris refused to distance herself from her boss.In south Texas, thousands of traditional Democrats cast their lot with Trump. Republican redistricting efforts in the Lone Star state nowhinge upon those trends continuing, a debatable but plausible premise.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq set new records almost daily. Yet Trump’s promise to “end inflation” and start “saving our economy” beginning on “day one” looks increasingly empty. His unilaterally imposed tariffs bite.Democrats have plenty of material to work with. Their capacity to eventually deliver a coherent message is another matter.Lloyd Green is an attorney in New York and served in the US Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Trump seemed to suggest that court rulings that blocked his beloved tariffs would have the destructive power of, say, 100 hydrogen bombs.Call me naive, but I never cease to be amazed when Trump says such egregiously false and ludicrous things. OK, I sometimes forget that he’s the guy who said thatnoise from wind turbines causes cancer. After narrowly winning the presidency a second time notwithstanding the30,573 Trump lies, falsehoodsand misleading claims in his first term, Trump evidently thinks he can say anything, no matter how false or foolish, and get away with it. As part of his tariff fight, Trump also blurted this absurdity: if the courts don’t uphold his tariffs, “we would become a Third World Nation.”Trump’s statement that ending tariffs will destroy the US is totally bonkers because the US became the world’s richest nation and has largely prospered for nearly 250 years (despite occasional slumps) before Trump imposed his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. In the months before then, the US had solid GDP growth, low unemployment and declining inflation – the Economist magazine even called the US economy “the envy of the world”. But now Trump says that if the courts give a thumbs down to his favorite plaything – I mean weapon – to bang other countries over the head with, it would end the US. Even Ramesh Ponnuru, editor of the conservative National Review, called that “lunatic stuff”.The truth is that if the courts block Trump’s across-the-board tariffs, that would be good news for theUS economy. It would prevent Trump’s tariffs from further pushing up inflation and slowing economic growth. By giving a thumbs down to Trump’s tariffs, the courts might be doing him a huge economic and political favor because his tariffs, and the inflation they are fueling, have been dragging his dismal approval ratings even lower.On 29 August, the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington DC ruled that Trump overstepped his authority when he invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose his Liberation Day tariffs. The court said that act doesn’t give presidents the authority to slap sweeping tariffs on other countries. Trump has appealed the ruling to the supreme court, which might rule on the tariffs this fall.The court of appeals repeatedly noted that the constitution gives Congress, not presidents, the power to impose tariffs. It further noted that the Emergency Act doesn’t mention the word “tariffs” even once among the tools the act authorizes presidents to use to deal with emergency trade problems. (That appellate ruling overturned the bulk of Trump’s tariffs: the blanket 10% to 50% tariffs on exports from more than 70 countries. The court didn’t rule on Trump’s product-specific tariffs on steel, aluminum and auto parts.)As part of his conniptions over the appeals court ruling, Trump also warned of fiscal disaster, complaining that the US would lose hundreds of billions of dollars if his tariffs were halted. But Trump conveniently forgets that it’s embattled US consumers who will be paying most of those hundreds of billions as they pay Trump’s tariffs, essentially import taxes on furniture, cars, coffee, electronics and other foreign goods.In using his hysterical language, Trump evidently had one audience in mind: the supreme court’s six conservative justices who have repeatedly ruled his way. Trump’s goal is evidently to scare the bejesus out of those justices – he hopes that by shrieking “You’ll Destroy the Country If You Rule Against Me,” that will persuade them to overturn the appellate court’s decision and uphold his tariffs. (The appellate court let the tariffs remain in force to allow time for appeal.)So far in his second term, Trump has a remarkable batting average with the supreme court’s six rightwing justices, who seem astonishingly subservient and supine vis-a-vis the most authoritarian, power-grabbing president in US history. The justices have used their emergency docket to grantTrump administration requests 18 times in a row, often vacating injunctions that lower courts put in place to stop what they saw as Trump’s rampant lawlessness. In repeatedly siding with Trump, the supreme court has scrapped lower court injunctions in several highly controversial cases, provisionally letting Trumpfire the chair of the National Labor Relations Board,gut the federal Department of Education, andgive Doge– with itsstaff of twentysomethings– access to thehighly private social security informationof hundreds of millions of Americans.Trump is no doubt worried that the supreme court, though submissive so far, will overturn his tariffs. Many conservative and libertarian scholars and lawyers oppose his tariffs as both harmful and illegal. Not only do they dislike the tariffs for pushing up inflation and disrupting global supply chains, but they see Trump’s tariffs as anti-free market and mucking up the US and world economies.When Trump announced his Liberation Day tariffs, he invoked a national emergency, saying the US trade deficit and other countries’ tariffs were urgent problems undermining the US economy. Admittedly the trade deficit and other countries’ tariffs are a problem, but in no way do they constitute a national emergency, especially since the US economy was seen as “the envy of the world” before Trump went hog wild with his tariffs. (There’s no denying that the flood of imports from China and other low-wage nations badly damaged many communities in America’s industrial heartland two and three decades ago.) Wouldn’t it be great if, in this tariff litigation, the supreme court stood up to Trump and issued a candid ruling that told him: “Sorry, Mr President, your supposed national emergency is hogwash, a pretext for you to pursue your destructive tariff obsession”?The supreme court’s justices shouldn’t let themselves be cowed, bullied or fooled by Trump’s talk that the nation will be destroyed if they nix his tariffs. Trump is like the boy who cried wolf, forever crying catastrophe if he doesn’t get his way. It’s time for the court and the nation to wise up to Trump’s lies, hype and shenanigans.Virtually every non-Trumpian economist agrees that Trump’s tariffs have hurt the US by increasing inflation, undermining GDP growth, creating huge headaches for corporations and seriously damaging the US’s relations with other nations. The justices shouldn’t buy Trump’s calamitous warnings that if they overturn his tariffs, the world will end.If the justices declare his tariffs illegal, it certainly won’t be a “disaster” for the US, as Trump has claimed. But it might be a disaster for Trump’s ego and for his dangerous dream of having an authoritarian presidency wholly unchecked by the other branches of government.If the supreme court rules against Trump’s tariffs, let’s hope that will serve as a much-needed first step to the court’s developing the backbone to rule many times more against Trump’s authoritarian and lawless actions.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTariffsUS economyTrump tariffsTrump administrationInflationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Yes, he ranted about the enemy of the people, insulted journalists and taught his followers to hate the press. But the guardrails mostly held and the spines of media owners stayed fairly stiff.This time, his project to keep the media on a tight leash – and therefore control the message – is going much better. At least from the point of view of a would-be authoritarian.That was made clear this week when the broadcast network ABC abruptlypulledJimmy Kimmel’s late-night show off the air. That move followed Kimmel’s Monday nightmonologuein which he talked about thedeath of Charlie Kirk, the far-right activist.Kimmel’s on-air commentscriticized Trump, but he also went out of his way to condemn Kirk’s murder and he slammed both ends of thepolitical spectrumfor their “extraordinarily vile” responses.Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert … who is the next to be silenced? | Moira DoneganRead more“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the Maga gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said.The next thing you knew, the Trump-appointed FCC chair,Brendan Carr, was making a guest appearance on a rightwing podcast, apparently threatening to pull federal licenses. Objecting to Kimmel’s suggestion – made before more evidence came to light – that the shooter was part of the Maga movement, he urged broadcast affiliates to“push back” on Disney– or else.“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” said Carr, sounding a lot like a Bond villain. “These companies can find ways to change conduct … or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”No need to say more, apparently. Nexstar, the nation’s largest owner of local TV stations, quickly decided to remove Kimmel’s show from their offerings, and soon Disney brass were pulling Kimmel off the air, at least for the time being.Kimmel’s sudden defenestration may be a political success for Trump but it’s a dire sign for free speech in America.The move “marks a dark new level of capitulation and censorship of speech more redolent of autocracies than democracies”, according to PEN America, the free-expression advocacy organization.The Trump administration’s bullying appalls first amendment champions. Just as bad is the way so much of big media has rolled over like a docile lapdog, eager to obey in advance.The administration “is becoming increasingly brazen in its abuse of government power to silence its critics”, said Jameel Jaffer, who heads the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, adding that “too many of the powerful institutions that could stand up to this thuggery are capitulating instead”.Each instance of bullying emboldens Trump and his allies, and each instance of capitulation lays the groundwork for more cowardice.Just a few months ago, it seemed shocking when ABC Newssettleda suit brought by Trump over on-air remarks made by star anchor George Stephanopoulos. Most first amendment experts believed that the network could have successfully defended the case, but instead ABC buckled, even including an apology with the financial settlement.Not long afterwards, an evenmoredefensible suit against CBS News over the routine editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris went a similar route.Parent company Paramount Globalsettledthe case. Soon after Stephen Colbertcriticizedthat settlement, calling it a bribe, his CBS late-night show wascancelled.The media has been cozying up to Trump in earnest since last fall, often with the owners’ commercial interests all too obvious. Paramount Global, for example, was eager for federal approval of a huge merger with another media giant.Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension is an alarming new low for the ongoing culture wars | Jesse HassengerRead moreThe Washington Post, at the behest of its owner, Jeff Bezos,killed its editorial endorsingHarris just before the presidential election, and since then, has taken a sharp right turn in itsopinion coverage. And the Los Angeles Times, under its billionaire owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong, has madesimilarTrump-friendlymoveson the paper’s opinion pages.Elated and on a roll, Trump recentlyfiled suitagainstthe New York Times, the hometown institution with which for decades he has had a love-hate relationship.The Times has vowed to defend the case, which is laughably weak despite the whopping $15bn price tag for supposed damage done to candidate Trump before the 2024 election.“This lawsuit has no merit,” the Times responded. “It lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting.” The Times publisher, quite accurately, called it frivolous.Such a stalwart response is heartening but all too rare. Instead, too many media companies are bending the knee – and then cowering as Trump grows ever bolder.What good is the first amendment when so many in power don’t seem to know it exists?Explore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionTrump administrationJimmy KimmelcommentShareReuse this content"

With local radicals on the march, we have to push backVan BadhamIf you’re wondering why you feel emotionally assaulted every time you click a social media app it’s not just due to the content of US newsFri 19 Sep 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 19 Sep 2025 11.01 EDTShare“Why do Australians care about the domestic politics of the US?” is being asked a lot.In the wake of another bloody week in US news and the online discourse around it, wrestling with the answer provokes questions about the implications of shared language, cultural sovereignty and deeply divergent attitudes to the politics of speech.Whether US news interests you or not, any non-American must admit that none of us can compete with the level of spectacle generated since the greatest commercial entertainment culture the world has ever known decided to apply the aesthetics of B-movies to politics.As an Australian more committed to politics-watching than most, locally produced content ofthe opposition leader, Sussan Ley, backing in the Afghan women’s cricket team while elsewhere a joyful government MP, Mike Freelander, wavesa giant IUDto spruik a healthcare initiative is both adorable and not competitive. Even disturbing rants in the vein of Bob Katter threatening topunch a journalist, Senator Ralph Babet claiming “leftism is a mental illness” or Pauline Hanson chanting something paranoid aboutAsian lesbian cyborgsfails in its power when you consider that Katter is slightly less famous than his own hat, Hanson once released a video complainingshe’d been murderedand Babet is also known as “Senator Baby” (seriously, if you Google the words, hisofficial parliamentary pageturns up).America used to fire the world’s imagination – but now the cultural conversation is being silenced | Van BadhamRead moreCompare this with thechildren’s book authorturned FBI head, Kash Patel, resembling alost frog on a highwayduring his own assassination investigation. Then consider VP and perpetual Succession understudy JD Vance’slivestreamed performance. Then there’s Donald Trump – the president of the United States, the commander-in-chief of the US military – standing on a lawn, next to a helicopter,threatening to doban Australian journalist into Anthony Albanese for … I don’t know, but I sure got the feeling it may be “impertinence”.And dear God, these are all news reports fromjust this week.In political terms – and to conspicuouslyshared relief– the Australian majority conclusively chose the giant IUD over the melodrama when the Labor government was re-elected with an expanded majority in May. In entertainment terms Australia is stone cold sober and watching a school play while US politics is a Marvel movie on LSD. After a dull day at work, it can be hard to look away.The second reason for the fascinated investment in US politics is a drier one. It’s a pragmatic interest in the activities of an economic and military superpower whose choices can still determine whether local industriesprosper or fail, whether people stayhealthy or sickand to whom Australia, at least, has sacrificed its owndefenders in war: in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq (twice).But there’s also a third, kangaroo-in-the-headlights element to the online interest in “planet America” that, in Australia, I’ve come to believe this week stems from a cultural interest in our English-speaking cousin that is not matched by genuine cultural familiarity.Australians were,before Trump 2.0, active tourists to the US: more Australians in a year habitually travelled stateside than visitors camethe other way. Here we both grow up and proceed towards death with US games, texts and the internet. A shared language gives the illusion of cultural similarity.Yet the language of extremity that accompanies so much of the wild content drawing the eyeballs of Australians to amplified, omnipresent social mediais not something to which we are accustomed. At all.The vaunted “free speech” rights of Americans that protect expression from Nazi insignia to Klan demonstrations are being debated this week as Trump’s attorney general,Pam Bondi, ponders whether “I don’t like you” deserves censorship as “hate speech”. They date from the passing of the first amendment to the US constitution in 1791.The impact of Trump 2.0 on Australia is evidence of how American we suddenly aren’t | Van BadhamRead moreAustralia took a longer time to become a federated nation and, while our courts recognise an “implied [constitutional] freedom of political communication”, over our history we have recognised that speech can harm and therefore must be subject to democratic control. It’s a pendulum of protection that swings with the times; Australia was still banning books until public opinion conclusively upended that restriction in 1973. Public opinion also backed regulating against discriminatory expression in a series of anti-discrimination acts beginning from 1975. The democratic regulation of speech applies to workplaces and the public square, where “bullying” is considered unlawful.These laws also supposedly apply to the internet but the sheer volume of the US-built information monstrosity now overwhelms our present regulatory framework to contain it. There’s a certain “island tameness” of Australians unused to unregulated speech yet now confronted by it.If you’re an Australian wondering why you feel emotionally assaulted every time you click a social media app it’s not just due to the content of the US news. It’s the discourse around it and the assumptions that such speech contains.A local radical right are, of course, mobilising in this window, emboldened by imported discourses that – on the internet – face no meaningful local barrier, to spread the harmful, hateful speech that the Australian majority from right to left has repeatedly, emphatically rejected.While we delay regulating platforms the assault on our acceptable social parameters will continue. The long-term loss will be more than Australia’s cultural sovereignty. With radicals on the march there will be an eventual inability to discern meaningful difference between our politics and America’s.Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsAustralian politicsOpinionFreedom of speechTrump administrationSocial mediaFar rightcommentShareReuse this content"

We can do the past. The rest of the world may be more powerful and richer than we are, but only Britain can embody statehood in a banquet. Only Britain can force the titans of the digital age into white tie and tails, and reduce an American president toquivering admiration.The question is where now? Trump’s itinerary mostly avoided central London. He did not go near Downing Street, let alone address parliament. Imagine a state visit to the US that did not include the White House or the Capitol. This week was all soft power and flattery. It probably did more for British tourism than for steel tariffs or pharmaceuticals.Yet as I watched the golden carriage trundle through an empty Windsor park and into a gathering of bear-skinned soldiers, I did wonder what real message was being given out. How could such a country handle a struggling NHS, with its courts and prisons in disarray and its Treasury not knowing where to turn? What of its prime minister, embedded in woes of past and present, but with no vision of the future?It was the past that cost Keir Starmer both Angela Raynerand Lord Mandelson, key figures in two major areas of his policy. Their faults were not monstrous, their atonement sincere and their talents clearly needed by the nation. Yet Starmer lacked the authority of his leadership to tell everyone to shut up and get back to work. Even a senior aide, Paul Ovenden,had to resignover eight-year-old text messages. Politics is becoming a no-go area for anyone with a past.Britain has become crippled by the cabinet being seen not as the nation’s executive but as a cabal. Starmer last week felt he could only restore his authority with a reshuffle. A year into office, almost all the leading ministries of state, including the Home and Foreign Offices, are again run by novices. Were David Lammy and Yvette Cooper really so bad at the foreign and home ministries? For the past five years, departments such as transport and culture have had a new boss every year. Ministerial office appears to be merely an internship.The historical archaism of British government is ingrained. An Attlee, indeed a Disraeli, would recognise the rituals of the modernHouse of Commons. Many prime ministers have tried to end the theatrical punch-up of PMQs, but without success. Debates are ill-attended and pointless. Select committees are lacking in authority. The House of Lords is virtually immune to reform, with hereditary peers and bishops still taking their seats, the former at least for the time being. As for Britain’s head of state, he still has to be anointed by God with oil.Every party comes to power promising to end what is widely agreed is the most over-centralised state in western Europe. Every one ends by increasing it. Last year Starmer did not bother even to wait and consider beforeeffectively abolishingwhat is seemingly local councils’ last area of democratic discretion, over housing and industrial development. His concession to the defence lobby was a reassertion of Britain’s once imperial presence east of Suez. His concession to the Labour left was a return to its ancient war on private landlordism.Over the years, some of Britain’s favourite television documentaries have been on archaeology, whether presented by Mortimer Wheeler or Alice Roberts. We love dredging up past history. Popular, too, is dredging up grim political sagas as public inquiries. There are roughly a dozen running at any one time, costing as much as a West End musical, and offering a running theatre of political failure.Barely a week passes without the spectre of past calamities – from the infected blood scandal to the government’sCovid response– haunting the present. Other countries determine issues of corporate responsibility and get on with the future. Swedeninvestigated Covid in two years. Britain is still doing so, at a cost that is likely to exceed £200m. It can take two years to bring rapists to trial, while thousands of lawyers crowd public inquiries. They are the soap operas of politics.The reason Britain’s public services are in such disarray cannot be separated from the recent instability of British politics, traditionally indicated by a surge in third-party support. Critical areas of reform simply went by the board. The health service defies reorganisation, as does the legal profession. The regulation of social media andartificial intelligenceare clearly beyond the competence of parliament. The assisted dying bill requires the utmost care and attention, not the present shambolic back and forth between Commons and Lords. I have lost count of the neglected issues that would once have been delegated at least to a royal commission, such as the future of universities, the funding of the BBC and local democracy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’d message my friend wondering aloud whether I would get through the day without making some glaring mistake. I was the prime minister of New Zealand. Only the second woman in the world to have a baby while leading a country, and some days were hard.Yet there was one response, a simple text message from my friend, also deep in the trenches of caregiving, that would stop me in my tracks: “Women give birth during war.”I knew what her intent was. Five simple words meant to remind me that every single day, women defy the odds – surviving horrifically difficult things, all while being mothers and caregivers. If they could persist, so could I. But that wasn’t the effect these words had. Instead, I thought endlessly of the women giving birth through the perils of war.We live in a world plagued by humanitarian crises. Famine. Civil conflict. The facts on the ground are often relayed crudely. The tons of food delivered or not. Aid funding announced or taken away. Territory gained or lost. Bombs dropped; casualties sustained.None of that tells us a simple truth. For all of the dehumanisation of these grave humanitarian crises, life, in the most extreme conditions, continues. Children still need to be fed. People still mourn the loss of loved ones, while trying to find a safe place to sleep. Health conditions need treatment. Women still give birth – and many of them don’t survive.Globally, loss of maternal life resulting from childbirthis most commonly caused by postpartum haemorrhaging(PPH). The World Health Organization estimates 14 million women a year areaffected, but death is largely preventable. In fact, in high-income countries, deaths from PPH have nearly been eliminated. But globally, 70,000 women are still dying every year. That’s one PPH death every 7.5 minutes. More than half of these deaths are in the 25 countries with current appeals for humanitarian aid.These are women in South Sudan who have experienced civil unrest for decades, and now reside in one of the most dangerous places to become a mother. The maternal mortality rate is more than1,200 per 100,000 live births.These are thousands of newborns in Burkina Faso, where hundreds of health facilities haveclosedas the security situation deteriorates, who will grow up without mothers, and all of the social and economic scarring that brings.There’s no question these environments are difficult to operate in. And that’s one of the reasons for the lack of progress in ending these preventable deaths. But they remain just that – preventable.Researchers from the World Health Organization and the University of Birmingham recentlypublisheda study that suggested a new solution, known as E-MOTIVE, could reduce deaths from PPH.The study, which involved more than 200,000 women in four countries, found that measuring blood loss using a simple, low-cost collection device called a “drape” and bundling together evidence-proven treatments – rather than offering them sequentially – resulted in dramatic improvements for women.These solutions are low-cost and can be delivered more widely. But the focus has been on providing them in stable settings, rather than areas of conflict and crisis where they are urgently needed.That is why the International Rescue Committee is launching a new global partnership titledSafer Births in Crises. This consortium brings together those experienced in the field, such as theInternational Medical Corps, theUN population fundandJhpiegoto deliver these lifesaving solutions for preventing, and treating, PPH to the world’s most vulnerable women.While Safer Birth in Crises will begin in countries such as South Sudan and Burkina Faso, it will also explore how to adapt these solutions for countries such as Papua New Guinea, which are increasingly prone to extreme weather events within the Pacific region. And with future resources, the consortium hopes to expand access to lifesaving interventions for both mothers and babies in additional crisis-affected settings, such as those in the Middle East.The Matariki Fund for Women isjoining this initiativeto fill a critical funding gap, and to save thousands of women losing their lives each year in child birth, by providing $4m to the consortium.But no one should pretend this is enough. Even a child born safely in these conditions is still being born into crisis.In the coming weeks leaders willgather for the UN general assembly. And as they do, we must continue to call on those with power to respond to these humanitarian crises, ranging from the conflict in Ukraine to natural disasters caused by the climate crisis. We should start with Gaza. There is a path to stopping the genocide still happening daily before us: more countries must recognise Palestinian statehood; any cooperation that facilitates military action must end; humanitarian aid needs to urgently reach the trapped and starving; and medical care must be available for the injured, the malnourished, and for the expectant and new mothers.We may live in a world plagued by humanitarian crises, but we must resist the dehumanisation of numbers. Because yes, women give birth during war, and they die. But they shouldn’t. Not in the midst of birth, nor in the crossfire of conflict. Sometimes politics and leadership should be as simple as that.Jacinda Ardern is a former prime minister of New ZealandDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What the party needs is someone able to unite and persuadeFri 19 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 19 Sep 2025 08.52 EDTShareYou might think the last thing Labour needs now is this deputy leadership contest, the unavoidable fallout from Angela Rayner’s sad plunge from grace. But these two combatants, Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell, may ignite exactly the rethinking Labour needs. Like it or not, whoever the contestants were, this would be framed as establishment v insurgent, or asproxiesfor Keir Starmer and Andy Burnham. It’s for Phillipson and Powell to strike out and show they are their own people. In truth, Phillipson is not very establishment and Powell not very insurgent.Any party would be in a state of ferment after falling further than any previous government in its it first 14 months, with inflation stubbornly high and growth flatlining. It reels from the shock ofscoring 20%in opinion polls while Nigel Farage’s Reform UK rides high on 31%.Large numbers ofLabourMPs on thin majorities are projected to lose their seats at the next general election. But beyond narrow self-interest, they can all see the historically terrifying price of failure this time. The possibility of handing power to a demagogue Trumpite xenophobic authoritarian would make a Labour failure not just a blow against social democracy (again), but an emergency for the country, its European defence and trade alliance, and even its democracy and the rule of law.What needs to emerge from their debate is what is missing from the government so far, a sense of direction, what and whom they are for, where they want to go and why. No red thread pulls together a list of things they have done, unacknowledged for lack of language and sense of purpose. Rail and steelnationalisation,buses back to council controlin England, huge investment ingreen energy, renters’ rights,workers’ rights(undiluted), falling hospitalwaiting lists– none of this is linked into coherent self-definition.Some things, quite expensive and good, slip below the radar: everyone knows about the winter fuel allowance cut, but who knows that an extra 2.7 million people, 6.1 million in all, can get a£150 energy discountthis winter? A mumbling government is unsure if it wants to be cast as leftist or even leftish, despite losing many more voters to Greens and Liberal Democrats than to Farage.As education secretary, Phillipson can boast of the most already done so far. Her determination to stick toearly years as a prioritywas hard fought as the most effective engine of opportunity: others wanted that considerable budget to be spent on more politically visible education for older cohorts. But her near-universal free nurseries from nine months old started this month, plus a Sure Start revival now called Best Start, with300 nurserieswithin primary schools and more to come, planting education – not mere childcare – as the purpose of her early-years spending. Free breakfasts for all primary schoolchildren in England,free school lunchesextended to many more, begin the prevention of hungry children. Despite the hullabaloo, removing VAT exemption from private schools is highly popular and the money goes tostate school teachersin England, further education renewal and now a big push on apprenticeships, on the rise at last.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Is there anything Starmer can do to turn things around? Our panel responds – part oneRead moreBut too little of any of this has landed with the public due to bad errors on benefits, mistakes that sprang from uncertainty about their message, never mind missions that never resonated. This contest is likely to raise the difficult issues. The failure to address child poverty head-on has been the gaping void for Labour people. The 2024 partymanifesto said: “Labour will develop an ambitious strategy to reduce child poverty.” I expect both Powell and Phillipson to come out for abolishing the two-child benefit cap that damages 1.6 million children. If so, Rachel Reeves would be obliged to do it in her budget.Powell will draw many of the disaffected now she has become an involuntary outsider. Wisely, she is unlikely to stray far from the fold of existing policies she voted for: throwing bricks at the government is not a winner with Labour members, only with those who long ago departed. Attempts to draw her on a wealth tax by Nick Robinson on Political Thinking drew a sensible answer that she wasn’t about to write the budget. But both will reject the current Starmerite notion that “delivery” will overcome present misfortunes: it did nothing to save Joe Biden, who delivered a lot. The one who tells the missing story of what Labour is for – and why – in the most lyrical and persuasive language deserves to win.But their greatest duty, above all, is to take the fight to Farage and show Labour how to hit back hard, taking no prisoners. Be unafraid to call out racism: the timid and delayed response to the terrifying march of 100,000 people at Tommy Robinson’s beckoning is indeed a klaxon. No need to worry that some who are seduced into this poison don’t see themselves as far right or racist – history shows us that “ordinary people”, even “ordinary majorities”, can be drawn into the politics of hate by malign demagoguery exploiting immigration as a proxy for all grievance. Both candidates need to show how best to challenge this lethal toxin, which is more pressing than any slight difference between them.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionBridget PhillipsonLucy PowellReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s now time to abandon the failed fantasies and strategies. Time to accept that Britain, or more specifically, England – as the far right is much less prominent in Scotland and Wales – is not an exception to the global trend.Here are some home truths from abroad. After this rally, the centre left should finally put to bed Labour’s illusion that it can compete with the far right on anti-immigration issues. AsI arguedin the Guardian in 2019: “Copying the far right isn’t going to save the left.” If decades of experiences in the rest of western Europe won’t convince Keir Starmer, then hopefullya recent authoritative studyon his own policies will. Adopting nativist discourse and policies does not win back far-right voters. It leads to losses for centrist and leftwing parties. Moreover, it raises the salience of the topic and the expectations of the government, which will always fall short in the eyes of far-right voters, as the “unite the kingdom” rally shows painfully.For the centre right, the rally should end its fantasies that Brexit has prevented the rise of the far right in the UK. Obviously, that didn’t happen. The “unite the kingdom” rally followsa summer of anti-immigrant rallies, while Reform UK has beenpolling firstfor months now, not just replacing the Tories as the party of the right, but also eclipsing Labour. This is not surprising, as Nigel Farage’s various parties were never mere single-issue parties. In fact, Farage had already moved on to the immigration issue before Brexit, whileimmigration was the key issuefor Brexit supporters in the 2016 referendum on European Union membership.Moreover, it is high time for Britons from the left and right to shed their “British exceptionalism” and accept that the UK, and England in particular, is very much part ofthe fourth phaseof the far right in the postwar era. This phase, which started at the beginning of this century, is characterised by the mainstreaming, radicalisation and globalisation of the far right – all of which were on display at the “unite the kingdom” rally.It was already evident, not just in the continuous anti-migrantrhetoricandpoliciesof the Starmer government, but also in the media coverage of the “unite the kingdom” rally. Notably, rightwing media such asthe Spectatorandthe Telegraphexaggerated the number of protesters, while bending over backwards to emphasise that this was a “normal” rally and that the protesters were “no racists”.Several years ago, Tommy Robinson, or more accurately, Stephen Yaxley-Lennon – an extreme-right activist withmultiple criminal convictions– was too toxic for anyone with something to lose in British politics and society to associate with. Today, he is the major challenger to Farage for the voice of the nativist right. That also explains, in part, why Farage continues to keep his distance from him.Finally, the rally clearly illustrated the increasing globalisation of the far right, with speeches from international figures such as French politician Éric Zemmour and South African-US billionaire tech bro Elon Musk. (Steve Bannon from the US was slated to speak, but did not.) Musk is of particular importance here, as he has repeatedly expressedhis preferencefor Robinson over Farage. Musk has been weighing in on far-right politics in various European countries, including Germany, where he madeonline appearancesat meetings of the extreme-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, even claiming that “only AfD can save Germany”.In short, Britain is not exceptional and Brexit did not solve its far-right problem. If there is one thing that British democrats should learn from the activities of the far right, it is to look for lessons and support beyond the UK’s shores.They should heed the mistakes of others. BothLabourand Tories must see that copying the far right does not work. And Labour has to accept that it has not lost most of its voters to Reform but to the Liberal Democrats and Greens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The natural coalition partners of Labour are the centrist and leftwing parties, particularly as long as the Tories continue to try to out-Reform Reform. So Labour should think ahead. Continuing its nativist, authoritarian policies and rhetoric will not only lose the party more voters to those parties, but it will also make coalition formation with them more difficult. In the future, the ability to do that may be crucial.Cas Mudde is the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, and author of The Far Right TodayDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He was right. I was moved through six ministerial briefs in four years. I knew nothing about Africa when I was made the Africa minister. I had only just completed my Africa strategy, and introduced myself to the key African leaders, when I was made the prisons minister nine months later, still knowing very little about Africa and nothing at all about prisons. Little wonder that civil servants were reluctant to throw themselves behind my radical rethinks of my predecessor’s approach – not least because they sensed that I would soon be gone and my strategy with me.Starmer has now donehis own reshuffle, and it is if anything worse than what the Tories did. Cameron left William Hague as foreign secretary for four years. Starmer has taken David Lammy, just as he has built his relationship with world leaders, and replaced him with someone, Yvette Cooper, who has never held a foreign policy brief in government. The ministers who have painfully mastered the complexities of AI or the welfare system have all moved hardly more than a year into their jobs.And the loss of knowledge is not compensated for with fresh talent. Cameron sent seven cabinet ministers in 2014 to the backbenches, replacing them with entirely new faces. Starmer has changed 10 of his secretaries of state. But he has only sent one to the backbenches. The others have simply been moved from one ministerial job to another. He has done the same to 20 of his junior ministers. His holding on to the same team in new posts without sacking the bad and introducing the new suggests a poker player too afraid to raise or fold. And he will just make his problems worse if he tries to tinker yet again.But the fundamental problem he faces is not the individuals. It is the way in which every aspect of our political settlement – parties, whips and electoral systems – creates all the wrong incentives and behaviours.The best hope for better government is not another reshuffle but a constitutional revolution. We should build on the success of the newish mayors in Manchester and Birmingham, giving them far more freedom to tax and spend and forge their own industrial policies. (Here we can learn from both France and Germany.) A New Zealand-style electoral system – balancing proportional representation and constituencies – could break the old parties and encourage coalitions around the centre. An Australian model of compulsory voting would force politics to pay attention to the marginalised and try to persuade the undecided centre, rather than indulge the extremes. And we should make far greater use of citizens’ assemblies – which,as Ireland has shown, can achieve remarkable radical progress that parties often cannot achieve – and which would have a democratic legitimacy that we are losing from our parliaments.Do AI the right way and Labour could reap the rewardsMariana MazzucatoProfessor in the economics of innovation and public value at University College London, where she is founding director of the UCLInstitute for Innovation & Public PurposeThe government has spent much of its first year in office trying to attract private investment into the British economy. This has meant changing planning regulations, “cutting red tape” and, most recently, opening the door wide to AI companies. But the point must not be to accept any kind of investment. We should be prioritising the type of growth Britain needs: innovation-driven, inclusive and sustainable.The global investment summit last autumn, for instance, mostly attracted controversial financial companiessuch as BlackRockand Macquarie; the latter is best known in Britain forloading Thames Water with debtduring its much-criticised ownership of the company. Getting AI investment right in this context is crucial, but there are worrying trends.This week’s US-UK tech prosperity deal is an example of tech investment being structured poorly. US tech firms have pledged to invest £31bn in the UK, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Nvidia and Google, while the governmentrefuses to rule outscrapping the digital services tax. It will lead to the outsourcing of more AI capacity across public institutions and the wider economy to US tech firms. With Labour promising to “mainline AI into the veins” of the country, we must ask: are we building AI capacity for Britain or Silicon Valley?Labour should demand clear conditionsalongside state investments – this is what the Biden administration did with the Chips Act that requiredsemiconductor companies to limit share buy-backs and improve working conditions. In the UK,which remains 28thin the OECD for business investment, and where companies are often overly financialised and prioritise rapid dividendsfor shareholders, we should require that AI companies benefiting from government programmes make real investments in the country that are good for our economy. That kind of confidence was shown during Covid when the taxpayer-funded Oxford University/AstraZeneca collaboration ended up shaping public goals: knowledge-sharing and keeping costs and prices in check.This isn’t about choosing between innovation and regulation. Governing AI for the common good means steering markets, not just opening them up for “business-friendly” contracts. Labour’s upcoming partyconference presents an opportunity to reset this approach. Rather than “cut the red tape” fetishism, Labour needs AI governance that generates British capabilities and public value. TheTUC arguesthat workers must have a role in shaping AI. AsI’ve written recently, Britain should explore public funding models akin to the BBC licence fee – collectively supporting AI systems serving public purposes rather than commercial imperatives.For a government struggling to bring the public with it, promising growth through unfettered AI adoption risks repeating the mistakes that fuelled populist backlash against globalisation. When citizens see deals with tech companies while local jobs fail to materialise at resource-heavy datacentres, the political costs are inevitable. Smart AI governance – with workers’ voices, public ownership stakes and visible benefits for communities – offers a positive radical and Labour vision. By showing the state can actively shape technology for public benefit rather than simply accommodate Silicon Valley’s agenda, Labour can rebuild trust that the government works for ordinary people.Gaza is the stainShaista AzizJournalist and crisis response campaigner working on GazaI resigned as a Labour councillor from Oxford city council in October 2023, days after Keir Starmer, then the leader of the opposition, agreed during a live radio interview that Israel was justified in cutting off water, gas and electricity in Gaza, after Hamas’s deadly attacks. Two years later, his government stands credibly accused of being complicit in genocide. The domestic politics of this are less important than the immense suffering that the people of Gaza have gone through, but it seems clear that this government’s inaction over Palestine has damaged its credibility in the eyes of many voters.If there is to be any way back,the government must fully reset the UK’s relationship with Israel and acknowledge it for the destabilising force in the region it is. After all, Israel is accused of killing more than 60,000 Palestinians in Gaza, with thousands more missing and buried under the rubble. It has reduced Gaza to a wasteland and has launched attacks on Lebanon, Yemen, Iran, Qatar and Tunisia. It is a flagrant violator of international law and should not be considered an ally of the UK in the way it has been up to this point.Starmer could take a leaf from European countries such as Spain, whose prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, recently announced that he would formalise his country’s arms embargo on Israel, ban the use of Spanish ports and airspace to transport fuel or weapons to the Israeli military, and comprehensivelyban imports made in illegal Israeli settlements. This is the absolute bare minimum and should have been done some time ago.Stop being afraid of debateAlan FinlaysonProfessor of political and social theory at the University of East Anglia and expert in political rhetoricGreat political rhetoric doesn’t sell a policy position. It shares with us a vocabulary, a way of thinking and speaking about our situation, so that we can join with the rhetorician in making decisions. Then, we don’t buy what a politician offers; we agree with it because we thought it ourselves.Labour is poor at doing this. The prime minister “umms” through interviews. Ministers focus on policy process rather than making arguments for a future we might all live in, defending their expertise and skills in the language of HR. Welfare reform wasn’t argued for but insisted upon as an inevitability, as if people could be forced into supporting a policy without a clear picture of how they might live in the world it would create.Reform UK has benefitedby taking the critical counter-position: smash the orthodoxy, humiliate the HR managers and give free rein to the few allowed to stay on the island. Greens are developinga lively languageconnecting environmental security with larger arguments about future housing, jobs and security.Your Partywill probably employ a strident anti-war moral vocabulary appealing to those sick of a politics of “pragmatic” positioning.These are parts of a tortured, fractious (and overly dramatic) argument that the country is having with itself, and to which this Labour government has contributed no key term, concept or description.What Labour needs is an ideology: an overarching argument connecting policy areas to an analysis of what’s wrong with British politics, economy and culture, as well as the principles that define its response and a picture of a future we can see ourselves living in well. Ministers arguing for policy, instead of just insisting that they are hard-working and serious, could then show the bigger picture of which they are a part.MPs could seek opportunities to share arguments with key affected sectors: local teachers, chambers of commerce, NHS staff. People won’t all agree but will respect being treated like rational citizens and potential participants in rebuilding society. Of course, this also needs to happen online, since that is the primary arena for ideological contestation today (as a few in Labour arebeginning to understand). Imagine two or three Labour MPs with different takes, arguing things out at length on YouTube (without fear of expulsion). That would model good political behaviour, invite audiences to think for themselves and communicate an image of life beyond desiccated managerialism.Only a minority are deeply attached to Reform’s politics, but they are confident in making arguments for it to friends, family and colleagues. That is why it is winning. Labour’s instinct is to keep members and supporters at a distance rather than supporting them in becoming active representatives of party-thinking online, offline, in work and with friends.As long as Labour prefers the language of force, law and managerial necessity, it will lose – and what’s more, it will deserve to. The rest of us will have to find our own ways to push back against what’s coming.This article was amended on 19 September 2025.

We didn’t have a family football team or spend all summer obsessing about cricket scores. But when I was about eight or nine Dad introduced me to the joys ofPot Black, the BBC snooker competitionthat was televised in Australia on the ABC.At the time I’d never played snooker or seen a pool table. I didn’t understand the rules or know how it felt to send a white ball barrelling along the green felt to nudge another into a pocket.Dad didn’t play and I doubt he knew the rules any more than I did but each week we’d curl up together on the old couch, waiting for that jaunty theme song to start. As the first player broke, we stopped talking.Gods of Snooker: how the sport went from dingy hobby to national treasureRead moreSometimes the games would be so close that I worried I was going to stop breathing. If our favourite player, the Australian Eddie Charlton, was in contention, I’d pace around the room, not looking at the screen until he’d played his shot, just in case he missed.The show stopped being televised in the mid-1980s and it would be 10 years or so before I picked up a cue. I never played snooker like Charlton and the rest of the cast. It was always pool. A pub game on a pub-size table, requiring less skill and less knowledge.From the first time that I pocketed a ball I was hooked. And from that point on through my 20s I could be found most nights draped near a table in inner-city Melbourne pubs, smoking and drinking cheap beer. We would slide our 20 cent coins on to a table and eagerly awaiting our turn.Some nights I’d pair up with a talented friend and we’d manage to hold the table for hours. It’s where I learned that the thrill of competition roared in me and where I discovered I often lacked patience.I did the sums in my head. If I budgeted for the next few weeks, I could buy the painting on the spotOn a good night I could sometimes hold my own but I was never consistent. I rushed too much, approaching pool the same way I did most things: impulsively and without considering all the angles. I had a sort of reckless hope when I played, assuming that because I wanted the balls to go in they would. And sometimes that seemed to work.When it didn’t, I’d quickly forget the failure and approach the game exactly the same way the next time I played. I was a great loser but a dreadful winner. I couldn’t keep the smugness from my face. It just oozed out of me.View image in fullscreenSteven Rendall, Snooker (study), 2024. Courtesy Niagara Galleries and Spring 1883.Photograph: Christo Crocker PhotographyI still play pool when I can, although these days it’s more often in a dingy hall with a friend than in a pub, but I’d forgotten about my childhood love of watching Pot Black until I visited an art exhibition. I was there to see if I could afford one of the artist’s paintings because I’d loved his work for years.Right in the middle of the gallery was a small, square painting, with a bright green background and an arm stretched long with fingers curled around the tip of a pool cue. The cue was pointed at a white ball, suggesting the player was readying to take a shot. I stared at the painting for much longer than I would normally.Giddy with excitement, I explained to the gallery owner that it reminded me of Pot Black, a show I’d loved as a child. She smiled and told me the painting was calledSnookerand that the artist had grown up watching Pot Black too.I did the sums in my head. If I budgeted for the next few weeks, I could buy the painting on the spot. And I did.I rushed home and started my hunt for old episodes of the show. I thought I’d find it dull but I didn’t. It was all as I remembered. The live audience applauding fine play. The commentator speaking in hushed and serious tones. And the players themselves in their bow ties and vests, suit pants and slicked-back hair. Each with their own style of humour, playing and concentration.What I didn’t know as a child was that the BBC had started broadcasting in colour in 1967 and that its controller, David Attenborough, had been on the hunt for shows that would exploit the technology. What better way to show off this new vibrancy than to televise a game that saw coloured balls pinging around a bright green table?At the time snooker wasn’t a popular sport. It was mostly played in divey billiard halls or in the homes of the wealthy. But after Pot Black aired in 1969 its popularity was altered forever, with millions of people tuning in each week to watch their favourite player compete.The painting now hangs on the wall opposite my kitchen. As I cook each night I look across the room at the small green square and the shirt sleeve of the player, as he prepares to hit the white, and I’m back in the 1970s with my dad on our old couch, silenced into anticipation.Nova Weetman is an award-winning children’s authorExplore more on these topicsSnookerOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

But is a $90m subterranean labyrinth, created by Herzog & de Meuron, really the answer?Oliver WainwrightFri 19 Sep 2025 09.36 EDTLast modified on Fri 19 Sep 2025 12.33 EDTShareAshimmering metallic wall slices through a scrubby mound on the edge of a highway inPhiladelphia, like a long steel blade cutting into the earth. Halfway along its length, this silvery barrier flips up, recalling the lid of a giant laptop, forming an entrance canopy that beckons you inside. As you ascend the planted knoll, you find great furrows gouged into the ground, jagged concrete sinkholes from which the peaks of colourful sculptures protrude.Welcome toCalder Gardens, an otherworldly place conceived by Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron to celebrate the work of Philadelphia-born Alexander Calder, master of mobiles. It is one of the strangest cultural complexes to be built anywhere in recent years. On an unpromising site no larger than a football pitch, wedged between two highways, a beguiling sequence of spaces take visitors on a journey of discovery deep into the ground. It is part barn, part cave and part rolling meadow, compressing a whole universe of different gallery types into one compact encounter.It seems very much tuned to our age of spectacle – the camp stagey quality can verge on Disneyish“I have never worked on anything like this before,” says 75-year-old Jacques Herzog, who hascreated numerous museums and galleries around the world, often reinventing the type each time. “There was literally no brief. I felt like an artist, waking up every morning without someone telling me what to do. Architecture is never this free.”There might not have been a defined brief, but the client certainly had strong opinions about what theydidn’twant. “I had no intention of making a museum,” says Sandy Rower, Calder’s grandson and president ofthe Calder Foundation, who steered the $90m project. “We wanted people to be able to sit in resonance with the work and have their own mysterious, unmediated experience. My grandfather wasn’t trying to predetermine the viewer’s reaction, so we don’t want to tell people what to think or feel.”View image in fullscreenInside and out … two works at Calder Gardens.Photograph: Oliver Wainwright/The GuardianThe project has been a long time coming. Born in 1898, Calder was the third generation in a lineage of esteemed Philadelphia artists. His grandfather sculptedthe statue of William Penn that crowns City Hall, while his father createda striking fountain of reclining river gods, marooned on a roundabout nearby. But the younger and most famous Calder left the city aged eight and – bar a big mobile in the main art museum – has never had much of a presence here, until now.His grandson describes the project as something of a spiritual quest. Rower has referred to the complex as a hypogeum, meaning an underground temple or tomb, calling it “a sacred space for self-cultivation” – and there is a ritualistic air to the place. Visitors are taken on a theatrical journey of compression and release, ushered through dark passages, then thrust into unexpectedly airy galleries, invited to peer around corners, perch in cubbies, and explore sunken gardens to discover the work on their own terms, with not a wall text in sight. The idea is not to ask when and how these sculptures were made, or what they might mean, but to submit yourself to a pure aesthetic encounter, communing with Calder’s moving creatures in this curious submerged menagerie. So does it work?View image in fullscreenIn the depths … a black mobile and a red stabile.Photograph: Iwan Baan/Herzog & de Meuron undefinedThe arrival sequence is worlds away from the nearby neoclassical cultural piles that linePhiladelphia’s Parkway Museum District– a misnomer for an inhospitable ribbon of highways, sliced through this part of the city in the 1960s. Once you have crossed 10 lanes of traffic, you arrive at a hilly garden (sadly ringed by an ugly chainlink fence) and ascend one of several winding paths, through what will one day grow into a lush display of perennials, laid out by Dutch celebrity plantsmanPiet Oudolf, finally reaching a circular plaza at the summit.Entering beneath the building’s sharp steel flap, you find yourself in a warm timber-lined lobby, with the feel of a domestically sized Apple Store. A bleacher staircase leads down to the first glimpse of a sunken gallery, where the contorted spidery limbs of one of Calder’s “stabiles” (what he called his static sculptures) stretch out in taut arcs. A mobile dangles above, hanging like a splatter of black paint, frozen in mid-air. The rumbling interstate highway can be briefly glimpsed through a long horizontal window, providing a reminder of the outside world that will soon be forgotten as you descend deeper into the Earth.Things start to get stranger at a second staircase, which winds down through what feels like a lava tube, lined with bubbling black sprayed concrete with the look of rugged basalt. A circular rupture gnawed through the wall provides a window on to another Calder mobile, hanging spotlit in the stygian gloom like a ghostly white tangle of coathangers. The dark stairs lead to a light-flooded central gallery, roofed by a polished plaster ceiling, which droops in a shallow bulge overhead, like the underside of a puddle. It adds a surreal, unsettling air, as if the weight of the ground above might burst through at any moment. One of Calder’s red steel animals writhes in the middle in twisted gymnastic curves, while more mobiles hang nearby, like flocks of angular birds.Windows on either side provide views of further contraptions. In one direction, a balancing black-and-red object stands imprisoned in a cylindrical concrete well. It is ringed by a dimly lit curved corridor gallery, where paintings and drawings hang on the raw foundation walls. A side niche presents another mobile against a seamless white backdrop, with the depthless quality of a photographic studio. Another purple-painted niche houses a sort of family altar, with works by Calder’s parents and grandfather. On the other side of the gallery, a door leads to the “vestigial garden”, where a memory of the site’s historic street pattern is summoned in the form of angular concrete forms jutting out into the courtyard, their surfaces scraped with a rough, rocky finish, as if freshly clawed from the earth. (Flood risk put paid to the possibility of using rammed earth; instead, concrete is used throughout to simulate stone and soil.)View image in fullscreenPerfectly framed … a ghostly mobile.Photograph: Iwan Baan/Herzog & de Meuron undefined“Calder’s work was about negative space,” says Herzog, “so our process was one of excavating and carving, rather than creating positive form. We see the project as an organism with different members, each with its distinct character, triggering unlikely situations. Otherwise things are too predictable.”There is a palpable restlessness on show throughout the complex. At times it can feel like too many ideas crammed into too small a space, a virtuosic display of Herzog & de Meuron’s greatest hits, populated by incidental Calders. It feels very much tuned to our impatient age of spectacle, and the camp, stagey quality can sometimes verge on Disneyish. You half expect to turn a corner and find an animatronic Calder bursting into a rendition ofIt’s a Small World, or his bones dramatically lit in a carved-out ossuary.‘A gilded temple to the new world order’: inside the former US embassy that is now a super-luxe hotelRead moreA bit more of the artist’s presence would help. The decision to omit captions entirely can be frustrating. Rower says he doesn’t want visitors to be staring at their phones, but without any kind of explanation of the work, you might resort to Google. “We are working on other forms of interpretation,” says Juana Berrío, director of programming. “Sometimes it will be music, or a sound bath beneath one of the sculptures, or collective singing. It’s about celebration, experimentation and real-time experience.” The loaned works will be on constant rotation, she adds, so each visit will offer something new.I left feeling entertained, but none the wiser about Calder. Perhaps that is what he would have wanted. “Theories may be all very well for the artist himself,” he once said, “but they shouldn’t be broadcast to other people.”There is a childlike wonder to Calder’s work, as there is to the building that Herzog & de Meuron has created to display it – even down to the loos, which wallow in a rich blue resinous soup. Kids will love exploring this labyrinthine place, just as they have stared in wonder at Calder’s mobiles for generations.

We need to get out of here.” As we speed out of a north Belfast estate, he checks the rearview mirror. The pedestrian who spooked him is snapping our departing car with his phone. Once we’re safely out of view, our driver breathes a sigh of relief. “That was a close call. I didn’t mean to scare you but that was a bad boy. And he was definitely taking an interest in us.”As part of our exclusive visit to the set ofBlue Lights– which is about to roar back on to BBC One, sirens blazing and bulbs flashing – the show’s creators and police adviser have invited us on a ride-along around some of the locations that inspired the Bafta-winning drama. It’s the first time they’ve taken a journalist on such a trip and nobody’s treating it lightly.The adviser – a retired detective I’ve been instructed to call “Roy” (not his real name, since there remain security risks for ex-police in Belfast) – told us not to use a Vauxhall or Skoda, which would be twigged as unmarked cop cars. “No matter how covert you think you’re being, they’ll rumble you,” he says. Instead, we’re in a hired SUV for a guided tour of the city’s crime hotspots, trying not to attract unwanted attention.View image in fullscreenThe long arms of the law … Frank Blake as Shane Bradley in series three of Blue LightsPhotograph: BBC/Two Cities Television“These areas traditionally policed themselves because there’s such a stranglehold from organised crime,” says Roy, as we move from a staunch enclave of loyalism – those who wish to remain part of the UK –to one whose residents are republican–supporters of a united Ireland. “I remember a kid on this road stole a neighbour’s car and was going to be kneecapped as punishment. He deliberately assaulted my colleague to get arrested before they came to shoot him. People here lived and died by a sense of community. There was a code of ‘we don’t talk to police’. That’s changed over the last decade or two but there’s still hostility.” Graffiti reading “All cops are bastards”, “Touts out” and “Police fuck off” illustrate his point.It makes law enforcement fraught with risk. “If we came here to arrest a drug dealer, we could be surrounded,” says Roy. “They’d cut off the road. You might have to fight your way out hand-to-hand. If it was somebody of a higher profile in organised crime or [unofficial armed force] the paramilitary, you’d bring four armoured Land Rovers, lots of backup and, in the past, maybe military support.” “Police say they don’t have no-go areas,” addsBlue Lightsco-creator Adam Patterson. “But even now, there are neighbourhoods you wouldn’t enter without significant numbers and force. That’s on both sides of the community.”A total of 302 police were killed during the Troubles.The near-fatal shooting of DCI John Caldwellin 2023, mere weeks before Blue Lights first aired, was a grim reminder that they remain a target. “That gave us pause for thought,” says Patterson. “It was difficult but we talked to police and decided to move ahead. Writing a contemporary show, it’s an occupational hazard to depict things uncomfortably close to real life.”Retired officers are offered a sidearm for personal protection. Roy still checks under his car each morning for bombs. He says: “There are three religions in Northern Ireland: Catholic, Protestant and police. The only thing that unites the first two is their hatred of the third. This is a uniquely dangerous place to be a frontline cop.”View image in fullscreenNeighbourhood watch … Andi Osho as Sandra Cliff in series three of Blue Lights.Photograph: BBC/Two Cities TelevisionTwenty-seven years since the Good Friday agreement, Northern Ireland remains divided along sectarian lines. “You see tribalism everywhere,” says Patterson, pointing out a flag for loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Volunteer Force on a lamppost. “You’re under no illusion about which side of the political fence you’re on.” Wealth divisions are equally stark. As Roy puts it: “You can throw a stone from a council flat and hit a Porsche.” Received wisdom says Belfast is a hard place to police but a harder place to live.It’s against this knotty backdrop that Patterson and his writing partner Declan Lawn set their pulse-pounding drama. The pair met while working as investigative journalists on Panorama and take a documentarians’ approach to storytelling. They interviewed 30 Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officers to inform Blue Lights’ characters and flesh out their fictional world.“We spoke to a lot of cops again for series three, distilling their experiences into the plots,” says Lawn. “Police carry so much pain. The job separates them from their communities and families. It was an emotional process. Officers sat in front of me crying about things they’d been through and what they’d sacrificed.”As part of that commitment to realism, Roy consults on procedural authenticity and ran a boot camp for the cast. “Whenever we’re on location, police stop for selfies with the cast,” says Lawn. “They say that, despite the dramatic licence, the show captures the feeling of a shift in Belfast.”Blue Lights began by following rookie response officers in republican west Belfast. The second series moved across to the loyalist east side. As we return for series three, they’re two years into the job, on the verge of passing their probation and becoming “actual peelers”. Venturing into a different part of the city’s criminal ecosystem, behind the high gates and leafy hedges of south Belfast, they slowly realise how little they still know.“We portray the professional apparatus around organised crime,” says Lawn. “The lawyers and accountants who facilitate it.” “We also look at how the appetite for cocaine, especially in affluent areas, filters down to the job of response cops,” says Patterson. “It causes domestic violence, driving offences, suicides, overdoses – which cops call a ‘coke stroke’. We follow the money to see what fuels the city’s drug trade.” South Belfast is an area close to home for both showrunners. “It’s literally where we live,” laughs Patterson. “If you can’t write that, you’re in trouble.” Lawn adds wryly: “After it airs, we’ll probably have to move.”Series two drew criticism for its workplace romances. “That actually came from our research,” says Lawn. “There’s a surprising amount of in-station romance because cops here can’t go on dating apps for security reasons. The only people it’s safe to consort with are colleagues. Riding around in a car together puts intimacy on fast-forward. This season, all those relationships are put under strain.”Scripts full of gallows humour and police lingo are also rooted in reality. “‘Notebook wanker’ [an officer who does everything by the book] and ‘sneaky beakies’ [MI5 agents] were directly lifted from real cops,” admits Lawn. “So was Gerry Cliff’s catchphrase ‘Take a beat’.”Ah, the much-missed Gerry. The veteran officer, played with craggy charisma by Richard Dormer, was a cult hero until fatally gunned down on duty. “One cop told me about arresting a guy on the street,” laughs Lawn. “The car journey to the custody suite was silent until he leaned forward in his cuffs and said: ‘Guys, I’m really sorry about what happened to Gerry.’ As if they were recently bereaved! They were like: ‘Thanks, mate, we appreciate your concern.’”View image in fullscreenGoing underground … Charlie Maher as Fogerty in series three of Blue Lights.Photograph: BBC/Two Cities TelevisionDo they regret killing him off? “Not at all,” says Lawn. “It was very deliberate. We wanted to explore the legacy of death which most police dramas tend not to do. Somebody dies and two episodes later, they’re never referred to again. That’s not real life. It’s pretty radical for Gerry to be gone but not forgotten. He’s still present – in his wife Sandra’s grief, in the memorial plaque on the station wall. A new character, played by Michael Smiley, knew Gerry back in the day at Special Branch, so we learn about different sides of him.” A fourth series is already commissioned and being written. “As the show goes on, we answer questions about why Gerry died,” says Patterson. “Trust us, by the end, it’ll all make sense.”We pull up at Netherleigh House, the ex-government building that doubles as Blackthorn police station, to watch filming in progress. Once you’re inside its bustling corridors and locker rooms, full of patrol boots and rolls of barrier tape, it’s uncannily convincing. I pause to pay my respects at Gerry’s plaque. “Everyone does that when they first come here,” says Lawn.I grab a chat with actors Siân Brooke and Martin McCann, who play constables Grace Ellis and Stevie Neill. The will-they-won’t-they colleagueswere last seendriving off into the sunset in a taxi. “A year on, they’re now a couple,” says Brooke. “They’re living together, even looking at houses to buy.”Tensions arise when Stevie is offered a temporary promotion to sergeant. “He’s a pragmatist,” says McCann. “The bucket man who shovels shit. Stevie gets the job done, finishes his shift, then goes home.” “Whereas Grace is an ex-social worker who wants to make a difference,” adds Brooke. “That causes friction. But, oh my God, if I had a penny for every time somebody comes up and asks if they’ll end up together. There’s genuine affection for them. People are invested.”Three series in, the duo have grown accustomed to their uniforms. “Sometimes sitting in the patrol car, the stab vests ride up around our heads,” says McCann, “and we look like Ninja Turtles. Two neckless wonders.” Brooke admits the role leaks into her own life: “I’ll be in my car, spot things on the street and say: ‘What’s going on over there?’ My husband has to remind me: ‘Siân, you’re not a police officer.’”View image in fullscreenKindergarten cops? … Dearbháile McKinney as Aisling Byrne and Katherine Devlin as Annie Conlon in series three of Blue Lights.Photograph: BBC/Two Cities TelevisionGo through a door and we’re in a luxurious new location: a swanky members’ club, presided over by Cathy Tyson – along with Smiley, this year’s other major cast addition. “The club is basically a front for criminal enterprise,” says Lawn. “It’s our way into issues like child exploitation, drug dealing on encrypted messaging apps and white-collar clients.” I also watch a funeral scene (no spoilers as to whose funeral). So sombre is the atmosphere and so powerful the performances, it’s still moving by the sixth take.Roy believes the show fulfils an important function by humanising the police: “Police used to be represented on TV by a silhouette of a flak jacket and a rifle. Just another part of state oppression. Blue Lights gives us a voice. We see the person behind the uniform.”It also portrays a Belfast where attitudes are slowly changing. “There’s a long way to go but we’re optimistic,” says Patterson. “It’s a show about trying to move forward, not be pulled backwards by history. All communities are proud of the show. I think that’s because it is uncompromising and written in our vernacular. Declan and I aren’t just journalists. We’re Belfast citizens who love this chaotic place for all its flaws.”It’s not just our fictional heroes who get flung into life-or-death situations. “We were filming on location early in the series,” says Lawn. “A crowd gathered to watch, as they often do, when one guy collapsed with a heart attack. There was this weird expectation that our actors would spring into action. Two extras dressed in uniform were like: ‘We’re not actually cops.’ But they ended up giving CPR until paramedics arrived. We checked the next day and the man was OK. Even fake cops can be useful now and again.”“Sharp eyes save lives” is an oft-quoted mantra in the show. It seems that Blue Lights saves lives too.Blue Lights returns to BBC One on 29 September at 9pmand on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionBlue LightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was to be mere syllables to sing notes to, immune to “vulgarisation” as he put it – a way to tell a tragedy without too much pesky drama getting in the way.In choreographer Wayne McGregor’s production of Oedipus Rex, paired with a new ballet based on the myth of Antigone and premiered by the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet, there is drama, but it is of the stark, unsentimental kind. The double bill is entitled Jocasta’s Line, as Jocasta, queen of Thebes, sees her husband/son (spoiler, they’re the same person!) and daughter meet tragic ends. It is visually striking and exciting in scale – the first half austere, the second softer – and pristinely danced, but still with a sense of distance, as of the gods from mere mortals.Stravinsky’s original instructions were for the singers to be masked, unmoving, in restrictive costumes. In this production, designed by Vicki Mortimer, they are trapped in Bauhaus-esque towers, as if Oedipus is in a pulpit, or Creon, his brother-in-law, in the dock. The small group of dancers, often in stillness, provide another kind of architecture. The male chorus lines up like a battalion. The ever-glorious Sarah Connolly as Jocasta is utterly imperious. The singers are eyes forward, unblinking – as Oedipus, Paul Appleby’s voice is on full beam – and unresponsive to others’ plights. It’s a startling mode of delivery for the layers of confusion, anger and distress that tussle within the story of a man discovering he murdered his own father.View image in fullscreenLining up like a battalion … Jocasta’s Line.Photograph: Erik BergA projection of actorBen Whishaw, just his lips, gives a precis of the story. The rest of the text is deliberately not translated, no surtitles here. McGregor does not want you to read your way through the performance, he says when we speak the morning after the show. “I want you to shift your attention from a cognitive headset to kind of a sensual headset, where you give attention to music in a different way.”There’s an ominous nature to Stravinsky’s music, but there’s also jarring contrast between Oedipus’s heavy fate and the jaunty, eccentric countermelodies in the score, bassoon and oboe playfully chasing each other like an illustration of the gods playing games with these throwaway humans’ lives.Stravinsky was interested in form as meaning, and McGregor’s work is not dissimilar. With 30 years of intensive movement research behind him, the choreographer is famously resistant to literal, narrative interpretation. In fact, he’s exasperated by people (especially critics) who want to know exactly what is going on. “Especially in ballet,” he says, “there’s a push all the time for concrete narrative. And it’s something I’m really sad about.”View image in fullscreen‘In ballet, there’s a push for concrete narrative’ … Wayne McGregor.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianDance offers “a more fluid relationship to meaning”, through concreteness and out the other side, which McGregor sees as more akin to how we experience our lives. “We don’t know from moment to moment exactly what we’re thinking,” he says, so to try to do that on stage would be “completely reductive”.Stravinsky’s way with distinctive orchestral textures is something picked up by Canadian composer-conductor Samy Moussa, who has scored the second half of the programme, along with a pared-down libretto (in ancient Greek, again no surtitles) for a female chorus, whose dense but fragile chords shimmer at the peak of the work’s crescendos. There are no named characters in the second act (McGregor’s acts are called Son and Daughter, not Oedipus and Antigone), and there’s no differentiation in their costumes: vests daubed with black, a symbol of Oedipus’s blood, the family carrying his stain. Nevertheless, the daughter is Antigone. Her brothers have killed each other in an ugly fight for power (portrayed here as an artful struggle), one led by flash of white light to the afterlife, the other left to rot, by Creon’s decree. Antigone is determined to honour his body and perform funeral rites, even if it means her own death.Her reined-in dance is a study in precision of line, beautifully measured angles as if by protractor. There’s little sense of character, but what you do see embedded is certainty. In Sophocles’s play, Antigone is unsentimental about her actions – she is driven by a sense of duty. Through that prism, this appears not a dance of grief, but a dance of purpose. When asked, McGregor is only frustrated by questions about what he himself was interested in exploring. “None of that matters, none of that matters. What matters is how you receive something.”View image in fullscreenEver-glorious … Sarah Connolly as Jocasta, right, and Magnus Staveland.Photograph: Erik Berg“It really bores me, this transactional conversation,” he says, meaning the choreographer explaining their intention; the audience expecting something explicit to be communicated. “I think we need to be much braver about trusting our instincts about what we’re receiving, by opening up ourselves, our own lenses.”‘Don’t worry, just watch’: how do you tell a story through dance?Read moreMore important than knowing, surely, is feeling. McGregor may be allergic to button-pushing, but Daughter has two especially strong scenes that tap into tragedy. Antigone’s brother’s body prone on the floor, met by a solemn string phrase, the stage suddenly bereft. And a pas de deux between Creon and his wife (Eurydice) at the work’s denouement. Antigone and her fiance have died and Eurydice, the fiance’s mother, finds them. She dances in a kind of nauseous disbelief, her body folding and pulling and keening, while Creon is unfolding and pulling back and trying to save her from herself. It’s one of the few moments where there’s a real sense of something at stake. To me, at least. The subjective push-pull between form and content, intellect and emotion, meaning and meaningfulness, artist and audience is just as alive almost a century after Stravinsky wrote his Oedipus Rex.Jocasta’s Line is atOslo Opera Houseuntil 4 October.

An artist with 30 gold or platinum singles to his name, he nevertheless quickly shifted the release date of a new album he has been promoting for six months, when it became apparent that it would clash with the arrival of Am I the Drama?View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Am I the Drama?It was a gesture that seems somehow antithetical to the very nature of hip-hop – a genre that’s had gloves-off rivalry in its DNA ever since the night, getting on for 50 years ago, when Busy Bee made the fatal mistake of challenging Kool Moe Dee to an onstage battle and inadvertently ushered ina new rap erain the process. But equally, you can understand Young Thug’s logic. Dressed up as let-me-hold-the-door-for-you chivalry – “It’s a ladies day,” he tweeted – it smacks a little of fear. Perhaps he remembers 50 Cent loudly announcing he would retire if his 2007 album Curtis didn’t outsell Kanye West’s Graduation, then dramatically changing his tune when it signally failed to do so. Why take the risk of being bested?And it seems a little ironic when you actually hear Am I the Drama? From the first moments of opener Dead, the listener is made abundantly aware that Cardi B is not a rapper who needs her memory jogged about the gloves-of frivalry inherent in hip-hop’s DNA. “Never smart to beef with me – what can I say? / These hoes be dumb, bitches die young,” she offers within seconds of arriving on the mic. Seconds later, she is letting longstanding rival Nicki Minaj have it in no uncertain terms. It possibly takes a degree of magical thinking to depict Minaj’s 2024 tour as a failure, given that it grossed $108.8m – and involves invokinga hotly denied 2022 rumourthat Minaj owed $173m to the taxman – but such is the hugely entertaining ferocity of Cardi B’s flow that she gets away with it.Indeed, such is the ferocity of Cardi B’s flow when dispatching perceived slights and minor nuisances on Dead – to the critics who felt her 2019 best rap album Grammy should have gone to Meek Mill, online commenters she accuses of sticking their nose in “my coochie and my business” – that you find yourself wondering if she’ll run out of bile before she even gets to her ex-husband, Migos rapper Offset, from whom she filed for divorce in 2024 amid allegations of infidelity. But no: pausing en route to variously tear strips off Ice Spice (“snow-faced bitch”), former City Girls rapper JT (“tail-wagging bottom-feeder-ass bitch”) former City Girls rapper JT’s boyfriend Lil’ Uzi Vert (bald accusation of sexual peccadillo that modesty forbids relating), BIA (“if I did your numbers I would hop out a plane”), and indeed to have another pop at Minaj, she arrives at Man of Your Word, addressing her estranged husband in a manner that might pass for equivocal were it not so fabulously passive-aggressive: fault on both sides, but considerably more on yours than mine.Cardi B: Safe ft Kehlani – videoThis merely proves an amuse-bouche beforeWhat’s Goin’ On. It involves Lizzo singing the hook of the old4 Non Blondes hit What’s Up?– which turns out to be substantially less irritating when allied to a series of bitter allegations about Cardi B’s marriage, from underwhelming anniversary presents to unsatisfactory oral sex, than to the non-specific grunge-lite angst of the original. Throughout it all, Cardi B offers sharp, impressively witty lyrics delivered with brutal vigour: she never sounds like someone going through the motions, or doing what’s expected of her.Something roughly similar is true of the music on Am I the Drama? An artist who spends six years making an album runs the risk of seeming like an artist mired in uncertainty about what direction to take, but the eclecticism here feels purposeful rather than confused. There’s a lot of distance between the bright pop of What’s Going On and the Selena Gomez feature Pick It Up; or between Bodega Baddie’s astonishing warp-speed salsa and the unsettling piano-led minimalism of Check Please.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

It’s a questionable choice, particularly given a couple of duds. The Janet Jackson feature Principle feels like it’s there largely so Cardi B can brag she’s got Janet Jackson on her album – her actual contribution is understated and nothing special – while even the rapper herself sounds like she’s flagging a bit on Nice Guy, a slow jam about her current partner, NFL player Stefon Diggs: she’s more entertaining in battle than bedroom mode. She has staunchly defended the presence of two old singles, 2020’s WAP (with Megan Thee Stallion) and 2021’s Up, and in purely qualitative terms, she’s right – but there’s no getting around the fact they feel tacked on as an overly familiar afterthought and streaming grab.Still, at least streaming means you can fillet out the bits you don’t like or don’t need to hear again. You’ll still be left with an album’s worth of imperiously raw and powerful material. One suspects on hearing Am I the Drama?, Young Thug will heave a sigh of relief at his decision: it’s not an album that a rival would want to go up against. And besides, it serves ample notice that getting on the wrong side of Cardi B is a course of action best avoided.Explore more on these topicsMusicCardi BRapHip-hopreviewsShareReuse this content"

With the indelible musical receiving an anniversary rerelease in cinemas this weekend – in a gleaming new 4K restoration to boot – five of the seven are preparing for another reunion to mark the occasion.Two are no longer with us. Charmian Carr, who played eldest daughter Liesl, and Heather Menzies, who played Louisa, died in 2016 and 2017. But the other Von Trapp actors, as Hammond says, have otherwise largely been spared any great misfortune. “None of the actors who played the children have really had terrible incidents in their lives of tragedy, chaos, addictions or problems that you hear about so often with child actors. Yes, we’re all identified forever as those characters. But it hasn’t sent anybody’s life off the rails.”None of the seven became major movie stars off the back of starring in what was, at one point, the biggest box office hit of all time; some went on to steady acting careers, while others eventually picked another vocation entirely. (Duane Chase, who played Kurt, studied geology and became a forester; Debbie Turner, who played Marta, is a floral designer, though she makes and sells Sound of Music-themed scarves on her personal website.)You might expect the combination of vulnerable youth and blockbuster exposure to have monkey’s-paw consequences in at least one of their cases. But various where-are-they-now interviews with the actors over the years have been consistent in their general positivity: it was a great experience, they’re part of a great legacy, and they’re all still great friends.“It’s like watching home movies,” says Angela Cartwright, who played middle daughter Brigitta, of watching the film today. “It’s like the way our kids watch videos of themselves. It brings back wonderful memories. I remember, I instantly clicked with Heather Menzies, so I was in Salzburg with a really, really good friend who also loved the Beatles and it was just fantastic. But everybody on it was great. When we see each other again, it’s like we’ve never been apart. We’re just like a family.”“We see each other at Sound of Music reunions, of course,” says Hammond, “but sometimes we just get together and have a meal, and that’s always really fun, too. I love them all. I mean, unashamedly, I love them. I don’t have a sister, and those girls are my sisters. We’ve been through a lot with each other, you know: good times, birthdays, weddings, bad times, divorces, funerals, illness, and we’ve always been there for each other, and we always will be. I know no matter what happens to me, at three o’clock in the morning, I could call any of them, and they would pick up, and be there for me if I needed them.”Their tales of making the film are uniformly sunny, and steeped in fondness for the film’s leading ladyJulie Andrews, then a new mother, who was happy to bond with her on-screen charges when the cameras were off. Hammond, who toured the southern hemisphere with Andrews in a two-person stage show, regards her to this day as a close colleague and personal friend – someone with whom “you can talk about this and that, and make sure you don’t have spinach between your teeth just before you walk on stage.”View image in fullscreen‘It was a huge event’ … Julie Andrews, Heather Menzies, Angela Cartwright, Kym Karath, Nicholas Hammond, Debbie Turner and Charmian Carr at the Hollywood premiere of The Sound of Music.Photograph: Bruce Bailey/Getty ImagesCartwright, meanwhile, treasures her memories of attending on-set classes with all her on-screen siblings (save the then-adult Carr), which bonded them across a wide age spectrum. “We all went to school together. Kym [Karath], who played Gretl, was only five, so she wasn’t required to get her school hours. But she wanted to go with us anyway.”Collectively, they had little sense that they were in the process of making a cultural phenomenon. “You hope every movie will be a success, but there were a lot of factors that were telling people it might not be,” says Hammond. “It was already the mid-60s, and we were moving into an era of darker, grittier, more realistic stories.Musicalsabout singing nuns and singing children – people weren’t at all sure this was something the public was going to buy.”Only at the film’s premiere did it dawn on the young stars that they were part of something very big indeed. Cartwright’s memories of the night are rapt: “It was a huge event at this theatre where the big velvet curtains parted and the music whisked you away to this land of mountains. And then, of course, Julie twirling. I remember just going: ‘Oh my gosh, this isamazing.’”Of the seven, Hammond and Cartwright are the two who have enjoyed the most sustained showbiz careers. Each was an established child actor prior to making The Sound of Music; indeed, Cartwright had already worked with the film’s director, Robert Wise, on the Paul Newman boxing drama Somebody Up There Likes Me at just four years old, though she recalls he didn’t remember her nine years later. And each found cult TV success in the years after the film, Hammond as a 1970s Peter Parker in The Amazing Spider-Man, and Cartwright on the sci-fi series Lost in Space.Hammond was last seen on cinema screens in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood; Cartwright has retired from acting but cheerfully plugs her website, Angela Cartwright Studio, and a podcast she recently launched with her sister, Alien star Veronica Cartwright. But neither has had a role to eclipse The Sound of Music on their CV, and both are perfectly happy with that.“There was nowhere I could go in the world where people didn’t come up and always want to talk about it,” says Hammond. “People would have a story to tell of what the movie meant for them, what it meant for their grandmother, what it meant for their child. And the enormous impact that the film had on everybody meant that I felt it was a great responsibility to listen to those stories, and to always behave in a manner that didn’t let down the film. And, in a way, that didn’t let down people’s opinion of the characters in the film.”The Sound of Music at 60: a flawed but enduring cultural touchpointRead more“It is moving,” Cartwright says of the enduring fandom that follows the film, and her. “I try to go to the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles every year for the singalong screening. And when you stand up there in front of all those people that have come together to watch one movie, and we sing Edelweiss, and everybody sways back and forth with their phones, and you see all those lights – it’s tremendously moving and very, very special. Magical. You can’t jar something like that. It’s just a feeling. And I’m grateful that I’m able to let that sweep over me and appreciate it.”“To this day, if a flight attendant looks at my boarding pass and sees my name, they will want to tell me what the movie meant to them,” says Hammond. “That still happens all the time. That’s just part of who we are now, you know? We can’t do anything about that.”The Sound of Music is in cinemas from 20 September.Explore more on these topicsThe Sound of MusicJulie AndrewsMusicalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He talks odd jobs, busting stereotypes and holding his own opposite Gary OldmanFri 19 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 19 Sep 2025 08.16 EDTShareChristopher Chung is no longer surprised when members of the public walk up and insult him to his face. “It happened yesterday,” he says. “A guy came up to me and said: ‘Are you fromSlow Horses? You’re awful.’” Or sometimes, it’s “You’re a dickhead”.“But,” the 37-year-old adds, the insults are usually “said with love and affection”. And “I want, as an actor, to have some effect, so it’s really …” he hesitates, as if searching for the right word, “really nice,” he beams. Then he bursts into laughter.Whatever fans of the hit spy drama Slow Horses may think of his character, for Chung, playing the talented but abrasive hacker Roddy Ho is a dream role. “The best thing is not having to worry about the other characters’ feelings. You can be as arrogant and obnoxious as you like.” He perceives Roddy as “slightly on the spectrum” and “misunderstood”; never “vindictive” or “nasty”, just “egocentric” and lacking a censor. “Sometimes, the things that he vocalises are similar to my internal voice. So it’s a really fun character to play: I get to just say what I think.”View image in fullscreenSpies like us … Ruth Bradley and Christopher Chung in the new series of Slow Horses.Photograph: Jack English/Apple TV+We meet in London’s Soho, not far from Slough House, the rundown east London office for disgraced MI5 spies where Roddy spends most of his time behind a computer. But in the show’s new season, a series of bizarre events unfold in the city and the hacker takes a more central role. He attracts a glamorous girlfriend and – during a thrilling episode in which he wields a sword – is shown topless and declared to be “ripped” by a colleague.Sitting opposite Chung, I remark on how unusual it is for a geeky character to be presented as physically attractive: in the novels, the hacker’s defining physical characteristic is his thick black glasses.“He’s just me,” Chung drawls in a Roddy-ish way that makes us laugh.It becomes clear, however, that I’ve touched a nerve. He tells me that, after arriving in the UK at 24 in 2012, he had to navigate a lot of “unconscious bias” as an actor with east Asian heritage: “It’s one step forward, two steps back, consistently.” He was often auditioning for roles he didn’t want to play, “stereotypes like the takeaway worker or the Asian nurse – peripheral characters that don’t have any autonomy” – and other opportunities were thin on the ground.I always thought my career ambitions would be capped at being the best friend to the lead. I never thought I’d get to take that myselfTo have the freedom to be more choosy with his acting roles, he started working as a personal trainer: “If I didn’t have that, then my career might be in a very different place.” He continues the work today: “I had a client this morning. I love it because it gives me an external focus, an hour that’s about the client, not me. That’s really healthy.”But when the part as Roddy arrived, Chung “was really concerned about my physicality, because I was quite big at the time”. So at his audition, he tried to “cover up” by wearing a hoodie. Then, after he got the part, he discovered his costume was too small and “started to spiral, worrying they were going to want me to be this geeky Asian kid”. He began to wonder how quickly he could lose muscle. His first rehearsal swiftly put paid to that idea. “They were like: ‘No, no, no. We’re going to build all of that into the character.’ As soon as they said that, it was so liberating.” He realised that he could portray Roddy in a way that challenged even his own beliefs about how a nerdy east Asian guy should be seen on screen: “That was the most beautiful thing given to me on this job.”Acting alongside stars such as Gary Oldman, who plays Roddy’s grubby, mercurial boss Jackson Lamb, has forced Chung to bring his A-game to every scene, he says: “You’re trying to meet them at their level so that they don’t have a dud opposite.”View image in fullscreenCast offs … (from left) Rosalind Eleazar, Christopher Chung, Saskia Reeves, Aimee-Ffion Edwards and Jack Lowden in Slow Horses.Photograph: Jack English/Apple TV+Behind the scenes, the cast of the show are like a “dysfunctional family” with Oldman acting like a “very supportive” father figure. There’s a lot of banter and camaraderie between them all, he says, and when Oldman learned Chung could sing, the two of them recorded a version of Let It Be together “just for fun”.The role has been a “gamechanger” for Chung: he has since been cast as a hot-headed soldier in Doctor Who, a villain’s sidekick in the Steve McQueen movie Blitz, and has just finished filming the Australian Netflix period drama My Brilliant Career. In it, he plays the romantic lead, the handsome and wealthy Harry Beecham.“I always thought my career ambitions would be capped at being the best friend to the lead,” he says. “I never thought I’d get to take that myself.” Previous auditions for leading roles had been unsuccessful, and for a long time he was unable to see himself playing those parts: “Growing up I was never the most desirable kid.”Born to an Irish mother and a Malaysian Chinese father (they met at a party in London in the 1970s, and he often visits his mother’s home town of Limerick) Chung grew up in Mornington, a suburb of Melbourne, where he was one of three or four Chinese kids in a school of 2,500. “I remember kids yelling out to me in the field: ‘Jackie Chan, do some kung fu,’ all the time.” Heath Ledger had been his acting idol; he was not into martial arts, and so didn’t see an east Asian actor whose career he wanted to emulate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He took acting courses in New York and Philadelphia and then moved to London. Within six months, he was cast as Archie Wong, a student in BBC drama Waterloo Road, whose main function is to secretly help his (white) languages teacher learn to speak Mandarin. Later stints in the theatre followed, including roles as the jock Kurt in the musical version of Heathers, and Paris in Romeo and Juliet at the Globe. Then Covid-19 hit and theatres closed. Chung spent lockdown wondering whether he should take a break from acting: “If you weren’t an established actor at that point, what hope did you have?”On the eve of the second lockdown, he landed the part of Roddy. When his agent broke the news, “I broke down on the ground and cried,” Chung says. “Here I was, with an opportunity to have the career I’d always dreamed of.”These twists and turns of Chung’s career are fascinating: it’s hard to imagine Roddy on stage, dancing in a musical, I say.Initially, he shrugs this off with a joke: “I like to show range.” But after mulling it over, he explains that in his experience, actors from minority ethnic backgrounds “can’t just be good at one thing. You have to be good at everything if you want to work.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s a really fun character to play’ … Chung with Hiba Bennani in Slow Horses.Photograph: Apple TV+Before Slow Horses, he says, he often found himself pigeonholed by directors: “They were very much like: ‘This is the Asian part’,” he says. When he was working on Waterloo Road, an executive producer suggested that a good storyline for Archiewould have him “go to China on a boat”. Internally, Chung thought, “What the fuck? But I said: ‘OK.’ I didn’t have the vernacular at the time to say: ‘What are you talking about?’” He felt “othered” and that his presence on set was ticking a box.It was thanks to his wife, the Scottish actor Frances Mayli McCann, that he got past it: “She told me to keep going.” Earlier this year he was nominated for best supporting actor at the Bafta TV awards, becoming the third east Asian male actor ever to be nominated. Now, he’s doing everything he can to break out of “race-specific” roles. There needs to be more diversity “across the board, behind the camera, on the stage, the higher-ups”, he says. “That’s where significant change starts to happen.”Meanwhile, as viewers gear up for Slow Horses’ new series, he eyes the release with some trepidation. “I feel a little anxious about being a bit more central,” he admits. “Fame is not something that I ever chased. I think it’s really overwhelming. You don’t get any time or space for yourself.” On a practical level, he says, being really famous is very expensive, because you can’t easily go out. “You have to get people to go and do stuff for you – and I can’t afford that,” he says.His personal training clients, however, are “thrilled” by his newfound fame: “I think it’s a hoot for them to be able to say: ‘Oh, my trainer is on Slow Horses.’”Slow Horses season five is on Apple TV+ from 24 September.Explore more on these topicsSlow HorsesTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Five decades later, John Cleese and Connie Booth’s show is still unmatchedPhil HarrisonFri 19 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 19 Sep 2025 07.25 EDTShareThe first episode of Fawlty Towers was broadcast on 19 September 1975. We are now half a century distant from that point; as far away as the first episode of Fawlty Towers was from John Logie Baird’s first successful transmission of greyscale television pictures in 1925. And, while the creation of Fawlty Towers wasn’t a technical breakthrough on quite the same level, Fawlty Towers does feel almost as fundamental and foundational to the medium. Like the music of the Beatles, it’s become part of the dominant cultural language of the era.In a 2019 list compiled by the Radio Times, the show wasnamed the greatest ever British sitcom. Has anyone ever done it better? Fifty years seems a reasonable point at which to assess the show’s legacy and conclude that they probably haven’t. And even if anyone has, they were almost certainly following a template that John Cleese and Connie Booth’s English Riviera romp established.The apparent genesis of Fawlty Towers seems too good to be true and very easy to imagine. During the filming of the second season of Monty Python’s Flying Circus, the cast were staying at a hotel in Torquay. Thanks to the uptight, schoolmasterly proprietor, it was an interesting visit. He made a habit of waiting in the lobby for the group to return after an evening out, and even demonstrated the correct British use of a knife and fork to the American Python Terry Gilliam.This hints at the enduring, antihero appeal of Basil Fawlty. To rewatch Fawlty Towers is to be reminded of how appalling Basil really is. He’s sneaky, pompous, pedantic, xenophobic, rude beyond description, and an appalling snob. And, yet, in a way that offers a clue to the show’s lasting legacy, he’s usually just about got a point. Like Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm, Basil takes tricky situations and amplifies them into comic absurdity by his inability to cut his losses. Curb is one of an endless list of sitcoms that simply would not exist without Fawlty Towers. Arguably, might the “no hugging, no learning” template of Curb’s predecessor, Seinfeld, have been born here? Imagine if Basil had just chilled out a bit? Or if Manuel’s English had improved? No fun. The vast majority of sitcoms are a tortuous loop; everyone has to stay exactly where they are.View image in fullscreen‘Uniformly brilliant performances’ … John Cleese, Connie Booth, Andrew Sachs and Prunella Scales in character for BBC sitcom Fawlty Towers.Photograph: BBC/PAAt one point during the gestation of Fawlty Towers, it was suggested that the show might do without a laughter track or a live studio audience (it plumped for the latter). It’s piquant to imagine the show without the laughter. It would still have been funny, naturally, but also tragic; a man in the middle of a painful meltdown. Many 70s comedies now seem strikingly racked by psychic doubt and even anguish; Reginald Perrin fakes suicide and disappears from his own life. Even a show as cheerful as The Good Life has an existential crisis at its heart.In this sense, Fawlty Towers is an emblematic 70s sitcom. But this became an eternal sitcom trope. From Open All Hours and Only Fools and Horses through to The Office and Peep Show, many classic sitcoms are a parade of men behaving badly but also sadly; men going nowhere; men with big ideas and an infinite capacity for self-sabotage. The gender politics of Fawlty Towers are intriguing and a big part of its enduring appeal. The female characters pick up the pieces. Sybil Fawlty (Prunella Scales) is rarely likable, but she is ferociously efficient. Polly (Connie Booth) is game, funny and endlessly put-upon. For all that the show is inextricably linked withJohn Cleese, Booth’s role as co-creator always feels crucial.In defiance of modern viewing habits, Fawlty Towers never feels particularly bingeable. Instead, it’s the comedy equivalent of an extremely hot chilli: delicious but a little goes a long way. The uniformly brilliant performances are endlessly rewatchable, certainly – Cleese’s aptitude for physical comedy remains unmatched. But to revisit it now is to be struck by the sheer, sustained levels of discomfort on display. Each episode is a tightly constructed panic attack; a perfectly calibrated Swiss watch of cringe. In simple narrative terms, theWaldorf Salad episodein season two is one of the least plot-heavy episodes of comedy it’s possible to imagine. But that isn’t the point; it’s 30 incredibly precise, escalatingly painful minutes based around a series of misunderstandings concerning a dinner order. “This is exactly how Nazi Germany started!” fulminates Basil at the episode’s climax, somehow embodyingGodwin’s law, long before the world wide web was born.View image in fullscreenJohn Cleese, Bruce Boa and Claire Nielson in the episode Waldorf Salad.Photograph: ImagenetThere isn’t much of Fawlty Towers to watch. Two seasons of six episodes each, with a three-and-a-half-year gap between them. The writing of the second season was shadowed by the disintegration of Cleese and Booth’s marriage and Booth subsequently disappeared from the public eye. And yet even this scarcity feels like a feature rather than a bug. It didn’t decline into mediocrity. As such, its brevity has become a beacon for other sitcom writers – the creators of The Office and The Young Ones both cited the show’s decision to quit while they were ahead as an example.As such, it has survived perfectly intact. Where does Fawlty Towers stand in 2025? The West End theatre adaptation is streaming on the U platform and offers a clue. It isn’t a reinterpretation, it’s a faithful reproduction. It is period-detailed comedy karaoke. Because, while television may have evolved since 1975, Fawlty Towers was born fully formed. It still lives in a world of its own.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionJohn CleeseTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s early 1963, and Dax, a travel writer, is in his Sussex cottage working on his latest book, struggling with emotional baggage and yearning for his MI6 handler and sometime girlfriend, Faith Green. She persuades him to go to Guatemala to check out the popular leftwing leader who is threatening to topple the country’s CIA-backed government, but Dax is forced to flee when things go seriously awry. He ends up being sent to West Berlin to gather intelligence on a possible assassin, whose arrival in West Germany just before the visit of US president John F Kennedy may not be coincidental. Beautifully crafted, with echoes of le Carré, Greene and Forsyth, this is a superb evocation of a vanished world, seen through the eyes of a relatably hapless accidental hero.View image in fullscreenThe Killer Questionby Janice Hallett (Viper, £18.99)Hallett’s latest centres on that staple of British social life, the pub quiz, and like its predecessors it’s told in emails, WhatsApp messages, texts and transcripts. We know from the start that things haven’t gone well for pub landlords Sue and Mal Eastwood: their nephew is pitching a true crime documentary to Netflix, promising “intrigue, tension, betrayal, deception and … murder”. Rewind to five years earlier: Sue and Mal, desperate to keep their struggling business afloat, are pleased at the arrival of a new quiz team. However, the Shadow Knights proceed to sweep the board every week, prompting accusations of cheating. So far, so nerdy – but when the body of someone already outed as a quiz cheat is discovered in a nearby river, things take a darker turn. Some suspension of disbelief is necessary – why Sue and Mal chose to communicate via WhatsApp rather than talking to each other is unclear – but Hallett is a master of misdirection, and this plot is up there with her fiendishly clever best.View image in fullscreenThe Impossible Fortuneby Richard Osman (Viking, £22)The fifth novel in Osman’s bestselling Thursday Murder Club series sees crime-solving pensioners Elizabeth, Joyce, Ibrahim and Ron engaging with secret codes, drug dealers, impecunious aristocrats and cryptocurrency, with assistance from former cocaine queenpin Connie, friendly cop Donna, Bogdan the handyman and Ron’s clever nine-year-old grandson. Although still grieving for her husband, Elizabeth steps up when Nick, the best man at Joyce’s daughter’s wedding, confides that somebody is trying to kill him. Nick and his business partner Holly own a high-security storage facility and once accepted a payment in bitcoin, the value of which has risen to £350m. They want to cash out, but the money is protected by two codes, and as Nick and Holly have one each, neither can access it alone. When Nick disappears, the quartet gets on the case. The central mystery is a satisfactory head-scratcher, but the true pleasure is a gently humorous read, peopled with characters who feel like old friends.View image in fullscreen59 Minutesby Holly Seddon (Orion, £10.99)Seddon’s seventh novel is a high-concept, inhale-at-a-sitting tour de force. On a Friday afternoon in November, the announcement of an imminent nuclear strike on southern England – just 59 minutes until impact – causes instant chaos. The public are told to seek immediate shelter, but Carrie, stuck in a crowd of panicked commuters at Waterloo station, is desperate to get home to her family. Frankie and Otis, on a romantic minibreak in Devon, are trying to find enough supplies to sustain them until it’s safe to leave their rented cottage, but the queue at the local store soon degenerates into a melee, with worse to follow. As the clock ticks down, Seddon paints a terrifyingly convincing picture of what happens when everything we take for granted breaks down in a matter of seconds, as well as creating characters you’ll be rooting for and keeping up a breakneck pace with a plot that twists, turns, and – without giving too much away – somersaults back on itself.View image in fullscreenDeadman’s Poolby Kate Rhodes (Orenda, £9.99)The eighth novel in Rhodes’s splendid series set on the Isles of Scilly begins when DI Ben Kitto’s dog discovers the remains of an emaciated girl on the uninhabited island of St Helen’s. Kitto and his colleagues are baffled: no one has been reported missing, and rumours about rich islanders being involved in a people-smuggling conspiracy are dismissed as the imaginings of bored schoolkids. Kitto’s narrative is interspersed with that of Mai, a Vietnamese girl who is being held captive in a basement, alone now that her younger sister and her baby – the result of rape by her captor – have been taken away. And when a tiny baby is found abandoned at the police station, the race is on to find the mother before it’s too late. An atmospheric and moving depiction of a tightly knit community in a rugged and often dangerous landscape, Deadman’s Pool is tense and deftly plotted, the pathos fuelling true suspense.Mick Herron and Richard Osman: Crime, Comedy and the Art of the PlotOn Tuesday 23 September, join Mick Herron, Richard Osman and Alex Clark for an insightful discussion about their new books, Clown Town and The Impossible Fortune, live at Cadogan Hall, London and livestreamed.

According to the book, he told her: “My brother called. He’s been talking to a group of real power brokers in Philly.” He offered several names and asked if Harris knew them. She did not.Harris writes: “Then he got to his point. His brother had told him that those guys were not going to support me because I’d been saying bad things about him. He wasn’t inclined to believe it, he claimed, but he thought I should know in case my team had been encouraging me to put daylight between the two of us.”View image in fullscreenKamala Harris’s campaign memoir 107 Days.Photograph: Simon & Schuster/ReutersThe then vice-president asked Biden to put the group in touch with her directly. But he was not done with the call. He sought to rewrite the history of his own disastrous debate performance against Trump three months earlier.“Joe then rattled on about his own former debate performances. ‘I beat him the other time; I wasn’t feeling well in that last one.’ He continued to insist that his debate performance hadn’t hurt him much with the electorate. I was barely listening.”Harris goes on to reflect that her debate against Trump would be like “a big prizefight”, with huge consequences for America and the world, and she needed to be at the top of her game.She writes of Biden: “I just couldn’t understand why he would call me, right now, and make it all about himself. Distracting me with worry about hostile power-brokers in the biggest city of the most important state.”Her husband, Doug Emhoff, “could see how angry and disappointed I was. ‘Let it go,’ he said. He knew I had to redirect my focus. ‘Don’t worry about him. You’re dealing with Trump. Let it go.’”During the campaign and in its aftermath, Harris had avoided criticism of the president she served beside and defended him amid questions abouthis mental acuity.But in 107 Days she lays bare tensions between the two. When the supreme court overturned the Roe v Wade decision on abortion in 2022, for example, “Joe struggled to talk about reproductive rights in a way that met the gravity of the moment.”Harris acknowledges there was a distinction between Biden’s ability to govern and to campaign, and that she had concerns about the latter. “His voice was no longer strong, his verbal stumbles more frequent,” she writes.There was an awkward meeting on 4 July, when Biden was facing growing calls to step aside after his feeble debate performance. Harris hugged him and notes that “he felt so frail”, while Emhoff was led away to see the first lady at the time, Jill Biden.Harris reports: “She seemed tense, even angry. ‘What’s going on?’ she demanded. ‘Are you supporting us?’ Of course, Doug said. Of course we are supporting you. ‘OK. That’s really important. We need to know that.’“When I joined him,” Harris continues, “Doug was wearing a grim expression. Doug runs cool. He’s slow to anger. But I could tell something had gotten to him.“Later, he unloaded. ‘They hide you away for four years, give you impossible, shit jobs, don’t correct the record when those tasks are mischaracterised, never fight back when you’re attacked, never praise your accomplishments, and now, finally, they want you out there on that balcony, standing right beside them. Now, finally, they know you are an asset, and they need you to reassure the American people.“And still, they have to ask if we’re loyal?”Harris had felt similar frustrations, recalling how she was once castigated by Biden’s team for apparently delivering a speech too well. “Their thinking was zero-sum:Ifshe’s shining, he’s dimmed.”Biden bowed to the inevitable and dropped out of the election race on 21 July, then endorsed Harris. Campaign advisers urged her to distance herself from the president. David Plouffe, a senior aide, eventually told her: “People hateJoe Biden.” Harris admits: “It was hard for me to hear that.”She had just over three months to fight Trump and his army of rightwing influencers. At the end of July, the Republican nominee falsely claimed that Harris, whose mother was Indian and father is Jamaican, “happened to turn Black” a few years ago, a remark that blew up all over the media.Harris told the campaign aide Brian Fallon that she was not going to take Trump’s bait. She writes in the book: “‘Today he wants me to prove my race. What next? He’ll say I’m not a woman and I’ll need to show my vagina?’“Brian, on the other end of the phone, fell silent. I imagined the deep crimson of his blush.”Explore more on these topicsKamala HarrisJoe BidenUS politicsUS elections 2024DemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, the Kremlin’s version of the spectacle promises “traditional values”, patriotic ballads and a Russian entry led by a fiercely pro-war singer, as Moscow attempts to refashion Europe’s glitter-soaked pageant in its own image.Russia was banned from Eurovision in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Three years on, the president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree to revive Intervision, clearing the way for its first edition since the collapse of the Soviet Union.View image in fullscreenRussia’s Shaman (Yaroslav Dronov) enjoys a cuppa at the contest draw.Photograph: Maxim Shipenkov/EPAParticipants will include members of the Brics bloc – China, India, Brazil and South Africa – as well as post-Soviet allies such as Belarus and several states in central Asia. The show will be hosted by the Chinese showman Lay (real name Meng Lei) and the Indian actor Stefy Patel, billed as the contest’s “international pair” of presenters.“The quality is high … The main thing for us is that they bring with them their culture, a sense of life and spiritual traditions. This has succeeded,” said Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov.Russia will be represented by Shaman, a peroxide-blond singer who has become one of the most prominent cultural faces of the Kremlin’s war effort. Best known for his booming patriotic songs, among them I Am Russian, which has become an unofficial anthem of Moscow’s pro-war movement, Shaman (real name Yaroslav Dronov) has cultivated a fervent following at home, performing at state rallies and military events draped in the Russian flag.Intervision’s organisers were dealt a blow on Wednesday when the American singer Brandon Howard unexpectedly pulled out. His participation had been widely trumpeted by Moscow, though he was never part of any official US delegation.View image in fullscreenThe US singer Brandon Howard, who has pulled out.Photograph: Imaginechina Limited/AlamyThe show marks an unlikely comeback for Intervision. Launched under the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, the contest ran sporadically from the 1960s to the 1980s as the eastern bloc’s answer to Eurovision. Staged in Poland and the then Czechoslovakia, it also drew entries from Moscow’s communist allies farther afield, including Cuba. At the time, Intervision was widely cast as a gesture of openness after the death of Joseph Stalin and as a showcase of artistic traditions from across the bloc.Russia first competed in Eurovision in 1994, just a few years after the fall of the Soviet Union, marking the beginning of a long and complex relationship with the singing competition.Throughout the 2000s, Eurovision became one of Russia’s most highly anticipated events, with Moscow frequently sending some of its biggest stars.The singer Dima Bilan remains Russia’s only Eurovision winner, claiming victory in 2008 with his song Believe.The following year, Moscow hosted the competition in grand style, spending a reported $42m, making it the most expensive Eurovision to date.But as Russia took an increasingly conservative turn under Putin’s rule, there was growing criticism of the famously flamboyant competition, which often celebrates LGBTQ+ themes and performers. Officials in Moscow frequently criticised the contents for undermining “traditional family values”.View image in fullscreenAn installation dedicated to the contest near the Kremlin.Photograph: Maxim Shipenkov/EPAGennady Zyuganov, the longtime leader of Russia’s Communist party, said this week: “Eurovision used to be bright and interesting. But when the west started dragging all sorts of perversions on to television I not only didn’t like it, I no longer wanted to watch it.”Zyuganov added that he was confident Intervision would outdo its western counterpart in popularity.But Russian audiences do not appear to be entirely convinced. Local media reported that organisers, anxious about sparse attendance, sought to pad out the hall withmassovka, paid extras, who are instructed to pose and dress as “foreign guests”.Explore more on these topicsRussiaEuropeEurovisionnewsShareReuse this content"

So it was an incredibly forward-looking festival.”View image in fullscreenCrowds at the Festival of Britain in London in 1951.Photograph: ANL/Rex/ShutterstockBedell added that the timing was ideal during a time of increasing divisions within society. “We’ve never needed this more,” she said. “At a time when the world feels very polarised, we know that arts and culture is the thing that can bring people together. The Southbank Centre has always been this place of congregation.”The Guardian reported on the closing of the original festival, which featured a “flag ceremony” as a union flag and two festival flags were lowered while an assembled crowd sung the national anthem, Abide With Me and Auld Lang Syne.“We need an injection of positivity now more than any other time in my life,” saidLemn Sissay, who is collaborating with schoolchildren around the country for the event. “We’ll be asking 3,500 young people to imagine the future. It’s perfect timing.”The original event concluded with “an open-air cabaret with Gracie Fields for its main attraction”, while the Royal Festival Hall was a permanent reminder of the celebrations.When laying the foundation stone for the Royal Festival Hall, Attlee said it would “show that we’re not just a nation of shopkeepers, but a people who appreciate and practise the arts”.More than 8 million people attended the 1951 event, which, according to the Guardian, became “part of our communal memory, haunting certain stretches of the Thames shore”.Boyle said the Southbank Centre was “for everyone, like the NHS – a dose of culture, like a vitamin injection, it lifts you”.The Trainspotting director added that he wanted “to send people on an adventure through an arts centre that is usually experienced in individual venues, but transform it in people’s minds so they can see the Southbank Centre in a completely original way”.There will be a celebration of Benjamin Zephaniah and the composer Steve Reich, while Anish Kapoor returns to the Hayward Gallery after 28 years with a landmark exhibition. Goalhanger podcasts will also host events, and the pianist Yuja Wang will present her immersive Playing With Fire performance.Explore more on these topicsSouthbank CentreFestivalsDanny BoyleLemn SissayYoung peopleLondonSecond world warnewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "2:03How US late-night hosts covered the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live! – videoJimmy KimmelLate-night show hosts decry suspension of Kimmel’s show: ‘Blatant assault on freedom of speech’Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart, Seth Meyers, Jimmy Fallon and David Letterman criticize ABC’s parent company, Disney and FCC chief Brendan CarrRobert Mackey,Maya YangandSian CainThu 18 Sep 2025 22.18 EDTFirst published on Thu 18 Sep 2025 22.05 EDTShareLate-night show hostsStephen Colbert, Jon Stewart,Seth MeyersandJimmy Fallonand former hostDavid Lettermanhave all rallied behindJimmy Kimmelfollowing ABC’s decision to indefinitelysuspendhis popular late-night show after his comments about theTrump administration’s response to the death of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk.In his opening monologue on Thursday night, Colbert mocked executives at Disney, ABC’s parent company, for caving to threats from Brendan Carr, the FCC chair, when they pulled Kimmel off the air.Inan excerptposted on Instagram before broadcast, Colbert also scolded Carr for calling Kimmel’s commentary on the rush to politicize Kirk’s murder an affront to community values. “Well, you know what my community values are, Buster?” Colbert asked. “Freedom of speech.Explainer: What did Jimmy Kimmel say about Charlie Kirk’s killing?Read more“People across the country are shocked by this blatant assault on the freedom of speech,” Colbert added. He poked fun at Disney executives, saying: “As one source at ABC put it, they were pissing themselves all day” over the threat of Trump’s administration’s retaliation against the network. “On the bright side, that proves Disney is No 1 in streaming,” he joked.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

In a message to employees at Disney, ABC, ESPN and Hulu, character Lumière’s lyrics in the song Be Our Guest were changed to say “shut your trap, we are warning you to cut the crap”.“Patriotically obedient host” Jon Stewart, meanwhile, stepped in to present “the all-new, government-approved Daily Show”, which he normally only hosts on Mondays. On a newly gold set –to match the Oval Office’s new aesthetic– Stewart struck a playfully sycophantic tone.Referring to Trump’s comment overnight that “Kimmel is not a talented person”, Stewart joked that Trump had a “Talent-O-Meter” to measure when a performer’s “niceness to the president goes below a certain level”.“At which point, the FCC must be notified to threaten the acquisition prospects for billion-dollar mergers of network affiliates. These affiliates are then asked to give ultimatums to the even larger mega-corporation that controls the flow of state-approved content, or the FCC can just choose to threaten those licenses directly. It’s basic science. Read your constitution!” he said to applause.HighlightingDonald TrumpJr and the House speaker, Mike Johnson, criticising their political opponents for calling Trump’s administration “fascist”, Stewart played clips of Trump calling Democrats “fascists”, “animals” and “demonic”.In response to comments by Republicans that politically motivated violence was no laughing matter after Kirk’s death, Stewart showed clips of Republicans and conservatives mocking the2022 hammer attackon Paul Pelosi, husband of the the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, which left him with a fractured skull.Stewart then interviewedthe FilipinoNobel peace prize-winning journalist Maria Ressa who was jailed in the Philippines in 2020 for her journalism criticising former president Rodrigo Duterte, who she said “collapsed our institutions in six months”.“Do you think it is weird it has taken Trump eight [months]?” Stewart asked.“I think he did it in the first 100 days,” Ressa replied, describing Trump’s dismantling of institutions that could stand up to his rule as “identical” to what happened in the Philippines.Meyers, the NBC late-night host, made light of fears that he might be next in line to be canceled,starting his showon Thursday by pausing to say that as “[Trump’s] administration is pursuing a crackdown on free speech … completely unrelated, I just want to say before we get started here that I’ve always admired and respected Mr Trump”.As his audience laughed, Meyers continued: “I’ve always believed he was – no, no, no – a visionary, an innovator, a great president, an even better golfer. And if you’ve ever seen me say anything negative about him, that’s just AI.”In his opening monologue, Jimmy Fallon joked, “I woke up to 100 messages from my dad saying, ‘sorry they cancelled your show.’“To be honest with you all, I don’t know what is going on. And no one does. But I do knowJimmy Kimmeland he is a decent, funny and loving guy, and I hope he comes back,” he said to applause.Earlier on Thursday, the veteran TV host David Letterman also condemned ABC’s decisionwhile speakingat a festival for the Atlantic magazine.“I feel bad about this because we all see where this is going,” Letterman said. “It’s managed media. And it’s no good. It’s silly. It’s ridiculous. And you can’t go around firing somebody because you’re fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian criminal administration in the Oval Office. That’s just not how this works.”The statements come amid growing criticism against big media companies such as ABC and Paramount over their decisions to cancel popular shows including The Late Show WithStephen Colbertearlier.Trump has repeatedly accused mainstream networks of unfair coverage. Speaking on Air Force One on Thursday, Trumpclaimed– without providing evidence – that “97% [of major US networks are] against me”, adding: “Again, 97% negative, and yet I won easily. I won all seven swing states … They give me only bad press. I mean they’re getting a license. I would think maybe their licenses should be taken away.”Such show cancellations have been widely regarded as part of a broader trend where major media companies, eager to protect theirbusiness interests, are increasingly aligning with rightwing views supported by Trump. This shift, which reflects a growing chill across media networks, has drawn criticism from the public and Democratic lawmakers who feel the media is becoming more submissive to Trump’s White House at the expense of free speech.Hundreds protest outside Disney HQ over ‘un-American’ Kimmel suspensionRead moreThe controversy began after Kimmel, in a recent broadcast,suggested that“many in Maga land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk”. Within a day, Carr condemned the comments as “truly sick” and suggested ABC could face regulatory consequences.The blowback on ABC and Disney on Thursday was swift, and ABC executives arereportedlyhoping to find a way to bring Kimmel back soon.On Thursday,Reuters reportedthat Bob Iger, the Disney CEO, and Dana Walden, Disney Entertainment co-chair, agreed to take Kimmel’s show off the air on Wednesday and find a way to bring him back later, after struggling to agree on how to address the social media furor that erupted over Kimmel’s comments about Kirk.Reaction to Kimmel’s monologue had reached a fever pitch on Wednesday, including death threats that raised concerns for the safety of Kimmel and his staff, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. The late-night host was prepared to make a statement, but Kimmel and Disney representatives could not find language that they agreed would not further inflame the situation.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But banish all thoughts about cartoon sitcom greatness – it is relentlessly, endlessly OKJack SealeFri 19 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 19 Sep 2025 00.01 EDTShareAnimated comedy for adults should be a limitless playground for the world’s brightest comic imaginations and sometimes it is, but it is also a genre that has been bloated by bland, empty calories – inessential shows that viewers leave running in the background while they potter or doomscroll. To the teetering pile of landfill entertainment can be added Haunted Hotel, Netflix’s new comedy about, unsurprisingly, a haunted hotel.As you ponder whether or not to put it on your watchlist, push the giants of cartoon sitcom out of your mind: showrunner Matt Roller has episodes of Rick and Morty on his CV, but Haunted Hotel doesn’t have the fizzing imaginative leaps of that series, nor does it deliver the finely honed, classic comedy of The Simpsons, the lewd snark of Family Guy or the black profundity of BoJack Horseman. Instead, it is, at best, quite funny. It has lines that conform to the familiar shape of jokes. Some of the synapses you associate with laughter will experience mild stimulus. If you don’t like this gag, another will be along in a minute, and although you probably also won’t like that one, you won’t strongly dislike it either. This show is relentlessly, endlessly OK.Our setting is the Undervale hotel, which suffers from a poor location, terrible decor and a lack of professional staff, but that’s not why it has very few guests. It’s haunted! It is crawling with ghosts, ghouls, demons and spooky supernatural phenomena. At first, it seems we are in a Ghosts rip-off, as the resident spirits offer an unpredictable blend of assistance and hindrance, and bargain pathetically for perks: just as in Ghosts, the boredom of eternity has caused an obsession with asking humans to leave their televisions switched on.View image in fullscreenResident family … Natalie Palamides as Esther, Skyler Gisondo as Ben, Will Forte as Nathan, Jimmi Simpson as Abaddon and Eliza Coupe as Katherine.Photograph: Netflix/PAGrappling with the undead residents is a pretty conventional sitcom family unit, led by smart, put-upon single mother Katherine (Eliza Coupe) and ineffectual dreamer Nathan (Will Forte). The twist here is that classic comedy dad Nathan is Katherine’s brother, not her partner, and he is also a ghost, albeit one who thinks and talks like a living human. He and Katherine act as parents to her two kids Ben (Skyler Gisondo), a 13-year-old at the wrong end of the high school coolness spectrum, and little sister Esther (Natalie Palamides), who like a lot of sitcom little sisters has a dark energy that tends towards megalomania. Completing the lineup is diminutive agent of chaos Abaddon (Jimmi Simpson), a demon trapped in the body of a small boy from the 18th century – and if that sounds like an original creation, rest assured that Abaddon is essentially Stewie from Family Guy: “The night is my canvas and terror my paint! I’d like PB&J for lunch.”Possibly a pilot episode was made and deemed to be too Ghosts-influenced because, once episode one has given us the setup, Haunted Hotel widens out to become a vehicle for various spoofs and homages. There is an episode with a serial killer that references Halloween and other teen-slasher movies, and another involving Esther’s attempts to gain popularity at school by lending out weird creatures as pets, which causes an Invasion of the Body Snatchers situation. Katherine’s effort to leave the madness behind and finally go out on a date, only for her passion to be thwarted by a particularly tumultuous evening developing back at home, is a standard sitcom story.None of this is actively preventing Haunted Hotel from fashioning sharp jokes. But it’s a format that lends itself more to dialogue that doesn’t feel like it has been worked on for too long, from the time Ben is attacked by a monster and thinks he is about to die (“Don’t let Mom open my laptop! Just throw it away!”) to the moment where Abaddon reminisces about his previous life as the gatekeeper to the fifth circle of hell (“I determined who would enter for torture, and who would fall into the abyss for different torture”). Often the will-this-do? vibe is too strong, as when someone says “You can’t rush love” and Nathan replies: “Or deep-dish pizza – it usually takes 40 minutes!” Eh?The hotel’s phantasmagorical squatters provide infinite opportunities for throwaway visual gags but, perhaps because writing on such a wide canvas is difficult as it means conjuring humour out of thin air, these never land either. A mouse, cat, dog and dog warden suddenly run across a corridor, prompting Katherine to wonder how they all died together. “Cliff,” explains Esther. “It was foggy!” Meh.“Welcome to The Undervale!” says Nathan to one potential guest when they walk through the front door. “We know about the smell, and we’re trying.” Haunted Hotel isn’t trying hard enough.Haunted Hotel is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsAnimation on TVTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

But even this fictionalised account of the career of the co-founder of dating app Tinder and creator of Bumble paints a damning picture of the toxic, misogynistic culture that permeates Silicon Valley. In Rachel Lee Goldenberg’s sadly still timely film, Lily James stars as Whitney, a peppy college graduate lucking her way into a startup incubator run by Sean Rad (Ben Schnetzer). It portrays the subsequent diminishing of her key role in the success of Tinder, which runs parallel with the collapse of her relationship with colleague Justin (Jackson White), amid gaslighting, trolling and sexual harassment.Simon WardellExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightJimi HendrixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This explosive thriller, which starsJessica Chastainas Jodi, an agent who specialises in infiltrating hate groups, fares better than most. It helps that the subject matter – lone wolf, far-right terrorists whose fantasies spill out into the world – feels grimly relevant. But Chastain also embodies the duality many of us now feel; the impossibility of reconciling online identities with real life. Using the persona “Fleshy MF”, Jodi understands the impulses of her chatroom comrades – and stopping the extremists becomes a challenge with potentially terrifying consequences.Apple TV+, from Friday 26 SeptemberHouse of GuinnessView image in fullscreenPacked with booze, crime and stylish violence … Louis Partridge in House of Guinness.Photograph: NetflixBooze, crime,family conflict, street politics and stylish violence: it’s hard to think of a tale more suited to the signature style of Steven Knight. With its ornate dialogue and lavish period flourishes, the essence of Knight is so strong in this drama that it approaches self-parody. It tells the story of the aftermath of the death of Benjamin Guinness in 1868, whose passing leaves a vacuum to be filled by some combination of his four dissolute, complacent, scheming children. Meanwhile, outside their inheritance battle, Irish republicanism is stirring.

He’s been cornered by old-money crime family the Dunmires, who are menacing everything he’s built. However, Dwight still has a few tricks up his sleeve, so expect these threats to be addressed with cunning and violence.

I secretly believed that Rivendell was based on that house, which it clearly wasn’t.My favourite book growing upImpossible. I’m inconstant, so it was whatever I was reading at the time. Let’s say Finn Family Moomintroll, which is the most perfect of Tove Jansson’s lovely (and occasionally frankly terrifying) Moomin books.The book that changed me as a teenagerGreat Expectations byCharles Dickens, at 14. I loathed it. It nearly turned me off reading for ever. Everyone kept telling me it was a masterpiece and I just couldn’t understand why [school would] set a book about being an alienated child for a bunch of teenagers. “Yes, I know adults are incomprehensible and other people make no sense and loneliness is awful. Why do I need to read about it?”The writer who changed my mindTan Twan Eng. The Garden of Evening Mists is a stunning novel – jaw-dropping, beautiful, intricate, elegant, powerful, touching – and made me see how books about terrible things can be uplifting to the point of transcendent. As I type that it seems obvious, but it wasn’t obvious to me then.The book that made me want to be a writerAh. That one’s a little bit tricky, because I’ve always been immersed in writing. I can tell you that Cloud Atlas byDavid Mitchellis so good that it infuriated me into starting a new novel, and that everything I’ve read by Michael Chabon has filled me with a furious creative envy that makes me work harder. Jeanette Winterson is some kind of perfect dreamer; Anne Carson and Colson Whitehead always make me feel like I should be wilder, wiser and better. But perhaps the honour has to go to A Murder of Quality by John le Carré. My father gave me a leather-bound copy when I was very young, and the smell of the pages and the beauty of the object itself made me believe in the magic of words.The bookI came back toWe’re back with Great Expectations. It really is a brilliant book, but we shouldn’t force it on teenagers. That’s not to say they shouldn’t read it if they want to. But just because it’s about young people doesn’t mean it’s written for them; it’s written for the rest of us remembering who we were.The book I rereadThe Hound of the Baskervilles byArthur Conan Doyle. I read it as a child and scared myself sleepless, then at university and chuckled at my tween fear, and again more recently, conscious at last not of the monstrosity of the hound, but the astounding cruelty of its master.The book I could never read againAlmost every book I read for fun between seven and 17. I actually don’t remember what they were, so I can’t name and shame, but that is some kind of judgment in itself. To highlight instead some of the notable exceptions: Susan Cooper’s Dark Is Rising sequence, Patricia McKillip’s harpist trilogy, and all thingsWilliam Gibson.The book I discovered later in lifeLabyrinths by Jorge Luis Borges.The book I am currently readingMatt Wixey’s Basilisk. And, with my kids, I’m reading the latest Amari Peters book, Amari and the Despicable Wonders by BB Alston. It’s very tense and I don’t know how she can possibly win through!My comfort readSpook Country by William Gibson, who I mentioned earlier, of course, but this is one of his later books and for me it’s just superb. The audiobook, read by Robertson Dean, is also a gem. The texture of the prose, the encounter between mundane and strange, the magic of story … it’s a good place to spend an evening.Karla’s Choice by Nick Harkaway is published by Penguin.To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Elite schools (Collegiate, Vassar, NYU); sleepovers with Sean Lennon and a cast of New York’s nepo who’s who; hanging out with Michael Jackson; the abundant creative freedom gifted by the safety net of generational wealth. It would be enough to make many readers roll their eyes before turning a single page. Their loss.Ronson’s talent as a writer enables him to render this privilege, the background glamour, his awkward stumbles as well as successes, with a kind of wry, soft self-deprecation that is genuinely endearing. It helps, of course, that he is a massive nerd. “I had the rhythm to play the music, but not the confidence to let go,” he writes in that throwaway line about dancing. It’s both deeply revealing and hard to get your head around. Ronson would rather spend paragraphs enthusing about the thickness of slipmats required for a specific DJ setup than he would recalling the wild-eyed buzz generated at an afterparty close to dawn. On balance, this is a good thing. There is more than enough bad writing on hedonism in the world. I’ll take the earnest, qualitative review of turntable cartridges.This is not supposed to be a definitive history of 90s club culture, but it’s a vivid snapshot told from a unique perspectiveIn Night People, the debauchery – of the best and worst kind – is alluded to rather than gratuitously revelled in. There are passing references to taking heroin (wait,what?) and late nights dieting on a menu of uppers and vodka cranberry, but without the detail that could tip into cliche. Instead, Ronson is faithfully reverent to the many people who helped a gawky Jewish, London-born hip-hop fan from the Upper West Side to become synonymous with the 90s celebrity-model party scene. It’s not an era of New York nightlife that has been particularly eulogised. Understandable, given it was preceded by the white-hot energy of the 70s and 80s and, I suppose, because it’s difficult to romanticise a period during which dancefloors began to give way to velvet-roped club lounges, bottle service and a scene built around being seen.Still, Ronson gives it a great shot. The impact of mayor Rudy Giuliani’s crackdown on crime and clean up of the city is told through the lens of its night-dwellers. The east coast-west coast hip-hop rivalry is documented through the many characters that kept the city hyped. It’s not supposed to be a definitive history of 90s club culture, though Ronson interviewed dozens of friends, DJs, bouncers, promoters and clubbers to help piece together his memories. But it’s a vivid social and cultural snapshot.The one-man hit factory, the force who famously drove Amy Winehouse to create her best work, the mega producer who just celebrated his 50th birthday – none of that is here, of course. At the centre of this book is a Ronson much closer to the teenage crate-digger whose mum bought him his first Technics turntables and who blagged his way to the booth. It shouldn’t be as compelling as it is, but for the accompanying soundtrack of deep cuts alone, Night People is well worth a spin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

This package offers a reissue of two episodes, about 50 minutes each, from the first 1965 season of Thunderbirds, the sci-fi/adventure series performed entirely with puppets and scale-model sets, a format that creators Gerry and Sylvia Anderson called “Supermarionation”. Most readers will probably already be familiar with the basic premise, but for gen Z and Alpha types out there, the idea is that the all-male Tracy family, led by former astronaut paterfamilias Jeff (voiced by Peter Dyneley), operate a private international rescue business with mysteriously unclear sources of funding that sends various super hi-tech vehicles (the titular Thunderbirds) to bail out people in jeopardy. Indeed kids, this is what inspiredTrey Parker and Matt Stone’s spoof movie Team America: World Police.In Trapped in the Sky, an evil Asian supervillain called the Hood plants a bomb on a Concorde-like supersonic plane making its maiden voyage so that he can lure out the Thunderbirds and thereby study their mechanics in order to sell them on. It’s a delightful hark back to an era when industrial espionage just involved covert photography rather than hardcore hacking and intellectual property law. Also, this episode contains posh spy totty extraordinaire Lady Penelope (voiced by Sylvia Anderson herself), and her trusty manservant Parker (David Graham) with his almost prehensile bushy eyebrows. (Parker has to stand up coachloads of guests to Penelope’s stately home in order to help out with the rescue, a shocking violation of etiquette, but needs must.)In the second, even better, episode, Terror in New York City, the Tracys must help rescue some pesky but hapless journalists who fall into a fissure in the ground when – get this – the authorities decide to move the Empire State Building 200 yards to the side in order that redevelopment of the area can go ahead. It’s a mad scheme that onlylegendary NYC city planner Robert Mosescould love, but not a single character questions the initial idea for a moment, even when it all goes disastrously wrong.These crisp remastered versions allow us to really appreciate the quality of the effects, which are so persuasive and intricately detailed you soon almost forget that you are watching models. But those sneaky little black strings always give it away, little reminders of the means of production that in fact makes it all the more endearing. Moreover, the costume and set design is especially swoon-worthy for fans of retro fashion (in those days, just fashion), especially the nifty lapel-less, cropped, double-breasted sports jackets the men wear and the orientalist loungewear favoured by the ladies. Aspiring designers are advised to take notes and execute a little industrial espionage of their own.Thunderbirds: Trapped in the Sky/Terror in New York City are in cinemas from 20 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsScience fiction TVTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Or, to put it another way, is there now enough reasonable doubt to declare her conviction unsafe? This documentary’s answer to the second question could hardly be clearer: yes.Letby was declared to be the biggest child serial killer in modern Britain, though she could yet go down in history as the subject of our era’s most serious miscarriage of justice. Public opinion, media mythology and the law turn as slowly as an oil tanker. Letby could walk free … or she could end up the subject of unending and fruitless debate, in a kind of permanent standoff with her accusers, like theMenendez brothers in the US, contentiously convicted of killing their parents in 1989 and still in prison.The film shows the struggle of Letby’s voluble and media-savvy barrister Mark McDonald to bring her case in front of the Criminal Cases Review Commission to have it sent back to the court of appeal – a process which is continuing. Among the interviewees on Letby’s side are Private Eye’s investigative reporter Dr Phil Hammond and the Toronto neonatal expert Dr Shoo Lee, some of many convinced that the conviction is unsafe. The Mail on Sunday columnist Peter Hitchens, a vehement commentator on the case, is glimpsed here at a press conference, but not interviewed. And on the prosecution’s side there is the expert witness Dr Dewi Evans, whose testimony was so important.Letby, a former neonatal nurse at Chester hospital who was convicted in 2023 of seven murders of infants and the attempted murder of seven more, was at the centre of a trial that focused on the sensational handwritten Post-it notes recovered from her house in which she appeared to confess her guilt, and which surely swayed the jury. She claimed these were merely imaginary cathartic exercises encouraged by a counsellor (it is a fault of this film that it does not more closely examine the process of this counselling.)Daniel Bogado’s documentary, which is due to be shown in two-episode form onChannel 4, focuses on the overwhelming importance of Dr Evans, the prosecution’s expert witness who was dramatically convinced of Letby’s guilt early in the process. Dr Evans himself, extensively interviewed in this film, is an experienced health practitioner and proud Welshman who is of the view that the current campaign is a London-based media stitch-up to put him and his expertise on trial. He calls Letby’s defenders the “Great Metropolitan Elite” or “God’s Most Entitled”. And in fact it is perfectly possible to feel sympathy for Dr Evans due to the abuse which he receives. The film also interviews anonymous parents whose infant was transferred away from Chester hospital and now believe that their child’s survival is due to escaping Letby.The convictions of Lucy Letby: should they be overturned?Read moreAs for Letby herself, she is a blond, blue-eyed former nurse who was once chosen as the face of the hospital PR campaign, and these are the qualities that might have made her the subject of prurient media fascination in the first place. But they might also have done her current campaign no harm; the film does not offer an opinion on that. But it certainly presents a very coherent argument in the case of each infant death that what could well have happened was incompetence and mishap; the all-important pattern of mysterious and questionable deaths, so easily attributable to a single malign person, could as easily be the result of systemic underfunding, understaffing or mismanagement. As Dr Hammond says: we don’t want to believe that it could happen in our NHS, so we blame an individual.None of this solves the issue of guilt; the argument merely addresses the onus of proof. It is conceivable that the conviction was only partly faulty. Everyone involved here makes it clear they have utmost respect for the feelings for the bereaved parents, and declare that getting at the truth will help them in the long run. That may or may not be accurate; what remains to be seen is whether the Letby debate leads to an increase in the standards of neonatal care.Conviction: The Case of Lucy Letby is in UK cinemas from 19 September, and on Channel 4 on 29 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsLucy LetbyChannel 4Television industryreviewsShareReuse this content"

This is a dynamically shot and earnestly performed real-life disaster movie aboutCalifornia’s terrifying 2018 Camp fire, a darkness-at-noon horror that became the deadliest wildfire in California history, killing 85 people and razing more than 150,000 acres. Greengrass and co-screenwriter Brad Ingelsby have taken their inspiration fromLizzie Johnson’s 2021 book Paradise: One Town’s Struggle to Survive an American Wildfire, about the calamity and the ironically named town caught up in it, pointing up the extraordinary, unassuming courage of school-bus driver Kevin McKay whopiloted a busload of screaming kids and their teacherthrough hell to safety.America Ferrera plays the caring, if slightly prim teacher Mary Ludwig andMatthew McConaugheyis the rough, sweaty everyman hero behind the wheel – with whom, in the time-honoured style of Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart in The African Queen, Mary is to have an emotional connection. Before the fire, Kevin had been a loser and a screwup, alienated from his son and ex-wife, on the verge of getting fired from his school-bus-driving job (due to honest errors attributable to family worries) – but of course highly eligible for the heroic redemption that the fire will provide.As this terrible blaze – sparked by a poorly maintained power line – sweeps across the state, we see everything periodically from the fire’s own point of view, whooshing along with it and the glowing embers through the smoky chaos. A school desperately needs to be evacuated as the fire closes in; no other vehicle is available and Kevin steps up, neglecting his own sick son in the process. (In truth, it is only a bottle of Tylenol he was due to deliver to the boy, who is in any case under the care of his grandma, so it is not exactly a life-or-death dilemma.)As he drives them through the chaotic inferno, out of radio contact, with the bus encountering gridlock and gun-toting rioters, almost literally bursting into flames with the heat, with air quality near unbreathable and the children losing consciousness, Mary almost thinks the unthinkable: might it not be better to let the kids fall asleep, rather than burn to death? “Don’t talk like that,” says Kevin. Meanwhile, at fire department HQ, the top brass are making increasingly panicky announcements, prefaced with: “Listen up people …”But wait. Whose fault is all this? The electrical company were found liable in the courts, as the titles over the closing credits confirm. President Trump (whose name is not mentioned in the film) blamed bad forest management. But there is one scene in which the tortured fire chief announces to a press conference that there are more and more fires like this and … his voice trails away, overcome with (understandable) emotion. He can’t quite bring himself to say the words “climate crisis” out loud – but I would have liked to see something on the closing credits about the increasing incidence of these wildfires. This is the point, and the film is in danger of missing it.The Lost Bus is in cinemas from 19 September, and on Apple TV+ from 3 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersCalifornia wildfiresPaul GreengrassMatthew McConaugheyFilm adaptationsreviewsShareReuse this content"

They’re wrong’James Vanderbilt (Truth, 2015)Robert Redford hid from me behind a door once. I was directing my first film, Truth, and had somehow, improbably, gotten him to star in it. We were shooting a take, I called cut, went in to give a note, and he was gone. The whole cast was smiling, and I couldn’t figure it out – there was only one door in and out of the room and I had just walked through it. How had I lostRobert Redford?Then, from behind me, I heard that Redford chuckle. You’ve heard it in a hundred movies. I turned around and there he was, possibly the most famous man in the world, hiding behind the door I had just walked through, pressed up against the wall, giggling.View image in fullscreenBlanchett and Redford in Truth.Photograph: Supplied by LMKBefore Truth, I had been a journeyman screenwriter with some hits and some misses and had met Bob (he asked me to call him “Bob”, which in itself was a career highlight) after writing a script he was supposed to direct called Against All Enemies that never got made. I remember, while developing that film, he gave me a note on a scene I had written featuring Bill Clinton. I was resisting the note and explained why, and Bob very gently said to me: “It’s just, knowing Bill, he wouldn’t say it like that.” And it crashed in on me that he was giving me the note because he personally knew the president of the United States. It was one of those moments where you remembered: “Oh my God, I’m actually talking toRobert fucking Redford.”He knew the effect he had on people. Crew members who had been working on movies for 30 years would turn into teenagers at the sight of him. The first day he was on set for Truth, Cate Blanchett told me she changed clothes three times before coming to work in case she bumped into him before she went into wardrobe. Elisabeth Moss, who I’d never seen be anxious in her life, nervously went over to say hello to him. He told her he admired her work and that her show at the time, Jane Campion’s Top of the Lake, was on his network, the Sundance Channel. “I forgot he has a network!” she told me, grinning.View image in fullscreenRedford as Dan Rather in Truth.Photograph: Sony Pictures Classics/AllstarHe had a network, he had the Sundance Institute, he had built everything himself. He started out as a stage actor, then became the most handsome and famous movie star in the world, then decided he wanted to become a producer, and used his star power to produce some of the greatest films ever made, then decided to direct. His first film as a director, Ordinary People, won best picture and best director at the Academy Awards. Of course, he made a stone-cold classic right out of the gate.And now I was directing him in my first film. He knew how intimidating all of that could be, the “Robert Redford” of it all and, at every turn, he chose to disarm, to put you at ease. The first time I went to dinner with him, he sat down across from me and said: “What’s your story? Everyone has a story. I’d like to hear yours.” Nobody had ever asked me that question, before or since. It might be the kindest question I’ve ever been asked. So, we sat there and I told him about my life. Because he was curious, because he was interested.“I’m here as an actor,” he told me. “I’ll never look at the monitor. Just tell me what you need.” And he was true to his word. He was a generous performer, game to try anything with the other actors. He loved the craft of it, playing the scene, being part of a company. All he asked for on set was a chair and a copy of the New York Times. Every weekend, he would have me come to his apartment and go through the next week’s work. Just Robert Redford and me, talking about the movie we were making together, no big deal.We shot in Australia. He had never been there before. That blew my mind. I couldn’t conceive of a place he hadn’t been, an experience he hadn’t lived. And he loved it there. On his days off, he would go out and explore. “I went to the zoo yesterday,” he’d announce, proudly. We told him we knew, because his visit had been breathlessly covered by the media. They covered his every move throughout the city. Because he was Robert Redford, and Robert Redford coming to your country and doing anything was a big deal.He didn’t treat it that way, though. He knew that a random encounter for him would be a story the other person would tell for the rest of their lives. He was everything you wanted him to be, in an industry where so often that isn’t the case. They say you should never meet your heroes. They are wrong.View image in fullscreenJames Vanderbilt, Cate Blanchett and Robert Redford at a Truth film screening at the Cinema Society in New York.Photograph: Gregory Pace/ShutterstockOne last story. We were shooting his character’s introduction, and I explained to him I wanted to shoot him sitting in profile first, completely in silhouette, backlit so all we saw was the shape of his face. “Like Lincoln on the penny,” I said. “Great,” he said. Super-simple shot.We rolled film. “Action!” Bob sat there, then turned his face a fraction of an inch so the light spilled perfectly off it. I called cut. I told him I’d love to try one where he stays in silhouette. “Got it,” he said, “love that.” I called action. He turned his head again and caught the light. We did it four more times. Same thing every time. He kept apologising for it. I couldn’t figure it out. Our wonderful DP Mandy Walker finally did. “It’s muscle memory,” she whispered to me, smiling. “He’s been doing this for 50 years. He can’t not find his light.”I get to direct movies today because, for some reason, Robert Redford took a chance on me as a film-maker. But not just me. Hundreds of film-makers came through his Sundance Labs. Thousands more through his Sundance festivals. The impact he has had on film-making today is incalculable. He was a giant and his loss is tremendous. The gifts he leaves behind are not just his incredible performances, or the films he produced and directed, but his devotion to the legacy and the art of cinema. At every opportunity, he gave of himself to the art form he loved.For more than 60 years, in every facet of his career, Robert Redford could not help but move towards the light.‘We were locked up in a hotel for months. What a treat!’Lena Olin (Havana, 1990)View image in fullscreenRedford and Lena Olin in Havana.Photograph: THA/ShutterstockRedford was almost a fairytale figure. A dream cowboy of the sort I had imagined as a little girl that American men would be like.But Redford seemed to have the answers and the ambition to save us all. Ridiculously handsome, always so articulate and bright. Beneath that cool surface lay a volcano of emotions and desires.We spent six months together shooting Havana in the Dominican Republic at a time of political instability. That meant we were basically locked up together on the top floor of the hotel for months. What a treat!As an actor, he was extremely sweet and always wanted us to find other ways to tell the story, never sticking to the mainstream. As a king in Hollywood, he could have just sat on his throne but instead used that power to give new talent a chance through the Sundance institute.There was no one like Robert. I just don’t understand why I didn’t fall in love with him.‘I was a nobody. But he knew my name’F Murray Abraham (All the President’s Men, 1976)View image in fullscreenWith Dustin Hoffman in All the President’s Men.Photograph: Warner Bros/Kobal/ShutterstockThere were night shoots on that movie, and we gathered at the catering truck before the shot was set up. I didn’t have any stuff with Redford in the film, nor did the other two actors I was having coffee with, but he came over to us and said, “Hi, I’m Bob Redford”, to which I had to reply, “We know who you are”, and he said, “And I know who you are”, and he called us each by our first names. I was absolutely a nobody, so he must have learned the names only minutes before he met us, but what did that matter – it was a wonderful way to start that job. A long time ago, and still as fresh in my memory as yesterday.‘His smile made you feel like you’d won something.’Marianne Jean-Baptiste (Spy Game, 2001)When I accepted the role portraying Robert’s assistant, Gladys, in Spy Game, I don’t think it actually registered that all my scenes would be with this iconic actor who I’d grown up watching. My first day on set it suddenly dawned on me, and I turned into a bag of nerves. All I can remember is looking at him and seeing the titles of all his films rolling through my mind.Baptiste and Redford in Spy Game.Tony Scott introduced us and Robert warmly took my hand and told me how happy he was to be working with me. I think I mumbled a response – my mind totally blown. I needed to get a grip and remind myself that he was just an actor. But that annoying inner voice was screaming, “It’s the Sundance Kid! It’s Bob Woodward from All The President’s Men!” I was a mess!After we blocked the scene, he didn’t rush off to his dressing room. He quietly asked if I would mind going over lines with him and discussing our characters’ histories and relationships. I was stunned. I guess I thought he’d be aloof and star-like, but what I found was a warm, generous actor who was about the work. An actor on the hunt for the gems that would turn our small scenes into prized moments.View image in fullscreenRedford and Brad Pitt in Spy Game.Photograph: THA/ShutterstockI studied him – the way he conducted himself with the cast and crew alike; a consummate professional with a genuine, warm, and cheeky sense of humour. A beautiful human. His twinkling eyes lent encouragement and his smile made you feel like you’d won something.He was light. When it came to shooting our scenes, he kept them alive by always trying things and always seeking the particular. He was the type of actor who made you want to be better.When we shot our final scene, on the last take his character leans in and kisses me on the forehead. Tony screamed, “Cut! That was great.” Tony came to me afterwards and said: “That was beautiful. What were you thinking about?” On the spot I made up something like, “She’s worried because she knows he’s going to do something really dangerous.” But I was actually thinking: “My God, Robert Redford just kissed me.”‘He made clear his wariness regarding Hollywood cliches’Ralph Fiennes (Quiz Show, 1994)View image in fullscreenFiennes in Quiz Show.Photograph: United Artists/AllstarI was incredibly sad to learn of Robert Redford’s death.

I loved his droll sense of humour as he guided me through screen-acting skills and process.His maverick spirit was readily apparent and he made clear his wariness regarding Hollywood cliches and practice.I treasure my experience of working with him, which was also an introduction to a great film-maker with a true artistic vision of an American cinema that could be intelligent, original and politically provocative.He took me riding near his home in New Mexico. I’m no horseman, but he made me feel I could be. The film-making world is smaller without him.‘Failure and Robert Redford were not two things you put together’Richard Jenkins, The Company You Keep (2012)I first met Robert when I was an actor at the Sundance Institute screenwriters’ lab in the late 80s. It was a wonderful time. You’d workshop and shoot during the day and then, at night, there was a big plastic garbage can filled with beer and soda on ice and people would sit around and talk. There was also a screening room in a cabin where they’d show movies and the lead actor or the director of the movie would come and talk about it.It was like Camp Hollywood: no pretension, everyone staying in other people’s houses, just kind of jerry-rigged and hanging out in the mountains. Karl Malden was there, and Sydney Pollack. You knew you were a part of something special when you were doing it, which doesn’t happen very often.Robert would come and direct some of the scenes and, after about three days, once you’d got over the fact it was Robert Redford, he was just Bob. The idea of being special bothered him, because it would have meant he was alone. He wanted people to be themselves around him and he made that easy, which was much appreciated. I found him really easy to chat to.View image in fullscreenJenkins and Redford in The Company You Keep.Photograph: Sony Pictures Classics/Sportsphoto/AllstarIn about 1990, they announced they were going to start this little film festival. Bob said: “I just want these films that nobody was seeing to be shown somewhere.” It was always going to work. Failure and Robert Redford were not two things you put together.About 20 years later, I worked with him on The Company You Keep. As a director as well as an actor, he never hurried. His sets were very quiet and calm and gentle. He made the movie he wanted to make and played the scene the way he felt comfortable playing it. It was very cool to be around that.Actors know what it’s like not to be treated well and he wasn’t going to be one of those directors. I remember we were looping dialogue afterwards – which I don’t like doing: saying the line again and trying to match your lips to the footage. I did a take and Bob said: “I like that better than the original. And I liked the original.” It was such a nice thing to say.As a director, Bob took on stories that spoke to him and he felt needed to be made, rather than projects to make money. The Company You Keep is a movie about a world not a lot of people today are aware of, and there were a lot of people of the generation who remembered 60s radicalism and idealism who worked on it: Julie Christie, Susan Sarandon, Sam Elliott, Nick Nolte, Chris Cooper, Brendan Gleeson. Bob liked being around those folks.On the set of The Company You Keep, we spoke about that time back in Utah at the start of Sundance. He said: “Oh my gosh, you were there right at the beginning!” I said: “I know! That was something, wasn’t it?” It really was. You could tell he loved that time. Bob excitedly told me I had to come back to Sundance, so I did and was a mentor for a year there. And he was in every single day, just doing it.‘Beneath that suave surface, his passions always boiled’Lasse Hallström (An Unfinished Life, 2005)View image in fullscreenRedford in An Unfinished Life.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyIt’s worth remembering that Robert’s views of the world were also formed by his travels in Europe as a young man, painter and artist.I think he came back from those trips with a new view of America so, all his life, while he was caught up in his success as a leading man in Hollywood movies, his heart was always with true art, European taste, experimental film-making.With that came also a passion for truth and honesty, and a desire to protect what was genuine, natural, true nature, nature.He spoke so eloquently and coolly about those things, almost like a politician, but his passions always boiled in him, right underneath that suave and well-mannered surface.‘Robert seemed the last person who’d need to buy somebody for the night’Adrian Lyne (Indecent Proposal, 1993)Robert was really the only true film star who I’ve worked with. He’d walk on to the set and I wouldn’t be looking at him – I’d be speaking to someone else – and everything would go quiet. There would be a hush, and I’d know he’d arrived. They never went quiet about me, or anybody else I’ve worked with.He had an extraordinary presence and aura. It was an uncanny thing, really. He also walked better than anybody on Earth. I remember that very particularly. Very straight and very beautiful to watch. I’ve never seen anybody walk like that.View image in fullscreenDemi Moore and Robert Redford in Indecent Proposal.Photograph: David James/Paramount/Kobal/ShutterstockCasting him in that role in Indecent Proposal [as a businessman who offers Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore $1m to spend the night with her] was interesting, because Redford seemed to be the last person on earth you’d think would need to buy somebody for the night.We both thought the film posed a really interesting question: if you wouldn’t do it for a million, would you do it for two, or 10? What’s your price?Making the movie, I was very aware of his being a director as well as an actor, and of him watching me be a director. It was almost like a secret between us both. There’s one scene in the film in which he’s telling a story to Demi Moore about missed chances, which was based on something that happened to me on the tube in London when I was about 17.A girl was sitting opposite me on the train and I thought she was just lovely. When I looked at her, she turned away and, when she looked at me, I would turn away because I was shy. Then it was my stop: I got off, the doors shut and she looked at me and gave me this beautiful smile. I wanted to rip the doors open. I remember I went back to that station at the same time for the next 10 days in case I saw her.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The take I’d chosen should have ended right on his face, within his face almost, to coincide with when he speaks about the girl smiling at him from inside the train. But, for whatever reason, the camera assistant didn’t quite hit the end mark. Robert was watching it next to me and he was saying to himself, “Tighter, tighter, tighter, tighter!” and I went to him: “I know, I know, I know!” It was the best take but we both knew it didn’t go in quite tight enough.And I’ll always remember shooting the scene in which Robert was looking at Woody and Demi as they danced to The Nearness of You. I was on the camera and shooting little moments of Robert through the crowd dancing. Then he looked at me through the crowd and smiled.I think he saw the director’s agony, which you get when nothing’s going right – it was a sort of, “Shit, I know what you’re going through” sort of smile. He was seeing it from that perspective. It was the sweetest smile and I used that shot for him smiling at them in the scene. I’ll always treasure the way he looked at me through that crowd.‘It felt like a private, intimate masterclass’Danny Huston, The Conspirator (2010)For me, Robert Redford was a dream. I admired him not only as an iconic movie star, but as a political activist and a passionate champion of independent film.Working with Robert gave me a deep insight into how he approached his craft. We were shooting a courtroom scene and the assistant director had mistakenly placed the witnesses in the wrong order. I called on the wrong witness, and Redford immediately seized the opportunity. He said, “Let’s keep it that way – have your character realise mid-sentence that he’s addressing the wrong man.” That spontaneous adjustment brought levity and humour to the scene – something that wasn’t on the page. It was his special kind of magic, that extra nuance he so effortlessly delivered.View image in fullscreenRedford directs Danny Huston, James McAvoy and Kevin Kline in The Conspirator.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyFrom that point on, with each scene, I’d turn to him and ask, “How would you do it?” Without hesitation, he would act out the scene for me – with a twinkle in his eye. It felt like a private, intimate masterclass. His acting was invisible in the best sense: refined, precise, often laced with that quietly sarcastic wit. He was always searching for that light touch that made the drama feel more genuine and heartfelt. He would save his final jab, and it was always unexpected.For example, the way he delivered his last line in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, in response to Butch’s insistence they jump off the cliff to escape pursuit – “I can’t swim” – and then Butch’s reply: “The fall will probably kill ya”, before they both start to run to the edge. That will always break my heart.View image in fullscreenRedford with Paul Newman in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.Photograph: Photos 12/AlamyWhat moved me most about Robert was his unwavering stance for justice and loyalty. His creative partnership with Sydney Pollack produced some of the most thoughtful films of their time. As a director, he showed a deep understanding of the human condition. His dedication to Indigenous communities and environmental causes was not just admirable – it was unshakable. He was a man of rare beauty and grace. As an audience member, I’ve always considered him one of the greatest movie stars of his generation. And for me, he will always be the Sundance Kid.‘It was the privilege of a lifetime to get to spin stories beside him’David Lowery(The Old Man and the Gun, 2018)I don’t know where I’d be without Robert Redford. I still remember the day my mom told me about this film festival of his in the mountains of Utah, and the concept of independent film; I was nine or 10, already stubbornly independent, and everything he was doing up there sounded pretty great to me.View image in fullscreenSissy Spacek and Redford in The Old Man and the Gun.Photograph: Lifestyle pictures/AlamyCut to two decades later and, against all odds, I’m on set with Bob for the first time, pinching myself, wondering how I’d managed to wind up working with this legend. The answer is: I followed the path he laid out, for me and for countless other film-makers and artists over the years. He gave us all the confidence to tell stories on our own terms, as we saw fit. It was the privilege of a lifetime to get to spin a few of those yarns alongside him. He was a storyteller, through and through, and I can’t imagine there’s a better way to honour his life’s work than to keep on telling them – and making them count. Rest well, Bob. Thank you for everything.‘Always gracious, creatively egalitarian and generous in spirit’Delroy Lindo (The Last Castle, 2001)When I heard of Robert’s passing, I thought about the relative impermanence of our time on this planet, and the opportunities we have to impact our world while we’re here. Robert Redford’s time among us was clearly impactful.As a huge global movie star, but choosing to use his platform to promote social causes that were important to him; that spoke to a vision the man had, far exceeding his own personal sphere.View image in fullscreenDelroy Lindo in The Last Castle.Photograph: THA/ShutterstockI particularly respected that, as it’s not a given that people of influence and power will make those kinds of choices. In Redford’s case, though, it clearly represented a desire to have a far broader impact outside the entertainment industry, in his life and work.As a film-maker and storyteller, making in-depth investigations into our world, and culture; while simultaneously presenting his work engagingly, as broad-based entertainment. Films such as Ordinary People and Quiz Show are about very different subject matters; but both represent compelling explorations into human behaviours, illuminating the human condition as he saw it.We first met in the early 2000s, when I attended a film workshop at the Sundance Institute as an adviser. One project in particular was having some difficulty. He asked me what I thought the sources of those problems were, and I told him. Our subsequent conversation had nothing to do with his being a movie star; but rather, represented two creative workers striving to unlock and solve a specific set of creative challenges and problems. I engaged very directly with his innate, genuine creative impulse and aspiration.The trailer for The Last Castle.Wrapping the one scene we had together on The Last Castle, he offered: “Hey man, you’re a really nice actor.” A few years later, I reached out to him on behalf of an event I’d created to benefit aspiring Black scientists. He very readily contributed financing.I didn’t know him well. But, in the few interactions I shared with him over the years, he was always gracious; creatively egalitarian, and generous in spirit. I appreciated that.‘There was nothing easy about his tenacity and commitment’Elizabeth McGovern (Ordinary People, 1980)Robert Redford represents the sort of movie that is fast disappearing. The movie that grapples with the complexity of the human experience and, at the same time, is genuinely entertaining. He was a guy who could think and feel simultaneously, and make audiences do the same. But he made it seem fun and easy. You didn’t realise you were doing both until suddenly you were.With Ordinary People, you had a phenomenon in the sense that lots of people were reacting collectively to a story about one particular American family. Everything about his approach to the story was specific and detailed, and that’s what made it universal.View image in fullscreenRedford directing Elizabeth McGovern and Timothy Hutton in Ordinary People.Photograph: American Pictorial/THA/ShutterstockI had no way of knowing, at the time, that it wouldn’t last. This kind of film-making, that sort of person. Because he made it all seem so easy. And that’s how it felt being directed by him. Easy. I didn’t ever feel as if I was acting in any kind of big deal movie. I was just going bowling with Timothy Hutton. Easy.That was 43 years ago. Now I realise only too clearly there is nothing easy about the tenacity and commitment it takes to sustain the kind of work he did all of his life. It’s hard. He made movies that work. He did it over and over again. I miss that kind of film-making, that kind of person. I will miss you so much, Bob.‘My mom screamed and put him in a bear hug’Norman Reedus (The Conspirator, 2010)I heard the news about Robert’s death on a long motorcycle trip in Spain. I’d pulled over for gas and a coffee and read about it on my phone. I was super bummed because he was such a nice guy to work with. A creative force, of course, and an icon whose movies I grew up watching, but also just so much fun.I made a movie with him in which I played one of the men behind the killing of Abraham Lincoln. We were filming in Georgia and shot the scene in which my character is hanged. I was sitting with Robert as they were setting up the hanging of the next guy. I said to him: “You know, in real life, this criminal actually wet his pants on the gallows.”View image in fullscreenReedus and Redford on set.Photograph: Supplied imageHe looks at me and goes: “Really?” I went: “Yeah! I did a lot of research. And I told the actor who plays him he should probably do that, because that would impress you.” He looks at me and goes: “No. You didn’t.” And I go: “Yeah, I did.” And we both started cracking up. This poor guy was being hanged in front of us and we were laughing hysterically.I was supposed to ride a horse in the film and had told Robert straight that I didn’t know how to do that. He said: “Don’t worry, we’ve got a great team.” But every time my horse got near other horses it would start to trot backwards and go and stand ear to ear with the horse next to him. So I’d be giving a speech, trying to be all serious, and the horse would start walking backwards. It was totally humiliating. Take after take! Robert was yelling: “Can somebody handle Norman’s fucking horse?” I thought: I’m dead, he’s gonna fire me. But luckily he didn’t.The trailer for The Conspirator.We had the premiere at the Ford’s theater in Washington DC, where Lincoln was assassinated. I remember speaking to Robert in the first couple of rows in front of the stage. The movie was about to start and the lights going down and I just heard this shrieking from the back of the theatre. Then my mom – who I’d brought along with me – came running down the aisle towards us, like she was watching the Beatles or something. The whole theatre kind of stopped as she ran in and put Bob in a bear hug. She was screaming and he was looking over his shoulder at me like: “Help! Get her off me!” I held up my hands like: “Nothing I can do, sorry.”He was just that cool. It was so impressive to have been a heart-throb your entire life and successful in every area, as well as a philanthropist and the founder of Sundance, and also not have it go to your head.I loved how honest he was. He just vibrated at this level where he could see everything from every single direction and angle and everybody’s point of view, all at the same time. He oozed this level-headedness and knowledge of how the world works and what it all meant. Everybody else was sort of panicky around him, but he was always the coolest, calmest person in the room.View image in fullscreenRedford shooting The Conspirator.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyI was quite a new actor when I worked with him and nervous about a lot of things. He gently sort of pushed me to jump in and we also just really got along well, from the get-go. I have a ton of photos where we’re just talking and really into each other’s conversation.He was a guy’s guy who’d sit on the floor with you and talk. There was nothing pretentious about him. He never acted as if he were above you, just got down to your level and wanted to hear what you had to say. I really appreciated that.I lost my dad early, so if there’s a cool older guy that I can latch on to and who likes me then I really love them. I had that with Kris Kristofferson and Scott Wilson, too. There’s a certain calibre of person who’s very honest and cool that I gravitate towards. And I really gravitated towards Robert.‘He offered me kindness when I needed it most’Terrence Howard(The Company You Keep, 2012)View image in fullscreenTerrence Howard in The Company You Keep.Photograph: Voltage Picture/Kobal/ShutterstockRobert Redford gave the world more than extraordinary films. He gave us sanctuary. By founding Sundance [film festival], he created a refuge where independent voices could be heard, seen and honoured. Without Sundance’s sheltering light, many of us, myself included, would never have had the room to be recognised. That festival shaped the world that made my name possible, and for that gift alone, his legacy is forever woven into my life.But my connection to Robert goes deeper than the history books or headlines. We worked together only once, yet it was during one of the hardest emotional moments of my life. It’s difficult enough to hold your own opposite such an icon, but when you’re weighed down by personal turmoil, the challenge can feel impossible. What I found in Robert surprised me. He wasn’t just cool in the way so many of his characters had been. This wasn’t a role and he wasn’t performing. He became, in that moment, a friend and a mentor.Actors know there are rare bonds forged under the lights, between takes, in the fragile space where reality and movie magic meet. That day, Robert offered me steadiness, kindness and a sense of belief when I needed it most. It wasn’t grand, it wasn’t scripted, it was simply human. And it reminded me that the truest measure of a person is not the spotlight they stand in, but the quiet moments where they stand beside you.View image in fullscreenRedford in The Company You Keep.Photograph: Moviestore/ShutterstockRobert’s gift was never just his talent. It was his stewardship. He didn’t hoard praise or power, he used them to lift others. His films changed cinema, but his leadership changed culture. He showed us that artistry and integrity can share the same path, and that generosity itself can be a kind of courage.I will miss him: his candour, his warmth, and the steadying force of a man who believed in artists and audiences alike. Yet grief is its own kind of promise. The friendships he seeded, the moments he gave, the courage he shared, these will find us again. Until our paths cross in another lifetime, I’ll carry the memory of that bond with gratitude.‘I said: “I’m not obese.” He said: “We’ll put sweaters on you.”’Judd Hirsch (Ordinary People, 1980)I was shocked when I learned of Robert’s death. I never knew he got old. The last time I saw him was in about 2006 when he had an Ordinary People reunion. Six of us in one room: Timothy Hutton, Elizabeth McGovern, Mary Tyler Moore, Donald Sutherland, Robert and me. Three of them are now gone. Robert was a year younger than me and when I saw him then I thought, well, he ain’t ever gonna look as old as me, no matter what happens to him. But then I realised, no, he’s human.When he asked if I’d be interested in playing the psychiatrist in Ordinary People, he sent me the novel it was based on. The description of my character was an obese, fumbling man who couldn’t turn off the radio and had to look up his clients’ names. I said: “I’m not obese.” He said: “Don’t worry, we’ll just put some sweaters on you.”View image in fullscreenRedford directing Judd Hirsch in Ordinary People.Photograph: American Pictorial/THA/ShutterstockI wanted to give the character more flaws, so the viewer had a reason not to expect the kid [a bereaved and suicidal young man played by Timothy Hutton] to come back after the first session. I suggested smoking. He said: “No, no, no, no, no – that’s a cliche.” I said: “Look, I stopped smoking last year, but I think it’s the only thing I can do that will make the kid think: why did you do that?” He said OK, and so I did. I was very proud of that.He was very much an actor’s director and conscious of the obvious. I felt in one scene there was a way of dramatically enhancing a moment, almost as if to say: “Ah, you got it!” But Robert said: “You don’t have to say it like that. Just tell him.” That was the only direction we ever got: “Just tell him.”View image in fullscreenRedford with his best director Oscar for Ordinary People.Photograph: APMaking that film, Robert was not self-assured about anything. He said he really did not know how to do this from behind the camera. And he was mostly interested in the values of the characters and in telling the story in a way nobody else could.I felt a tremendous responsibility playing that part. I was always afraid that, if it was a little different from what he expected, I’d feel a failure. It was a special movie for him because it was about something he had thought about. When we had our first meeting, he said: “I’m going to have you say [to Hutton] that you are his friend.” I said: “But psychiatrists don’t do that, you’d get shut down for that.” And he said: “I don’t care. We gotta say it and we gotta mean it.” Two of his own kids had gone to therapy and he never, ever believed that it was any good.At that point, Robert had never won an Academy Award. Then Ordinary People won four, including best picture and best director. It was like magic. They threw everything at him in one bundle. He was totally surprised.Later on, he came to see me in a Broadway show. I was rather surprised, but it was a wonderful acknowledgment. He’d not only remembered me through doing the movie, but he also knew I wasn’t just a television actor. He came to the dressing room afterwards and we had a great discussion. He liked the play and what I did and it was sort of like he was saying: “I’m glad I chose you for the film.”View image in fullscreenRedford in All the President’s Men.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarWe don’t see people like Robert any more in the movie business. He was so honest about what he did as an actor, a director and a man interested in the politics of the nation. That honesty undercut what everybody might expect of this handsome star. I think people would’ve voted for him if he’d run for political office. I know I would.Explore more on these topicsRobert RedfordMarianne Jean-BaptisteRalph FiennesRichard JenkinsDanny HustonElizabeth McGovernFilm industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Almost 30 years since its first production, I can still recall the chill that came across Rae Smith’s snug set, hear the humorous sneer in the line “the Harp drinkers” and sense the despair beneath the banter.McPherson’s aptitude for atmosphere was later deployed in his Bob Dylan musicalGirl from the North Country, set during the Great Depression, and will be tested when he evokes the dystopian Panem foran immersive version of The Hunger Games. But first here is The Weir, back for another round, designed again by Smith and this time directed by McPherson in a revival of such exactness it appears effortless.The headline star is Brendan Gleesonbut The Weir is an ensemble: its characters are on different frequencies yet see each other for who they are. That goes for the locals as well as a stranger like Valerie, relocating from Dublin as a “blow-in” while literal gales whistle outside in Gregory Clarke’s sound design. Her arrival prompts a troubling exchange of tall tales, dreams, memories and confessions but McPherson judiciously uses humour to clear the air between them. Much like a weir, the effect is simultaneously of free flow and stillness.View image in fullscreenBarnstorming … Tom Vaughan-Lawlor, right, with Seán McGinley in The Weir.Photograph: Rich GilliganTo tell a story is to make yourself vulnerable. Each teller here has their own style but seeks reassurance from their listeners. With knotted brow, Gleeson’s Jack first unsteadily threads together a bit of local folklore but also gives the aching closer, aKrapp-like remembranceof romance unseized in youth that has dogged him daily since. It’s heightened by Gleeson’s age (he is 70, the character is written as in his 50s) and by coming at the end of a performance rich with quips (“That fella’d peel a banana in his pocket”) and perplexed grimaces (starting with a lovely bit of physical comedy with a bar tap).Finbar is altogether more of a raconteur. Tom Vaughan-Lawlor plays him as equal parts theatrical showman and school-class showoff in a caffeinated, barnstorming performance that you initially fear will overwhelm the others – but proves irresistible. Each line comes with a lick of the lips, a pointed finger or a boxer’s footwork, yet Vaughan-Lawlor keenly reveals Finbar’s insecurities and sense of absence.View image in fullscreenCool and bemused … Kate Phillips as Valerie.Photograph: Rich GilliganThen there’s Jim, played by the wonderful Seán McGinley, also significantly older than his character was envisioned by McPherson. His lengthy grave-digging tale is all the more compelling coming from this sleepy-seeming onlooker who elsewhere can raise a laugh with the briefest of utterances. (Much humour comes in the play’s pregnant pauses, too.)Cheers to The Weir! What makes Conor McPherson’s mysterious pub drama so mesmerising?Read moreThe only British actor in the cast is Kate Phillips, emphasising Valerie’s outsider status. She is coolly bemused by the men before delivering a painful account that shares unsettling similarities with the others: defenceless children, uncanny noises, altered states. Phillips makes clear that it’s a story Valerie is still getting used to telling, aware it will define her.Owen McDonnell harbours heaviness as barkeeper Brendan, keeping himself busy with routines that bring a comfort akin to Finbar superstitiously preparing the stock for banquets at his businesses. Weddings and funerals are all part of the talk but it’s tiny day-to-day kindnesses that define these lives in a room dimly lit by Mark Henderson to evoke personal isolation and the blanket darkness of rural night.You wouldn’t want to match them drink for drink but all five characters stay with you: it’s an endlessly rewarding evening that proves McPherson’s play is built to last.AtHarold Pinter theatre, London, until 6 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreConor McPhersonBrendan GleesonWest EndreviewsShareReuse this content"

The focus is on displaced minors, some of whom are German, others Slavic. There is talk of a third category of “special” children who were stolen by the Nazis as part of their campaign to create a breed of Aryan “pure bloods”. This, we hear, consisted of abducting mostly Slavic children and habilitating them into German families – if they met the “genetic” requirements.Young Thomas is among this category, his previous Polish identity having been erased. He was given a new name, mother, tongue and Bavarian home, but we meet him as he is torn from this second, adoptive family to become a temporary charge of Ruth (Juliet Stevenson), a UN relief worker working with the American forces to return the children to their original towns, villages and homes.When he turns up at her door in London 45 years later, demanding an explanation, Ruth takes the adult Thomas (Tom Wlaschiha) into her investigations of his family history in the direct aftermath of war.Stevenson gives a typically muscular performance, but it is Artie Wilkinson-Hunt, playing the young Thomas on press night, who well and truly steals the show. Under the direction of Stephen Daldry (who famously elicited a superb performance from Jamie Bellin Billy Elliot), he is an initially angry, mercurial and fearless force in the lives of Ruth and the GIs. Wilkinson-Hunt is an absolute whirlwind, baleful, melancholy and tender by turns. A star in the making, without a doubt.View image in fullscreenAn absolute whirlwind … Artie Wilkinson-Hunt, front, as young Thomas in The Land of the Living.Photograph: Manuel HarlanEverything seems lined up for a captivating production, from the strength of the cast to Miriam Buether’s original and intricate traverse set, which has a kitchen at one end, representing the present, and a bookcase and piano at the other, which takes us back to 1945. The ground in between is filled with scenes from the past, set beside the present as we travel into the mystery of Thomas’s heritage and displacement and his anger at Ruth.Yet the pace is too slow (almost three hours) and the characters around Ruth are generic, from the classically cocky Yanks to the oh-so-British aid workers. At one point, a group of aristocratic Germans enter, after the fall of the Third Reich, all dressed in black and seeming like cartoon villains.Earth Angel review – Alan Ayckbourn’s 91st play is a plea for decencyRead moreAnd there is so much plot that it does not leave enough space for you to feel the play’s big emotional jolts, despite the stupendous central performances. Buether’s set design is superb, but its middle span of empty space does not lend itself to emotional intimacies.Still, it is impressive as a production and resonant in its subject matter. The DPs of then equate to the asylum seekers and refugees of today. Those protesting at what they term the immigrant invasion may benefit from watching this play as a way of restoring their humanity.At theDorfman theatre, National Theatre, London, until 1 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreNational TheatreJuliet StevensonreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s told in retrospect by Michael, remembering the summer of 1936 spent with his mother and aunts in County Donegal, and draws on Brian Friel’s own early life. Yet what we see of the women at its centre resists the sentimentality of nostalgia, instead showing lives of survival, humour and wild, suppressed desires.Aspects of this duality are captured byElizabeth Newman’s production, her first as artistic director of Sheffield Theatres. The five unmarried Mundy sisters are sharply drawn, their interactions conveying the subtle, unspoken language of a lifetime together. Even when in the background, their faces each tell a shadow story – whether it’s the pained disapproval of schoolteacher Kate (Natalie Radmall-Quirke), the quick wit of joker Maggie (Siobhán O’Kelly), or the various thwarted yearnings of Agnes (Laura Pyper), Rose (Rachel O’Connell) and Chris (Martha Dunlea). Their familiarity is thrown into relief by the presence of older brother Jack (Frank Laverty), back after 25 years in Uganda and floundering.Francis O’Connor’s set design, meanwhile, has the tattered, impressionistic quality of memory. The flagstones of the Mundy cottage melt into the greenery of the surrounding countryside, blurring inside and outside, while the sky is a canvas of bright blue swirls of paint. It all has the heady mix of the vivid and faded that characterises our fragmentary visions of the past.View image in fullscreenQuick wit … Siobhán O’Kelly (centre) in Dancing at Lughnasa.Photograph: Johan PerssonBut adult Michael’s (Kwaku Fortune) long monologues pose a problem that Newman doesn’t entirely solve, slowing down the drama. His reminiscences feel slightly removed, lacking the raw emotion of the exchanges between the sisters and lending a portentous heaviness to the surrounding scenes. There’s a similar sluggishness to the episodes between Chris and her feckless sometime lover Gerry (Marcus Rutherford), whose relationship doesn’t fully convince.Then there’s the dancing of the title. The most striking moment of the play is when the sisters burst into ecstatic, fevered movement, whirling across the stage. This production left me craving more of that wild, joyful energy – the “wordless ceremony” that Michael remembers when he looks back at the lost time of his childhood.AtCrucible theatre, Sheffield, until 4 October.

On the other: a Steinway concert grand piano. Such juxtapositions are typical ofBold Tendencies, the groundbreaking arts organisation based in Peckham Multi-Storey car park, which programmes a wide array of performances in its concrete concert hall a few minutes’ walk from the vivid scruffiness of the south London high street and a busy railway line.Commissioned by Bold Tendencies, the world premiere of Garland,Oliver Leith’s large-scale “processional work”, fitted right into its world of equivocal, self-conscious semi-gentrification. Leith, the composer of the critically acclaimedLast Days, begins his hour-long piece with hymn-like piano chords and someone whistling a descant. Then the two tubas of an expanded12 Ensembleentered with a hefty bass pedal, cueing the first of many slow journeys across the stage travelled by a community choir, the Bold Chorus, and professional vocal ensemble Exaudi. Initially they smiled and chattered before standing to join the pseudo-hymn, their sound warm and wholehearted. Later, grim-faced, they trailed thin ropes of bells, blew through straws, spun whirly tubes, and dragged planks of wood and lengths of aluminium tubing. A couple of singers pushed supermarket trolleys full of glass bottles, shaking them as commanded by scores propped on the child seats.These beguiling sounds counterpointed the often voluptuous tone of 12 Ensemble’s strings – at close quarters and as the procession continued out of sight, behind the audience. One memorable passage felt like being in a bell tower as the changes are rung, the entire concrete structure made wildly, ecstatically resonant. There were also solos from sopranoPatricia Auchterlonie(often stunningly controlled crescendos and blistering releases of her laser-like upper register), a dramatised switch of onstage conductors fromJack SheentoNaomi Woo, and a horse steered reluctantly across the stage. On its second pass, it led off the singers, clattering away as the final chord echoed.Charlie Fox’s text was largely inaudible, its narrative lost. Instead, Garland was an extravagantly immersive staging of sound in motion.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicPeckhamreviewsShareReuse this content"

But she could also conjure up a dream world of her own that listeners would willingly follow her into. Her new album, Oh Snap, is a set of 12 originals and one cover that she created on her own over four years, before adding her band. She experimented for the first time with computer-generated sounds to draw on grungy pop and intimate folk music and expand on the classical-vocal education and extensive jazz input she acquired while living in France in the 2000s. Salvant says her enthusiasms as a visual artist also liberated her for this adventurous step-change.The opening I Am a Volcano is a diaphanous vocal that builds intensity against a drum loop, while Anything But Now – themed around procrastination – is a breezy jazz swinger featuring freewheeling pianist Sullivan Fortner. Take This Stone, featuring Salvant’s folksy harmonising with favourite fellow singers June McDoom and Kate Davis, is a standout – as isWhat Does Blue Mean to You, a brushes-cushioned, quietly conversational and then starkly soul-wailing epiphany inspired by Toni Morrison’s Beloved. The meditative, pandemic-induced Expanse, the playful Auto-Tuned electro-pop of A Little Bit More and theskipping, scampering synth-hooked title trackall show how ingeniously and fearlessly this remarkable artist can reinvent herself.Also out this monthDistant geography and other ventures have periodically silenced 2009 Mercury nomineesLed Bib, the unique UK band led by expat American drummer Mark Holub – but Hotel Pupik (Cuneiform) returns to strip the lineup down to just two saxes, bass and drums, and recaptures much of their original directness in the tracks such as the polyrhythmic, raw Iron Ore, and the ensemble spontaneity of the long, hypnotically bass-thundering title track. American bass starChristian McBridereconvenes his acclaimed big band for the star-packed Without Further Ado Vol 1 (Mack Avenue), hitching the outfit’s terrific scores to guest performances by Sting and Andy Summers, Dianne Reeves and Samara Joy.

The retro country influence rarely fuses with Hebden’s soporific synths and brain-scouring bursts of distortion: the aforementioned opener kicks off with a drone that wavers in intensity like the circling of a benevolent alien spacecraft, practically drowning out Tyler’s faithful rendition of Lovett’s soothingly lovely guitar work. ThenSpider Balladcombines pointillist synths with an insistent bassline, while the dreamlike Loretta Guides My Hands Through the Radio layers studio chatter and instrument tuning.Tyler’s guitar does return: melded with chimes on Timber, and on closer Secret City, a swirl of ethereal synths and meditative strumming. An attempt to resurrect the good old days and/or boys this is not, but Tyler and Hebden have managed to provide a fresh if slightly disjointed take on formative inspiration.Explore more on these topicsFour TetElectronic musicAmericanaCountryreviewsShareReuse this content"

But to judge from this impressive collection of five works by Schoenberg, all recorded at concerts in the Berlin Philharmonie between 2019 and last year, Kirill Petrenko is already exploring the composer far more thoroughly than any of his predecessors.Petrenko’s set does include some of Schoenberg’s best known works. There’s the string sextet Verklärte Nacht in its sumptuous string-orchestra expansion, and the Chamber Symphony No 1, thankfully not in the late orchestral version that blurs the acerbic textures and robs the instrumental writing of its muscularity, but in the original scoring for 15 solo instruments. And a superb account of the Violin Concerto, in which the soloist, Patricia Kopatchinskaja, turns what can sometimes seem a rather four-square, dutifully conventional piece into something constantly surprising, and the Variations for Orchestra, with each event vividly, fiercely characterised.View image in fullscreenBerliner Philharmoniker/Kirill Petrenko: Arnold Schoenberg.Photograph: BPHR/Peter HalleyBut there are already fine versions of all these works in the CD catalogue; it’s the recording of Die Jakobsleiter (Jacob’s Ladder), the first new version of the oratorio fragment in more than 20 years, that makes this release so compelling. Composed between 1915 and 1925, it was originally intended as the first half of a much larger work exploring spiritual transcendence in an earthly existence. But the project obsessed Schoenberg for much of his life, like his other great biblical epic, the opera Moses und Aron, he failed to complete the task, and it was left to one of his pupils, Winfried Zillig, to create a performing score out of what he had composed.But as Petrenko’s magnificent performance shows, the score contains some of Schoenberg’s most powerful and impressive music, composed at a time when he was moving away from free atonality towards his first 12-note scores, and often more dramatic and theatrical than anything in Moses und Aron. It helps that Petrenko has a first-rate octet of soloists, led by the baritone Wolfgang Koch as Gabriel, but the sense he believes in the quality of every bar is inescapable.Explore more on these topicsArnold SchoenbergClassical musicBerlin Philharmonicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

This crostata – a buttery, crumbly pastry filled with homemade blackberry and bay jam – would work well for both breakfast and an afternoon treat. You will have more jam than needed here, but if you’re going to the effort of making it yourself, it’s worth having a bit extra to enjoy on yoghurt or toast.Blackberry and bay crostataPrep5 minMacerate1 hr+Chill1 hrCook1 hr 30 minServes8-10For the jam600g blackberries300g caster sugarJuice of ½ lemon2 fresh bay leavesFor the pastry155g unsalted butter60g caster sugar1 egg, plus 2 egg yolks310g type 00 flour, or plain flour¼ tsp baking powder½ tsp fine sea saltMilk,for brushingStart with the jam. Put the blackberries, sugar and lemon juice in a large bowl and leave to macerate for at least an hour, and ideally three or four, until the berries turn syrupy and most of the sugar has dissolved.Put a small saucer in the freezer – you’ll use this later to test if the jam is done. Put the berry mix, including all the juices, in a large, wide saucepan, then add the bay leaves and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat, simmer for 10-12 minutes, then put a teaspoonful of the jam mix on the chilled saucer. Leave it to sit for two minutes, then push it with a fingertip: if it wrinkles a little, it’s done; if not, cook for a couple of minutes more and retest. Remove and discard the bay leaves, then pour the jam on to a shallow tray and leave to cool.To make the pastry, beat the butter and sugar until creamy. Whisk in the egg and egg yolks, then add the flour, baking powder and salt, and stir well to bring the mix together into a dough. Give it a quick knead, then divide in two, with one piece slightly larger than the other. Wrap both in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for an hour, or until firm.Roll out the larger piece of dough to about 2½cm wider than a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin, then lift into the tin and press evenly into the corners. Trim off any overhanging pastry, prick the base all over with a fork and fill with about 300g of the cooled jam.Roll out the other piece of dough, then, using a sharp knife or crimped cutter, cut it into eight strips. Arrange these neatly on top of the jam (ie, four in each direction) to create a lattice pattern, then trim off any overhanging edges. Brush the exposed pastry lightly with milk, then bake for 25-30 minutes, until nicely browned. Remove, leave to cool completely, then lift out of the tin.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotPastryItalian food and drinkFruitBakingPickling, fermenting and preservingSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"
