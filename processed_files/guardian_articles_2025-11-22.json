He denies it. Who’s telling the truth about Farage’s schooldays?Reform UK’s leader refuses to answer questions about his abusive behaviour, claiming there’s ‘no evidence’. We talk to victims and witnessesHenry Dyer,Daniel Boffeyand Mark BlacklockSat 22 Nov 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 22 Nov 2025 12.23 ESTShareNigel Farage has denied – albeit through a spokesperson – that he ever said anything racist or antisemitic when he was a teenager.The Guardian has spoken to 20 of his contemporaries while at Dulwich College in southLondonwho say otherwise – more than half of them on the record.So, who is telling the truth? That has become the crux of the row that has engulfed the leader ofReform UK.His spokesperson insists “there is no primary evidence. It’s one person’s word against another” and he has accused the Guardian of seeking to smear Farage.But here are a selection of the many voices who have claimed they were either victims of, or witnesses to, that kind of deeply offensive behaviour.1.Peter Ettedgui“[Farage] would sidle up to me and growl: ‘Hitler was right’ or ‘gas them’, sometimes adding a long hiss to simulate the sound of the gas showers […] I’d never experienced antisemitism growing up, so the first time that this vicious verbal abuse came out of Farage’s mouth was deeply shocking. But I wasn’t his only target. I’d hear him calling other students ‘Paki’ or ‘Wog’, and urging them to ‘go home’. I tried to ignore him, but it was humiliating. It was shaming. This kind of abuse cuts through to the core of your identity.”View image in fullscreenPeter Ettedgui said he wasn’t Farage’s only target. He would urge other students to ‘go home’.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images2.Anthony Butler“Peter Ettedgui’s recollections of Nigel Farage’s naked racism and antisemitism in his schooldays left me with a sense of deep regret. A contemporary and classmate of Farage, I clearly recall him relentlessly hectoring and bullying Ettedgui with shouts of “stupid yid” in the playground. Peter was a small, rather shy and sensitive boy, and Nigel was a physical coward who could easily have been silenced.“But I do not recall anyone doing so […] If he will accept it, I apologise wholeheartedly to Peter Ettedgui.”3.Jean-Pierre Lihou“[Farage] used to say things like, you know, ‘Jude’, to Peter, which is the German for Jew, in the way it was said in the 1930s, a long ‘u’ in a menacing way, you know? It’s pretty awful.“Farage used to say things like ‘Hitler was right’ and ‘gas em’, you know, that sort of thing. But he also used to sing this song, which I later discovered was based on George Formby’s Bless Them All.“He had a whole load of ‘lyrics’ on this which are pretty awful. I can remember it verbatim: ‘Gas em all, gas em all, into the chambers they crawl. We’ll gas all the paks, and we’ll gas all the yids, and we’ll gas all the coons and all their fucking kids.’”View image in fullscreenJean-Pierre Lihou said Farage used to say things like ‘Hitler was right’.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian4.Martin Rosell“[Farage] certainly made comments to the Jewish guy in that class, Peter Ettedgui […] Comments like, under his breath, sort of ‘Jew’ … and comments about how they ‘missed you’, that sort of thing. He was noticeably more of those times than the rest. He was known for it across the school.”Rosell is now the chair of the Liberal Democrats in Salisbury.5.Bob Jope, a former teacher“Yeah, to another boy. And because I was a young teacher then, it wasn’t my first year, but certainly very close to the beginning [of] my career, I wasn’t really able to handle such kind of sudden out-on-a-limb [incident]. Perhaps an older, wiser teacher. I might have intervened and discussed it or something, but I think I just snapped and said: “Right – out!” […] I think he [Farage] said ‘Shut up you Jew’ to Peter Ettedgui.”6.Andy Field“When I became a prefect, he [Farage] said: ‘I’ll show you how to do it.’ He took me for a walk up to the lower school playground, where all the children from about nine years old to 12 would be. And he singled out, completely at random, a kid of Asian extraction, and just put him in detention for no reason whatsoever. I was flabbergasted, absolutely stunned. I was just disgusted, really. No rhyme or reason, just purely based on the colour of his skin.”7.Mark Haward“He loved the sound of his own voice; he would come in usually chanting something. He always wanted to be listened to – I distinctly remember him coming in several times chanting ‘Oswald Ernald Mosley’ [the name of the far-right leader of the British Union of Fascists].”8.Dave Edmonds“I have a very strong memory of him using the W-word for what we now call people of Afro-Caribbean origin and the P-word for those of south Asian origin.“I don’t remember being on the receiving end of antisemitic remarks, though of course he made outrageous comments about the war. I don’t think Jews were his main racial preoccupation. He was generally obsessed, as he is now, with the erosion of Britishness.”9.Tim France“It was habitual, you know, it happened all the time. He would often be doing Nazi salutes and saying ‘Sieg heil’ and, you know, strutting around the classroom. He was a member of the cadet force, [so] often being in uniform. And, yeah, it might have been for shock value, partly, but I think, you know, clearly, he also is very rightwing politically.“He was saying really, really unpleasant things, really things that you just knew were wrong. You can’t really defend it as being a joke, or that he was too young to know any better. We were 18.”10.Nick Gordon Brown“What he would do was he would loudly and frequently support that National Front policy at the time for repatriation […] I always remember his words – he used to refer to as our ‘black and brown friends’ with that grin, with that tone of voice, that anyone who sees him on the TV now will be so used to […] that was a constant narrative.”11.Luke Gray“He was proud to be a racist at school. That was his shtick – he was the school pet racist. […] A nasty foul mouthed racist and happy and proud to say he was. No contrition at all, trying to pretend it’s just a joke. I’ve heard him say every racial slur you could possibly imagine.”12.A former pupil, from a minority ethnic background“I was very small in one of the junior classes of the time, and you know that the sixth-formers were probably 17, very tall, much taller than me. And that person’s walk, it’s the same walk he has now, I’ll never forget it.“He walked up to a pupil, flanked by two similarly tall mates, and spoke to anyone looking ‘different’. That included me on three occasions; asking me where I was from, and pointing away, saying: ‘That’s the way back’, to wherever you replied you were from.”13.A former pupil“What sticks in the memory most is not just his odious and prejudicial opinions towards black, Asian and minority ethnic students, but how central and public these views were to his whole school persona.“How brazenly and actively he identified with them, wearing them loud and proud as badges of honour.”14.A former pupil“I was in the CCF [combined cadet force] with him from 1979 to 1982 or so […] [Farage] did teach the younger members of the CCF the infamous ‘gas ’em all’ song, or at least led the singing of it on CCF coaches to training areas.”15.A former pupil“He was very strong-minded and had strong views about particular races. The word “yid” was frequently deployed, used about 50 times in a row.“I remember one particular thing he would do, a gesture, where he would put his left hand over his left eye and make a wanker sign with his right hand and chant ‘Moshe Dayan [an Israeli defence minister] is a wanker!’ Jews were regularly cited.”16.A former pupil“His behaviour towards cadets of ethnic background was no better than to those of Jewish religion. He held a cadet rank of sergeant or similar so was able to issue work/task details of his own devising. All pretty grim and pointless usually – guess which ethnicity or religion got the wrong end of his stick?”17.A former pupil“He was someone who always had slogans. He would repeat things ad nauseam. He would certainly say: ‘The National Front is the white man’s front.’ Whenever we watched a film in class and there was a black face he would say: ‘areyouEnglish?’”18.A former pupil“I remember him singing on occasions, leading those songs. I definitely heard him singing racist marching songs at various occasions. If it comes to it, I would happily stand up in court and say it. My overriding memory is just nasty little shit and a racist.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

This is how to save itPat YoungeA moment of peril demands a new approach – on everything from funding to the BBC charterPat Younge is the chair of the British Broadcasting ChallengeSat 22 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 22 Nov 2025 11.40 ESTShareWe have not been here before. The BBC is used to coming under pressure from political parties, well-funded pressure groups and powerful newspaper publishers. But thethreat of a lawsuitfrom the US president is unprecedented.This latest furore is dangerous because it comes at a time when democracy faces an information crisis. The foundations of informed democratic debate are under attack across the globe from a combination of AI-generated deepfakes, hostile state propaganda and algorithms that amplify divisions through social media. We have already seen how Elon Musk, the wealthiest man on the planet, is prepared to use his own social media platform, X,to interfere in the affairsof other countries and exert a chilling influence on democracies.The tech platforms through which most media and news content is distributed, discovered, consumed and shared – X, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Amazon Web Services and Prime Video, TikTok USA, YouTube and Google – are owned or controlled by six American billionaires who pursue self-interested agendas, aided by a litigious president intent on browbeating the media. In the US, the communications regulator has acted as an arm of the executive rather than defending free speech, and sycophantic media executives have caved in to politically motivatedlegal threats. Meanwhile, Trump has removedvirtually all fundingfrom public television andradio.0:53Donald Trump says he has 'obligation' to sue BBC in Fox News interview – videoIt could happen here. The BBC is our most effective defence against the dangers of global media power concentrated in the hands of a few private individuals, but we have very few obstacles to prevent a populist or authoritarian government from undermining it. This is a moment of peril that demands a new approach to governance and funding that secures the BBC’s future. We at theBritish Broadcasting Challengehave set out a number of proposals for achieving this.First, the government must grant theBBCa permanent charter that establishes it in perpetuity and enshrines its core principles of independence, public service and universality. To ensure proper accountability, an agreement with the culture secretary – renewable every 10 years – would set the parameters for BBC services and priorities in accordance with those core principles.Second, it should create a new BBC governance board whose members – crucially – should be appointed by an independent body, and be responsible for regulating the BBC’s editorial performance and setting its strategic direction. Its members would possess genuine areas of expertise, be truly representative of different regions of the UK, and would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and approval through the culture, media and sport select committee. This governance board would be separate from the BBC management board, which would be chaired by the director general, who would be responsible for day-to-day leadership and management.Third, the government must recommit to the fundamental principle of BBC universality. That means geographical universality, ensuring BBC services are free at the point of use throughout the UK, and universality of content, providing quality programmes across the board that reflect the lives of nations and regions throughout the country. The unifying nature of the BBC is more important than ever in an increasingly fragmented and polarised media world, particularly as premium content moves behind paywalls. The rich will always have the means to access quality news and content; the BBC guarantees that privilege as a right for everyone.It is therefore essential that the BBC continues to offer popular audience-pulling programmes, such as The Traitors, Match of the Day, Gavin and Stacey and natural history, alongside major national events, if it is to stay at the heart of public life. But it must also continue to offer content that the market does not deliver: programmes for minority and niche audiences, current affairs programmes in prime time, creative risks that promote the work of new talent in music, drama and the arts, and coverage of women’s and disabled sports.Fourth, the BBC must have a proper funding settlement that recognises the 30% cut in funding imposed over the past 15 years. At £3.35 a week, the licence fee is astonishing value for money, and the BBC still reaches95% of the adult populationeach month. But it also provides a guaranteed stream of investment in the UK creative economy, sustaining directly or indirectly more than 50,000 jobs, as well as giving young people the opportunity to learn transferable creative and technical skills.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As an AI worker on Amazon Mechanical Turk – a marketplace that allows companies to hire workers to perform tasks like entering data or matching an AI prompt with its output – Pawloski spends her time moderating and assessing the quality of AI-generated text, images and videos, as well as some factchecking.Roughly two years ago, while working from home at her dining room table, she took up a job designating tweets as racist or not. When she was presented with a tweet that read “Listen to that mooncricket sing”, she almost clicked on the “no” button before deciding to check the meaning of the word “mooncricket”, which, to her surprise, was a racial slur against Black Americans.“I sat there considering how many times I may have made the same mistake and not caught myself,” said Pawloski.The potential scale of her own errors and those of thousands of other workers like her made Pawloski spiral. How many others had unknowingly let offensive material slip by? Or worse, chosen to allow it?After years of witnessing the inner workings of AI models, Pawloski decided to no longer use generative AI products personally and tells her family to steer clear of them.“It’s an absolute no in my house,” said Pawloski, referring to how she doesn’t let her teenage daughter use tools likeChatGPT. And with the people she meets socially, she encourages them to ask AI about something they are very knowledgable in so they can spot its errors and understand for themselves how fallible the tech is. Pawloski said that every time she sees a menu of new tasks to choose from on the Mechanical Turk site, she asks herself if there is any way what she’s doing could be used to hurt people – many times, she says, the answer is yes.A statement fromAmazonsaid that workers can choose which tasks to complete at their discretion and review a task’s details before accepting it. Requesters set the specifics of any given task, such as allotted time, pay and instruction levels, according to Amazon.“Amazon Mechanical Turk is a marketplace that connects businesses and researchers, called requesters, with workers to complete online tasks, such as labeling images, answering surveys, transcribing text or reviewing AI outputs,” said Montana MacLachlan, an Amazon spokesperson.ChatGPT may be polite, but it’s not cooperating with youRead morePawloski isn’t alone. A dozenAI raters, workers who check an AI’s responses for accuracy and groundedness, told the Guardian that, after becoming aware of the way chatbots and image generators function and just how wrong their output can be, they have begun urging their friends and family not to use generative AI at all – or at least trying to educate their loved ones on using it cautiously. These trainers work on a range of AI models – Google’s Gemini, Elon Musk’s Grok, other popular models, and several smaller or lesser-known bots.One worker, an AI rater withGooglewho evaluates the responses generated by Google Search’s AI Overviews, said that she tries to use AI as sparingly as possible, if at all. The company’s approach to AI-generated responses to questions of health, in particular, gave her pause, she said, requesting anonymity for fear of professional reprisal. She said she observed her colleagues evaluating AI-generated responses to medical matters uncritically and was tasked with evaluating such questions herself, despite a lack of medical training.At home, she has forbidden her 10-year-old daughter from using chatbots. “She has to learn critical thinking skills first or she won’t be able to tell if the output is any good,” the rater said.“Ratings are just one of many aggregated data points that help us measure how well our systems are working, but do not directly impact our algorithms or models,” a statement from Google reads. “We also have a range of strong protections in place to surface high quality information across our products.”Bot watchers sound the alarmThese people are part of a global workforce of tens of thousands who help chatbots sound more human. When checking AI responses, they also try their best to ensure that a chatbot doesn’t spout inaccurate or harmful information.When the people who make AI seem trustworthy are those who trust it the least, however, experts believe it signals a much larger issue.“It shows there are probably incentives to ship and scale over slow, careful validation, and that the feedback raters give is getting ignored,” said Alex Mahadevan, director of MediaWise at Poynter, a media literacy program. “So this means when we see the final [version of the] chatbot, we can expect the same type of errors they’re experiencing. It does not bode well for a public that is increasingly going to LLMs for news and information.”AI workers said they distrust the models they work on because of a consistent emphasis on rapid turnaround time at the expense of quality. Brook Hansen, an AI worker on Amazon Mechanical Turk, explained that while she doesn’t mistrust generative AI as a concept, she also doesn’t trust the companies that develop and deploy these tools. For her, the biggest turning point was realizing how little support the people training these systems receive.“We’re expected to help make the model better, yet we’re often given vague or incomplete instructions, minimal training and unrealistic time limits to complete tasks,” said Hansen, who has been doing data work since 2010 and has had a part in training some of Silicon Valley’s most popular AI models. “If workers aren’t equipped with the information, resources and time we need, how can the outcomes possibly be safe, accurate or ethical? For me, that gap between what’s expected of us and what we’re actually given to do the job is a clear sign that companies are prioritizing speed and profit over responsibility and quality.”Dispensing false information in a confident tone, rather than offering no answer when none is readily available, is a major flaw of generative AI, experts say. An audit of the top 10 generative AI models including ChatGPT, Gemini and Meta’s AI by the media literacy non-profit NewsGuard revealed that the non-response rates of chatbots went down from 31% in August 2024 to 0% in August 2025. At the same time, the chatbots’ likelihood of repeating false informationalmost doubled from 18% to 35%, NewsGuard found. None of the companies responded to NewsGuard’s request for a comment at the time.“I wouldn’t trust any facts [the bot] offers up without checking them myself – it’s just not reliable,” said another Google AI rater, requesting anonymity due to a nondisclosure agreement she has signed with the contracting company. She warns people about using it and echoed another rater’s point about people with only cursory knowledge being tasked with medical questions and sensitive ethical ones, too. “This is not an ethical robot.

He was tasked with stumping the model – meaning he had to ask Google’s AI various questions that would expose its limitations or weaknesses. Having a degree in history, this worker asked the model historical questions for the task.“I asked it about the history of the Palestinian people, and it wouldn’t give me an answer no matter how I rephrased the question,” recalled this worker, requesting anonymity, having signed a nondisclosure agreement. “When I asked it about the history of Israel, it had no problems giving me a very extensive rundown. We reported it, but nobody seemed to care at Google.” When asked specifically about the situation the rater described, Google did not issue a statement.For this Google worker, the biggest concern with AI training is the feedback given to AI models by raters like him. “After having seen how bad the data is that goes into supposedly training the model, I knew there was absolutely no way it could ever be trained correctly like that,” he said. He used the term “garbage in, garbage out”, a principle in computer programming which explains that if you feed bad or incomplete data into a technical system, then the output would also have the same flaws.The rater avoids using generative AI and has also “advised every family member and friend of mine to not buy newer phones that have AI integrated in them, to resist automatic updates if possible that add AI integration, and to not tell AI anything personal”, he said.Fragile, not futuristicWhenever the topic of AI comes up in a social conversation, Hansen reminds people that AI is not magic – explaining the army of invisible workers behind it, the unreliability of the information and howenvironmentally damaging it is.“Once you’ve seen how these systems are cobbled together – the biases, the rushed timelines, the constant compromises – you stop seeing AI as futuristic and start seeing it as fragile,” said Adio Dinika, who studies the labor behind AI at the Distributed AI Research Institute, about people who work behind the scenes. “In my experience it’s always people who don’t understand AI who are enchanted by it.”The AI workers who spoke to the Guardian said they are taking it upon themselves to make better choices and create awareness around them, particularly emphasizing the idea that AI, in Hansen’s words, “is only as good as what’s put into it, and what’s put into it is not always the best information”. She and Pawloski gave a presentation in May at the Michigan Association of School Boards spring conference. In a room full of school board members and administrators from across the state, they spoke about the ethical and environmental impacts of artificial intelligence, hoping to spark a conversation.“Many attendees were shocked by what they learned, since most had never heard about the human labor or environmental footprint behind AI,” said Hansen. “Some were grateful for the insight, while others were defensive or frustrated, accusing us of being ‘doom and gloom’ about technology they saw as exciting and full of potential.”Pawloski compares AI ethics to that of the textile industry: when people didn’t know how cheap clothes were made, they were happy to find the best deal and save a few bucks. But as the stories of sweatshops started coming out, consumers had a choice and knew they should be asking questions. She believes it’s the same for AI.“Where does your data come from? Is this model built on copyright infringement? Were workers fairly compensated for their work?” she said. “We are just starting to ask those questions, so in most cases the general public does not have access to the truth, but just like the textile industry, if we keep asking and pushing, change is possible.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)AmazonGoogleChatGPTWorkers' rightsEthicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Things can easily go badly wrong, as Gordon Brown discovered when heabolished the 10p tax rate in 2007, or George Osborne when his 2012‘omnishambles’ budgetfell apart over pasties, and especially Kwasi Kwarteng, whosedisastrous mini-budgetof 2022 sent the Conservatives spiralling towards electoral defeat.Rachel Reeves appears to have come perilously close to the turmoil of previous budgets, and that’s before she has even delivered it.Veterans of the Blair government who have watched the chancellor at work behind the scenes say she has a calm, methodical approach, which compares favourably with the chaos that surrounded Brown in the buildup to his budgets, as KitKat wrappers and pages of speech drafts were strewn around the floor of No 11.Yet to the world outside, the run-up to this difficult secondLabourbudget has looked utterly chaotic. A plethora of policies has been floated, denied, debated and ditched over the long buildup to next Wednesday.And a carefully choreographed series of interviews and speeches from Reeves, setting out the bleak economic backdrop and paving the way for a manifesto-busting rate rise in income tax – to the dismay of many Labour MPs – gave way last week toyet another policy U-turn.The highly controversial plan – which would have marked the first rise in the basic rate since 1975 – has now been ditched, in favour of a menu of smaller revenue-raisers, includingextending the freeze on income tax thresholds, which the chancellor said in last year’s budget speech would “hurt working people”.View image in fullscreenReeves hoped she could win over sceptical bond markets, driving down the cost of borrowing.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesAsinvestors dumped government bonds last Fridayon the back of news that the income tax rise was off, fearing it meant Reeves was less committed to balancing the books, her allies insisted the change of heart was a result of wage growth leading to better than expected forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).But some with knowledge of the process cast doubt on that explanation. “I think they just changed their minds,” said one, pointing out that the essentials of the OBR’s judgment about the economy were already known weeks earlier.On the night the U-turn leaked, one senior cabinet minister told the Guardian it was because the politics did not stack up. Despite angry denials from Treasury officials, backbenchers said they believed Reeves had “bottled it”. It was another blow to the government’s already damaged reputation.It wasn’t meant to unfold this way. Reeves and her team had hoped that by taking decisive action to shore up the public finances and increase the financial cushion against her fiscal rules on 26 November, she could win over sceptical bond markets, driving down the cost of borrowing.At the same time, a slate of cost of living measures, likely to include cutting VAT on domestic fuel bills, would help to tackle inflation and open the way to more interest rate cuts from the Bank of England. Eventually, this would help to bring back the feelgood factor and point to a more positive 2026 for the economy.Could you do better than Reeves as chancellor? Play our interactive budget gameRead moreThis is still a possible economic outcome, on which Reeves and her team are pinning their hopes. Jonathan Portes, a former government economist, said: “If consumers and markets think, ‘She’s made the best of a bad job, and I personally will not be hit as badly as some of the more excitable headlines suggested,’ you could have a bounce.”However, weeks of corrosive uncertainty may have made it harder to convince the markets – and sceptical voters – that Reeves has the situation under control.And if she only increases her “headroom” against the rules to £15bn, from around £10bn in thespring statement, that may fall short of market expectations, risking a market wobble on the day.Unusually, even before the budget has been delivered, it has had a very bumpy ride. The chancellor first got wind of the OBR’s plan to downgrade its productivity forecasts in June, and decided to start rolling the pitch for what was to come.“The alternative strategy would’ve been not to say anything, hold your nerve. But when the forecasts are announced at the budget, they’d be dramatically down and market chaos would be unleashed. It could completely destroy the economy,” said a Treasury insider.By the time of the Labour conference in September, Reeves was aware the downgrade would leave her with a £21bn gap in her plans. Again, her team faced the choice of whether to prepare the ground for a manifesto breach.“Unless you bring people on a journey it makes things much harder to land,” one aide said. “If you drop any of that stuff from the clear blue sky you’d rightly be criticised.”In media interviews, Reeves confirmed she no longer stood by a pledge made last year not to raise taxes, saying “the world has changed” due to conflicts, US tariffs and borrowing costs.View image in fullscreenLiam Byrne says the pre-budget uncertainty had an economic cost.Photograph: House of CommonsLabour MPs began to get jittery, with speculation mounting that Starmer, already at risk of a leadership challenge after difficult local elections next May, could face one even sooner.Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of the business and trade select committee and a former Treasury minister, says the pre-budget uncertainty was not just politically damaging, but also had an economic cost.“We’ve just come off the road doing a week’s worth of road trips up and down the country with hundreds of businesses and there’s a really dark sense of pessimism there,” he said. “What is paralysing them – and it is paralysis – is tax uncertainty.”Over the following weeks, ministers and officials juggled various options for filling the fiscal gap, as well as paying for U-turns including on welfare, and increasing Reeves’s headroom. They worked up some plans for various tax rises, including raising the basic rate of income tax.At the same time, the political pressure on the chancellor was mounting. Lucy Powell, Labour’s deputy leader, spoke up for anxious MPs and party members when she said in an interview days before the U-turn there was“no question” the party should stick to its manifesto.Rachel Reeves sick of people ‘mansplaining’ how to be chancellorRead moreBut Jeremy Hunt, the Tory former chancellor who still exchanges texts with Reeves on a semi-regular basis, believes she could have pressed ahead with the plan if she had solid reasons.“Manifesto promises are obviously a very big deal but the next election is not until 2029. If it turns out to be the right thing then lots of people would be prepared to forgive them,” Hunt said. “The worry is that any breach will increase taxes and slow down growth.”Simon Case, the head of the civil service until a year ago, admits that officials had been concerned about whether Labour would be able to stick to its pledge even before it took power – but were not formally permitted to give advice during access talks.“In Whitehall we were very worried about the promises they made before the election on not raising taxes because we obviously knew the true state of the public finances that would face them on arrival,” he told the Guardian.Some in government – including senior figures inside the Treasury – believe that this budget has shown more clearly than ever that the system itself is flawed. Case is among those who believes it needs to change. “We talk about a few billion here or there, that’s going to be enormously politically significant, because it’s the difference between breaking the manifesto rather than accepting the fact the process is unsustainable,” he said.“Nobody is having the really big conversation: if we’re going to dramatically change the UK economy we need to be talking about how we spend hundreds of billions.”The former cabinet secretary believes that Reeves’s woes are deeper-rooted. “Some of this is to do with the current political situation, of course. But there are other long-running issues that just feel as if they’re getting harder and harder.“Our economic productivity is poor despite multiple governments’ efforts to fix it. There’s also great pressure to spend on public services because they’re not performing as we’d like. Every budget now for the next few years is going to be incredibly difficult.”View image in fullscreenSince putting the OBR and its chair, Richard Hughes, left, on a pedestal, Reeves and her team have found their dealings with it increasingly frustrating.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesThere have also been questions around the OBR. When Labour first came to power, the chancellor lavished praise on the watchdog, even legislating to ensure it would no longer be possible to present a major fiscal event without a forecast – as Liz Truss did with disastrous consequences.But since putting the watchdog and its chair, Richard Hughes, on a pedestal, Reeves and her team have found their dealings with it increasingly frustrating – a sentiment which has sometimes spilled out in public.She has openly questioned the timing ofthe productivity downgrade– which Labour believes should have happened earlier – and called for it to give Labour more credit for its pro-growth policies.She is expected to announce that next spring’s OBR forecast will only cover economic growth, not judge the fiscal rules, in a bid to avoid the twice-yearly circus of speculation about tax and spend. A more radical suggestion was to drop the spring forecast altogether, but Hughes made clear he was against that option.Treasury insiders say that Reeves’s strategy for the budget has not changed since July when she picked her three priorities: cutting NHS waiting lists, paying off the national debt and tackling the cost of living. They acknowledge she knew back then that there would be no return to austerity or more borrowing – meaning tax rises were the only route.“We’re being honest with the public that this is a tax-raising budget, but they obviously want to know if taxes are going up, what’s it going to do for me, what do they get in return,” said a Treasury source. “But once MPs see it in its totality they’ll see they have something to sell to the public.”View image in fullscreenJeremy Hunt: ‘Rachel Reeves has had a combination of bad luck and bad judgment.’Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA MediaMany MPs are still to be convinced. It is perhaps unsurprising that many feel that Starmer’s leadership, already weakened after theextraordinary Downing Street briefing campaignto shore him up before the budget spectacularly backfired, is hanging in the balance.John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, said: “Labour MPs are just desperate to avoid another disaster. We’ve had so many political mistakes. Everybody is hoping we don’t go through it again at the budget, that we get through it as quickly as possible and survive.“There’s such a sense of frustration. We’ve been waiting for a Labour government for years. If voters don’t see it helping them they won’t just withdraw their support from Labour, they’ll be angry, and that’s where Reform comes in.”Hunt said: “It’s fair to say the personal future of both PM and chancellor depends on the success, or otherwise, of the budget. Rachel Reeves has had a combination of bad luck and bad judgment.”Others fear that this budget is more significant than any fallout for individual politicians, however senior. “Yes, this budget is going to be critical to the fortunes of Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves, which are intertwined,” said Case.“But this budget is even higher stakes than that, because it raises the question of whether centre ground governments can answer the fundamental questions that are hampering the UK. And if they can’t, voters will look elsewhere. It’s a really pivotal moment”."

The scenery was static, solid, but everything else wasconstantly getting shaken up, bits flying in unpredictable directions. The crowd roared, commentators gibbered, the glitter never settled.Unlike the first day England were not batting at the start, though they were not long delayed. At which point a pattern quickly emerged, one that almost perfectly repeated that established on the previous day, while also being completely different. The bowler who was useless was good, the marginal, unconvincing snickometer-based review that was not out was now given. Some things were precisely the same (Australia’s tactics against England’s tail, how the tail reacted to Australia’s tactics) and, at the same time, completely the opposite (the outcome).Travis Head powers Australia to humbling Ashes Test win over England inside two daysRead moreIt is good, in these awkward, perplexing circumstances, to have at least one thing you can rely on and unfortunately for England that thing has been Zak Crawley. It was Australia who came into the game with questions over their opening partnership, questions they neatly if temporarily sidestepped by playing two opening partnerships. Neither of which was their chosen opening partnership and one of which contained the person who would win the match in a couple of hours of wildly incongruous, completely irresistible genius.But if Crawley’s awkward prod, Mitchell Starc’s brilliant leftwards dive, and the opener’s second duck of the game started England down another spiral – this one destined to be terminal – it was another single shot that really decided the game. The issue for England, the one that made this one impossible to recover from, was that this single shot was played three times by three players in the space of 10 minutes and six balls. The guts of their innings were spilled in a single repeated act of self-evisceration.View image in fullscreenOllie Pope looks to the heavens after throwing his bat at a ball and getting out – Harry Brook and Joe Root soon did the same.Photograph: Gary Day/APAfter the chaosof the opening dayand a bit, Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope gave themselves a couple of hours to remove the echoes of constantly crashing crockery from the game. They were only ever spinning plates. At lunch it was 59 for one: Pope was on 24 off 48, Duckett 28 off 37, England’s lead 99.One respected former Australia international, working the game as a television analyst, confidently predicted over his prandial curry that they were about to score “a million runs”. But those plates were already starting to wobble and eight balls after the interval the first one toppled.Scott Boland had been almost irredeemably useless on Friday, but was a different proposition with a different ball, his lengths reined back by a crucial few feet, and a few cracks starting to show in the surface. Belatedly, deservedly, he was rewarded. Duckett was squared up and deflected the ball to second slip, where Steve Smith took a fine low catch. Joe Root joined Pope, England’s lead 105.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Three balls into his next over Boland sent down a tempter to Pope, full and wide. Pope saw a ball that was there to be driven and threw his bat at it. He had done plenty of this already and it was more luck than judgment that had allowed him to survive his first 25 Boland deliveries. He would not make it to 27. Alex Carey, the wicketkeeper, stepped in front of first slip to take an easy catch.Then it happened again. Three balls later, Boland sent down a tempter to Harry Brook. Brook saw a ball that was there to be driven and threw his bat at it. This time it flew to Usman Khawaja at slip, whose reactions may have slowed but not by enough to fluff those.Then it happened again. Perhaps Brook had not seen Pope’s dismissal before he came out to bat. He could have been looking the other way, tying his shoelaces, in a quiet corner willing himself into the ideal mindspace for his brand of often brilliant, reckless batsmanship. Root, on the other hand, had, from the perfect vantage point at the other end, seen two teammates punished for responding to the same question with the same regrettable answer, had felt the ground shift, the match situation change, the pressure on his own shoulders swell.View image in fullscreenJoe Root looks back at his stumps after being bowled off an inside edge by Mitchell Starc.Photograph: Philip Brown/Getty ImagesStarc bowled, full and wide, a ball that was there to be driven. Instinct took over. The ball clipped his inside edge and crashed into his stumps. England led by 116. Largely thanks to some rapid late-innings runs from Gus Atkinson and Brydon Carse, less rescuing what had gone before than hinting at what was to come, they hauled that to 204. Not nearly enough, not when Travis Head is in this kind of mood.This is this England, a team that refuse on a point of principle ever to rein themselves in. Remorse just slips off them, like honey from an oiled spoon. It is a compulsion that makes them so compelling and so many of their Tests so entertaining. It might also have stopped them winning a few more of them.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26Australia cricket teamEngland cricket teamThe AshesCricketAustralia sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

I love to kickstart December with Advent calendars for all the family, so it seemed only fair to taste test this lot with them in tow. And, despite an age range spanning 60-plus years, we were all pretty much on the same page with our expectations: we were looking for a bit of variety behind the doors, some Christmas sparkle and a hint of nostalgia. Packaging that looked the part when displayed on our mantelpiece was also an important consideration.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Despite the obvious biases (the kids being attracted to the calendars aimed at them v the adults preferring the slightly more elegant offerings), the results were pretty consistent. We all loved the calendars where there was something extra: a picture behind a door or a foil barrier to break through, a variation in the chocolates and so forth. Ultimately, that just goes to show that we’re all big kids at heart – and that every day should start with a miniature chocolate treat.The best chocolate Advent calendarsBest overall:Hotel Chocolat milk chocolate Advent calendarView image in fullscreen£13.95 for 125g at Hotel Chocolat (£11.16/100g)£13.95 for 125g at Amazon★★★★★I love everything about this: it’s compact, stylish and the only one we tested with a message behind each door, which the nostalgist in me loved.

Most importantly, there is a full-size and different-flavouredBacichocolate behind each door. And while the overall price may seem more hefty than some, it works out as much better value for money per 100g of chocolate.

He said: “There wasn’t a long holiday that I took. I was working throughout the period and the tempo did increase.”‘Too little, too late’: damning report condemns UK’s Covid responseRead moreBut official activity logs appear to undermine evidence that Johnson gave under oath.The files suggest that Johnson did not conduct any official government business on 15, 16, 17 and 21 February. Instead, he appears to have spent time walking his jack russell dog, Dilyn, in Chevening’s 1,416 hectare (3,500 acre) grounds, riding a motorbike given to him by his now wife, Carrie, and hosting friends and family for lunches, dinners and overnight stays.Entries in the logs for 14 to 24 February make no reference to Johnson working on the Covid response, although he said he had discussed the virus on scheduled calls with other world leaders.The Covid inquiry this week concluded that the UK’s response to the virus was“too little, too late”and the introduction of a lockdown just a week earlier on 16 March could have saved more than 20,000 lives.It described February 2020 as a “lost month” and said the response to the virus was essentially halted during the half-term holidays. The report added that there was a “toxic and chaotic” culture in Downing Street under Johnson.It found there were no cabinet meetings between 14 and 25 February. Johnson was not briefed “to any significant extent” on the virus during this period and received no daily updates, its report concluded.It added: “Mr Johnson should have appreciated sooner that this was an emergency that required prime ministerial leadership to inject urgency into the response.”View image in fullscreenDisclosure logs indicate Johnson enjoyed an extended break at Chevening, a governmental estate in Kent, during February.Photograph: Johnny Green/PAThe details of Johnson’s activities are revealed in an official government document contained in the Boris Files, acache of leaked documents. The files have been seen by the Guardian after they were obtained by the transparency groupDistributed Denial of Secrets.On 21 February, as Johnson biked and walked around Chevening, the British government was briefed on a new cluster of 16 cases in northern Italy. Officials were told that seven patients were in intensive care and none had travelled to China, prompting fears that the virus could no longer be contained.On the same day, NHS England noted that “even with continued mitigation work” it could become “overwhelmed” before the virus peaked unless the government made “significant interventions to flatten the curve” but lockdown measures were not implemented in England for more than four weeks.Johnson was not briefed and the logs indicate he did not join any calls about the escalating situation in Europe. However, they show he enjoyed a four-hour dinner with Catherine Humphrey, a friend of his wife’s who would later be a witness at the couple’s wedding in May 2021.The inquiry, chaired by retired judge and crossbench peer Heather Hallett, said the Italian outbreak “should have prompted urgent planning” in the UK, including by devolved administrations. However, its report added: “Instead, the governments did not take the pandemic seriously enough until it was too late. February 2020 was a lost month.”The files indicate that Johnson carried out just two full days of work during his Chevening break, on 19 and 20 February. He held a 20 minute call with US president Donald Trump on 20 February, during which he said the virus and its origins were discussed. The logs say this was followed by a three-hour dinner with Henry Newman, Simone Finn and Josh Grimstone, former government officials understood to be close friends of his wife.On 18 February, Johnson worked for just 40 minutes, joining a call with Chinese president Xi Jinping, the documents suggest. Johnson told the inquiry that one purpose of the call was to “compare notes” on Covid.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lessons must be learned | EditorialRead moreHe missed a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee, which was convened to discuss Covid and was chaired by then health secretary, Matt Hancock.While Johnson entertained his late mother, Charlotte Johnson, and his now mother-in-law, Josephine McAfee, over lunch at Chevening, the government’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty told the Cobra meeting it was possible the Covid outbreak could escalate to a global pandemic.On 22 February, Johnson worked on his ministerial boxes for about 90 minutes before hosting family in his Downing Street flat and walking in St James’ Park as the Italian government prepared to put part of the country into lockdown after its first Covid death. Johnson then spent time shopping in Sevenoaks, before returning to Chevening.He travelled back to Downing Street on 23 February, after spending several hours on ministerial boxes. By this point, the UK had 13 confirmed cases of Covid.The government announced the first lockdown in England on 23 March. By this time, confirmed cases of the virus in the UK had reached 6,726 and there had been 336 deaths. Covid was listed on the death certificates of about 227,000 people between March 2020 and May 2023.Joe Hurst, the spokesperson for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, said the revelations in the Guardian are “horrific” and provide “further evidence that he [Johnson] wasn’t taking Covid seriously, that he was ignoring the warnings he was getting and putting himself ahead of the country at that time. It vindicates further the report that came out on Thursday.”He added: “It sounds like he has questions to answer about how truthful he was in front of the inquiry.”Hurst said the Guardian’s reporting was describing “gross misconduct in public office and a total abdication of his [Johnson’s] role and of his primary objective, as prime minister, of keeping people safe. That’s certainly how the families feel and that’s what the inquiry has said as well.“It will be devastating for the families to read, and horrific. It further vindicates the reasons they were calling for the inquiry in the first place.”Johnson declined to comment.Additional reporting by Donna FergusonQuick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Developing countries achieved part of their goal at the global talks, which was a tripling of the financial support available from rich countries to help them adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis. They should receive $120bn (£92bn) a year for adaptation, from the $300bn developed countries pledged to them last year, but not until 2035, instead of the 2030 deadline they were demanding. Many had also hoped the increase would be on top of the $300bn.‘The Amazon insisted on being heard’: seven key takeaways from Cop30Read moreA roadmap to the halting of deforestation was dropped from the final deal, a bitter disappointment for nature advocates at this “rainforest Cop” held in Belém, near the mouth of the Amazon River.The agreement among 194 countries – excluding the US, which did not send a delegation – was reached in the early morning after 12 hours of nonstop extra-time talks among ministers in deserted conference halls, and completed at a closing meeting at 1.35pm, after negotiations were hauled back from the brink of collapse on Friday evening.In the plenary, many country delegations, including Colombia, complained vociferously that they were not allowed to speak before the deal was gavelled through, despite Brazil having said this would be “Cop of truth”. The session was briefly paused but the Cop president, André Corrêa do Lago, then confirmed that the decisions that were gavelled through earlier had been adopted.Jennifer Morgan, the Cop veteran and former German climate envoy, said: “While far from what’s needed, the outcome in Belém is meaningful progress. The Paris agreement is working, the transition away from fossil fuels agreed in Dubai [at the Cop28 talks in 2023] is accelerating. Despite the efforts of major oil-producing states to slow down the green transition, multilateralism continues to support the interests of the whole world in tackling the climate crisis.”Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: “With an increasingly fractured geopolitical backdrop,Cop30gave us some baby steps in the right direction, but considering the scale of the climate crisis, it has failed to rise to the occasion. Despite calling themselves climate leaders, developed countries have betrayed vulnerable nations by failing to deliver science-aligned national emission reduction plans.”View image in fullscreenA drought-stricken village in Turkana, northern Kenya, in 2023, when climate breakdown caused the worst drought in the region’s history.Photograph: SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesAisha Humaira, Pakistan’s head of delegation, accused developed countries of hypocrisy: “Countries that have used all sources of energy in the last 200 years and have achieved the pinnacle of industrial growth and yet not stopped using all those sources of energy are telling us ‘stop growing,’” she said. “The right to growth and security is fundamental for every country.”Efforts to limit global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, in line with the goals of the Paris agreement, were also addressed in the final text, but less robustly than vulnerable countries had hoped. Before the conference, countries were supposed to present new national plans on cutting emissions, but they fell short of the commitments needed to maintain the 1.5C limit, which has already been breached but which analysts say could be returned to.Instead of censuring this failure, the conference agreed to set up an “accelerator” programme to address the shortfall in the nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which will report back at next year’s Cop, to be held in Turkey but presided over by Australia. The text exhorted countries to “full implementation of NDCs while striving to do better”.The final deal also recognised the “just transition” that social justice campaigners have been calling for, which means helping workers affected by the move away from fossil fuels and towards clean energy. But key provisions on the exploitation of “critical minerals” – which has been accompanied by soaring human rights abuses in some countries – were blocked by China and Russia.0:38Moment world secures compromise deal at Cop30 that sidesteps fossil fuels – videoInsiders said the talks came close to foundering on Friday, after a hectic few weeks in Brazil that began with a summit of world leaders held by Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and attended by about 50 heads or deputy heads of state.But after the leaders left and Cop30 formally began on Monday 10 November, discussions among ministers and high-ranking officials degenerated into a bitter standoff. A fire near the delegation offices on Thursday afternoon, in which no one was seriously hurt, forced evacuation of the conference centre and disrupted negotiations at a crucial stage.‘It’s like arguing with robots’: negotiators on the state of Cop30 talksRead moreWhen they resumed late on Thursday evening, the rift was clear: more than 80 countries had declared in favour of including a commitment to “transition away from fossil fuels” in the final outcome, but scores of countries – led by the Arab group, which includes Saudi Arabia – lined up against it.That opposition forced the relegation of the “transition away from fossil fuels” – that scientists say is essential to staving off the worst effects of climate breakdown – to a voluntary commitment rather than the legally binding decision many had hoped for.Teresa Anderson, the global lead on climate justice at ActionAid International, said: “A lack of climate finance is throwing a spanner in the works of climate progress. Global south countries, [which] are already carrying the costs of the climate crisis they have not caused, desperately need support from rich countries if they are to take on any more commitments. Nowhere was this more stark than on the issue of fossil fuels, where specific text once again ended up unfunded and on the cutting-room floor.”Nikki Reisch, from the Center for International Environmental Law, said: “This is an empty deal. Cop30 provides a stark reminder that the answers to the climate crisis do not lie inside the climate talks – they lie with the people and movements leading the way toward a just, equitable, fossil-free future.”Explore more on these topicsCop30Climate crisisBrazilClimate financeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

And 41% of those who backed Starmer for the leadership in 2020 said a new leader should be in place, with 40% wanting him to stay.Poll results showing how Labour members would vote in head-to-head contests between Keir Starmer and potential leadership rivalsThe poll exposed a rift among those who backed either candidate in the recent deputy leadership contest, with 69% of those who supported Lucy Powell calling for a new leader by the next election while 51% of Bridget Phillipson supporters want Starmer to remain as leader.Emma Burnell, the editor of LabourList, said: “Starmer’s team have made it clear that he would contest a leadership contest were one to arise. Of course, that was a week ago and we all know that’s a long time in politics.“It may well be that if it came to it Starmer would decide a contest in which he ran – and was possibly defeated – was too damaging to the party in the long term.”Should Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, take part in a leadership contest, he would defeat Starmer with the largest margin of any potential challenger – 26 percentage points, the research found. Burnham would need to return to Westminster as a Labour MP in order to be able to challenge for the party leadership.Rayner, the former deputy prime minister, would also defeat Starmer by a 19-point margin, polling 52% compared with 33% for the prime minister. Last weekend, allies of Rayner said she would seek to renew her public profile in the coming months andwould be likely to runin a future leadership contest.Streeting, the health secretary, would edge out Starmer by 33% to 31% but the result is within the margin of error and is effectively a dead heat.Both candidates would also have to win over the 36% of members who said they would be unsure who to back in such a contest. Earlier this month,Streeting denied leading a plotto overthrow the prime minister and called for those briefing against him to be sacked.Miliband, Labour leader from 2010 until his resignation in 2015, would lead Starmer by four points should a leadership contest take place, the poll found.Burnell added: “The two leading contenders to Starmer both face significant challenges. Rayner because it may be that not enough time has passed since she, very unfortunately, had to step down.“Burnham because he faces several hurdles to being able to run. If things move quickly, he may not be able to return to parliament in time to be a candidate. This might give Starmer and his team hope. If there is no obvious candidate that can beat him, he will feel much more secure in place.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsLabourAndy BurnhamEd MilibandAngela RaynerWes StreetingKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Acoustic music crooned from a speaker in a modest two-bedroom apartment in a suburb of Pennsylvania. “You are a queen,” murmured one of three friends in the room.Only Esau’s mother, Gabrielle Lopez, felt something was wrong. She was pushing hard, but her son would not be born. “Can you help [him] out?” she asked, as Esau crowned. “Baby is coming,” the friend replied. Four minutes later, Lopez asked again, “Can you grab [him]?” Another friend murmured, “Baby is safe.” Six minutes passed. Again, Lopez asked, “Can you grab [him]?”Lopez could not see the cord wrapped around her son’s neck, nor the bubbles blowing from his mouth. She did not know that his shoulder was grinding against her pubic bone, like a tire spinning on gravel. But “deep down”, she says, “I knew he was stuck.”Esau was experiencing shoulder dystocia, meaning his head was born, but his body did not follow. Midwives and obstetricians are trained in how to resolve this complication, which occurs in up to 1% of births, but as Lopez was freebirthing, meaning giving birth without any medical providers present, no one in the room understood that, with every minute that passed, Esau was sustaining an irreversible brain injury. In a birth attended by a trained professional, a five-minute delay between a baby’s head and body emerging would be an emergency. Seventeen minutes is unthinkable.Nobody joins a cult willingly. You think you’re joining a great movementWith a superhuman effort, Lopez bore down, and Esau was born at 10pm on 9 October 2022. He was limp and floppy and lifeless. His body was white and his legs were purple, both signs of acute oxygen deprivation. The only noise he made was a faint gurgle. His father Rolando handed Esau to his mother. “Do you think he needs air?” she asked. “He’s good,” her friend replied. Lopez cradled her unmoving son, her eyes huge.Everyone in the room was scared now, but hiding it. To articulate what they were all feeling seemed huge, like a betrayal of Lopez and her ability to bring Esau into the world, but also of something greater: of birth itself. As the minutes crawled by, and Esau didn’t stir, Lopez and her three friends reminded themselves of what their mentor, the founder of the Free Birth Society, Emilee Saldaya, had taught them: birth is safe. Trust the process.So they tamped down their rising panic and waited. “It felt,” recalls Lopez’s friend, “that we entered some sort of time warp.”Lopez had met her three friends through the Free Birth Society (FBS), a business that promotes freebirth. Unlike home birth – birth at home with a midwife in attendance – freebirth means giving birth without any medical support. FBS promotes a version widely seen as extreme, even among freebirth advocates: it is anti-ultrasound, which it falsely claims harms babies, downplays serious medical conditions and promotes wild pregnancy, meaning pregnancy without any prenatal care.FBS was founded by ex-doula Emilee Saldaya, and most women find it through its podcast, which has been downloaded 5m times, its Instagram account, which has 132,000 followers, its YouTube, with nearly 25m views, or its bestselling The Complete Guide to Freebirth, a video course co-created by Saldaya with fellow ex-doula Yolande Norris-Clark, available for download from FBS’s slick website. Analysis of FBS’s financial records by Stacey Ferris, a forensic accountant and academic at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, suggests it has generated revenues exceeding $13m since 2018.When Lopez discovered the podcast she was hooked, listening to an episode almost every day. For $299, she joined FBS’s paid-for, private online community, the Lighthouse, where she met the three friends in the room when Esau was born. To prepare for her freebirth, she purchased The Complete Guide to Freebirth in May 2022 for $399 – a vast sum to the then 23-year-old nanny.After consuming hundreds of hours of FBS materials, Lopez grew convinced freebirthing was the safest way to deliver her unborn child, away from unnecessary medical interventions. Earlier in her three-day labor, Lopez had visited her local hospital for an ultrasound as the baby wasn’t moving as much as usual. Staff urged her to stay, warning she was at high risk of shoulder dystocia, as the baby was “huge”. But Lopez wasn’t concerned. Fresh in her memory was a newsletter she’d received from Norris-Clark, stating fears of shoulder dystocia were “greatly exaggerated”. From The Complete Guide to Freebirth, Lopez had learned that women’s “bodies do not grow babies that we cannot birth”.View image in fullscreen‘The small gains are huge for us’: Gabrielle Lopez with son Esau.Photograph: Hannah Yoon/The GuardianAfter a few minutes, with Esau still not breathing, the spell in Lopez’s bedroom broke. Lopez sprang into action, instinctively performing CPR on her son as her friend Googled how to do it, while another dialled 911. After being resuscitated by paramedics, Esau was taken to pediatric intensive care, where he stayed for 21 days. He sufferedhypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, a brain injury caused by oxygen deprivation.Now three, Esau is severely disabled and fed through a tube. “He is a sweet, sensitive boy,” Lopez says. “He wants to do things like other children, but gets frustrated that his body won’t let him.” Esau loves Ms Rachel, Sesame Street and watching his parents blow bubbles. When he learned how to turn the page of a picturebook, Lopez was overjoyed: “The small gains are huge for us.”Looking back at the person she was when she was pregnant, it’s sometimes hard for Lopez to recognise herself. Over the faint roar of a nearby highway, as Esau plays with his toys, Lopez tries to explain how she got caught up in FBS. “Nobody joins a cult willingly,” she says. “You think you’re joining a great movement.”Dressed in a flowing white robe, Saldaya wore a gold crown, shaped to resemble the rays of the sun. Her most loyal followers sat around her in a circle in a shaded meadow. It was June 2021. One hundred women had gathered for the first annual Matriarch Rising, a female-only festival held on Saldaya’s 53-acre plot in the Blue Ridge mountains of North Carolina. “All of these women,” remembers Serendipiti Day, 34, a former FBS employee, “were gathered around her with their notebooks, taking down every single word.”By 2021, Saldaya was the apex influencer of the freebirth world. The image of her, half-naked, in her crown, posing in a meadow, would go on to become a core part of FBS’s marketing materials. “I def think I own freebirth,” she texted another freelance employee.Saldaya presided over a movement that told women it was returning something sacred that had been stolen from them. “We are truly disrupting the conditioning of over a hundred years of obstetric violence,” Saldaya declared, describing herself,in a promotional YouTube video, as a “pioneer of the birth liberation movement”.View image in fullscreenEmilee Saldaya, founder of the Free Birth Society, in her crown, alongside other images from the FBS website.Photograph: freebirthsociety.comEmails flooded into FBS from women who had experienced life-affirming unassisted births. Many had previously had traumatic births in hospital. The obstetrician-gynecologist who delivered writer and birth worker Kaitlin Pearl Coghill’s second child in 2015 performed a membrane sweep, an internal procedure to induce labor, without her consent. He subsequently lost his license for having a sexual relationship with a patient. “He was a creep,” says Coghill, 36, who lives in southern California, of her doctor, “and he was abusive, and it definitely felt like sexual assault.”After discovering FBS, in 2020 Coghill freebirthed her third child in a joyous four-hour labor. “It changed my life,” Coghill says. “I’d never felt so much power in my body.”Soo Downe, a British midwife and professor at the University of Lancashire, says the prevalence of freebirthing, while low, appears to be increasing across the world as women lose trust in professional maternity services. It is a dynamic that is especially acute inthe US, which has one of the highest maternal mortality rates among wealthy countries in the world. Experts point to a number of factors: lack of access to midwife-led care, an overly interventionist approach driven by fear of litigation and a desire, among healthcare providers, to maximize profit. A lack of universal healthcare means some women have to pay for home birth midwives.There is also a more medicalized approach to birth than in other developed countries with strong cultures of midwifery. “I have seen episiotomies [a cut to widen the vaginal opening] done without consent,” says Ivy Joeva, a doula from the city of Ventura. “There’s a doctor in LA that’s referred to as ‘the butcher’ because she just [C]-sections people,” Joeva says. “Needed or not.”Hermine Hayes-Klein, an attorney based in Oregon who specialises in maternity law, says she talks to mothers who are “suicidal” following births. “The women I know who have chosen to give birth unassisted, it’s often because they have horrific trauma from that first birth that they feel they barely survived,” she says. “Things were done to them without their consent, they were injured as a result – sometimes seriously injured – and they believe it will happen again if they go back into a hospital.”To these women, FBS showed another way was possible. It launched in 2017, the year before Instagram reached 1bn users, and Saldaya was among the first wave of entrepreneurs to harness the power of social media, transfixing women with images of mothers serenely holding babies they’d successfully freebirthed at home. Next, women binged the podcast. Episodes usually featured Saldaya interviewing women about their previous, traumatic births, which were “sabotaged” by doctors and midwives. Saldaya raged about the abuse she’d seen: the babies killed by drug overdoses, the women sexually assaulted by doctors, the midwives who promised to protect their clients, only to betray them.What’s crazy is no one had a gun to my head. I was doing the brainwashingHer guests, many of whom found freebirth through the podcast itself, went on to share their birth stories. These were often multi-day epics, in which the women were pushed to their physical and mental limits, before emerging triumphant, self-doubt shed like snake skin, a new, heroic identity as a freebirthing mother forged.Saldaya and Norris-Clark promised their followers they, too, could experience the euphoria of unassisted birth, if they dropped their reliance on a medical establishment that often gets it wrong on women’s health. This message resonated with thoughtful, health-conscious women who did not like much of what they saw in contemporary culture – the reliance on pharmaceuticals and junk food, or what they perceived to be an excessive reaction to the Covid pandemic – and were willing to make difficult choices, for the benefit of their families. Instead of putting their trust in a failing system, women would place their trust inthemselves. If a healthy mother went into labor, FBS taught, a healthy mother and a healthy baby would come out. Together, Saldaya and Norris-Clark codified an approach to freebirth that taught most birth complications were simply a “variation of normal”.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenEmilee Saldaya in a MatriBirth Midwifery Institute video. Photographs: MatriBirth Midwifery InstituteFreebirthing was not just safe, they argued, butsaferthan a birth with medical support. Saldaya and Norris-Clark decreed that prolonged rupture of membranes, breech babies, week-long labors and gestational diabetes could all be variations of normal, and usually nothing for the freebirthing mother to worry about. (All are known to increase the risk to mothers and babies during birth.) According to experts, the pair also made false or dangerous claims about hemorrhage, shoulder dystocia, retained placenta and infant resuscitation.Norris-Clark and Saldaya were sometimes careful to caveat their advice with disclaimers, stressing they were not qualified medical professionals and drawing only on their personal experience. They acknowledged there were scenarios that could be life-threatening, though presented them as very rare, and said it was a woman’s choice how to have her baby and whether to transfer to hospital. Yet they spoke with such confidence and apparent credibility that many women trusted information they only later discovered was medically unsound. In the Lighthouse forum in August 2022, a mother posted that her premature baby, who had required “an hour of mouth to mouth” resuscitation, was now struggling to breathe on her own. A medical professional is likely to have urged the mother to take the child to a hospital or dial 911. In her reply, Saldaya acknowledged she was not there, but said “all sounds totally normal … shallow breaths and gurgling wouldn’t personally concern me.”MotherHad a baby 2 days shy of 36 weeks. She is having trouble breathing on her own, any suggestions on what to do?Saldayahow many days is she now? What’s the breathing like? How do you know she’s struggling? Dark room, naked, skin to skin. Can she swallow? Is she peeing and pooping?MotherWe just had her 3 hours ago. Had to give mouth to mouth to get her to start breathing. It’s just very shallow breaths and she has been kind of gurgling. She is skin to skin with dad. She hasn’t peed yet but she did have meconium when she came out. Haven’t had a chance to nurse because of her not breathing great.MotherIt took like an hour of mouth to mouth to get her to start breathing.SaldayaI’d have her skin to skin entirely uninterrupted with you, no one else. Full naked, no bra. That all sounds totally normal, but I’m obvi not there nor seeing videos. Shallow breathing and gurgling wouldn’t personally concern me. She needs to be on your bare breasts to follow nursing instincts.When she got pregnant that same year, Nicole Garrison, 34, an artist from New Jersey, thought she’d give birth in a birth center, or perhaps at home with a midwife. She began Googling and came across FBS. “As soon as I heard Emilee talking,” Garrison says, “I was like, oh my goodness, this is my tribe.” She listened to around 30 podcasts, sometimes taking notes.Garrison sits cross-legged on the floor of her immaculate cottage, flicking through the journals she kept at the time. “I can literally feel my stomach churning reading this,” she says, in a deep, soft voice.On 4 February 2023, she listened to an FBS podcast and wrote: “Processing fears. What would happen if my baby died? What would happen if I died? … I would take full responsibility.” On 4 April 2023: “Radical responsibility is the way … for the safety of me and baby.”View image in fullscreen‘I was like, oh my goodness, this is my tribe.’: Nicole Garrison with daughter.Photograph: Hannah Yoon/The GuardianRadical responsibility is the closest thing FBS has to a doctrine. Saldaya took the term from a self-help book aimed at CEOs and business leaders,The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership.In FBS, to take radical responsibility means that a freebirthing mother assumes complete responsibility for all the outcomes of her birth, including her own death or that of her child. No one is coming to save her, nor does she want them to. She is fully autonomous or, in FBS parlance,sovereign.“What’s crazy,” Garrison says, “is no one had a gun to my head. I was doing the brainwashing.”Her water broke on 3 July 2023. Seven days later her daughter was born “pink and perfect”, but Garrison began to hemorrhage. Her then-partner called an ambulance, but Garrison sent it away: FBS teaches that hemorrhage “is almost unheard of” in a freebirth. In reality, while severe bleeding is rare, without medical care women can bleed to death in 15 minutes.After the paramedics left, Garrison passed out. When she woke up she was choking on her vomit. “I came back from a place of complete abyss, black, separation from everyone, from God himself. I know I was dying.” Her partner called 911 again. At the hospital, doctors gave her a blood transfusion and removed her placenta.Garrison had lied to her family about her plans to freebirth. In the hospital, when she saw the devastation on their faces, Garrison began to realize “something is wrong with the women running these programs. That house of cards I had built came tumbling down.”Like so many of the businesses – and ideologies – that thrive on social media, FBS cultivates a sanitized image of the product it promotes. Saldaya never hosts podcast guests who regret their decision to freebirth. And she routinely deletes negative comments on Instagram, such as the one posted earlier this year by a mother who lost her daughter: “My baby died 41 weeks stillborn after I followed your teachings and I will regret it for the rest of my life.” (The mother was also blocked.)The first woman known to have lost her baby after following Saldaya’s advice was Lorren Holliday. When she got pregnant in 2018, she interviewed midwives, but couldn’t afford the $5,000 downpayment for their services. Reluctantly, she resigned herself to the hospital, until, scrolling through Instagram one day, she found FBS: “What they offered was exactly what I was looking for.” A friendly animal lover with short pink hair, Holliday lives in a trailer on an acre of land in the Arizona desert with her husband, Chris, their three barefoot children and 35 dogs, cats, ducks, goats, chickens and turkeys. “I wanted health. I wanted natural.”She began bingeing the podcast and joined Saldaya’s FBS Facebook group. A freebirth, Holliday believed, would give her baby the most gentle start to life.Holliday was in her Airstream caravan when her contractions began on 1 October 2018. She was 41 weeks pregnant. By day three she realised they “weren’t spread out any more. It was like one long contraction.” Holliday began messaging Saldaya for advice. “The pain is unbearable … I just want to know if I’m not progressing,” she wrote on 4 October. She said she’d been vomiting, and explained a pattern of contractions that would have rung alarm bells for a medical professional. Saldaya said the pain was not unbearable – thinking of it that way “is a dead end – or a path to hospital birth”. She added, “You’ll have to die 1000 deaths and let go of everything that you think you can’t do.”View image in fullscreen‘I wanted health. I wanted natural’: Lorren Holliday with her family.Photograph: Adriana Zehbrauskas/The GuardianOver the next two days, Holliday would tell Saldaya she was swollen, in excruciating pain, her water was “brownish” and she was “pouring colored fluids”. She also reported foul-smelling amniotic fluids, a possible sign of infection, and sent a photo showing what was possibly meconium, a baby’s first stool. In a hospital, staff recommend fetal monitoring to assess the baby’s heartbeat, as meconium can cause respiratory distress.“It doesn’t even look like meconium to me,” Saldaya replied. “All looks well and healthy. Ride those waves sister, you babies [sic] coming! All is well.”At the same time, Holliday was posting in the FBS Facebook group. “I remember typing,” says midwife Ranee LaPointe, a member of the group, “‘please go to the hospital.’ And as quickly as I would type it, it would get taken down.” Administrators told LaPointe that talk of hospitals was against the group’s rules.On the evening of 6 October 2018, after six days of active labor – unheard of in a medically managed birth – Holliday sent Saldaya a photograph of luminous green meconium. The following day, Saldaya asked for an update. Holliday said the baby wasn’t moving much and she hadn’t been able to urinate for 24 hours. Saldaya said she would go to hospital at this point, but suggested she may want to lie to doctors about when her water broke. She sent her a script to deceive medics.SaldayaSome women fudge the date and when their waters openSaldayaIf you go in and say it’s been open for 24+hours they will c Section immediatelyHollidayGood…I think Im going to go in…i feel terrible about it… but i don’t want to let me pride hurt this baby…yeah im not going to tell the whole truth for sure…oh wow… should i say 12 hours?Saldaya[Tell doctors] “I recently began labor and my water opened this morning but it has a bad smell and I thought it best to come in and get a NST [non stress test] and catheter and go from there. I’m not sure I want to be admitted yet, just want help getting a sense of what is going on.”At the hospital, Holliday learned her daughter was dead. Journey Moon had dark hair like her father. Holliday doesn’t know what color her eyes would have been, but she likes to imagine they were blue.After Journey Moon died, the Daily Beast reported on the case. At Saldaya’s request, Holliday lied to the journalist, saying Saldaya didn’t advise her during her birth, and Saldaya said she’d provided no advice. “We tweaked,” Holliday says bitterly, “that little interview.”Both Saldaya and Holliday received hate mail after the article was published. “I wanted the best for Journey Moon,” Holliday says of her decision to freebirth. “That’s why I stuck it out so long, to give her the best birth possible. When people started calling me selfish and greedy, that killed me, because I did it for her.”View image in fullscreenLorren Holliday holding the ashes of the baby she lost.Photograph: Adriana Zehbrauskas/The GuardianSaldaya closed down the Facebook group and set up a paid-for membership. She would crow that taking the membership behind a paywall actually strengthened the business, because it enabled her to collect fees. “We’ve been rocking ever since,” Saldaya wrote in a 2023 post in Lighthouse.Saldaya has always denied involvement in Journey Moon’s death. “The story wound up that I was her virtual midwife,” she would later tell students, “which is not true. We had never worked together. I didn’t know this woman at all.”When she had moved to LA as a 17-year-old high school dropout, Emilee Saldaya was bubbly and fun-loving, with a forceful personality that belied her small stature. Born Emily Benner in Florida, she had inherited from her obstetrician-gynecologist nurse mother an interest in birth, and from her father, who sold medical equipment to hospitals, her entrepreneurial zeal.In LA, Saldaya bounced around jobs: infant massage therapist, waitress, trimming marijuana for cash, a hula-hoop performer and in the office of a home birth midwife. Friends recall her ambition to be rich. “She wanted to have a big voice and be an activist,” one says, “but she was also oriented towards making money.”From 2010 on, Saldaya worked as a doula, providing emotional and practical, but not medical, support to women giving birth. She would later say she was “haunted” by the traumatic births she saw in hospitals, many of which she perceived to be sexual assaults.A committed feminist at the time, Saldaya joined a non-profit, the LA Doula Project, providing free doulas to low-income women. Through it, she met fellow doula Laura Garland. “She would do anything for her clients,” Garland recalls. “She was very protective, a fighter.” But Garland also says Saldaya had a tendency to exaggerate how many births she’d been to, sharing stories of births attended by other doulas as if she’d been there herself.Saldaya had hoped to train as a midwife, but came to believe licensed midwives were part of the problem, promising women a hands-off birth, only to “sabotage” this by transferring them to hospital, in her opinion unnecessarily. She began falling in love with unassisted birth, and quickly had it all mapped out: a business, promoting freebirth. She’d launch with a podcast, then offer courses, online schools, retreats, even a festival.On 1 May 2017, the podcast went live. It was a success, and downloaded 10,000 times in three months. But there was a problem: Saldaya had never had a freebirth herself. Her thoughts turned to how to legitimize her burgeoning venture. Garland remembers her saying, “There’s this woman in Canada who is amazing. I’m obsessed with her, and I’m going to make her my best friend.” In New Brunswick, Yolande Norris-Clark was about to receive a phone call that would change her life.Saldaya’s call came at a good time. Reluctantly Norris-Clark had just taken a marketing job and enrolled her oldest children in school. Her self-described “wild days” – home schooling, making art, baking and walking barefoot through the woods – were over.Born Yolande Norris into an upper middle-class family in the affluent suburb of Point Grey, Vancouver, medicine also ran in Norris’s family. Her grandfather, Prof John MacKenzie Norris, was a medical historian widely acknowledged as a world expert in the history of infectious diseases such as cholera and plague.In her early 20s, she had two children with her first husband, both delivered at home by famed underground midwife Gloria Lemay, who inspired her interest in birth. Lemay is awaiting trial for manslaughter, after a baby died following a birth she attended in 2024. (Lemay has denied the charge.)In 2005, aged 24, Norris separated from her husband, leaving her young sons with him. She met and married Lee Clark, a ceramic artist, and by the time she and Saldaya connected in 2017, the Canadian social media influencer had seven children, five freebirthed at home. (She is currently pregnant with her 11th child.)View image in fullscreenYolande Clark from the Unpacking Ultrasound  podcast.Photograph: Free Birth SocietyIf it was freebirthing credibility Saldaya was looking for, Norris-Clark had it in abundance. She was, at this point, a minor celebrity in the online birth world, due to her popular blog and the fact that a 2012 video she’d shared of her son’s freebirth on YouTube had gone viral.“I figured out,” Saldaya would later say to Norris-Clark, in a 2022 podcast, “how to make myself valuable to you … [by making] us a bunch of money.” In return, Norris-Clark would bring her experience “of being an authentic midwife”.But Norris-Clark was not a midwife. “We were never midwives,” says Lily Smallwood, 40, a nurse from Fredericton and former friend. “We did not have skills.” Smallwood and Norris-Clark connected around 2013 because they lived locally and had freebirthed their children. The two women began attending local births together, Smallwood assisting Norris-Clark, who she thought had greater expertise due to the fact that she’d taken a doula training course under Lemay in Vancouver.Always careful never to advertise her services as a midwife, Norris-Clark instead called herself a traditional birth attendant, charging up to $3,000 to attend births, considerably more than a doula would command. (Smallwood was occasionally gifted the equivalent of a doula fee.)‘You will interact with babies not making it,’ Saldaya warned her students in one video call. ‘People turn real fast’When Saldaya and Norris-Clark connected in 2017, Norris-Clark claimed in her blog she’d been “present at hundreds of births”. “I’d be floored if there were hundreds,” Smallwood says – the New Brunswick unassisted birth scene was “very underground, very quiet”. She estimates Norris-Clark attended between a dozen and 20 births between 2013 and 2016.Although, Smallwood says, Norris-Clark found it a “little rich” that Saldaya had set up a business promoting freebirth when she had never done it herself,the timing was opportune. She agreed to share transcripts for a book she’d been working on; this became The Complete Guide to Freebirth. To date, it has made more than $5m.In January 2018, Saldaya attempted her first freebirth. Supported by her sister, a friend who was a nurse and training to be a nurse-midwife, and Johnny, her husband, who worked in the cannabis industry, Saldaya labored at home for 50 hours. She then transferred to the hospital, where she had a procedure to push back her cervical lip. Afterwards she returned home and gave birth to her daughter. Privately, friends say she was shaken – as she’d transferred to hospital, it wasn’t a true freebirth. But publicly she claimed victory. “It was epic,” she would later say in a podcast.By 2020, Saldaya and Norris-Clark had built a lucrative partnership. Norris-Clark was the charismatic, intellectual one. With her photogenic brood of children, she sold the promise of ease to the burned-out mothers following her social media accounts. Her births were pain-free and orgasmic, and she had far more children than most people do, yet Norris-Clark never seemed exhausted or burdened by them. In comparison, Saldaya was abrasive but, unlike Norris-Clark, who could seem scatterbrained and easily distracted, Saldaya was always focused on growing the business.Friends say Saldaya often took her ideological cues from her business partner. After Norris-Clark decided she did not believe in gravity, Saldaya announced she was no longer “round [Earth] committed”. When Norris-Clark said she no longer believed in germ theory, Saldaya told friends she did not wash her hands. When Norris-Clark said she no longer identified as a feminist and wished to submit to her husband, Saldaya quietly stopped marketing the podcast as “radical feminist”.After Norris-Clark tacked rightwards politically, Saldaya followed. She began to promote wild pregnancy, a term Norris-Clark invented, meaning pregnancy without any prenatal care, and German New Medicine, which Norris-Clark has championed, which claims that disease is caused not by pathogens but by unresolved emotional conflicts.Together, the pair developed a dogmatic approach at odds with the wider unassisted birth community, whose members attend medical appointments, seek ultrasounds to help them make informed choices and have emergency plans. When Coghill freebirthed back in 2020, she prepared a binder for her husband, with information about what to do in case of complications.By contrast, FBS taught that evencontemplatinga back-up plan was a sign of moral failure, because the truly sovereign woman trustedbirth. “You have to choose one world or the other,” Norris-Clark told followers in a video call. “And if you’re setting up a medical team in the room next door, you’re not getting the best of both worlds. You’re choosing the medical world.”As her empire grew, Saldaya contemplated how to further monetize a practice that is, by definition, free. She knew not every woman who followed FBS was ready to freebirth alone. But in most jurisdictions, practicing midwifery without a license was illegal. “In order to maneuvre around these unjust laws, I made up the term radical birth keeper … to be crystal clear, a radical birth keeper is, in practice, [an] authentic midwife,” she told her followers. In 2020 she trademarked “Radical Birth Keepers”: its registration states it provides education and coaching services in “midwifery”.The first Radical Birth Keeper (RBK) school opened in 2020 and, despite its $6,000 cost, sold out. Over the next five years, it would train more than 850 “authentic midwives” from every continent. In 2024, Saldaya and Norris-Clark went one step further, launching the MatriBirth Midwifery Institute (MMI), a $12,000, year-long “gold-standard online intensive midwifery school”.In reality, American midwives study for years at the feet of elder midwives, who train them in how to resolve life-threatening birth complications. Most carry drugs to stop hemorrhages, know how to assist delivery of the placenta and train in neonatal resuscitation.FBS students, on the other hand, would learn from an online course, taught via Zoom. The RBK school was only three months long, and much of the content was about how to build and market a business and find clients online. While Norris-Clark and Saldaya did acknowledge there were some genuine emergencies that would warrant transfer to a hospital, mostly these were played down and students were taught it was not for them to play the “hero” and keep their clients safe. The freebirthing mother takes radical responsibility for her birth, including, if necessary, her death. But some of the women who hired FBS-trained Radical Birth Keepers for between $3,000 and $5,000 dollars – comparable to what real midwives would charge – did not realize they were hiring women with no life-saving skills until it was too late. They believed they were hiring midwives.To avoid legal jeopardy, Saldaya and Norris-Clark taught their students to accept cash gifts only after a successful birth, never to sign contracts and to avoid the sort of women who might blame them if a birth went wrong. “You will interact with babies not making it through their births,” Saldaya warned her students in one video call, adding, “People turn real fast.” If RBKs transferred with clients to the hospital, Saldaya told them to give a fake name. If the police were called to a baby’s death, Saldaya advised, “You just play dumb, sweet, innocent neighbor.”When 42-year-old mother of one Keelee Sullivan, from California, signed up for the RBK school in 2023, she borrowed $6,000 from a family member, telling him, as she believed, it was “for midwifery school”. After the first birth she attended ended in hospital, Sullivan realised she’d been “practicing delusional optimism” and “was not educated or prepared” to be a midwife: “And no, I am not willing to go to jail.” She has not attended any births since.Saldaya and Norris-Clark always insisted that being a Radical Birth Keeper isn’t illegal. “You are not practicing medicine,” Saldaya told her students. But privately, Norris-Clark mocked medical disclaimers. “Always consult your licensed certified medical professional,” she laughed in one call with her students. “This is for entertainment, informational, artistic purposes only. Yeah, it’s all just performance art, right?”Molly Flam, 34, a doula from Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, who attended MMI, FBS’s flagship midwifery school, described it as “a scam”. She paid $9,000, only to find the pre-recorded videos were rambling and unprofessional, and contained medical advice that was inaccurate and confusing. “They’re showing up to classes dishevelled, talking about their personal lives,” Flam says. “There was no structure.”From 2020-2025, FBS ran nine RBK schools and at least one MMI school, generating more than $4m in sales. At one stage in 2024, FBS was making up to $160,000 a month, according to one former employee.As the money poured in, Saldaya established what she called her “queendom”. She bought three pieces of land in Hayesville, including a four-bed house in eight acres of land, an adjacent 53-acre plot and a school, set in 17 acres, that she spent tens of thousands renovating, only for it to fail a year later. She spent more than $10,000 on lawn ornaments, including giant toadstools, for the school and festival. She bought a Range Rover. She spent over $100,000 on a swimming pool and outdoor kitchen in her back yard. During this period, one friend recalls Saldaya asking for advice on how to get a private jet.It had long been her ambition to buy land and build a community, so, at her invitation, around 13 families are believed to have moved to Hayesville, sometimes working for FBS and living in yurts on her property. By 2023, so many high-profile employees had fallen out with Saldaya, insiders called them her “fallen soldiers”.View image in fullscreenSerendipiti Day, who worked for the Free Birth Society but quit after becoming disillusioned with it.Photograph: Calla Kessler/The GuardianSerendipiti Day, who had watched Saldaya wear a crown in the meadow in 2021, was one of those employees who had ended up disillusioned with FBS. She’d found the group after attending underground births in her community. She paid $300 to become a member in 2020 – a vast sum of money for Day, then an anarchist without health insurance – and her intellect and radical feminism marked her out. Saldaya asked her to lead Zoom calls and sent coaching clients her way. Quickly Day was making more money than she’d ever earned in her lifetime.As its client base expanded, FBS grew more extreme. Within the Lighthouse, women came to understand wild pregnancies were the goal. An unofficial hierarchy of birth emerged, with C-sections at the bottom and freebirth at the top. If partners were hostile, Saldaya suggested women freebirth in hotels. She compared family members who didn’t support it tohomophobic parents. Anti-midwife rhetoric escalated, too. “You’re fingering women in birth,” Saldaya said of midwives in a call with Lighthouse members. “Go fuck yourself.”For all the money Saldaya was making, and her public image as a champion of women, privately she had grown weary of those in her community. When an Instagram follower asked why Lighthouse membership cost $500, Saldaya vented via text to a freelance employee. “That idiot bitch,” she wrote, “asked me where the money went. Where does the money from your job go?”When women’s births didn’t go to plan, Norris-Clark and Saldaya offered paid sessions to unpack what went wrong. Neither woman had any training in grief or trauma counselling. On 20 May 2024, Camille Voitot logged on for a Zoom call with Norris-Clark from Frontignan, in the south of France. Voitot was barely functioning. Two weeks previously, her son Marlow had died during a freebirth.Voitot, 35, a therapist, found FBS after searching for birth options when she began fertility treatment with her wife, Jo, in February 2023. Voitot has always been the sort of person to do her own research, rather than just accepting what people tell her to do. “I wanted a natural birth,” Voitot explains at their house meters from the beach, an inviting space full of plants and art. “I wanted my body and my baby to be respected.”Throughout 2023, Voitot listened to the FBS podcast daily. She came to see Saldaya and Norris-Clark as the big sisters she’d never had. Growing up, Voitot did not have a close relationship with her mother, and she craved the sort of wisdom that once would have been passed down by elder women in her community.When she got pregnant in August, Voitot found out home birth wasn’t covered by state insurance, meaning she’d have to pay €900 for a midwife, which felt unfair. After purchasing The Complete Guide to Freebirth, and Norris-Clark’s book, she decided to freebirth.Jo had concerns, but told Voitot it was her choice. She knew Voitot had previously struggled with feelings of shame and trauma related to her sexuality, and wanted to support her. Friends were also worried – they would later tell Voitot they “didn’t recognise” her. But by then she believed “this is the safest way to give birth” without the risk of “obstetric violence” in a hospital.After Marlow died, Voitot became consumed by the need to speak to Saldaya and Norris-Clark. She couldn’t afford the $350 Saldaya charged for an hour-long call, but Norris-Clark agreed to a reduced fee of $150.On this call, Norris-Clark told Voitot her son’s death was not necessarily a bad thing. “There’s an overall assumption that death is the wrong outcome,” she said. “And I don’t think that can really ever be true.”At the time, Voitot did not fully comprehend what Norris-Clark was saying. “I was so amazed by the fact that I could speak to her directly that I didn’t really hear what she said.”View image in fullscreenCamille Voitot makes an offering to the sea for her son Marlow, who died during a freebirth …View image in fullscreenand has a tattoo in his memory. Photographs: Emilienne Malfatto/The GuardianAs the months passed after Marlow’s death, Voitot began to have questions. Why, in all the time she’d listened to the podcast, had she never heard stories from mothers who lost their babies following freebirths and now regretted it? Why did she believe “you can only have a positive outcome”?She reached out to Norris-Clark for a second debrief. This time it cost $800.The two women spoke on 29 September 2025. The call quickly grew miserable and tense. Voitot asked Norris-Clark: how could she have said that death was not necessarily a bad outcome?“This idea of death being bad is not really something I believe is true,” Norris-Clark said. “But that doesn’t mean I think it’s not a big deal.” She acknowledged she’d never lost a newborn baby of her own. “It’s a terrible thing, yeah,” she said. “And also, not ‘bad’, you know?”They circled around a question that has played on Voitot’s mind over the last year. Did Norris-Clark take any responsibility for influencing her to freebirth?Norris-Clark seemed irritable, though she stayed civil. Her answer was no. “People are responsible for their own decisions and their actions. You could have read other books. You could have gone on other websites. I am so sorry about your experience, Camille, but you are a woman that I don’t know, who lives in France.”By 2024, it was becoming increasingly hard to deny how many babies were dying to FBS mothers. Deaths followed a pattern. First-time mothers – whose pregnancies are known to be higher-risk – attempting freebirths over many days, even a week, after wild pregnancies. Some women went to more than 44 weeks of pregnancy.Most women who freebirth will have positive outcomes, and for healthy mothers the risks are low. But the radical version of freebirth Saldaya and Norris-Clark pioneered caused alarm even among freebirth advocates.Most concerning was FBS guidance around the resuscitation of newborn babies. On the one hand, FBS courses gave basic advice for an emergency, though experts say their instructions were flawed. But Saldaya and Norris-Clark also claimed resuscitation was often an unnecessary act which deprived babies of the chance to choose to begin their lives. In her book, Norris-Clark called it “meddling” and “sabotage”. Babies, Saldaya said in a 2024 podcast, “need to learn how to breathe on their own”, adding, “It is so profound to marinate on this idea of your baby walking with this story at his back or her back, that she knew how to get born. And she claimed her breath.”If an FBS-trained birth keeper was attending a birth, Saldaya and Norris-Clark taught that it was for the mothers, not the birth keeper, to decide if or how to help an infant unable to breathe. “When I attend a birth,” said Saldaya, on a2024 podcast, “like, for example, I would never resuscitate a baby. That’s cuckoo bananas to me.”Watching this video is like watching a parent sit by the pool while their child is quietly drowning and they do nothingIn 2025, Saldaya taught her students about a birth she attended in which the baby did not breathe after it was born for “a couple of minutes”. She found the experience challenging, she said, because she was still unlearning her societal conditioning “to want to hear the baby breathe”. Despite her unease, she did nothing and merely watched. “There’s nothing for me to do,” she said. “I’m not going to resuscitate someone else’s baby. I’m not going to make calls for someone else’s baby.”But exhausted mothers may not recognise that their babies are in respiratory distress until it’s too late. Or their intuition can be scrambled by exposure to FBS content. Just a few minutes of oxygen deprivation at birth can be fatal. If children survive, they may sustain lifelong brain injuries, like Esau Lopez. Milder forms may not be apparent for months or even years.Should parents decline to seek medical help, that was their call. “For some women, giving birth to a severely compromised baby at home and allowing that baby to die with dignity in the arms of their family who love them is a reasonable outcome,” Saldaya told her students.The notion of allowing a child to die is thorny legal terrain. “Parents are legally required to seek medical attention if a newborn is sick or struggling to survive,” says Prof Warren Binford, a children’s rights expert at the University of Colorado. “If a child dies because the parents fail to get medical care, they can be prosecuted for manslaughter, homicide, even murder.” The same principle applies to anyone else present who fails to seek help.Saldaya and Norris-Clark practised what they preached. When Norris-Clark freebirthed her eighth child in 2019, he was born “limp, unmoving, and grayish white”, she wrote in 2023. She held him and waited. “Had I intervened to accelerate his revival, this would have deprived him of his ownership over his vital and truly enlivening experience of transitioning independently to full incarnation.”In 2022, Saldaya did the same, later sharing the video of her second child’s freebirth online. Over the course of a four minute, 40 second video, her limp and floppy son grunts and shows signs of acute respiratory distress. Saldaya does not call 911 or resuscitate him.Experts who recently reviewed the video said it showed a life-threatening scenario; a medical professional would have begun resuscitation within 60 seconds. “Watching this video,” says Prof Michelle Telfer, an associate professor of midwifery at Yale, “is difficult. It’s like watching a parent sit by the pool while their child is quietly drowning and they do nothing.”View image in fullscreenSaldaya and Norris-Clark on a Free Birth Society podcast.Composite: Free Birth Society podcast with Emilee Saldaya/YouTubeBoth Norris-Clark and Saldaya’s children survived. But Saldaya, who taught her followers to always have a “death plan”, had considered what she’d say to the authorities if a child of hers died after they were born. She’d pretend the baby was stillborn. “I would certainly lie,” Saldaya told her students in 2023. “If my baby was born alive, then died, and then I involved the police – that baby was born dead.”If a child died in a freebirth, Saldaya also taught her students not to “kneejerk” call 911: “Dead is dead.” If grieving families chose to illegally bury their children on their land, Saldaya passed on advice once given to her by an underground midwife: “Dig a little deeper.”After working closely with Saldaya for two years, in 2023 Day left what she calls a “death cult”.FBS is not, by any conventional definition, a cult. But former FBS members often use the language of high-control groups to describe the hold they say they felt the organization had over them, leading them to behave in ways they now find hard to understand.It is hard to quantify exactly how many babies have died in FBS circles, because many “loss moms”, as they’re known, disappear in the wake of their tragedies. Most do not respond to journalistic inquiries.Within the Lighthouse alone, around eight women appear to have experienced stillbirths or neonatal deaths in the last year, in a community of around 600 women, many of whom were not pregnant.Why did no one encourage this woman to seek medical attention asap, even though it was clearly an emergency?As part of this Guardian investigation, we conducted in-depth interviews with 18 mothers who suffered late-term stillbirths, neonatal deaths or other incidents of serious harm after they or their birth attendants were heavily influenced by FBS. Their accounts were corroborated through interviews with friends, family and partners, and supported by journal entries, medical notes, video footage, message threads or legal documents. In all 18 cases, the evidence suggests FBS played a significant role in the mother or birth attendant’s decision-making, leading to potentially avoidable tragedies.They include Adair Arbor, who never would have considered an unassisted birth before encountering FBS, and whose daughter, Ilex, was stillborn in January 2021 following a 115-hour labor, and Amalia Hernandez, who nearly bled to death in March 2024 after refusing to call an ambulance, believing her post-partum bleeding would resolve itself at home. The same year, Haley Bordeaux went blind and suffered several strokes following a four-day labor in which she was in contact with Saldaya, in phone calls and text messages via a friend. When Saldaya was later informed that doctors had concluded Bordeaux’s temporary vision loss was due to severe pre-eclampsia, she replied: “She doesn’t have severe pre e[clampsia], that’s so entirely retarded.”We identified a further 30 cases, almost all late-term stillbirths or neonatal deaths, in which mothers appear to have been influenced by FBS, according to interviews with reporters, posts on Lighthouse or social media, or appearances on FBS or other podcasts. Most of the cases of harm relate to mothers in the US and Canada, but they also included births in Switzerland, France, South Africa, Thailand, India, Australia, the UK and Israel.“There’s this cycle,” says one ex-Lighthouse member, whose baby was stillborn in 2024. “Children die. It’s known in the community for a time, then new members come into the Lighthouse, and they’re forgotten. It’s like the erasure of our children.”In December 2024, a frantic-looking Norris-Clark appeared by video call from a hotel room. She announced to the students in the Matribirth Midwifery Institute that she was an “international fugitive”, after a freebirth she’d attended in Nicaragua had gone wrong. After the mother was unable to birth her placenta, she began to bleed heavily, before having a seizure. Paramedics were called. Afterwards, “there was swearing and screaming and people threatening me”, Norris-Clark said. She briefly fled the country, saying she would no longer be attending births, because she did not want to go to jail. When she’d launched the flagship MMI programme with Saldaya in September 2024, Norris-Clark told her students she was “fulfilling one of the central purposes of my life, by teaching midwifery”. Now, three months later, this U-turn.One of Norris-Clark’s MMI students was a 23-year-old pregnant first-time mother from Australia. She was having a wild pregnancy, with no prenatal care. On 5 March 2025, she posted in the Lighthouse to say she’d been in labor for five days and was “exhausted and hitting a wall of confusion”. Saldaya responded: “Sounds so normal and so hard. Baby is coming. You can do it.”On day eight, the mother posted “still going”; on day nine, “belly is taking on a strange shape as I contract, sort of like 2 bulges”. She was describing a Bandl’s ring, a sign of obstructed labor, an emergency in all medical settings. But nobody told her to go to the hospital.The mother subsequently posted a video of her son. He is grunting and struggling to breathe, his chest retracting effortfully. “Hey y’all,” the mother wrote, “just wondering if this sounds normal for a sleeping newborn?” Members expressed concern, but still no one told her to call emergency services immediately.“With a broken heart,” the mother subsequently posted, “I want to share that baby boy didn’t make it.”It was this video of a dying baby that finally prompted a mass outpouring of shock and revulsion in the FBS community. Days later, on 16 March 2025, a Reddit community formed. r/FreebirthSocietyScam was set up to “help deprogram from the mind control, culty atmosphere and rigid dogma of FBS”.On 27 March an MMI student posted inside a private chat for fellow students. “I would like to know,” she wrote, “why it has not been addressed that a woman in this space, in our current cohort, lost her baby … no one encouraged her to seek medical attention asap, even though it was clearly a medical emergency.”Saldaya deleted her post, before ejecting her from the course. Over the coming weeks, 13 students would leave, or be kicked out, of MMI.Saldaya and Norris-Clark appeared to have concerns about the legal consequences of what they were doing. In May FBS posted a disclaimer on Instagram, claiming its content was for “educational and informational” purposes and was not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any medical condition related to pregnancy or birth. “For medical advice, consult your healthcare provider.” In a call with her remaining students after the Reddit community formed, Saldaya admitted “[we] overplayed our hand, calling this a midwifery school”.View image in fullscreenEmilee Saldaya on the redesigned Free Birth Society website.Photograph: freebirthsociety.comFBS did not respond to requests for comment, however, in recent months Saldaya and Norris-Clark have pivoted to describing themselves as online educators, training “birth mentors”; MMI has been renamed the MatriBirth Mentor Institute. There are signs that the business duo may be parting ways: Norris-Clark was recently scrubbed from the FBS website homepage, which has been redesigned to put Saldaya front and center.On Instagram, Norris-Clark has called critics of FBS “pathetic losers”, defending her partnership with Saldaya as “the most ethical kind of business you can run”.In a statement on her Instagram account, Saldaya rejected the depiction of herself as “some manipulative cult leader” and compared the negative publicity to “advertising” that “has brought me a wave of new followers”.“Let me be clear: I don’t care if you freebirth,” she said. “I don’t encourage strangers on the internet to do anything at all. You are an adult. You’ve got some big decisions to make. It’s important to know freebirth is an option; what option you choose is up to you … I speak what is true for me, from a lifetime of devotion to understanding birth and the toxic power dynamics of the industrial birth system,” she added. “I stand righteously in my values. In a world where mothers and babies are routinely abused in birth, I will always stand with my whole heart for women finding their own way. And yes – turns out many of them prefer to give birth at home, like I do.”In a call with her students, Saldaya described the Reddit community as “a little troll group”. On 8 August, in her ninth month of a wild pregnancy with her third child, she uploaded a podcast with Norris-Clark, discussing the backlash. Their critics were “a bunch of very deeply insecure, bitter, sad, lonely women”, Norris-Clark said. Saldaya laughed as she compared them to the fish that eat dead skin during a pedicure. “Disgusting,” she shuddered.A week after the podcast went out, Saldaya stopped posting personal updates on social media. Speculation mounted among ex-FBS members, who knew her baby was due, but Saldaya stayed silent. And then, on 25 August, she posted an announcement.“I recently gave birth to a beautiful baby, stillborn at 41 weeks of gestation. Our son, our baby, was not born alive.”There were 15 pregnant teachers and students in the first-ever MMI school. Saldaya’s loss brought the number of full-term stillbirths or neonatal deaths in this cohort to three, all in a six-month period.Last month, Norris-Clark flew to visit Saldaya in North Carolina. Afterwards, she took part in a birth trauma debrief with a mother who had lost her child. The subject of Saldaya’s recent loss came up. “She’s integrating this experience beautifully,” Norris-Clark said, adding, “She’s so grateful that she chose freebirth, especially for her son.”To listen to The Birth Keepers podcast series, subscribe toThe Guardian Investigates feed, and it will drop in automatically when it launches in December.

This is part of our wider plans to rebuild Great British Railways the public can be proud of and rely on.”View image in fullscreenTransport secretary Heidi Alexander with a Great British Railways train in Bournemouth in May.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAA typical commuter work three days week in an office, travelling using flexi season tickets, would save £315 a year between Milton Keynes to London or £57 annually from Bradford to Leeds. A traditional full-time commuter to the capital from Canterbury could have seen their annual season ticket rise by more than £400, to £8,929.The announcement was welcomed by public transport advocates, many of whom have long contrasted the fuel duty freeze for motorists since 2010 with the rapid rise in rail fares.Ben Plowden, chief executive of Campaign for BetterTransport, said: “We know that cost is the number one concern for people wanting to travel by train.“This will enable more people to choose rail, reducing traffic on our roads, benefiting the economy, helping the environment. This is a positive sign that affordability for passengers is being given the high priority it deserves.”Aslef, the train drivers’ trade union, said it was “the right decision to help grow our railway”.The outgoing general secretary, Mick Whelan, said: “We are pleased that after 14 years of the Tories pricing people off our railways, this Labour government is helping people to commute to work and travel for pleasure.”The announcement will come as some relief to passengers, and to those dismayed by Labour’s first decision of fares in government. In last year’s budget, accompanying documents revealed thatfares would rise by 1% more than RPI, or 4.6%, in March this year.The preceding two years had seen even higher rises under the Conservative government, of 5.9% and 4.9% – albeit significantly below RPI as inflation soared.Decisions on fares within Scotland and Wales are taken by the devolved governments and are yet to be announced.Explore more on these topicsRail faresConsumer affairsTransportEnglandRail transportBudget 2025Heidi AlexandernewsShareReuse this content"

The former prince had a long friendship with Epstein and is alleged to have sexually assaulted one of his victims, Virginia Giuffre – allegations he denies.Starmer’s comments came after Mountbatten-Windsor failed to respond to an interview request from the committee, prompting an angry response from two of its members.Starmer said: “I won’t comment on his particular case. But as a general principle I’ve held for a very long time is that anybody who has got relevant information in relation to these kind of cases should give that evidence to those that need it.”He added that Mountbatten-Windsor’s response would be a “decision for him” but said: “My general position is if you have relevant information you should be prepared to share it.”Former prince Andrew accused of ‘hiding’ from US House’s Epstein inquiryRead moreThe committee is conducting an inquiry into Epstein, who died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. As part of that investigation, members of the committee wrote to Mountbatten-Windsor asking for an interview and giving him a deadline of 20 November to respond.Two Democrats on the committeesaid this weekthe former prince had not responded by the deadline. Robert Garcia, the most senior Democrat on the committee, and his colleague Suhas Subramanyam said in a statement Andrew’s silence “speaks volumes”.“The documents we’ve reviewed, along with public records and Virginia Roberts Giuffre’s testimony, raise serious questions he must answer, yet he continues to hide,” the pair said.“Our work will move forward with or without him, and we will hold anyone who was involved in these crimes accountable, no matter their wealth, status, or political party. We will get justice for the survivors.”Despite their comments, the Democrats are unlikely to be able to compel Mountbatten-Windsor to speak to them without the backing of the Republicans, who chair the committee and are in the majority.The banality of evil: how Epstein’s powerful friends normalised himRead moreJames Comer, the Republican who chairs the committee, has not said whether he would seek to force the former prince to testify, though the subject of Epstein remains highly sensitive for his party, given President Donald Trump’s involvement in it.Earlier this week Trump signed into law the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which will compel the attorney general, Pam Bondi, to release documents related to the government’s handling of his case within 30 days.If Congress did decide to issue a subpoena, Mountbatten-Windsor – who has denied wrongdoing – could avoid the legal penalties for non-compliance by not coming to the US.Explore more on these topicsAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorUS CongressJeffrey EpsteinKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

The 70-year-old politician was taken to a federal police base, seven miles from the presidential palace he occupied from 2019 to 2022, when he lost the election and tried to launch a military coup.The arrest of Bolsonaro, who had been living under house arrest in the capital, Brasília, since August, was ordered by the supreme court justice, Alexandre de Moraes, as a result of fears the former president might make a run for one of Brasília’s many diplomatic compounds to avoid punishment for the failed power grab.View image in fullscreenA supporter of Jair Bolsonaro holds a Brazilian flag outside the federal police headquarters in Brasília, where Bolsonaro is under arrest, on 22 November.Photograph: Eraldo Peres/APIn September, Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison over a scheme to stop the 2022 election winner, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, taking office. However, the court has yet to order Bolsonaro’s imprisonment for those crimes while a series of legal procedures and appeals play out.Amid growing speculation that Bolsonaro would be imprisoned in the coming days, supporters had been planning to hold a “vigil” on Saturday night outside the luxury condominium where their leader has been living under house arrest.The protest had been called by Bolsonaro’s senator son, Flávio Bolsonaro, in a social media video: “Are you going to fight for your country or are you going to watch everything on your mobile phone while sitting at home on your sofa?” He invited Bolsonaristas to “come and fight with us”.In his ruling ordering Bolsonaro’s arrest on Saturday morning, Moraes said it was possible the vigil could be used as a diversion to help the former president escape to a foreign embassy.Adding to those suspicions, Moraes said Bolsonaro’s electronic ankle monitor had been tampered with at 12.08am on Saturday. That suggested “the convict had planned to break the ankle monitor in order to ensure the success of his escape, aided by the confusion caused by the protest called by his son”.Moraes noted how Bolsonaro, who counts the US president, Donald Trump, among his international allies, lived about 15 minutes from the US embassy. In August, Bolsonaro was accused of seeking asylum in Argentina, where another rightwing ally, Javier Milei, holds power. In 2024, Bolsonaro mysteriouslyspent two nights inside the embassyof Hungary.Speculation that Bolsonaro’s arrest was imminent had reached fever pitch in recent days as allies voiced outrage at the prospect of the former president beingsent to a maximum security prison in Brasilía called Papuda.Lula supporters have voiced satisfaction that the ex-president appeared jail bound. “The message toBrazil, and to the world, is that crime doesn’t pay,” said Reimont Otoni, a Workers’ party (PT) congressman, noting how Bolsonaro’s plot included a conspiracy to assassinate Lula.Bolsonaro’s evangelical wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, responded to her husband’s arrest by posting an excerpt from Psalm 121 on social media. “The Lord will keep you from all harm – he will watch over your life; the Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore,” it said.Congressman Sóstenes Cavalcante, one of Bolsonaro’s closest allies, called the arrest “the biggest [act of] political persecution in Brazilian history”.Bolsonaro’s lawyers voiced “profound perplexity” at their client’s detention in a sparsely decorated 12 sq metre police bedroom and vowed to appeal against a decision they claimed would put the former president’s life at risk, given his “delicate” health.Talíria Petrone, a leftwing congresswoman from Rio, captured the joy among progressives, as Bolsonaro’s detractors were filmed opening bottles of sparkling wine and setting off fireworks outside the federal police HQ. “Today the alarm clock sounded different: it was the news of Bolsonaro’s arrest illuminating the morning,” she tweeted, adding: “Brazil smiles. A wonderful day.”Petra Costa, a film-maker and the director of documentaries about Bolsonaro’s attacks on Brazilian democracy, was also celebrating. “Brazil just succeeded where America failed. Bringing a former president who assaulted democracy to justice,” she wrote on Facebook.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

RedBird Capital, the US group led by Gerry Cardinale, had dropped its own bid in the face of campaigning from the Telegraph’s newsroom for its links to China to be investigated.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyThe culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, has said she will review any buyer.While DMGT has pledged the Daily Telegraph will remain editorially independent from other titles, there is a concern that it represents a consolidation of media organisations on the right that are already emboldened by the scalps of Tim Davie at the BBC in recent weeks, as well as Angela Rayner and Lord Mandelson.While there are few things generations ofLabourleaders are in total agreement on, all have felt they have been on the receiving end of harsh treatment by part of the press.Tom Baldwin, who was director of communications for Ed Miliband when he was leader of the Labour party and was political editor at the Sunday Telegraph, said he was concerned about the effect the merger would have.Baldwin said: “Britain’s media is already tilted dangerously to a homogenous, rightwing, angry point of view. A merger between the Mail and the Telegraph will only exacerbate that.“There are lots of grounds to be concerned about this on reasons of plurality, for competition, but more than anything else this Labour government should consider whether it is good for Britain, and good for its democracy, for the Daily Mail to strengthen its pernicious grip on Britain’s media.”His view was backed up by the former Labour leader Lord Kinnock, who said: “Everyone should be able to recognise that the creation of a rightwing press giant will plainly not improve balance of opinion and presentation.“Indeed, it is likely to diminish competition and diversity in providing information and opinion – the most precious of all commodities.“That would harm discernment and, therefore, democracy. I hope that the competition authority will attach prime significance to that reality.”Baldwin added: “Given the last 16 months, where from day one of this government there’s been a wall of angry, sometimes hyperbolic, often misleading coverage against everything, and that has I think affected the government’s fortunes.“I think there will be pressure from Labour MPs on Lisa Nandy. There are a lot of people who are concerned that the government hasn’t spoken out enough in recent weeks about the BBC, the idea that Labour will just silently nod through a deal to strengthen the Daily Mail’s grip on national discourse, seems really counterintuitive.“From day one of this government, those newspapers were set out to damage and destroy in any way possible. There would never be any intention by the Mail or the Telegraph to treat the government fairly. They do no favours at all to this government, this government shouldn’t do any favours to them.”However, Barber said: “They didn’t try and defend the RedBird bid, they never kind of looked at it in the mirror and said, here’s the Telegraph that hates us. A ruthless politician would have said, that’s fine, we’ll just let RedBird through.“Now for any Labour party member or even minister to be complaining about the consolidation of the right in the media, it just rings rather hollow, doesn’t it, because the government didn’t do anything to stop this.”Explore more on these topicsTelegraph Media GroupNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesLabourDaily TelegraphDaily MailanalysisShareReuse this content"

On the morning the government announced its much-trailed changes to the asylum system, Vaughan began articulating his fierce opposition to them on every available platform.Shabana Mahmood puts the signs up: Britain is full. No blacks, no dogs, no IrishRead more“The idea that recognised refugees need to be deported is wrong. We absolutely need immigration controls. And where those controls decide to grant asylum, we should welcome and integrate, not create perpetual limbo and alienation,” hewrote on X. “The rhetoric around these reforms encourages the same culture of divisiveness that sees racism and abuse growing in our communities.”His interventions were particularly unwelcome to the government because they came from a uniquely well-informed source: an MP representing a constituency at the frontline of the immigration debate, who, prior to his election in 2024, worked as an immigration barrister at the same chambers where Keir Starmer once practised. Vaughan has represented refugees and asylum seekers, and victims of human trafficking at the supreme court, and was appointed as a KC earlier this year.As home secretary Shabana Mahmood unveiled details of what was billed as the biggest shake up to the UK’s asylum system in 40 years, Vaughan was on the radio and television explaining why the new approach was inflammatory, objectionable and unlikely to work.He was particularly uneasy about the weekend briefings to media that jewellery and other assets could be stripped from asylum seekers and, more fundamentally, the decision to change refugee status from a permanent to temporary position.View image in fullscreen‘Once you are granted asylum, you should be supported, integrated and you shouldn’t have a sword of Damocles hanging over you for 10 or 20 years,’ says Tony Vaughan.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianVaughan’s outlook is shaped by his legal career, but also by years spent living on this stretch of coast, with its views across the Channel towards France, 23 miles away. A few years ago he spotted a small boat arriving carrying about 20 people from the window of the house overlooking Sandgate beach where he was living then with his wife and two young sons. He called the coastguards, but they were already en route.“To actually see that with your own eyes in relatively close proximity to your house, really brings home the human element to this,” he said, in an interview on Thursday in the constituency. Despite rising support for Reform in the area, Vaughan is convinced that many locals want asylum seekers to be treated humanely. “I think a lot of people in this area who have seen boats arrive on this bit of coast are sympathetic to their plight.”But even a brief visit to the constituency reveals how the issue divides residents. Although there are no asylum hotels in the area, Napier Barracks, which has provided temporary housing for about 320 male asylum seekers since 2020, remains the site of regular pro and anti-immigration demonstrations, despite being scheduled for imminent closure.One of 231 new Labour MPs elected in last year’s landslide election, he benefited from Reform eroding the Conservative vote; it was Folkestone’s first non-Conservative victory since 1885. He took a 3,729 majority, but theElectoral Calculuswebsite currently estimates he has a 6% chance of winning; the Conservatives are at 3%, and Reform 91%. Vaughan is in a group of about 33 so-called “bonus MPs”, politicians in non-target seats that Labour had little expectation of winning last year. Unconstrained by the prospect of long political careers, the bonus MPs havereputation for political disobedience.He is sanguine about the possibility that his comments have detonated any prospect of promotion. “I’m not one of the people who decided they wanted to be prime minister when they were a kid,” he said. He refuses to say whether he received a Malcom Tucker-style monstering from whips in response to his comments, simply noting that some colleagues were “frustrated” by his intervention, while others quietly expressed support.“You’re doing a great job. Keep doing it,” one woman said as she passed him in the Old High Street on Thursday. His comments on immigration have also attracted critical emails to his office inbox. Talking to constituents in the Romney Marsh area, where there are a scattering of St George’s flags, it is clear that how Labour handles this issue will determine whether people vote for Vaughan or Reform in the next election.Janice Biffen, a retired NHS matron, who voted Labour in 2024, is thinking about switching to Reform. She is concerned about pressure on hospitals, which has intensified in the decade since she retired, and local housing shortages, both of which she connects to the rising numbers of asylum seekers coming in small boats. “We haven’t got the facilities in the area to accommodate people coming through unauthorised routes. Farage says a lot of positive things about how to solve it. I probably would consider voting for him,” she told Vaughan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m not pretending that there isn’t a political challenge here of monumental importance,” he said.The first politician of Filipino heritage to be elected to parliament, Vaughan is the son of a care assistant who moved to the UK in the early 1970s and spent 30 years working for the NHS. His mother’s occasional experience of racism at work has made him think carefully about policies that incite division. “Once you are granted asylum, you should be supported, integrated, and you shouldn’t have a sword of Damocles hanging over you for 10 or 20 years, questioning whether you belong. We cannot pretend that there is no link between narratives that demonise refugees and constituents telling me that they are being subjected to racial abuse in the street,” he said.His solution would be a radical scaling up of the one-in-one-out UK-France agreement, to allow more small boat arrivals to be returned instantly to France, which he sees as a more powerful deterrent than the longer-term prospect of potential withdrawal of refugee status. He was more comfortable with the government’s initial focus on tackling criminal smuggling gangs in Europe and speeding up the processing of asylum cases. He places responsibility for the surging numbers of boat arrivals firmly with Nigel Farage, noting that people smugglers now tell migrants that Brexit has removed the prospect of being deported from the UK. “Because we left the EU and tore up our returns agreement, there is a lesser chance of being returned to France. These are Farage’s boats,” he said.View image in fullscreen‘These people are cheating proper immigrants,’ says Les Dawson, a volunteer for National Coastwatch, of those arriving on small boats.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianLes Dawson, a retired police officer who has been a volunteer watchkeeper for National Coastwatch for six years, used to spot boats arriving on the local beaches, although for the past three years, Border Force cutters have routinely intercepted them at sea, and transferred passengers from the dinghies to the bigger vessels, before taking them to Dover for processing, so small boats now rarely land on Kent’s beaches. “It’s got to be stopped. These people are cheating proper immigrants,” he said, as Vaughan visited the Folkestone viewing station. He was uncertain about whether Labour’s newest initiatives would work. “We’ve heard so many things, stop the boats, smash the gangs. It would be nice to see something happen.”This article was amended on 22 November 2025. An earlier version of a picture caption said that Les Dawson was a “volunteer coastguard”. He is in fact a volunteer watchkeeper.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumLabourfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Heaven is ‘a socialist state’. David Attenborough is ‘anti-human’ – the startling theories of Reform MP Danny KrugerCharlotte EdwardesHe was a Conservative party big-hitter who wrote speeches for David Cameron and worked with Boris Johnson before he suddenly jumped ship. He talks family, flags and why Nigel Farage is ‘top dog’Sat 22 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 22 Nov 2025 09.05 ESTShareWhat I struggle to understand, I say to Danny Kruger in his office at Reform UK HQ, is why a serious Conservative, with a glittering future like yours, would defect to a party led byNigel Farage?Indeed, the defection of Kruger, a heavy-weight on the Conservative right who served on the front bench and been tipped as a possible future leader, was seen as a major coup for Reform, catching commentators off-guard. Unlike previous deserters – Andrea Jenkyns, Jake Berry, Nadine Dorries – he was a sitting MP in a safe Tory seat. Plus, he was untarnished by the boisterous excesses of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss.Butwe’ve been around the houses a few times on this. He’s talked about his philosophy (Burkean), his Christianity (evangelical), thrown out words like “family”, “community”, “nation”. He’s asserted (confusingly) that the Tories are “over” but “not dead”, that politics is mostly “gut feeling … mostly vibes – isn’t it?” Now, after a pause, Kruger sits back and fixes me with a blue-eyed grin: “Humans are pack animals,” he says. “You need to know who top dog is, otherwise the other dogs fight each other. That’s what we get in Tory and Labour. Because there’s a weakness at the top.”In a nutshell, then, Farage is what drew Kruger to Reform. And when you think about it, Farage is all there is to Reform. Or was, until recently, when their polling was boosted by all the rats fleeing the Tory ship. The Faragists drained their pints, stubbed out their cigars, and got down to some party-building. For instance, in an effort to persuade voters they are more than a protest group, Reform have abandoned their reckless promise of £90bn in tax cuts, stressing instead the need to do sensible things like reduce national debt.Meanwhile, Kruger is heading up the party’s department for preparing for government. “The characterisation of Reform a year ago – basically one man and an iPhone – is not the case any more,” he says. “It’s one man with a very professional setup. Operationally, the party has become properly constituted, formalised with a party board, legal structure, all the things that a grown-up political party needs.”Here, I am struck by another thought. It’s not just Farage that attracted Kruger. It’s the great big policy vacuum behind Farage. Like a property developer eyeing a brownfield site, Kruger sensed opportunity. Because Kruger is a font of ideas. Not all are stable, not all are consistent, and not all will last the course, if his extraordinary career trajectory is anything to go by.At first glance, the white-haired, softly spoken, 51-year-old – who wears the same crumpled wool suit, white shirt and mustard tie each of the three times we meet – might seem patrician in the traditional One Nation mould. He was educated at Eton, at Edinburgh, has a DPhil from Oxford. He founded the prison charity Only Connect, and not only worked for David Cameron in opposition, but was responsible for his famous “hug a hoodie” speech. Oh and guess what? His mum is cookery writer Prue Leith, the colourful judge on The Great British Bake Off.View image in fullscreenKruger with his mother, the Great British Bake Off judge Prue Leith.Photograph: Les Wilson/DMG Media LicensingTo be fair, Kruger has always had a sense of who might be top dog. After Cameron, he was Boris Johnson’s political secretary, before becoming an MP, then a defence minister. He ran Robert Jenrick’s campaign to succeed Rishi Sunak, but insists, “I was happy that Kemi Badenoch won. If I had chosen an alternative, it was her.” What frustrated him was Badenoch’s failure to “hit the ground running” and then her failure to do anything at all. A year passed: “Labour collapsed; Reform rose. The Tories did nothing.”So, over the long hot summer, he walked the fields around his Wiltshire home. He sat mulling in his sitting room, took calls from his friends in Reform. Among them: James Orr, a don in Cambridge’s faculty of divinity. Orr was working informally for Reform, but now has an official advisory role, recruiting “highly able individuals” to party ranks. Kruger shares Orr’s vision for a “new politics”, which would see a realignment of party lines, bringing in sync Blue Labour – culturally conservative “old left” – and the populist “new right”. Orr’s presence, Kruger says, “was another confirmation that the philosophy of Reform is the one I’m comfortable with”. (By the way, Orr’s influence on the new right is substantial: JD Vance, the US vice-president, describes him as his “intellectual mentor” and “my British Sherpa”; Politico calls him “the philosopher king”; his positions include opposing abortion at any stage of pregnancy and admiring US gun laws. If Farage were to get to No 10, he has said, he will have to do “very unpopular things”.)While Kruger insists there was no one lightning bolt of clarity – “it was more a gathering conclusion, which crystallised in August” – it’s important to mention the hot night that month that Kruger drove to the Cotswolds to join Vance in his holiday house for a barbecue. They drank beer, talked Christianity. Kruger found him “gentle, personable. He listens as well as talks.” He’s impressed by what Vance had made of his tough upbringing – detailed in the book Hillbilly Elegy – but also his real-world military experience; “his intelligence”. Not long after, Kruger returned Vance’s hospitality by giving him a personal tour of the Palace of Westminster.Wherever the flag is planted, people stand for the values and traditional ideas of our nation. A country in crisis has to lean on its traditional symbolsToday we are on the 14th floor of Millbank Tower, the modernist block in Westminster, where even the lift stinks of cigar smoke. My questions cover recent events. Such as, why was the Reform MP Sarah Pochin given a free pass for saying that seeing black and Asian people in adverts “drove her mad”? (Answer: “It’s about intention. Sarah’s mistake was that she didn’t mean what it sounded like.”). What is your personal view of overturning the legal status of those given indefinite leave to remain? “Indefinite leave to remain was never a promise of permanent settlement. It’s what it sounds like –indefinite leave to remain: it’s in government’s hands whether they continue it or not.” Should women be sent back to countries like Afghanistan and Iran? “If it’s safe to do so.”There are also observations I don’t get to put to him – such as whether he’s noticed how many of the young men in Reform’s press conference team had chosen to have Hitler Youth hair – because we get stuck into his views and his responses come in thick and fast. It’s like handling fissile material.First, flags. I heard British writer Zadie Smith recounting how she drove from Cambridge to London recently and was alarmed to see that every village en route was decked out with St George’s and union flags. She felt that was a sign of national crisis. Even before I’ve finished the question, Kruger is nodding in fierce agreement. “Yes. It reflects the fear and insecurity in society – but it’s a legitimate fear and quite a noble statement by ordinary people who believe in their nation and want to proclaim it. The waving of a flag is a pacific way of asserting identity and belonging. Wherever the flag is planted, people – the majority of that community – stand for the values and traditional ideas of our nation. A country in crisis has to lean on its traditional symbols.”View image in fullscreen‘We have a fiscal system that rewards and incentivises family breakdown.’Photograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The GuardianButwasthere a spontaneous uptake of the flag all over the country? Or is Reform putting flags in people’s hands, while pressing the bruises of division in order to gain power? “When you say ‘pressing the bruise’, you could say ‘respecting the bruise’,” he says. “Acknowledging it. Saying, ‘You’re hurting here, and we are going to treat it.’” He says I should worry about the cause, not the consequence. That anger is caused by a dysfunctional state, massive migration, economic and wage stagnation, a breakup of communities with their traditional industries. “People are waving flags to say, ‘We want our country back.’”Isn’t it an import from the US, though, specifically Trump’s Maga America? “I dispute that,” Kruger says. “I recognise there’s a bit of a conscious echo. But remember America is British.”I look up from my notebook and frown. Are you sure you meant to say that “America is British?”“Yeah, go on, definitely. Trump, JD, they all explicitly say, ‘We derive our ideas – and certainly our political model and our political culture – from Britain.’ And, ‘What a shame you guys seem to have so little pride in your own country and your own model.’ If you look back to the 18th and 19th century, we were pretty vulgar, too. There’s a lot of flag-waving. So partly, Reform is just bringing it back.”So flag-waving is vulgar? He tells me not to be a snob. “Vulgarity is great. It’s a simple, straightforward, uncomplicated assertion of national pride, which is a good thing – if the country itself is good and democratic. If you go back to the time when America was being born, Britain was extremely triumphalist and pleased with itself in a way that we would now regard as terribly déclassé.”Are we talking about empire? But he’s moving into an explanation of how economics and migration are only part of the problem. The real issue, the real poison, the real fight is actually with the progressive left. The flag-waving is, yes, a deliberate hostile response to what Reform sees as “dangerous and transgressive ideas”. These fall under “the panoply we call ‘woke’”, he explains, “a word that trivialises quite a substantial set of ideas that are not to be treated flippantly. Everything from BLM [Black Lives Matter], to trans, to the Palestinian agenda, to DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] in the workforce, to all the ideas that are undermining traditional associations of family, community and nation. Those ideas are hostile to the inherited understandings of how we belong, and how we relate to each other in society. So: hostility to traditional families, hostility to the idea of rootedness in place, hostility to nations.”There is almost too much in here to unpick. I query what he means by “hostile” and Kruger’s tone turns grave. “I’d love your readers to properly believe me when I say this: I have great respect for the people who are trying to make a better society on the left. Their motivations are decent. The problem is they have an ideological objection to traditional family forms – which is mothers and fathers bringing up their children, living together and staying together. They think that is inherently patriarchal, oppressive, problematic.” Kruger does not say outright that he is against gay marriage or parenting – on the contrary, he says, “It’s not for me to judge people’s marriages or love lives –at all.” And yet, and yet he believes fiscal policy should benefit, “what we think is right for most people”. That suggests a hierarchy, with his idealised nuclear family at the top.I remember a New Statesman piece that listed the words Kruger used to described the left: “enemy”, “parasite”, “malignant growth”, “gnostic”, a “false faith”, a “lethal threat”. Put to Kruger, he replied that “policing language is a trick of the left”.Half of all teenagers grow up in broken homes, he says, “because we have a fiscal system that rewards and incentivises family breakdown”. Most countries have a more family system, he insists, and that’s what he wants to see here: “A system that is more pro-couple, more pro-children.”I know from the policy positions of the splinter group he had with Miriam Cates called The NewConservatives, that he has strong views on traditional family. But I suggest that he wouldn’t be here today if marriages didn’t sometimes fall apart. After all, his own mother had a 13-year affair with his father, the author Rayne Kruger, who was married to Leith’s mother’s best friend. “Well, quite, exactly,” he says. “I’m the child of an adulterous affair. Thank you for raising that. My wife was also brought up by a single mum.” (Emma Kruger’s father died suddenly when she was five).What about Farage, whose first marriage ended in divorce ? Would the way he lives represent all Kruger’s values? “So, listen: you’re challenging me as a Christian, and as a Christian I don’t judge people – how they live, who they live with, who they sleep with.” However, he continues, “I’m interested, as a politician, in setting the framework that makes for a better, healthier and happier society. Which I think is one in which people are supported to do what most people want to do: settle down with one partner, live with them for the rest of their lives, bring children up together.”View image in fullscreenWith Nigel Farage during a Reform press conference in Westminster in September this year.Photograph: James Manning/PAWe talk about Christianity, because although he was raised by atheist parents, he converted when he met Emma in his 20s and she gave him a copy of CS Lewis’s Mere Christianity. Religion is now a major part of his life. – as set out in his 2023 book Covenant. He is Church of England, but the Anglican leadership irritate him because they are too leftwing. Was Jesus a socialist, I  ask. He laughs sardonically. “He is a Palestinian as well.” OK, so a Palestinian socialist?“I think that socialism is in heaven,” he says. “The problem with socialists is they don’t accept the fall of man. They try to create heaven on Earth with the assumption that if we somehow just got our institutions or culture right, we could be synonymous beings and all behave nicely to each other.” Wait, I say, checking I have heard correctly. Heaven is socialist? “Heaven is a socialist state,” he says. “The effort of socialists is to bring heaven on Earth, with the state in the position of God. That is not a good idea. That’s because no state of human beings can be all good or all powerful.”We move on to the conflict in Israel and Gaza, because he’s declared Palestine woke and I’d like to know how. He says the position of Israel is important to our politics in the UK, but also the west in general, “because it stands for an idea of the nation and of western civilisation being something worth defending. [Israel] is fighting the battle for all of us in the Middle East.”Kruger does not believe that Israel is committing genocide in the region; he says all deaths in Gaza are the responsibility of Hamas. Nor does he feel Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has gone too far. “The children wouldn’t die if Hamas was not a security threat to Israel,” he argues. “I can’t judge the precise tactics of particular IDF operations. I can well imagine that there have been atrocities and excesses, as happen in wartime.” Is there no price too great in terms of human life for the elimination of Hamas? “Well, if that price is the elimination of Israel, then nothing is too great.”The Gaza independents, as he calls them, who sit behind him in the Commons ‘all seem very gentle individuals. The fact they have these views which I find appalling is secondary on a personal level’Later he tells me how much he likes the “Gaza independents” as he calls them, who sit behind him in the Commons. “They all seem very gentle individuals. The fact they have these views which I find appalling is secondary on a personal level,” he says. “But I don’t get very wound up at work.” He describes Naz Shah, the Labour MP for Bradford West, as “my good friend”: “I dedicated my Spectator award for speechmaker of the year to her,” he says. “She’s such a brilliant MP.”He shifts uncomfortably when I ask what Reform’s policy is on abortion. “To maintain the 1967 Act. Nigel has said he thinks the term limit of 24 weeks is too high. So we’d bring that down.” To what? “Look, I don’t know.”He has said women don’t have absolute autonomy over their bodies. “Well, they don’t,” he exclaims, “unless you think they should be able to terminate a healthy baby up to term. At some point on the journey from conception to birth, the baby acquires rights, yes? Therefore a pregnant woman doesn’t have absolute bodily autonomy.” So what would his term limit be? “I’m not sure I have one,” he says, stalling. “Look, I got in trouble speaking about abortion before. I’m actually somebody who accepts the settlement we have. I mean, how it’s implemented – the requirement on women to demonstrate the necessity for it – that is for doctors. I regret the numbers of abortions we have. I think it is tragic.” When I say it is difficult being a woman, he replies, “I was going to say, ‘Tell me about it,’ but you would have to tell me about it, of course.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He thinks it will be better if humans didn’t exist. And that is the problem with the green cult: it’s essentially anti-humanAnother concern for him is the birth rate “and fertility” in this country. “So many women are not having children – that’s a problem.” He tells me I should have a view on this, and when I suggest it’s the personal choice of the woman having children, he looks perplexed. “As a society, you might be concerned about the fact that we are basically disappearing.”Are we? “Yes!”He starts talking about Sir David Attenborough now. and I see a pattern in Kruger’s ability to stretch points to the extreme. “Attenborough thinks human beings are the problem,” he argues. “He thinks it will be better if human beings didn’t exist. And that is the problem with the green cult: it’s essentially anti-human.”This view that the world was overpopulated was one that Kruger’s father held in the 1970s. “They thought there were too many children, so it would be wrong to bring another child into the world.” Although he “regrets” that they held that position, it was, happily, the thinking behind their decision to adopt his sister in 1975. He briefly tells the story. When he was one, his parents heard through friends of an 18-month-old baby in Paris that had been adopted from Phnom Penh. The adopted mother had died, and the father couldn’t cope – and that was enough for his parents. They rushed to Paris and brought home Li-Da.She is now a film-maker and runs a charity that reconnects Cambodian families scattered around the world by the war. “We are close,” Kruger says. “I can’t remember a time before her.” He adds that she chose to adopt two children of her own.Both Kruger’s parents were originally from South Africa. The family settled in the Cotswolds, in an old rectory with dogs, cats “and a gerbil that I set free but that the cat then ate”. Childhood was happy. But as both parents worked running their joint business in London, the children were left three nights a week with the nanny. At weekends, the house filled with political friends, some “Bevanite”, some ministers in Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet. Kruger senior, who died in 2002, had as a young man been an anarchist. He shifted rightwards as he got older and was 50 by the time his son was born, “and very Conservative”. He was a big authority in the house, “gentle but firm; never raised his voice”. Growing up, Kruger emulated his father by being bookish and quiet. It’s only in later years that he became more gregarious, like his mother. Kruger won’t share Leith’s political views, “because that would not be right”. What he will say is that she is a “very nice mum. Both attentive and loving, but also pretty hands-off. She never tried to direct us.” I ask what she thought of his decision to join Reform? She was “fine”, “very supportive”, “perfectly happy with the move”. Does he watch Bake Off? “No.”Our second meeting is in Kruger’s office in the Commons, a little room with two desks and some wartime military posters. He is talking to me with one eye on the television so he can keep track of the debate in the chamber.School – Eton – was “obviously a very political place”, he says, where he struggled in the early years “doing all these subjects I was rubbish at”. He didn’t like team sports and hated the locker room. “I just don’t like being among boys in sort of …” he inhales deeply through his nose. Macho environment? “Yes. I prefer tennis.” He remembers the school’s ritual humiliation: the reading out of results in graded order, how his scholar cousin in the same year would be first or second out of 259, “and I would be 249th”. It doesn’t sound like he much enjoyed the place, so I am surprised he’s sent his son there. “I didn’t really think very hard about it,” he says. “They all went to state primary, which we were happy with.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The GuardianIs it true he edited a magazine called Intercourse at university? “It was us being flippant,” he laughs. “We originally called it Discourse but correctly thought that was a very boring title.” He pauses before volunteering that it went from “pretentious to pornographic” featuring three women students, nude. “I’m sure it was a bit more read as a result.”Has he ever watched pornography? “I’ve seen it, yeah.” Is that different from watching it? “Well, watching it implies some sort of voluntary act.” He stalls. “Which I think I’ll duck as a topic, Charlotte, if you don’t mind.” He continues: “To me, it’s ubiquitous. It’s everywhere. It’s unavoidable. I mean, I totally get the appeal. But I think it’s a problem in our society, how ubiquitous pornography is.”We get on to his sharing a house with the journalist Mary Wakefield in his 20s and then to the subject of her husband, Dominic Cummings. He tells me Cummings has had a couple dinners with Farage. “Obviously, they did not get along during the Brexit campaign, difficult for almost everybody, but Dominic wants Nigel to succeed.” He says, by the by, that Cummings has also tried to help Labour’s Morgan McSweeney. Why would he do both? “He wantssomebodyto grip the dysfunctional state we have.”Before his jump to Reform, Kruger says he made another “slightly bizarre leap” in 2008 when he left politics to run his charity Only Connect. He’d founded it with Emma­ – who’d already been running prison theatre projects, going in day in, day out as a volunteer – and was initially attracted to it “as an abstract idea”.Kruger believes in prisons. In fact, he thinks there should be more of them. It’s just the current system is broken. “The stories we hear of what these guys [go through]. It’s criminal – literally.” All the time he sees the freshly released walking into society with no addresses, no idea where to go. Often, “they wander back to the prison”. Only the other day a prison officer told him about a man released from Wormwood Scrubs who came back to the gatehouse and knocked on the reinforced glass. He said, “Excuse me, where is the community?” And the prison officer said, “What do you mean?’ He said, ‘I thought I was being released into the community?’”Does Kruger get angry? “Only with my own incompetence. There’s a sort of Basil Fawlty quality to me at home, my wife says.” He won’t give me an example. “You’re going to have to imagine. Obviously, I’m human.”He and Emma met “properly” in 2000 and then had an on-off “fairly complicated romance” until they married in 2007. “She wasn’t what I thought I was looking for,” he says. “She is gregarious, lively, very Christian. If I’d designed my ideal wife at that point, I would’ve probably said someone more like me, frankly. Quieter.” I ask how he proposed. “It was a process, put it that way. It was a negotiation.”‘The doofusisation of dads in popular culture is to blame for a lot of our problems. Because there’s no honour in dadness any more. Dad jokes, Dad dancing, I mean’That said, he is “thoroughly domesticated”. He changed nappies for all three children. Childcare was always split 50/50 and, “I do more cooking than Emma does.” Can Emma cook? “She’s not as … I don’t want to say anything mean.” He says their youngest son is fast turning into the family chef and then side-tracks into a monologue about how the myth of the 1950s housewife was a historical aberration because actually, before that, women had full economic roles.With the kids he’ll watch TV – Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Modern Family, which he loves “although obviously I largely deplore its politics”. Who is his favourite character? “They are all very good. As ever, the normal dad is the usual Homer Simpson characterisation, a bit of a doofus, which I regret. I mean, the doofusisation of dads in popular culture is to blame for a lot of our problems. Because there’s no honour in dadness any more. Dad jokes, Dad dancing, I mean.” He looks  depressed.Is he a feminist? “No, because I think the word has become an exaggerated sort of anti-man thing. Do I think women should have equal rights, yes. But increasingly, it’s become a code for an anti-family doctrine.”There are two possible problems with Kruger’s switch to Reform. First, East Wiltshire is a Tory safe seat – Reform came fourth in 2024. Is he worried he might be kicked out? “Yes. But my seat was at risk either way.” The second is that if Farage were to fall under a bus tomorrow, isn’t there a danger that the whole Reform project collapses? Kruger admits that is a “terrible thought”, and given that he’s put all his faith in Farage, “we don’t like to think about that”.He is on good terms with former colleagues in the Conservatives. Defection was hard in that “you’re basically betraying a whole bunch of people”, but he’s “very pleased” with the friendliness, and “all credit to the Conservatives, actually, for not being vicious”.So, no one was upset? “No, no.” OK, not totally no one: “I mean, obviously there are some people who definitely are hurt and disappointed.” These were mostly local Conservatives; people who’d gone out in the rain canvassing, door knocking, raising donations, good friends who “believed in me and selected me”. Those people were more – how can he put it? – “directly hostile” than colleagues in parliament. Also, Boris Johnson texted to say he was “dismayed”. Why? “Because he thinks Farage is not sufficiently pro-Ukraine.”Is he conscious of a creeping Islamophobia in general conversation, particularly on the right? I suggest that it’s pernicious and surprising, every bit as dangerous as the drawing room fascism of the 30s. “I think your surprise should be moderated by the reality of enormous growth in Islam in our country over the last couple of decades,” he says. “This [Islamophobia] is a response to demographic change. Across the nation, people are seeing total transformation of their communities, and they’re also seeing a very ugly and very threatening assertion of a militant Islam, which relates to all of the stuff we’ve been talking about foreign policy, but also how we live in our own country, which is deeply illiberal and should be concerning to people who, like you, think of themselves as good feminists.” This does not feel so far from the “great replacement” conspiracy.He asks if I saw a piece in the New Statesman called What Did We Learn Over Our Summer Holidays? in which an anonymous Blue Labour insider said only Nigel Farage could broker a peace settlement between the white working class and Muslim communities. “Because no one else has their attention.”Does he want to be prime minister one day? “I fantasise about that,” he admits, “but I think the country’s had enough Old Etonians for now.” He relaxes in his chair. “I am curiously at peace about this decision.

I was living in Canberra and a friend recommended a polite, plain-speaking accountant who came to town from time to time. That’s how I met David. He was a handsome, jovial fellow with sparkling blue eyes, not quite a silver fox then, but a few years my senior. At 6 foot 3 and dressed in a smart suit and tie (a weakness of mine), he certainly made an impression.At some point between sorting out my taxes and asking where I wanted to be financially in 10 years, he noticed I was wearing hearing aids and went on to tell me what a hard time his ex-wife and stepson gave him about his hearing, and anyway, wasn’t I far too young to need them? I explained, perhaps a little curtly, that I’d worn them since I was eight so he shouldn’t be so silly as to think they’d make him look old. I had an appointment coming up with my specialist and somehow it was arranged that he’d join me.On the day of the appointment the receptionist mistook us for a married couple and addressed me as Mrs Stephens. There was plenty of blushing on my part, but David, being a great flirt, had a great time playing with the idea.When we went for coffee afterwards, David was still running with the Mrs Stephens routine. I’d been admiring the audiometrist’s high heels and he was making jokes about how he’d be able to make sure I had a shoe closet in my “financial future”, and didn’t I think we could get a good deal on the hearing aids if we bought them together? There was obvious chemistry, and when we met up for dinner the following week he asked me if I’d like to join him at a wedding.View image in fullscreenDavid and Lynda at a wedding in Mexico in 2018.Photograph: Lynda LeighA few weeks later I found myself in Brisbane, walking into a family wedding with a man I barely knew. He’d been married twice and was such a charmer – I had no idea what the family would make of me, but during the reception he pulled me aside and said his sister had told him I should have been his first wife.As our relationship developed he often talked about how he wanted to learn sign language. What struck me most was his concern that one day we might struggle to communicate, and that he actually considered this a problem. I’d never been in a relationship with anyone who was interested enough in what I had to say to worry about things like that.When I was a child any sign of disability was stigmatised. I was always made to feel as though I was being difficult or not making enough effort, so to have David be so supportive was deeply moving to me.All my life I’d been in the habit of not putting my hearing aids on until after I’d showered. I’d wake up and have a few coffees in silence before I’d get ready and switch on for the day. Listening is hard work and it never bothered anyone else. So the first time David came to me as I sat at the breakfast table and presented me with my hearing aids like they were a little gift, I was taken aback. That small, silent gesture spoke volumes about how important my company was to him. Every time he quietly invited me to hear, and be heard, I fell in love with him again.David proposed on our 10th anniversary and we married in 2024.David was a true gentleman, in the best ways. He opened doors, pulled out chairs and took incredibly good care of his “Lady Lynda”, as he called me. Every night the table was set, we’d light candles, put on music, pour some wine and talk, and I mean really talk, about the deep things.View image in fullscreenLynda and David with their rescued great danes, Ellie (left) and Leroy (right) in 2023.Photograph: Tara Chui/Daisy Hill Photography/Lynda LeighThat’s how it should have been the night David disappeared. Like the caring, sweet man he was, he’d sent me a message to let me know he was setting off from Wangaratta and given me his ETA at Moruya airport. I’d made dinner, lit the fire and set the table with a tablecloth and serviettes. Our wine glasses were waiting to be filled.The moment I knew: when we reunited in our 60s, it felt like coming homeRead moreDavid had a lifelong passion for flying. He’d got his pilot licence in 1969, before he even learned to drive, but life had got in the way. Knowing how much he loved it, I had encouraged him to return to the skies, even after a battle with cancer had delayed his reaccreditation for five years.But David never came home that day. He had been flying again for eight years, then that afternoon he became disoriented over the Snowy Mountains and crashed. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.They don’t make them like David any more and the times we shared were the happiest days of my life. While his absence is excruciating, I remind myself that only the most successful marriages end in death. I take small solace in knowing he died doing what he loved and coming home to me.Tell us the moment you knewShare your experienceShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

A conversation and controversy that started in the unofficial parent chat culminated in the arrest of two parents in the Hertfordshire town, sparking fierce debate about police overreach, the right to free speech and the relationship between schools and parents. The saga was covered around the world, discussed in parliament anddrew the attention of Elon Musk on X, who appears to have viewed it as grounds for a “political revolution”.In its own – thoroughly improbable – way, it raised a question that might feel familiar to many whose phones get overtaken by the school group chat: what’s the difference between a concerned parent, a busybody and someone who should face the full force of the law? Inevitably, it also featured a doorbell cam.On a micro level, its impact has been seismic. “A lot of parents don’t talk to each other any more,” said Sarah. “It feels like you’re back on the playground. You feel like you can’t voice an opinion without people ganging up on you.”Cowley Hill - year 4From WhatsAppParent 1Must be something else or they’ve sent it in general to everyone as a shut up and get on with it 🙄RosalindMaybe there’s other stuff too doing on. No idea. But what I do know is they can’t control what anyone says. Anywhere.Parent 1Everyone’s talking about it on the playground aswell! It’s ridiculousRosalindHaha! I’m also pretty sure [name] didn’t write that letter. She hasn’t got a clue about anything.Parent 1I was thinking thatRosalindLove the way [she] has her little spies in WhatsApp and Facebook groups to keep an eye on what’s being said 🤣 They seriously need to get lives lol.This week the parents at Cowley Hill primary again found themselves caught in a surrealist fish bowl, after Maxie Allen and Rosalind Levine, the couple at the centre of the row, revealed they had been given a £20,000 payout by Hertfordshire police, whoadmitted they had been wrongfully arrested and detained in January. The force said there had been no issues of misconduct by its officers, but that the legal test for arrest had not been met.On a bitingly cold morning outside the large primary, harried parents were understandably reluctant to talk. One woman stopped briefly to say the school had been amazing with her autistic child. Another said the story had been impossible to ignore given it was plastered all over social media. “All I would say is that there are two sides to every story,” she said. “There’s been a lot of upset.”So what went so badly wrong? In the most basic terms, from spring last year Allen and Levine, who both work in the media, made complaints about the school directly, in a school WhatsApp group they set up and on social media. The school said it had been bombarded by “upsetting and derogatory social media posts, on Facebook and WhatsApp”. It reported the couple’s actions to police and, after a warning, banned them from the school grounds.The couple were arrested in January on suspicion of harassment, malicious communications and causing a nuisance on school property, but after an investigation police said in March that no action would be taken against them. Then they told their story to the Times, where Allen worked as a producer, and the story went stratospheric.Sitting in their living room, a brisk 10-minute walk from the school, Allen said the experience had been, to put it mildly, surreal. “It has taken on a life of its own,” he said. “It’s almost now as if it’s happened to somebody else.”Levine said they had been left with a deep distrust of the police. When six uniformed officers fromHertfordshirepolice showed up at their door – a widely shared moment captured for posterity by a doorbell cam – she thought her daughter, who has epilepsy, had died. “Every time I see that footage of the police coming to the door, I feel sick,” she said.0:37Doorbell footage shows police turning up to arrest Maxie Allen and Rosalind Levine – videoAccording to Levine and Allen, the trouble started in November 2023 when the school announced its headteacher would retire in June 2024, with the deputy taking over as acting head.Allen, a former parent-governor of the school, wrote to governors in May 2024 asking why an open recruitment process had not started. In June the chair of governors wrote to all parents saying that “a very small minority” were using WhatsApp and social media to “to cause disharmony” and “make inflammatory and defamatory comments about senior leaders in the school”.Levine and Allen stand by discussing the school issues on WhatsApp, and said their comments were private and not abusive. But the school sent the couple a letter in July referencing WhatsApp messages they had sent and saying if they did not stop the school would consider “communication management measures”. It suddenly felt like a whodunnit, said Sarah. “You’re looking at other people, like, was it her? Who’s screenshotting our messages? And that itself was awful.”Cowley Hill - year 4From WhatsAppRosalindCan you imagine what the ‘action’ is they say they’ll take? ‘Hello 999? One of the school mums said something mean about me in a school mum WhatsApp group. Please can you arrest them?’MaxieNo public body has the power to control what people say about it.ParentThis should be a safe group where parents feel free to speak and share opinions about how they feel about the school and its actions and activities nothing more or less, end of story.RosalindAbsolutely. I thought the Facebook group I wrote in was a safe space.MaxieRegardless, what we say, or not, is none of their business.Schoolshave no power beyond their gates.The couple responded in the same month, copying in a county councillor and some local education authority officials, and Levine posted the letter on her personal Facebook profile. Then, six days after the warning, they were banned from the school premises, forbidden to speak to or see teachers, and given an email address and told it would be monitored once a week. They later sent a subject access request and went through the school’s complaints process.The school said in a statement that it welcomed dialogue with parents but “the nature and large volume of the communication and public posts” during the dispute meant it was “no longer able to manage using normal internal procedures”.In November, Michelle Vince, a former county councillor, also emailed the school to query the headteacher recruitment process after being cc’ed in correspondence by Allen. In December, Allen and Vince were visited by a police constable.Vince was out, but in an email seen by the Guardian, police asked her to cease communication with the school “as you may find yourself liable to being recorded as a suspect in a harassment investigation”. The whole story had “created a culture of fear”, she said. “It certainly put the fear of God into me.”Allen and Levine were arrested on 29 January, five days after their daughter had started at a new school. At 1.05pm, 66 minutes after officers arrived at their house, Cowley Hill primary sent out an email announcing that the acting headteacher had got the job. Hertfordshire county council said in a statement that the role had been advertised publicly and followed all regulations. “Following the departure of the former headteacher, an interim head was appointed for the one term to allow time for a proper recruitment process to be carried out … We are confident that this was a fair, transparent and timely process,” it said.One parent at the same school as Allen and Levine said she had also been told to shut down a WhatsApp group in 2022, and she had politely refused. “The [then deputy head] told me she knows many people and she can call the police on me,” the woman said. A spokesperson for the school said its now headteacher “does not recognise this description of the conversation and refutes this accusation noting that no subsequent formal complaint was received by the school”.The couple say that since they first told their story in March, dozens of other parents claiming excessive responses to raising issues at their own schools have been in touch. Online, others have criticised the parents’ use of social media to discuss their grievances. Did the couple ever worry they were causing discord in a finely balanced eco-system?“It’s one thing if you’re saying, let’s go and throw stones, or using a lot of very personal, pejorative language,” said Allen. “But what we did was to comment on governance and policy and how [the school] was run. You can’t immune a public authority from that scrutiny because it happens to be a school.”Allen and Levine now want the Department for Education to conduct a full review of what happened. The school, which declined requests for interviews, has said it continues to focus on “providing an excellent education for its pupils” and will not comment further.What is clear is that this very modern school drama has left a mark on everyone involved. “None of the mums talk to each other now really,” said Sarah. “It’s left a horrible impact.” She said the WhatsApp group remained open but largely unused. “Funny enough, one mum actually wrote in there about a week ago,” she said. “She was asking for someone to help for a pickup.” No one replied."

What’s the strangest journey Rocky Horror has taken you on?I was at the 30th anniversary at Queen’s Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue. After the show, I was in the downstairs bar, chatting to a couple of people. I turned around and going up the stairs was a man in such high heels – these fetish shoes – that he couldn’t walk in them. He had a leather thong up his arse, and I thought to myself: “I suppose I’m responsible for that, aren’t I?”Your family emigrated to New Zealand when you were 10 and your dad bought a sheep farm. What was the name of your favourite childhood sheep?I don’t know how my father ever became a sheep farmer. My father was a bean counter. He was the most unambitious human being on the planet. He counted beans through the week. He was the city treasurer in Tauranga for the last 20 years of his life, and he played golf on the weekends. I didn’t have a sheep. I wasn’t into pets. Especially not a sheep.What’s the most out-of-date item in your fridge?I’d have to go and look. There have been times when I’ve been staying at someone’s place and they’ve said “help yourself”, so I’ve opened their fridges and they’re lovers of runny French cheeses. That’s not a happy moment, is it?What’s the ideal length of men’s shorts?To the ankle.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningYou play a photographer in 1997’s Spice World. In what order would you like to photograph the Spice Girls?I don’t know, really. I know, um – what’s her lovely name? Baby Spice.Emma.Emma Bunton, she’s delightful. I don’t know the other four. I’ve not met them since we did the movie. Am I a fan? Not particularly. They couldn’t sing. Their big hit was a chant: “I’ll tell you what I want / What I really, really want.” It’s not singing. Singing is the purest art form. The first song ever sung was a mother cooing to her baby. What a delightful origin to something so delicious. When a great unaffected singer like Billie Holiday is singing, without any kind of showing off, it’s just delightful. I love good singing. Music keeps you alive.The Spice Girls were put together and became a very successful pop group. No shame in that. As great singers, they don’t qualify. But lovely girls.View image in fullscreenLittle Nell, Patricia Quinn, Tim Curry and Richard O’Brien in The Rocky Horror Picture Show.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyWho last addressed you as Dick?Gay friends call me Dicky occasionally, but there’s probably something else going on there. [Composer] Lionel Bart and other chums from the 70s used to call me Ritzy. I was in a drag club in the East End one Saturday night. This chap leaned in towards me and said [does funny voice]: “Say, what’s your girly name?” I said: “Richard.” “No, no, no. What’s your girly name?” “Richard.” The poor being was so nonplussed, the conversation ended there.It’s a nice regal name. King Richard.What a sad reality that we see him as a glorious being. What a dreadful fucking human being he was. King Richard I beheaded more than 2,000 of Saladin’s men in a single day in the name of Jesus, because they hadn’t got the message that Jesus was a kind and caring kind of being. It’s as insane as it is maddening.I’m so anti-Abrahamic creationist fantasy. It’s become my bugbear before I pop my clogs. The whole business is nonsense. The abandonment of rationality in the United States is partly due to creation, myth and fantasy being held as reality.Is it ironic that you used to be a hairdresser?I was a barber from 1959 to 1964 in Hamilton in New Zealand. It was a man cave. Looking back, I can’t quite believe that on a daily basis, there were so many dirty, inappropriate jokes.If Edward Tudor-Pole was begging for mercy, would you let him out of The Crystal Maze?Um … no. I wouldn’t want to take Eddie on. I’d steer clear. I’d leave Eddie to his own devices.‘Risky is the best way to be’: Tim Curry on sexuality, surviving a stroke – and 50 years of stardomRead moreWhat’s been your most cringeworthy run-in with a celebrity?I have a lovely happy memory from one afternoon in 1968. I was on a bus with Aretha Franklin’s band going towards Hammersmith, with an actor friend of mine, Arthur Kelly. Arthur and I used to write songs, and we got to meet the piano player in Aretha’s Band, a chap named Gary Illingworth. When we got to the Hammersmith Odeon, I was standing on stage when Aretha Franklin came on to do her mic tests and warm up. Nobody came over and said: “Excuse me, who are you?” The relaxed nature of things back then was just marvellous.Would you rather die at the bottom of the sea or deep out into space?Bottom of the sea, because that’s where we came from. I don’t think I’d want to go into space. We’re built for gravitational pull. This is our environment. We’re not meant to be out there. I wouldn’t even want to go out to space for a week, or three.Strange Journey: The Story of Rocky Horroris now available on DVD, Blu-ray and digitallyExplore more on these topicsFilm10 Chaotic QuestionsRocky Horror ShowMusicals (Stage)Musicals (Film)featuresShareReuse this content"

The French company itself has tumbled several times in the past two decades and always bounced back, but never quite as spectacularly as when, earlier this month, it asked the public for money.An appeal for €5m (£4.4m) of emergency funding to secure the immediate future of the glassworks took just five hours and 40 minutes to reach its target. Within 48 hours, the total amount pledged had topped €19m.François Marciano, 59, the director general of Duralex, said the response had astonished everyone at the company. “We thought it would take five or six weeks to raise the €5m. When it reached nearly €20m we had to say stop. Enough,” he said.View image in fullscreenFrançois Marciano, chief executive of Duralex, holds up a Picardie glass.Photograph: Magali Delporte/The GuardianAs a staff cooperative, €5m is the maximum Duralex can accept in public investment under financial rules.Beloved French brandMention Duralex to any French person and they will be transported back to childhood and a school canteen. The brand evokes a mix of nostalgia and pride and is a symbol of French patriotism and industrialsavoir faire.“We’re likeProust’s madeleines,” Marciano said. “The French people want to save us. They are fed up with factories closing and the country’s industries declining.”At the Duralex factory on an industrial estate in La Chapelle-Saint-Mesmin on the banks of the Loire just outside Orléans, Marciano says he and his colleagues are “floating on a cloud” after the appeal.Eighteen months ago, Marciano oversaw a staff buyout of the company, which had been placed in receivership for the fourth time in 20 years. Today, 180 of the 243 employees are “associates” in the company.View image in fullscreenSuliman El Moussaoui, the leader of the CFDT union at Duralex.Photograph: Magali Delporte/The GuardianSuliman El Moussaoui, 44, a union representative at the factory where he has worked for 18 years, said the appeal had prompted “a tsunami of orders, so many that we’re struggling to keep up. Every time the company is mentioned on the television or radio we have more orders. It’s been amazing.”Inside the factory, a simple but magical alchemy takes place. A mix of sand, soda ash and limestone, the exact proportions of which are a closely guarded secret, is heated in a vast overhead oven to 1,400C. Glowing globs of molten glass drop into iron casts that are blasted with a flame of gas. The red-hot glass is instantly pounded into shape, sprung from the mould, snatched by metal pincers and placed on a conveyor belt.View image in fullscreenThe iconic Picardie glasses coming out of the 1,440-degree ovenPhotograph: Magali Delporte/The GuardianDuralex production videoThe process has changed little since Duralex – which is said to take its name from the Latin expressionDura lex, sed lex, meaning “the law is harsh, but it is the law” – opened in 1945. When the Guardian visited, the production line was turning out small clear glasses in the Provence range.View image in fullscreenWorkers in the factory starting a new production of glasses.Photograph: Magali Delporte/The GuardianView image in fullscreenEach glass is carefully inspected.Photograph: Magali Delporte/The GuardianA worker brandishing tongs lifted a glass to the light to inspect it for faults. During a production run, more than a dozen samples of whatever is being made – glasses, plates, bowls – will be randomly removed and subjected to stress tests. In the quality control room, they will be heated to 150C then plunged into cold water to see if they resist a thermic shock, and dropped from the height of a kitchen counter on to a metal sheet to see if they shatter. They will be tested for stackability and then weighed and the glass thickness measured. If they pass, they are thrown in a bin and the production line is given a thumbs up. If they fail, everything stops and the machines are recalibrated.‘The ultimate drinking vessel’It is not known who invented the company’s trademark Picardie glass, the tumbler used in school canteens with a thick curved rim and semi-fluted shape that first appeared in 1954. The British design guruPatrick Taylor has rankedthe Picardie alongside Levi’s jeans and the Swiss Army knife as an icon of modern design. Taylor describes it as: “An object whose form gives the impression it was discovered rather than designed. It is the ultimate drinking vessel created by man, and of its type cannot be improved.”View image in fullscreenThe instantly recognisable Picardie glasses.Photograph: Magali Delporte/The GuardianDuralex says its glass is microwave, freezer and dishwasher-safe and will not turn cloudy or lose its colour, which is in the glass rather than on it. When they do break, Duralex glasses shatter into small pieces rather than shards, reducing the injury risk.Joël Cardon, 59, who has worked at the factory for 35 years, said the soaring cost of gas and electricity were the firm’s largest and most worrying expense.On his screen, the oven containing the liquid glass showed a temperature of 1,440C. It can never be allowed to cool or the glass will solidify. Another screen showed the factory was using 360 cubic metres of gas an hour. According to the regulator Ofgem, the average UK house uses 97.3 cubic metres of gas a year.View image in fullscreenDuralex’s oven, in the background, is held at a temperature of 1,440C.Photograph: Magali Delporte/The GuardianLast weekend, potential investors were asked to come good on their promises on a first come, first served basis. They will be issued with securities that pay 8% interest over seven years but give no company voting rights. The maximum investment was set at €1,000.“We want to involve as many people as possible but with almost €20m in pledges obviously some people will be disappointed,” Marciano said.Since the company became a staff cooperative, turnover has increased by 22% and Marciano said he hoped Duralex would be breaking even by 2027.The €5m raised will be used to modernise the factory and develop new products. These include a partnership with the Élysée presidential palace shop to sell a set of three of its Gigogne glasses in red, white and blue, marked RF for République Française.Set of 3 Gigogne glasses in Tricolor, advertised online for €24.90Photograph: boutique.elysee.frDuralex plans to commission moulds to make “pint” glasses with a measure line for British pubs and bars and the US, both regions identified by the company as untapped markets.“Selling abroad is more difficult because there isn’t the same nostalgia for Duralex as there is inFrance,” said Vincent Vallin, the head of strategy and development. “Interest in the company is high and this is positive, but now we have to focus on increasing sales.”Explore more on these topicsFranceManufacturing sectorEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

As a child of the 80s and 90s, pop culture was awash with extra-terrestrial sightings. “How can you be a kid watching movies like ET and Close Encounters, TV shows like The X Files, and not end up curious about whether or not we’re alone in the universe?” he said in an interview with the Guardian. “And whether or not the US government does, in fact, hold secrets from the public.”‘80 years of lies and deception’: is this film proof of alien life on Earth?Read moreFarah’s exposure to otherworldly beings in fiction kickstarted an interest that’s now morphed into a professional quest, and the subject of his documentary debut The Age of Disclosure. Here, Farah makes the case that the United States has been hiding, for decades, a fount of information related to UAP (unidentified anomalous phenomena) – the acronym rebrand of the stigma-ridden UFO.It would be easy to assume this is the stuff of tin-foil hats and Reddit forums, and in some ways the documentary’s pseudo-narrator, Luis Elizondo, could come across as a type of conspiracy theorist at first glance. He’s armed with a blackboard and piece of chalk, working to sell the viewer, running through a lot of overwhelming military and intelligence jargon, like “hypersonic velocity” and “trans medium travel” with undeniable passion.But there’s a reason why Farah gravitated towards Elizondo (who also serves as an executive producer on the film). He’s got genuine credentials. A former Pentagon official, who helped lead the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), Elizondo eventually left his role in 2017, claiming the department was hiding vital information from the public. He also claims there was a “powerful disinformation campaign” from the Department of Defense to discredit his work.Making a point to “only interview people who have direct knowledge” of these programs from working within the US government was a north star for Farah – who has served as a producer on several films, including Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One. While filming The Age of Disclosure, as more former officials and experts got on board, it helped to convince others to take part.But Farah ran a tight ship over the three years it took to make the film. “Everyone’s names would be kept silent until it was done,” he said, noting that he only told documentary subjects about who had agreed to take part in order to make them comfortable. “We would make the movie in secrecy, so this information of who’s in it would not get out there until we were done with this film, and these people I was approaching would have safety in numbers.”Farah also opted to make the film independently, unattached from a studio or streamer. “None of them would ever want to participate in a big commercial documentary,” Farah explained. “They would be afraid of it being sensationalized. They would be afraid of being intercut with someone who was not on their level, who would undermine them.”His first big commitment came from Jay Stratton, one of the defense officials who started AATIP. He had an established career investigating UAP and non-human intelligence life on behalf of the government, and was responsible for briefing senior lawmakers in Congress and the White House. “I have seen with my own eyes non-human craft and non-human beings,” Stratton says plainly at the beginning of the film.After Stratton agreed to “break his silence” it had tremendous “ripple effects” on the rest of the film, and convinced others to come forward. When the current secretary of state, Marco Rubio, agreed to take part, that escalated things. “Then next thing you know, general Jim Clapper was participating,” Farah said of the former director of national intelligence under Barack Obama, who sat for an interview.The sheer wealth of contributions, 34 to be exact, from members of Congress across the political spectrum, as well as people with rich national security experience – many of whom might balk at the prospect of a cable news hit let-alone an independent documentary – certainly lends a veneer of credibility. Off the bat you’re confronted with a propulsive string score, and a supercut of former military and intelligence officials ensconced in armchairs. They all offer brief summaries of their CVs, spell out that we are not alone, and why the American public ought to know more about it.View image in fullscreenDan Farah.Photograph: Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images“This [UAP] technology does stuff that we can’t do, and if we can’t figure out what it is or what it wants, or what it’s being used for,” says a former director of aviation security at the National Security Council. The former chief scientist for AATIP claims that those who are tasked with ensuring information about UAPs doesn’t leak “will use whatever tool they can find to try to convince people they shouldn’t come forward”. Meanwhile a former defense official notes that if we’re able to understand the technology that we’re observing, it opens the door to so many “potentially beneficial impacts, including clean energy”.In many ways, Rubio offers one of the more convincing arguments. He says that much of the research and intelligence about UAPs is on a need-to-know basis, with incoming administrations being left out of the loop on the details. “But that begins to ramp out of control,” he notes, leading to a lack of transparency that might give US adversaries a head start by analyzing UAP technology. It’s a theory that sounds all the more convincing coming from the noted foreign policy hawk, who spent time in the senate spearheading a bipartisan effort to understand more about UAPs.The geopolitical arms race to reverse engineer UAP technology is, what Farah came to see, one of the biggest reasons behind the alleged cover-up. “You can’t tell your friends without telling your enemies,” Farah says in our interview, reciting one of Stratton’s lines in the documentary. He traces a line from the debunked 1947 Roswell “alien crash retrieval” (generally considered the genesis of modern UAP conspiracies) to what he sees as the ongoing effort to withhold information – for fear of enemies getting wind of how much the US knows about extraterrestrial life.“Put yourself in the shoes of US government and military officials in the 40s,” Farah said, explaining that, fresh off a second world war victory, the Truman administration couldn’t tell the American people that “we’re in another conflict that we can’t protect anyone from, because we don’t even know anything about it”.He says this race escalated when the US found out that other countries, like Russia, were capturing and retrieving UAP technology. “Here we are now where the people who run our country are not aware of the facts,” he added. “Those people are supposed to be aware of significant information like this that has high stakes for us. And at a base level, the public deserves to know the truth about fundamental facts, like we’re not alone in the universe.”In The Age of Disclosure, it’s clear that there is little room for pushback or skepticism, particularly since there’s not a single detractor in the film to serve as a foil to the plethora of resolute interviewees. And Farah, for his part, doesn’t see the need for those voices to cloud the documentary’s throughline. “I think when people watch this movie, one of the realizations will be that the stigma around this topic is completely illogical and makes no sense and is not good for humanity,” he said. “We need the scientific community, not only in the United States, but in every nation, accepting the fact that this is a real situation, this is a valid area of inquiry, and that they should put their brain power towards learning about this and answering a lot of the big questions that remain.”Testimony is ultimately what film hinges on, and it’s really the only “proof” it can offer. This, for Farah, is more compelling. He believes that “the strongest evidence” is “credible people putting their name and reputation on the line to tell you what they know at great risk”. When it comes to video and photos, the director notes that it would do little to quieten claims that it’s all a hoax. “You could put a picture or a video of the most extraordinary thing on the cover of a major news publication or on major plants on TV, and half the human population would tell you they think it’s AI or they think it’s visual effects,” he said.As more people, like Elizondo and Stratton, speak out about their experiences, Farah hopes it will encourage more people who have been silenced in the past to attempt to reveal the truth. “For way too long, the public has been lied to, kept in the dark, completely misled by a heavily financed and very sophisticated disinformation campaign,” Farah said.“I think it is only a matter of time before a sitting US president steps to the podium, and tells the world that we are not the only intelligent life in the universe, and that the United States government intends to lead in this new chapter by ending the era of secrecy and beginning the era of transparency.”The Age of Disclosure is out now in the US with a UK date to be announcedExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsAlien lifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Steve Rose profiled the fitness-obsessed billionaire tech leader whose business is at the heart of many governments, including the US, where its AI-powered data-analysis technology is fuelling the deportations being carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Pentagon’s unmanned drone programme, police departments’ (allegedly racist) profiling of potential criminals and much more besides.Read more2.‘I thought the grownups were back in charge!’: John Crace on how Labour shattered his expectationsView image in fullscreenIllustration: Billy B/The GuardianA few days after the 2024 UK general election, John Crace wrote that he felt as ifthe grownups were back in chargeand that Britain had regained a basic level of competence, that politics would become business as usual rather than a breathless psychodrama. So what would he write about? It turns out he needn’t have worried.Ahead of his new book, The Bonfire of the Insanities, our parliamentary sketch writer took stock of the political scene: from Labour’s serial cockups to the Conservatives’ impressive ability to be even less popular.The Bonfire of the Insanities by John Crace (Guardian Faber Publishing, £16.99).

It has fallen to Dunlop, an outsider, to study the history, to sift through the tradition, and to taste the dishes as if for the first time. Along the way, she has become the voice of a more authentic past.”Read more4.‘Possibly the most prolific sex offender in British history’: the inside story of the Medomsley scandalView image in fullscreenNeville Husband, who was in charge of the kitchens at Medomsley youth detention centre, pictured at Christmas 1983.Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/AlamyIn 2012, when Simon Hattenstone and our late prisons correspondent Eric Allison wrote about the scandal of sexual and physical abuse at Medomsley detention centre in north-east England, it was the first time any of the thousands of victims had told their stories to the UK national press. That story led to Operation Seabrook, followed by Operation Deerness, the latter of which reported back last week, finding that Neville Husband, a prison officer at Medomsley, was “possibly the most prolific sex offender in British history”.Read more5.Undisciplined?

As his numbers grew on the second afternoon here, what they represented grew more astonishing.A normal 16 runs from 20 balls became brisk at 26 from 23. By the time it was 50 from 37, the frame of the usual had disappeared. Soon it was 68 from 49. Yes, players have scored faster now and then, but imagine batting in a fourth-innings Ashes chase on 84 from 59 balls. Imagine coming from behind in the first Test of a series to score 92 from 61.When it arrived, Head’s century had taken 69 balls, the second-fastest in the Ashes. It trailed only Adam Gilchrist’s onslaught in 2006, across the river in this same city, when Gilchrist punished Monty Panesar, the England spinner whoSteve Smith took down verbally two days ago.But Gilchrist was scoring declaration runs on a scorching day against a weary attack. Head took aparta supposed English pace batteryon a cool second afternoon, against fresh bowlers who had hitherto sent down 45 overs in the match. It wasn’t even part of a plan.View image in fullscreenAustralia’s Travis Head struck four boundaries in five balls off Ben Stokes.Photograph: Darrian Traynor/Getty ImagesYou probably have an uncle who has emailed you a fake Sun Tzu strategy quote about finding a way to turn your weakness into your strength. But occasionally luck makes that happen despite you having no such intention. After match scores of 172, 132 and 164, a chase of 205 was enough to provoke nerves. Australia settled those with the opening stand, thanks to a player who was not supposed to open the batting.It has been publicly contentious that Australia arrived in this series relying on Usman Khawaja, a sprightly 38 years old in the broader world, but an old man as a Test opener. In this match, he could not have done any more to appear like a senior citizen. He fumbled but recovered his first slip catch, then was too slow reaching down for his second.‘Shellshocked’ Stokes urges England not to dwell on mauling in first Ashes TestRead moreWhen your team bowls out the opposition inside 33 overs on day one and 35 overs on day two, it is an achievement to have to leave the field in both innings for treatment on stiffness, then soreness, then back spasms. Fairly or not, that he had spent the previous three days playing golf did not improve anyone’s disposition to that news.By his absence near the end of each bowling innings, he upset the order when it was Australia’s turn to bat, the regulations not allowing him to open due to time off the field. In Australia’s first innings that led to disarray. The debutant opener Jake Weatherald lost the partner he had prepared with, Marnus Labuschagne had a new job and where Smith expected a few overs as a spectator, he was suddenly facing the third ball of the innings at No 3.Khawaja emerged at No 4, nowhere close to the pace of the game, unable to drop his gloves while making a short ball from Brydon Carse look like it had been bowled by Mark Wood. Whatever could have gone wrong with Khawaja’s selection had done.View image in fullscreenUsman Khawaja had to leave the field in both innings for treatment, looking every one of his 38 years.Photograph: Darrian Traynor/Getty ImagesBy the second innings, the problem flipped into an opportunity. Khawaja’s absence was more expected and while the players considered solutions including a sacrificial tailender, Head volunteered. As someone who has filled the role temporarily on Asian tours, it wasn’t new to him and having been below his best across formats for the past few months, trying something new perhaps didn’t have much downside.He took his time at first, picked off a few boundaries in his conventional spots through midwicket and cover. But one uppercut over the cordon for six and he was away. There was an outrageous carve over the fence behind point, a hook for the same over the keeper.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ben Stokes was talked up as a talisman after five for 23 in the first innings, but when he rolled up in the second, Head gave him no chance to be so again. Cover drive, pull shot, straight drive, pull shot, four boundaries in five balls. If the back of the chase had not been broken with the score at 89, it was at 106.From there, Head did as he pleased, galloping around the crease, batting from short leg, batting from silly point, slotting short balls that he could barely reach, matching the pace of the madcap game England aspire to, but with a consistency that their players failed to find. What he hadn’t finished doing with his 77 in Leeds in 2023 he finished here, with an innings that mirrored Brisbane 2021: the first Test of a series in Australia, Head celebrating an Ashes hundred, removing his helmet to the guttural roar of a crowd.View image in fullscreenAustralia’s Travis Head takes the Perth crowd’s plaudits after an innings that mirrored Brisbane 2021.Photograph: Gary Day/APIn Brisbane four years ago, he had roared along with them, the joy of the breakthrough. Here it was different, there was a lightness. He played the whole innings smiling and when the salute came, he greeted it swinging his bat like a man twirling a cane, whistling a jaunty tune during a turn down the promenade. He has done this before and he knows what it feels like.So this hundred will go down with Brisbane, and theWorld Test Championship final, andthe World Cup final; another entry on an increasingly crowded personal honour roll. The loss will go on the longer list of English humiliations in Australia. Given this side’s relative resourcing and talent compared to touring parties of the past, this one has a strong claim to be worse than any.But perhaps most of all, it’s because of England’s years of talk about cultivating 11 players to approach the game in a certain way, only to be beaten by the one player on the opposing team who does the same.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26The AshesCricketAustralia cricket teamEngland cricket teamAustralia sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

Indeed, he had been so cool in advance that he took in spot of shut-eye before it began and then weathered the hazardous conditions with insouciance.The Disneyfication of F1: Goofy in the pitlane and Fantasia in Vegas underline sport’s US transformationRead more“To be honest, I was having a quick nap before qualifying and I was expecting it to be dry but I woke up and saw that it was raining,” he said. “I thought: ‘Oh crap, this isn’t going to go well.’”Yet he had its measure, although his pleasure at mastering a “nasty” surface in cool temperatures and with a intimidating volume of water thrown in stood in stark contrast to the frustration ofLewis Hamiltonand Ferrari, for whom it seems the season’s end cannot come soon enough.Hamilton finished plum last in 20th, the first time he has been at the back of the grid on pace alone in his 19-season career. He struggled to make the tyres work in Q1 and was unlucky with a late yellow flag. “[The full-wet tyre] was as bad as it gets,” Hamilton said. “I couldn’t see anything. I think I hit the wall out at one point.”View image in fullscreenMcLaren’s Lando Norris’s pole position gives him a great chance of extending his lead in the title race over his teammate Oscar Piastri, at present 24 points.Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Formula 1/Getty ImagesHaving shown pace in the final practice session, Hamilton, who had been told by theFerrarichair, John Elkann, to “talk less and focus more on his driving”, was disappointed once more in a trying first season with Ferrari. “Today was amazing. I just didn’t get a lap at the end,” he added. “I felt like we were quickest and then you come out of qualifying 20th. This year is definitely the hardest year.”Ferrari have had problems with switching tyres on in the wet all season but while Hamilton’s teammate Charles Leclerc did fare better, finishing in ninth, he was equally angry with the his car. “My God, embarrassing, fucking embarrassing, fucking hell,” he told the team on his in-lap. “I don’t get how we can be so off the pace, there’s like zero grip, zero fucking grip.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterOur picture editors select their favourite sporting images from the past week, from the spectacular to the powerful, and with a little bit of fun thrown inEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Norris leads the Australian by 24 points and Verstappen by 49. As things stand, just finishing in front of Piastri at the remaining three grands prix would be enough to take the title. Should he extend his lead to 26 points by the end of the next round in Abu Dhabi, that would seal his first title.The session opened in steady rain, the first time qualifying has been held in the wet in Las Vegas and required the full-wet rubber.

But here, on a perfect night for rugby and with a game promising to develop into a gripping contest, we saw four players banished for crimes and misdemeanours in the first half alone. Mad stuff, at the end of which – after well over two exhausting hours – the world champions stumbled to a win that should have been managed with half the effort.Ireland v South Africa: Autumn Nations Series rugby union – liveRead more“I’d say it was chaotic,” Andy Farrell said. “I haven’t seen a game like that ever. First and foremost you look at ourselves and why things happened but my overriding reaction is that I’m incredibly proud. If you can’t learn from that then you’re in the wrong place really.”The passage to the overflowing sin-bin was halted only by the half-time whistle, at which point the referee, Matt Carley, was booed off the field with a venom you don’t often see. Their sense of injustice kicked off with the decision not to card Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu for a dangerous tackle on Tommy O’Brien. Both Farrell and his captain Caelan Doris felt a card should have been shown.So South Africa took with them a 19-7 lead and the knowledge they would be starting the second half against 12 men, albeit not for long. Ireland meantime were down the corridor with Farrell wondering what pieces he could move around a very bare-looking chessboard.The coach had seen James Ryan go first, on a yellow card escalated to red for a no-arms clean out on Malcolm Marx. The traffic became turbo charged in the last eight minutes of the half with Sam Prendergast, replacement Jack Crowley and then Andrew Porter all going off for a variety of offences.View image in fullscreenMalcolm Marx, bottom right, after a clean-out by James Ryan which earned the Ireland player a 20 minute red card.Photograph: Brendan Moran/Sportsfile/Getty ImagesIt was only in that bizarre passage that the Boks actually got to grips with turning their pronounced dominance at the scrum to something material on the scoreboard. They looked less confused when playing against 15 men, putting Damian Willemse over for a try inside four minutes. That said, they looked happy enough early in the second half when Sam Prendergast was back on the field to kick a penalty, only for his brother Cian to spill the restart. With yet another scrum penalty advantage to play with Feinberg-Mngomezulu, a serious athlete with a surfeit of skill, fended Jamison Gibson-Park en route to the line. That put the Boks 24-10 ahead, and looking safe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think the crowd recognised that and supported them for it. To be able to win the second half 6-5 in those sorts of circumstances was fantastic and that doesn’t tell the whole story of the second half. ” Consider that in a six-minute spell in the second quarter South Africa put Ireland on the rack, twisting seven penalties from the home side with the scrum the primary source. And that was before the hemorrhage of home players started.Even so, South Africa spent the last few minutes frantically defending their own line, with the slim comfort of a two-score lead, which they held until Carley blew for the last time, kicking off another chorus of boos.Quick GuideIreland v South Africa teams and scorersShowIrelandHansen (Farrell 65); O’Brien (HIA Crowley 32), Ringrose (Gibson-Park 75), Aki, Lowe; Prendergast, Gibson-Park (Casey 66); Porter (McCarthy 73), Sheehan (Kelleher 56), Furlong (Bealham 60), Ryan (C Prendergast 40), Beirne, Baird (Conan 60), Van der Flier (McCarthy 42; Porter 50; McCarthy 60; Porter 63), Doris (capt).Red cardRyan 21.Yellow cardPrendergast 34, Crowley 40, Porter 42, McCarthy 63.TrySheehan.PensPrendergast 2.ConCrowley 1.South AfricaWillemse; Moodie, Kriel, De Allende, Kolbe; S Feinberg-Mngomezulu (Libbok 59) C Reinach (Williams 69); B Venter, (Steenekamp 42), M Marx (Grobbelaar 66; Marx 73), T du Toit (Louw 42; Du Toit 73), E Etzebeth (Snyman 50), R Nortje, S Kolisi (Esterhuizen 59), P-S du Toit, J Wiese (Smith 54).Yellow cardWilliams 79.TriesWillemse, penalty try, Reinach, Feinberg-Mngomezulu.ConFeinberg-Mngomezulu.RefereeMatthew Carley (Eng).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Boks looked relieved, but that will last only until the review: how could a team so dominant at set–piece, and with a decent all-court game to match, end up in hand to hand combat to get over the finish line.

The British record signing, Alexander Isak, was again anonymous and Liverpool argued Murillo’s opener should have been ruled out for similar reasons to Virgil van Dijk’s disallowed effort against Manchester City before the international break. But Slot admitted the buck stopped with him and made no excuses.Liverpool in disarray as Nottingham Forest storm Anfield again with 3-0 winRead more“No one wants to hear me now talking about refereeing decisions if you lose 3-0 at home to Forest,” said the Liverpool head coach. “I should look at myself first and my team, but it does show you how a goal can change the momentum of a game. Before I was just waiting for us to score a goal. Afterwards we hardly created anything.“Of course there is a way out, especially with the quality players we have. No matter if you win or lose when you look back you are always thinking: ‘Where can we do better, where can we adjust?’ but that is something else from doubting yourself.“I want to emphasise I am responsible for the current losses. You are responsible when you are winning but also responsible when you are losing. I can never come up with enough excuses for us to have the results we have. That is far from good enough and I am responsible for that.”Liverpool’s performance unravelled as Slot made several attacking substitutions when chasing the game. “It was the same away at Forest last season,” he said. “I took Ibou [Ibrahima Konaté] off and put on [Diogo] Jota and he scored straight away to make it 1-1.

Tottenham had won the derby and would go on to win their last two games of the season to take fourth place and the final Champions League qualification spot fromArsenal. It was the end of the 2021-22 campaign, and the sixth season in a row in which Tottenham had finished above Arsenal and, for the first time since the 60s, it seemed that they had a definitive superiority in north London.Since when – although Spurs will point out theyhave won a trophyand Arsenal have not – the pendulum has swung decisively back the other way. Mikel Arteta has remade Arsenal, but the question is whether, after three straight second-place finishes, they can go one better and win the league for the first time since 2004, a drought that itself makes success more difficult.Gabriel is a big loss for Arsenal – Arteta’s conundrum is how to replace himRead moreThe long wait intensifies desire. Even at this stage of the season, there is an acute consciousness of where the finish line is: games are not just games, they are steps towards that final goal and that, inevitably, leads to a heightened emotional state.Adraw at Sunderland is not a bad result. Nobody has beaten them at home so far this season. There is no reason for Arsenal to panic. And nobody is panicking. But there is a faint glimmer of unease before a testing week. On the one hand, that is positive: Arteta should be frustrated at his side twice conceding by being beaten to the second ball in the box and should be determined to maintain the standards that had been set previously. But on the other, it’s impossible to win the title if the base level of nervous energy is too high. And Manchester City are looming.Erling Haaland looks unstoppable. Somehow, while Arsenal have had an excellent start to the season, setting records for consecutive clean sheets, and City began uncertainly enough to drop 11 points (only three fewer than they dropped in the whole of 2017-18), the gap from first to second at the beginning of the weekend was only four points.Arsenal have felt City’s breath on their neck before and it has not ended well for them. Not even a third of the season has gone; they cannot let the run-in start now. It happened in 2022-23 when the winter World Cup distorted the sense of the calendar and for Arsenal, with a lead to protect, each game became impossibly freighted. The memory of that season, the yearning for another league title, the early lead, all risk something similar.View image in fullscreenRicharlison celebrates after making it 2-1 against Manchester United in early November. The Brazilian is Spurs’ top scorer this season in the league, with four goals.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAIn that sense, a derby may not be the worst way to reset after the international break. It has a meaning in and of itself. The ramifications for the Premier League table, at least temporarily, retreat behind issues of parochial pride. And those are real enough, not least because the two sides, since Arsenal made the journey north from Woolwich in 1913, have had so much in common. Yet Arsenal, since the moment in 1919 when they were granted what Tottenham believe should rightfully have been their place in the First Division, have taken on the role of older cousin.Both benefited from innovative managers in the 20s: Herbert Chapman at Arsenal and Peter McWilliam at Tottenham. Chapman won an FA Cup and two league titles before his death midway through another title-winning season. It was thanks to the foundations he laid that Arsenal won a seventh league title in 22 years in 1952-53. McWilliam’s success was delayed, but it was two of his proteges, Arthur Rowe and Bill Nicholson, who brought Spurs’ two league titles.Both, by the end of the last century, found themselves restricted by old-fashioned stadiums that could not be expanded without complete rebuilding. But as Arsenal began the construction of the Emirates,Roman Abramovicharrived in English football and the rules of the game changed. It would be unfair to say the move to the Emirates has failed – Arsenal would be in a worse position without it – but it has not yet yielded the dividends on the pitch that many would have anticipated.Tottenham’s move came 13 years later. Their stadium can host five times as many non-football events a year as Arsenal’s andis more profitablebut whatever the merits of their homes, Spurs and Arsenal are unusual among the elite in relying more on stadium revenue than the generosity of their owners.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mauricio Pochettino and Arteta successfully cleared out the old guard while imposing a modern style that has influenced others in the league. The difference is that while Pochettino’s revolution came during the stadium move which, ultimately, cost focus, investment and momentum, Arteta has benefited from taking over with the stadium mature and its income streams reliable.Pochettino fell narrowly short of a league title twice (although Arsenal ended up pipping his side to second in 2015-16, it was Tottenham who were Leicester’s most serious challengers); Arteta’s story similarly is, so far, of near misses. The danger is that if that doesn’t change this season the perception of him, not only among the public but more damagingly his squad, will become of somebody who is somehow not a winner, despite the vast improvements he has brought to Arsenal.Injuries have struck again, Gabriel Magalhães joining Martin Ødegaard, Kai Havertz, Noni Madueke, Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Jesus on the sidelines with Riccardo Calafiori also a doubt for Sunday. Arsenal have probably the strongest and most coherent squad in the league, but this is its most severe test.Yet whatever doubts there are for Arsenal, at Tottenham they are far greater, poor home form magnifying the doubts of those who wondered whether Thomas Frank could make the step up from Brentford. And they are without Dominic Solanke, James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Lucas Bergvall.Spurs may be much better away from home this season, but Frank has won only one of nine games against Arsenal, who have won seven of their past nine Premier League games against Spurs.Whatever pressure they may be beginning to feel, Arsenal remain the elder cousin.Explore more on these topicsArsenalInside footballMikel ArtetaTottenham HotspurcommentShareReuse this content"

Somewhere along Ninth Avenue an ambulance threads through the congestion, its siren drawn out into a long, mournful ribbon that slips past the gym’s walls. He nods to a few familiar faces, peels off a Supreme Vanson leather jacket and begins to unwrap himself from the city. His father, Bill, arrives a step behind him, not so much entering the room as taking possession of it.“The youngest undisputed champion!” Bill cries out, half to the gym, half to himself. “He’s done it on three continents! Twenty-six years old and still writing history! Let the sparks fly!”The energy in the room seems to tilt toward the Haney clan, as it always does. Devin keeps his head down after taking a seat on the ring apron, winding the gauze around his knuckles with the same slow, practiced patience he’s carried since boyhood. Bill continues barking, rights and resentments and triumphs spilling out in a proud, protective crescendo. It’s a familiar ritual for the Haneys, father and son moving in concert. Bill has been here from the start, a self-styled Richard Williams of the hurt business: promoter, strategist, architect and hype man rolled into one. He has been shaping this trajectory since Devin was a boy, arranging professional fights in Tijuana when American commissions said he was too young. Lately, it’s a relentless leverage of social mediato breathlessly tout his son’s achievements. “Everything we built came from a plan,” he says. “We believed in the plan before anyone else did.”The first time I saw Haney up close he was 17 years old, newly licensed by special exemption from the Nevada commission after building a 4–0 start in Mexico andfighting in a four-rounderon the Manny Pacquiao–Timothy Bradley III undercard before a sea of empty seats in Las Vegas. His hand speed was already blinding, the eyes calm and alert, the movements unusually assured for a teenager still growing into his limbs. Nine years later, that stillness has only hardened. He glides around the ring working the pads with former world champion Mickey Bey, the mitts cracking like distant gunshots. Bey murmurs faint instructions between flurries. Haney grins, plants his feet and fires again.On Saturday night in Riyadh, Haney will move up to challenge the undefeated Brian Norman Jr for his WBO welterweight title. The fight is still three weeks away when we catch up at an open workout in Manhattan. “I feel great: strong, sharp, happy.” A small smile tucks into the corner of his mouth. “At 135, I was fighting the scale more than the guy in front of me. I’d make weight, and feel drained. Now I can eat. I can train for skills, not survival.”Two years ago, Haney seemed on an unstoppable rise. After defending the WBC lightweight title four times, he flew to Melbourne tooutpoint George Kambosos Jrand unify all four belts at 135lb. He went back again seven months laterto beat him more conclusively. Then came acareer-defining win over Vasiliy Lomachenkoin a fight that demanded uncommon nerve and ring intellect. Afterseeing off Regis Prograisfor a 140lb belt, Haney was 31-0, a two-weight champion and a fixture in the pound-for-pound conversation, all by the age of 25.But in one night, everything changed.The Ryan Garcia fight was almost entirely overshadowed byGarcia’s erratic behaviorboth in personand online. Weeks of unravelling – or performative unravelling – unsettled everything around the promotion. Then Garcia weighed in at 143.2lbs, a yawning 3.2lbs above the division limit, costing him money and the chance to win Haney’s title, but giving him a clear physical advantage. Still, the Haneys went through with the bout.Nothing prepared the sport for the night itself in April 2024, when the Haneys’ master plan was left in tatters by boxing’s biggest chaos agent. Haney was knocked down three times, all from the same left hook, and declareda majority-decision loser after 12 shocking rounds. The result was later overturned to a no contest after Garciafailed a drug test for ostarine, a performance-enhancing drug that promotes muscle growth. But the visuals of Haney getting battered to the floor repeatedly are much harder to wipe from the public consciousness, much less his own.View image in fullscreenDevin Haney, right, and Brian Norman Jr face off at Friday’s weigh-in at the Anb Arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Photograph: Hamad I Mohammed/ReutersIn the aftermath the Haneys filed a lawsuit against Garcia alleging fraud and battery, which only redoubled the ridicule from boxing’s unsparing chattering class, a complaint that has since been withdrawn. But even that, he admits, never sat right. “That wasn’t me,” he says. “That was the business side. I’m a fighter. I want to get it back in blood. I never wanted to do it that way. But I had people around me saying, ‘You lost millions, you’ve got to hold him accountable.’ I get that. But the truth is, I just want to fight. That’s who I am.”The rematch that might have rewritten the narrative never materialized. Haney had already signed his part of the contract, but Garcia lost to Rolly Romero before it could be finalized on the Saudi-backed cardthat took over Times Square. “We had a fight signed,” he says. “He didn’t want the rematch. But I still want it back in blood. I want to right that wrong.”On that same card, Haney’s return against José Ramírez signaled that something had been shaken. Haney won comfortably, but he mostly pirouetting around the perimeter, jabbed sparingly, flinched at feints and landed only 70 punches across 12 rounds. Surely there were mitigating factors: a 13-month layoff, the strain of staying at 140lb, the emotional debris of the Garcia nightmare. But the shift was noticeable.Haney doesn’t bother engaging with the criticism. “They’re going to say something regardless,” he says. “If you can punch, they’ll say it’s all you do. If you’ve got speed, they’ll say it’s because you can’t punch. All I want is to keep beating the guys they put in front of me.”Which is why Saturday night in Riyadh matters. Standing across from him will be Norman, unbeaten at 28-0 with 22 knockouts, and the owner of one of the most violent left hooks thrown this year: the punch that flattened Jin Sasaki in June and announced his arrival. A win would make Haney a world champion in a third division. A loss would represent a far more complicated detour.If Garcia embodied chaos, Norman represents danger. A younger, heavier fighter entering the ring with the kind of confidence Haney once carried. The fight came together very quickly, but Haney says the choice was deliberate. “I want to fight the best available guys,” he says. “I went down the list. Ryan lost and didn’t want it. So what better guy than the best one right now at 147?”Haney respects Norman’s potential but not the mystique. “He’s good,” he says. “But it’s hard to say how good. They put him in with guys who made him look the way they wanted him to look. We’ll see what happens when he’s in there with somebody who can think.”There is relief, too, in the move upward. “I’m much happier,” he says. “My mental [state] is better. I can focus more on game-planning instead of losing weight. At 135, everything in camp was about the scale. Now I finally feel like I’m training to fight again.”He’s become his own dealmaker, too, negotiating directly with promoters, including Turki al-Sheikh. “I’ve been negotiating my own deals for a while,” he says. “I love what Riyadh Season is doing for boxing. The best fighters are fighting the best fighters. Everybody’s making money. It’s a good time to be a boxer.”What keeps him moving forward, after belts and criticism and business? The answer lands softly but with certainty. “We set a goal as a kid,” he says. “I want my name to be mentioned with the greats when it’s all said and done. I won’t stop until I get there.“They said I couldn’t punch. They said I couldn’t take a punch. But I got up. I’m still here.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingUS sportsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

This latest one was 52-26 and to those who missed it will look like just another in their lengthy list of losses to New Zealand, which stretches back 34 matches. But it is possible, too, that for the men who coached it, and the men who played in it, for the tens of thousands watching in the ground and the hundreds of thousands watching on TV, it might yet come to stand for something more significant.Wales did not exactly turn a corner here, but they took a little look around one and got a glimpse of what a better future might be like. “A lot of what we want to do and what we’ve been working on as a team shone through today,” said their captain, Dewi Lake. “We made them work for it.”They were “courageous and fluent” said the All Black coach, Scott Robertson. Not to mention coherent and committed in defence, and smart and incisive in attack. Three times the All Blacks stretched ahead by scoring a try, the first of them after three minutes, and three times Wales managed to force their way straight back into the match by scoring one of their own.View image in fullscreenTom Rogers spins home for his historic third try.Photograph: Nigel French/PAThey were all finished by Scarlets’ wing Tom Rogers, who became the first Welshman to score a hat-trick against New Zealand. But they belonged to his teammates, too, especially Tomos Williams, who made one with an ingenious grubber kick, Louis Rees-Zammit, who set up another with a superb catch, and Joe Hawkins, who made the third with a fine long pass.Five minutes into the second half it was 24-21, with only a penalty kick by Damian McKenzie between the teams. Two of New Zealand’s three tries came from lineouts, one a simple finish by Caleb Clarke, the other an even simpler one by Tamaiti Williams off the back of a driving maul.Quick GuideWales v New Zealand teams and scorersShowWalesMurray; Rees-Zammit, Llewellyn, Hawkins, Rogers (Tompkins 55); Edwards (Evans 68), Williams (Hardy 68); Carré (G Thomas 52), Lake (Coghlan 76), Assiratti (Griffin 52), Jenkins, Beard (F Thomas 70), Mann, Deaves (Morse 68), Plumtree.Yellow cardsThomas 58, Plumtree 68.TriesRogers 3, Rees-Zammit.ConsEvans 3.New ZealandLove (Reece 55); Jordan, Ioane, Lienert-Brown (Fainga’anuku 68),Clarke; McKenzie, Ratima (Christie 55); Williams (Bower 55), Taukei’aho (Bell 65), Tosi (Newell 55), Barrett, Holland (Lord 64), Parker, Kirifi (Lio-Willie 68), Sititi.TriesClarke 2, Reece 2, Love, Williams, Ioane.ConsMcKenzie 7.PenMcKenzie.RefereeHollie Davidson (Eng).Attendance68,388.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The third was a brilliant finish by Ruben Love, who cracked open a gap between Rhys Carré and Harri Deaves with a dummy and slipped through with a fine side-step, then sprinted 30 metres to score. If no one in the stadium really believed Wales would win, everyone enjoyed pretending that they might.The atmosphere was feverish. The WRU had already laid on indoor fireworks and a light show, along with an a capella rendition of the national anthem and a brilliantly spot-lit haka, which was staged on a black pitch against the bright red backdrop of the grandstands. But what their paying public really wanted was a performance they could take some pride in. Their team delivered that for them.It could not last. As the match approached the final quarter, New Zealand slipped into a higher gear. They scored three tries in five minutes. The first two were awarded but then disallowed by the TMO, one for a knock-on, and another after replays showed Rogers had just managed to hold the ball up by wrapping his arm around Will Jordan as he dived for the line. But the third, which was not awarded because the referee suspected there had been a knock-on before Rieko Ioane scored off a crossfield kick, was given after an intervention by the TV official.View image in fullscreenRieko Ioane scrambles over the top of Wales fly-half Dan Edwards for New Zealand’s fourth try.Photograph: Dan Mullan/Getty ImagesFrom then on, things started to fall apart. Wales’s discipline had been bad all match, but it got worse when the All Blacks started to put them under really heavy pressure. First Gareth Thomas was sent to the sin-bin for a dangerous tackle. Then, just as he was coming back on, Taine Plumtree went off as well for the same offence. So Wales played most of the last 20 minutes with 14 men.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But McGregor, theCelticcaptain, came to the rescue deep into added time when he lashed home the winner from 25 yards to claim the points for Martin O’Neill’s side.Scotland’s World Cup qualifying win reactions equivalent to small earthquakeRead moreO’Neill, the interim manager, described his skipper’s contribution as “absolutely massive” and added: “It was a great goal from a great player. The game was obviously heading for a draw. I’m not so sure that we deserved any more than that.“He scores a fabulous goal. Strangely enough, he moved it out of his feet just at the edge of the box and I thought: ‘He could hit this’. So it was a great goal. Maybe it didn’t belong with the game, but it was just great to win.”St Mirren had come closer to a breakthrough on several occasions before the added time. Conor McMenamin was close to converting from close range and then hit the post from 20 yards, before being penalised for offside after Liam Scales scooped the ball past Kasper Schmeichel into his own net.The St Mirren manager, Stephen Robinson, felt the referee, Kevin Clancy, should have been asked to look at the decision again. Robinson, whose side have had a string of disallowed goals in recent games, said: “We lost to an incredible goal. I thought we were very good.“I don’t think Shamal (George) had a save to make.

That allowed Emmanuel Fernandez to make his third start since signing from Peterborough in the summer and the 24-year-old centre-back headed his side in front after nine minutes.Livi’s Australian striker Tete Yengi levelled after 18 minutes when he took advantage of awful defending and the home side’s overall play deteriorated, lacking urgency and guile.

I said to my team it was a hard-working victory but more than this, it’s three points.

But the Hibs head coach, David Gray, insisted he was never overly worried about Bowie’s struggles in front of goal.“Strikers get confidence from scoring goals clearly, but I’ve had a lot of conversations with Kieron recently about what he actually does for the team. It’s not just scoring goals, I know that’s what they get judged on but the rest of the players certainly benefit from unselfish work he does for the team.

After promising “severe consequences” in August if Vladimir Putin continued to obstruct ceasefire talks – but then doing nothing as Putin did just that – Trump finally on 22 October imposed significantsanctionson Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, seriouslycompromisingPutin’s ability to finance his invasion. But now, with his28-point peace planfor Ukraine,draftedby US and Russian officials without Ukrainian or European participation, Trump has reverted to his pro-Putin norm.Trump’s plan would reward Putin for invadingUkrainewhile leaving Ukraine’s democracy in jeopardy. The plan’s ringing proclamation that “Ukraine’s sovereignty will be confirmed” rings hollow when so much of the plan compromises that sovereignty. A Kremlin dream, the plan would be a Ukrainian nightmare.Betraying his real-estate background, Trump continues to treat the Ukrainian conflict as a mere territorial dispute, as if handing Putin a chunk of Ukrainian land will satisfy the despot. But Putin’s war is not about controlling a charred swath of deindustrialized territory in eastern Ukraine. It is about Ukraine’s democracy – and Putin’sdesireto snuff it out so it no longer serves as an enticing model for the Russian people of the accountable government that Putin’s deepening dictatorship denies them.While freezing in place the divided Ukrainian provinces of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, Trump’s plan would force Ukraine to abandon all of Donetsk province. Beyond rewardingRussiawith territory that its forces have been unable to seize in more than a decade of fighting, this surrender would leave Ukrainian defenses perilously weakened.Donetsk is the location of Ukraine’s much-vaunted “fortress belt”, the entrenched defensive positions that are a key obstacle to Russian advances. Trump would have Ukraine abandon these defenses, leaving Putin a clear path to Kyiv should he later choose to resume the war.Then, in a move that would make renewed fighting easier for Russia, Trump would require Ukraine todiminishthe size of its armed forces from their current 800,000 to 850,000 troops to a maximum of 600,000. Trump’s plan places no such limits on Russian forces.In an apparent sop to Putin’s efforts to portray Ukraine’s democratically elected government as a bunch ofNazis, Trump’s planproclaims: “All Nazi ideology and activities must be rejected and prohibited.” As if to underscore the point, it insists that “Ukraine will hold elections in 100 days” of a ceasefire agreement. Trump imposes no requirement that Putin jeopardize his dictatorship by holding elections in Russia.To be sure, the plan makes Russia promise not to “invade neighboring countries” and to “enshrine in law its policy of non-aggression towards Europe and Ukraine”. But given that Putin has breached similar agreements in the past – the 1994Budapest memorandum, in which Russia promised to respect Ukraine’s borders in return for giving up its Soviet-era nuclear weapons, and the 2014-2015Minsk agreements, in which Russia promised a ceasefire and a return of occupied territory in eastern Ukraine to Kyiv – why should we trust Putin this time?That is why Ukraine has been so insistent on western security guarantees. The plan threatens a “decisive coordinated military response” should Russia resume its invasion, and provides that “Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees,” but the details range from fuzzy to troubling. The plan would not only deny Ukraine Nato membership but also preclude Nato members from stationing troops on Ukraine’s soil, precluding thereassurance force, presumptively led by Britain and France, on which Ukraine had been counting to prevent Putin from replenishing his diminished forces, rearming, and reinvading.Aseparate side agreementreportedly would provide Ukraine with a Nato-style security guarantee, in which any future “significant, deliberate, and sustained armed attack” by Russia on Ukraine “shall be regarded as an attack threatening the peace and security of the transatlantic community.” That suggests a military response. But unlike a strong Ukrainian military – Ukraine’s most reliable defense against renewed Russian aggression – the effectiveness of the side agreement would depend on the commitment of Nato leaders, including Trump, to respond militarily to Putin’s aggression, something they have not done to date for fear of a nuclear conflagration.To make a deterrent more credible, European leaders have long insisted on a USbackstopto any peacekeeping force in Ukraine, but for now that depends on the unreliable Trump. Moreover, despite the Nato-sounding language, Trump reportedly isofferingonly “intelligence and logistical assistance” or “other steps judged appropriate”, not direct military assistance. That will hardly leave Putin quaking in his boots.As if this embrace of Putin’s wishlist were not enough, Trump’s plans move toward lifting sanctions against Russia and readmitting it to the Group of 8, from which it wasexcludedwhen it forcibly seized Ukraine’s Crimea. The removal of sanctions would make it easier for Putin to rebuild his military for a possible next invasion.One insidiously dangerous part of the plan is the amnesty it promises Russian forces for their atrocities in Ukraine. Beyond the brazen criminality of Putin’s invasion – a clear act ofaggression– Russian forces have systematicallytargetedUkrainian civilians and civilian infrastructure – blatant war crimes. The international criminal court (ICC) has already charged four Russian militarycommandersforattackingUkraine’s electrical infrastructure. Putin himself, and his children’s rights commissioner, have beenchargedfor kidnapping Ukrainian children. If he has his way, Trump will sweep these and future charges under the rug.Fortunately, Trump has no such power over the ICC. The only way todeprivethe ICC of jurisdiction would be through repeated annual resolutions of the UN security council. Even assuming that the United States and Russia (along with Russia’s ally, China) would support such amnesties, Britain and France, as the other veto-wielding permanent members, would have to go along, year after year.Dangling such an amnesty is a virtual invitation to more atrocities. Trump’s offer suggests to Putin that, as ceasefire negotiations progress, he may as well continue committing atrocities because in the end, Trump will arrange to absolve him. The day after Trump’s plan became public, another Russian glide bombhitan apartment in southern Ukraine, killing five people and injuring 10, including a teenage girl.The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has understandably treated the plan as a “vision” rather than a final offer. Wary of offending Trump, who must approve continuingsalesof US arms to Ukraine, Zelenskyy said he wouldnegotiateon the basis of the plan. But to underwrite a lasting peace in Ukraine, Trump’s plan needs not a few Band-Aids but major surgery. Let’s hope that Trump hasn’t again fallen so much under Putin’s spell that he has lost the ability to see the major faults in his proposal.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.

But it’s certainly not the prospect of running out of toilet paper in the minimum-security prison where she’s residing. Maxwell is serving a 20-year-sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation. Rather than doing hard time, however, it seems Maxwell is having a relatively easy go of it. While most inmates get an allocation of two rolls of toilet paper per week, for example,CNN reportsthat Maxwell gets an unlimited supply.Bountiful bog roll isn’t the only privilege being extended to Maxwell. The very fact that she was transferred to the federal prison camp (FPC) in Bryan, Texas, has prompted uproar and claims of special treatment. Maxwell, to jog your memory, was originally held at a federal detention facility in Brooklyn, New York, then sent to a Florida facility in 2022, where she complained about poor conditions and “possumsfalling from the ceiling”.It’s not entirely clear why she was transferred out of the possum prison, but it may have had something to do with a visit paid to her in July by Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, who was previously Trump’s personal defense attorney. What did the pair talk about? I’m so glad you asked! In the interests of transparency, which the Trump administration is very keen on when it suits them, the chat between Blanche and Maxwell was recorded and released to the public. And, what do you know, Maxwell wasemphaticthat she “never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way”. She was moved from the Florida facilitywithin days.Ever since the transfer, which a prison consultant called “unprecedented”, there have been reports that Maxwell is being treated like a VIP. Earlier this month, for example, the Democratic congressman Jamie Raskinsent a letterto Trump noting that “the deference and servility to Ms. Maxwell [at FPC Bryan] have reached such preposterous levels that one of the top officials at the facility has complained that he is ‘sick of having to be Maxwell’s bitch’”.Raskin’s letter also claims that “FPC Bryan Warden Hall, has heaped favorable concierge-style treatment on Ms. Maxwell since her bizarre arrival at the institution,” including special meals, access to technology, puppies to play with, and special use of the exercise facilities.Emails written by Maxwell that were recentlyseen by the Atlanticfurther reinforce the idea that the disgraced socialite is having a relatively comfortable time behind bars. “The food is legions better [than at the facility in Florida], the place is clean, the staff responsive and polite,” Maxwell wrote in one email to her brother reviewed by the Atlantic. “I am much much happier.”Well, good for you, Ghislaine. But the fact that the US seems to have a two-tiered legal system should make everyone else very unhappy indeed. This isn’t really about Maxwell: it’s about who our legal system protects and who it punishes.Maxwell, it cannot be stressed enough, is no victim or unwitting accomplice. She came from a world of power and privilege and used her status to prey on vulnerable young girls. Maxwell hasn’t just been accused of procuring girls for Epstein to abuse; she’s been accused of actively participating in the abuse. In 2021, for example, a woman identified by the pseudonym “Jane”testifiedin Maxwell’s sex-trafficking trial that she’d met the socialite when she was 14. At first Maxwell and Epstein made her feel special. Then, according to Jane, the abuse started, and Maxwell would occasionally join in.The fact that she has been accused of serious crimes isn’t to say that Maxwell should be thrown into a dungeon and left to sustain herself on foraged possum. I strongly believe that all incarcerated people should be held in humane conditions and given a chance to rehabilitate themselves. Alas, that’s far from the case. While Maxwell apparently doespilatesand plays with puppies, prisoners without the sort of connections she has are rotting away.This is particularly true of women in the US, who aredisproportionatelylocked up in jails rather than state prisons. According to a2024 reportby the Prison Policy Initiative, more than 60% of women in jails under local control haven’t been convicted of a crime yet and are awaiting trial. This, the Prison Policy Initiative posits, is because “incarcerated women, who have lower incomes than incarcerated men, have an even harder time affording money bail.” Local jails tend to offer fewer services and programs than prisons do and offer more limited communication options; it’s significantlymore expensiveto call people from jail than prison, for example.The lesson from all this? If you’re going to be a criminal, make sure you’ve got a lot of money and the right connections. Worst case scenario you end up in a plush correctional facility with unlimited toilet paper. Best case scenario, you end uppresidentof the US.South Carolina fails (for now) to advance the most restrictive abortion bill in the USThe state currently has a six-week abortion ban with limited exceptions for rape, incest and the mother’s health. That’s not enough forsome anti-abortion advocates, who recently advanced a bill that would repeal exceptions for the rape, incest and fetal anomalies and, asABC Newsput it, “make abortion a felony comparable to ‘the homicide of a person born alive’”. The bill, which was discussed on Tuesday, also contained language which might be used to ban hormonal birth control and limit in vitro fertilization. While thisparticular billhas now stalled, expect more efforts to criminalize abortion.Donald Trump told a female reporter: ‘Quiet, piggy’Trump didn’t justlash outat the Bloomberg reporter.The president also lashed outat another female journalist after she asked Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (sometimes nicknamedMohammed Bone Saw) about the brutal murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “These incidents are not isolated; they are part of an unmistakable pattern of hostility – often directed at women – that undermines the essential role of a free and independent press,” the Society of Professional Journalists said in astatementWednesday.

Turns out my mum was right all alongRhiannon Lucy CosslettIn the 90s my mum embarrassed me with her rejection of ultra-processed foods – but the growing body of evidence about them is vindicating herSat 22 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 22 Nov 2025 09.13 ESTShareAvery specific childhood experience arose from being a “weird-lunchbox kid” growing up in the 90s with a food-conscious mother. It was the sense of palpitating trepidation felt when opening your school lunchbox, knowing that what lay within was going to be seen as “weird” in comparison with the sliced-white-bread-plastic-ham sandwiches, cheesy Wotsits and Club biscuits everyone else was gobbling.What’s that?” your classmate would ask, their nose wrinkling as they took in yesterday’s veggie curry, crumbling homemade falafel or – my mother’s speciality – a “deconstructed sandwich” of doorstop-thick fresh bread, filling of some kind (often cucumber) and attendant crumbs floating freely in the bag. (Why bother assembling at all?, my father asked once, when you could simply throw in all the elements and shake?)Now, though, it’s 2025, and the weird-lunchbox kids, but more importantly their parents, have been vindicatedby continuing revelations about the dire health outcomes ofeating ultra-processed foods(UPFs). Most recently, diets with high levels of UPFhave been linked toharm in every major organin the human body, not to mention a range of health conditions. News to some but not my mother, a pioneer of healthy eating and cooking from scratch, an early adopter of quinoa and reader of food-packet ingredients. This was the age ofCheestringsandMicro Chips– I still know the jingle for the latter by heart – yet my mother doggedly resisted. At best, her insistence that such food was unhealthy fell on deaf ears, and at worst, was rudely mocked, not least by me. I knewwhat an E-number wasbefore I knew my times tables. If an unrefined carb existed, my mother knew about it.These days,people talk about UPFsin general conversation. Books and social media accounts devoted to eliminating them from your diet have hundreds of thousands of followers. It must be a strange feeling for my mother, after being ignored – and even actively fought – on the topic for so long. I’ve written before about having tohide Super Noodles packetsin the same way my friends hid packs of 10 cigarettes, a line that still makes her laugh uproariously. We once had a row about a packet of Pom-Bear crisps. There were times where all I wanted to do was eat like other children, and that battle played out on a weekly basis in our house. Mine can’t be the only weird-lunchbox mum who is left with an abiding feeling of “I told you so”. And I can’t be the only weird-lunchbox kid who, after decades of pushback, is left with a feeling of … what’s that – guilt? Or, perhaps even stranger, could it be gratitude?6:52How we created ultra-processed food from industrial waste – videoI’m a mother myself, now, and I mostlycook from scratch, as does my husband. Ready meals are a rarity in our house. Now I’m the one standing in the supermarket aisle, reading long lists of ingredients on the back of packets. Like my own mother, I try to do a roast most Sundays and, while I have occasionally resorted to gravy granules, I mostly make my own from meat juices, as she taught me, and as her mother taught her. I say this not to boast, but to highlight the benefits of education around food and cooking. Those skills have made such a difference to my ability to feed myself and my family in a healthy way. I feel I owe my mum a great deal of thanks for that.Too much discussion of UPFs is divorced from issues of class and economics, and feels shaming, particularly of women. Cooking from scratch doesn’t make me better than someone who can’t. It only means that I was taught how to do so, and have the resources to. I am fortunate enough to be able to buy the sausages from the butcher that have fewer additives. In the 90s, my mum, who was feeding us on a shoestring budget, used to have to go to the health food shop, or would drive out of her way to the supermarket that sold the cheapest cuts of meat. Not everyone has enough time to do that, or to cook from scratch,especially in 2025 when we are working longer hours than ever.In some ways, it is easier than ever to eat healthily, in thatalternatives to UPFsare more widely and readily available. That’s a positive outcome of this debate’s prominence, though the cost of living remains a huge barrier. What I like less is when the moral burden is placed on individuals, usually poor ones, as opposed to the retailers and corporations profiting from the sale of UPFs. Years before this conversation reached the mainstream,my mum would insistthat the problem was systemic, and requires systemic solutions. She’s also never gone full Gwyneth Paltrow: I’m pretty sure she’d still rather consume cheese from a can thansmoke crack cocaine.And look, I’m not going to say sorry to her for being 13 and wanting to eat a packet of Pom-Bears. Sometimes, I just don’t want to hear it, especially as everyone else is banging on about junk food now as well. We still don’t see eye to eye on Super Noodles, though I’ve graduated to proper packet ramen.A recent studylinked instant noodles to serioushealth conditionsdue to their high levels of salt, so in that sense my mum has always been right. In another, they’re just so delicious I can’t help myself.

Sisse Marie Welling, the new lord mayor, represents neither the mainstream right nor the far right but the Green Left (Socialistisk Folkeparti, known as SF). This should be a major wake-up call for centre-left parties across Europe. After more than a decade taking the wrong lessons from Denmark, it is finally time to learn theright lesson: copying the far right not only fails to turn on far-right voters, it also turnsoffprogressive voters.The 21st century has so far seen two simultaneous electoral developments in western Europe: the decline of social-democratic parties and the rise of far-right parties. This has created thepowerful narrativethat social democrats are losing votes to the far right, in particular because of their (alleged) “pro-immigration” positions. And although research shows that theirvoters mainly movedto centre-right and green parties, social-democratic parties have been chasing this mythical “left behind” voter ever since.Research by social scientistsoverwhelmingly showsthat adopting far-right positions leads neither to electoral success for centrist parties nor to electoral defeat for far-right parties. But this has not stopped centre-left advisers, politicians and strategists. Whenever my colleagues and I refer to this research, someone will point to the alleged success of the “Danish model”. The lure is so great that even as polls werepredicting the lossof Copenhagen, Britain’s Labour government ignoredinternal oppositionand introduced a number of policiesdesigned to emulateDenmark’s extremely stringent asylum rules.To be clear, the Danish model has never worked. Although the nativist turnpredatesthe current Social Democrat party leader, Mette Frederiksen made it her signature policy, not just asprime ministerof Denmark but also during theDanish presidencyof the EU. Her victory in 2019’s general election did not represent a great electoral surge: the party lost 0.4% of the vote but, because of specific bloc politics, regained the premiership. In 2022, her party did make small electoral gains (1.6%) but only remained in office by governing with the mainstream right. Currently, the party pollsjust above 20%, and is expected to reach a historic low result in next year’s legislative election.At the same time, the far right has not been defeated. The main far-right party, the Danish People’s party (DPP), which was already on adownward trendbefore the ascent of Frederiksen, saw a modest comeback in this week’s local elections. At the same time, new far-right parties, such as the New Right (NB) and the Denmark Democrats (DD) have emerged. Today, the DPP and DD togetherpoll closeto the record high of the DPP in 2015.Other social democrats should learn the right lessons this time. Opportunistic and often half-hearted anti-immigrant policies will not win over far-right voters. Moreover, their nativist turnwillpush away progressive voters, particularly younger ones, who want a party that is socioeconomically and socioculturally leftwing. This is particularly visible in Britain, where Keir Starmer’s desperate attempts to win over Reform UK voters is failing miserably, asLabour haemorrhages supportto the Greens and Lib Dems.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rather than cherish these cities and voters, the centre left has taken them for granted; even worse – again copying the far right – some of their politicians have insulted them, for instance as “woke warriors”.This has led to the rise of green and new-left parties, such as SF and Unity List in Copenhagen, and even a return of reformed communists, as in Austria’s second city,Graz. What sets these progressive competitors apart from the Social Democrats is not just their more outspoken leftwing agendas, but also theage of their electorate. Whereas social-democratic parties have some of theoldest electoratesand their membership is often literally dying off, their left competitors are particularly popular among young voters, including many with a minority background.In short, social-democratic parties should stop chasing after far-right voters. This strategy is not just unsuccessful in the short run; by failing to win over these voters, it leads to the loss of progressive voters and prevents the rejuvenation of their ageing electorate in the future. To remain relevant, they must promote an outspokenprogressive agenda, both in terms of cultural and economic issues. If they don’t, they will lose their last remaining political strongholds and their potential future electorate. That is the real lesson from the failed Danish model.Cas Mudde is the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, and author of The Far Right TodayDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Are you deeply moved by the arts or nature? Do you become overwhelmed when a lot is going on around you? Do you have difficulty with big changes?For as long as I can remember, I’ve seemed to feel life more intensely than many other people. I move through my days flayed open, exposed to the world. I can smell food, the ocean, flowers when no one else seems to. A beautiful sunrise will send me into ecstatic rapture. I am fascinated by and in awe of the smallest daily occurrences.Large social events such as weddings can leave me overwhelmed to the point of dissociation. Once, when driving on the freeway, I saw a driver swerve to intentionally hit a brown snake with his tyres. I sobbed so hard I had to pull over. Because it wasn’t just that snake. For a moment, that cruelty and suffering seemed connected to all other cruelty and suffering, part of the same invisible weave, and it was all happeningnow. Could anyone else feeleverything all at once, I wondered.Melissa Leong: ‘Life is not easy. Life is ugly and hard and unpredictable’Read moreThen the quiz. A label. I was a Highly Sensitive Person.The term “Highly Sensitive Person” (HSP) wascoined by the psychologist Elaine Aron in the mid-1990s. According to Aron and subsequent researchers, HSPs have high levels of sensory processing sensitivity, a biologically influenced personality trait (like introversion and extraversion) that is built into the nervous system. The theory is that the HSP is more responsive to stimuli, processes experiences more deeply, is strongly attuned to aesthetic influences, and lives with a vivid, complex inner world. While not a disorder that may be diagnosed by a psychologist or through an official test,studies have foundthere are differences in brain regions of people high in sensory processing sensitivity.These were my people. This was me. I felt seen.After the online quiz, I read everything I could about my newfound label. I signed up for an email newsletter for HSPs and treated it like a bible. There were philosophical quotes, photos of bookshelves and lush forests, discussions about the ache of being human.These were my people. This was me. I felt seen.It wasn’t long before being a HSP became suffused with my identity. I slipped it over my head like a jumper, wrapping both arms around my body tight. It was comforting, validating and empowering – until it wasn’t.Seven Ordinary Sounds HSPSShould Avoid,the online article headlines read.Why Highly Sensitive People should identify their triggers before every social situation;Eleven Things HSPsMust Have to Feel at Peace.I mostly considered being a HSP a gift. It charges daily life with beauty and meaning and infuses my writing with more depth. But I also recognised its downsides, and had sometimes struggled with the challenges of feeling everything so deeply. But now it seemed I need to protect myself, to curate my world, in ways I hadn’t even thought of.The newsletter and social media accounts I’d started to follow told me there were things I could and couldn’t do. Things Imust haveto feel peace. They told me that I was fragile, always at risk of collapsing with burnout. They gave me a daily to do list, items such as “environmental scans” to avoid undesirable stimulus. There was a link to a hat with the word “overwhelmed” printed on the front. This online world taught me to turn my personality into a pathology, to view all of my experiences – past, present and future – through the lens of my label. When I did this, the world went from being an occasionally stressful place to one full of landmines – threatening, triggering.I became very good at privately rehearsing future events in my mind in the name of self-preservation: if I go to those birthday drinks for too long then I will feel overwhelmed and I won’t have a good sleep, then I’ll be really tired tomorrow but my coffee will give me a headache, then I won’t be able to concentrate during this work phone call, and then and then and then. I listed my fears until they felt like facts, my thoughts pulling me along by a phantom leash.I soon realised that I’d created a mental cage out of my sensitivity, transforming it into anxiety. The more I focused on it, the more stressed I felt, and the more I needed to control my surroundings to protect myself.In recent years, self-labelling and self-diagnosis have become increasingly common, as people turn to online information, symptom language and identity frameworks to make sense of their inner experience. But experts warn this can sometimes be more harmful than helpful.“These days, because we have access to so much information and certain psychological diagnoses and presentations have become part of the general discourse, self-diagnosis can be a problem,” says Hannah Jensen, a clinical psychologist on Victoria’s Surf Coast. “Some people may become hyper vigilant to symptoms of the self-diagnosis, which may lead to heightened distress without the support of a qualified professional. The diagnosis could also be incorrect, or people could be over pathologising appropriate emotional experiences – for example, sadness or grief could be labelled as depression.”Sensitivity is a biological tendency, not a fixed identity.I’d gained a label that made me feel understood, but I’d lost the ability to see my life for what it is: moment to moment experiences I can react to as an individual human being, not a personality trait that dictates how I operate in the world.I wanted to enjoy the “good” without suffering the “bad” of being a HSP, but I also didn’t want to live inside a bubble-wrapped universe of my own making. Was that possible? I began to wonder if I had more power than the label had taught me.I long to carpe diem! How can I be more present? | Leading questionsRead moreThe brain, it turns out, is extremely malleable when it comes to how we respond to the world. Over time I’ve learned cognitive retraining techniques and grounding practices – but mostly I’ve learned that sensitivity is a biological tendency, not a fixed identity. My nervous system may be wired a little differently but my attention is still mine to direct, and when I stop scanning the world for threats I’m more available to notice the sheer magic of being alive.I unsubscribed to that newsletter, and now my life involves very little overwhelm but just as much beauty and awe. Before, I felt seen. Now, I feel free. I know which one I prefer.Miranda Luby is a writer and journalistExplore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingMental healthInternetHealthAustralian lifestylecommentShareReuse this content"

Not me. Although as a lapsed Catholic I had little stake in the conclave race, I felt that there was something unglamorous, dare I say godless, about a first-ever supreme pontiff born in the US, let alone one hailing from Chicago, the same city as Hugh Hefner, Hillary Clinton and Kanye West. There were greater apprehensions beyond taste, too. Would this finally be the ordination of the reinvigorated Maga movement after the death of the compassionate Pope Francis? When Leo appeared on the balcony of St Peter’s Basilica wearing the traditional red mozzetta cape eschewed by his predecessor, it was too easy to jump to conclusions.By the grace of God, the red mozzetta was a red herring. Very quickly, American conservatives went into meltdown over the pope’s patent anti-Maga leanings and his empathy for migrants and marginalised groups – “anti-Trump, anti-Maga, pro-open borders and a total Marxist,”fumed far-right activist Laura Loomer. That alone has been a relief. But perhaps even more significantly, Leo has demonstrated the benefits an American bishop of Rome can have for the rest of us, Christian, Catholic or otherwise: that is through his exemplary cultural leadership, and close engagement with the arts.The Vatican had already released a list of Leo’s favourite films that included The Sound of Music and Ordinary People. Then, last weekend, hesummoned Hollywood starsto the Vatican including Spike Lee, Darren Aronofsky, Cate Blanchett and Greta Gerwig. Even more striking is what he said when addressing this audience, telling them that over time film had evolved into “an expression of the desire to contemplate and understand life, to recount its greatness and fragility and to portray the longing for infinity”. He encouraged film-makers to not shy away from the difficult subjects of violence, isolation and poverty. And he also spoke of “beauty” as an “invocation” andart as a remedy for our digital age, stating: “The logic of algorithms tends to repeat what ‘works’, but art opens up what is possible. Not everything has to be immediate or predictable.” These are curious times indeed whenHollywood flails, algorithms and AI proliferate, and the pope, of all people, has to remind us what art is for.In a world where political leaders are continually preaching the need for aggressive innovation and investment in AI, and where our algorithmic universe constantly threatens us with terrible art (Disney+ has announced plansto stream user-generated AI content), what a relief it is to find a shepherd for inquisitive works made by creative minds, for art that meets a balance of taste, nuance, meaning and wonder. “It’s going to be very difficult to discover the presence of God in AI,” he said in hisfirst interviewafter being elected, or in other words, you offend the Lord with your artless slop.Leo wants to “deepen dialoguewith the world of cinema”. Herecently spoke ofthe need to move “beyond stereotypes and cliches” in media representations of the church and Christian life. So could our American pope be soft-launching plans for a collaboration between the Vatican and Hollywood? It would surely represent something of a ceasefire between the Holy See and pop culture; where The Da Vinci Code, the Twilight series and Madonna’s Like A Prayer had drawn condemnation, it seems that Leo might take a more participatory approach. After all, it was reportedby his brotherthat he watched papal thriller Conclave in preparation of his own sequestering, and the film, despite some of its salacious details and depiction of corrupt cardinals, hasn’t been condemned by Rome.View image in fullscreenThe singer Rosalía whose new album, Lux, has won acclaim for its embrace of Catholic spirituality.Photograph: Publicity imageWhat an opportune moment it is, too, to spearhead Catholicism as a medium for artistic sensitivity, taste and empathy. Widely considered the album of the year, Catalan pop singerRosalía’s new project, Lux, has been heralded for its embrace of Catholic spirituality and invocation of the divine, with its tracks mapping on to the lives of female saints including Saint Olga of Kyiv, Saint Rose of Lima and Saint Hildegard of Bingen. The song Mio Cristo Piange Diamanti, translated to “My Christ cries diamonds”, explores the relationship between Saint Francis and Saint Clare of Assisi, using it as the basis for dialogues about platonic love, spiritual connection and the pain that comes with it. To my mind, Catholicism’s cachet over other denominations has always lay in its appreciation of beauty and glamour – Rosalía and the pope might have different aims and followers but arrive at a similar purpose. Perhaps their next audience should be with each other.It was reported this week thatNew Yorkers are turning to the church, with priests saying that there are soaring numbers of Catholic converts. The idea is that in a world of chaos and polarisation, where everything seems to be falling apart, faith and its ceremonies are providing a sense of balance, calm and clarity amid the storm. It is a purpose well complemented by Leo’s messaging on the arts. Is this tempting me back to mass, or to dig out an old rosary and recite the Apostles’ Creed? No. But in an age seemingly starved of beauty and steadiness, it is strangely heartening to find, in the bishop of Rome, an unlikely custodian of culture. And hey, maybe he and Aronofsky are cooking up something to save Hollywood, as well as our souls.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nearby states have also shuttered all their schools as a precaution.In addition, the national education ministry has ordered that 47 boarding secondary schools across the country be shut.President Bola Tinubu has cancelled international engagements, including attending the G20 summit in Johannesburg, to handle the crisis.The two abduction operations and an attack on a church in the west of the country, in which two people were killed and dozens abducted, have happened since the US president,Donald Trump, threatened military actionover what he called the killing of Christians by radical Islamists in Nigeria.US defence secretary Pete Hegseth called on the government to “take both urgent and enduring action to stop violence against Christians”, during talks with the Nigerian national security adviser, Nuhu Ribadu, the Pentagon said on Friday.Nigeria is still scarred by the kidnapping ofnearly 300 girls by Boko Haramjihadists at Chibok in northeastern Borno state more than a decade ago. Some of those girls are still missing.View image in fullscreenParents pick up their children from a girls’ college in Abuja, Nigeria after the federal government ordered the temporary closure of 41 schools.Photograph: Afolabi Sotunde/EPAIn a video clip shared by CAN, a distraught-looking, unidentified St Mary’s staff member describes hearing the sounds of motorcycles and cars before “there was serious bang, bang on different gates of the compound”.“Children were crying,” she said, describing her panic while looking for keys to the section where the crying was loudest. A security guard was heard groaning and after some time she heard the gang driving away.The “attackers operated aggressively and without interruption for nearly three hours, moving through dormitories”, said the local Catholic diocese.Meanwhile, about 600km away, on the outskirts of Abuja, 40-year-old nurse Stella Shaibu collected her daughter on Saturday from a school in Bwari, after the directive to close some boarding schools.“How can 300 students be taken away at the same time?” she asked, concluding that the “government is not doing anything” to curb insecurity.“If there is something that the American government can do to salvage this situation, I’m totally in support,” she told AFP.In a separate attack on a church in western Nigeria on Tuesday, gunmen killed two people during a service that was being broadcast online. Dozens of worshippers are believed to have been abducted.For years, heavily armed criminal gangs have been killing thousands and conducting kidnappings for ransom in rural areas of northwest and central Nigeria, where there is little state presence.No group has claimed responsibility for the latest attacks but bandit gangs seeking ransom payments often target schools in rural areas where security is weak.Gangs have camps in a vast forest straddling several states in the west.Although bandits have no ideological leanings and are motivated by financial gain, their increasing alliance with jihadists from the north-east has been a source of concern for authorities and security analysts.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It was the ‘you have no cards’ argument again,” said the source, referring to Trump’s claim that Zelenskyy had no cards to play, during acontentious White House meeting back in February.‘They decided to kill us with cold’: Ukrainians struggle against Russian assault on power networkRead moreThe deal now on offer contains a number of provisions that are likely to be unacceptable to Kyiv, including the need to give up territory Russia has occupied, as well as surrendering further territory Kyiv still controls. It also suggests there would be an amnesty for all war crimes committed during the conflict.On Saturday, however, Donald Trump said the plan was not his final offer, and that “one way or the other” he hoped the fighting would stop.On Friday, Zelenskyy gave a video address to the country saying it was “one of the most difficult moments of our history”.Ukrainefaced a choice, he said: “losing our dignity or losing a key ally.”Driscoll, a close friend of the US vice-president, JD Vance, who has only recently been put on the Ukraine portfolio, declined to go into detail about whether the deal on the table matched a 28-point plan that had been published in the press. “Some things matter, some are window dressing – and we most focused on the things that matter,” he said, according to the source.The announcement of the US plans earlier this week blind-sided other Ukraine allies, who had been kept in the dark over the content and format of the plan. There is concern in Europe that Russia has had too much say in negotiating a draft agreement, which is being presented to the Ukrainians as a done deal.Driscoll defended this, saying it kept the process more manageable. “President Trump wants peace now. The more cooks in the kitchen, the harder it is to handle,” he said, according to the source present.Julie Davis, the US chargéed’affaires in Kyiv, was also present at the meeting and told the other diplomats that although the terms of the deal were punishing for Ukraine, it had little choice but to accept or face worse in future. “The deal does not get better from here, it gets worse,” she said.Trump is keen for Zelenskyy to agree to the deal by Thanksgiving, which is on Thursday. Earlier this week, Davis told reporters Trump was pursuing an “aggressive timeline” to get the deal agreed.“We have witnessed an absolutely remarkable pace of diplomatic activity,” she said, speaking on the sidelines of a reception for Driscoll and his US army delegation, attended by senior Ukrainian military figures, at the ambassador’s residence in Kyiv. She said the diplomacy was the “most ambitious” she had seen in her foreign service career.Asked why Kyiv should be forced to give up territory in the east that Russian troops have been unable to capture for 11 years, a US official said the deal “was beneficial to Ukraine”. They said they envisaged Trump and Zelenskyy sitting down together and signing a document “for peace”.The plan was reportedly drafted by Trump aide Steve Witkoff andKremlin adviser Kirill Dmitriev, a relationship that has emerged as a key back channel between Washington and Moscow. Driscoll is expected to head to Russia soon to discuss the plan.On Friday, Vladimir Putin said Moscow had received a copy of the plan. “I believe that it can be used as the basis for a final peaceful settlement,” he told senior security officials.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaNatonewsShareReuse this content"

The Daily Telegraph is Britain’s largest and best quality broadsheet newspaper and I have grown up respecting it. It has a remarkable history and has played a vital role in shaping Britain’s national debate over many decades.”DMGT said that the Mail and Telegraph editorial teams will remain separate and editorially independent, with investment provided to pursue the titles’ goal of becoming a global brand.DMGT said the deal would give “much-needed certainty” to Telegraph staff, who have beenstuck in limboover a sale process that hasdragged on for more than two years.“DMGT and RedBird IMI have worked swiftly to reach the agreement announced today, which will shortly be submitted to the secretary of state,” said a spokesperson for RedBird IMI.The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, will review any deal for the Daily Mail owner DMGT to buy the Telegraph newspaper.A spokesperson for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: “The secretary of state notes the announcement of a prospective new deal. She will review any new buyer acquiring the Telegraph in line with the public interest and foreign state influence media mergers regimes set out in legislation.”Peers call for independent body to take control of Telegraph saleRead moreRedBird Capital, the junior partner in the RedBird IMI consortium, had stepped in after the government introduced rules banning foreign states from owning UK newspapers.IMI is controlled by Abu Dhabi’s Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the vice-president of the United Arab Emirates and the owner of Manchester City FC.Two years ago DMGT had been intalks with Qatari investorsabout backing a bid for the Telegraph group, but later decided against the initiative.Earlier this year the government changed the law to allow foreign states and investors to hold amaximum of a 15% stake in UK newspapers.DMGT said that this deal will comply with the new foreign state influence (FSI) regime “as there will be no foreign state investment or capital in the funding structure”.Explore more on these topicsTelegraph Media GroupDaily Mail & General Trust (Business)Daily Mail & General Trust (Media)National newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesMergers and acquisitionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The result was “unsustainable workloads” and “compromised” patient safety.She raised the alarm in an interview with the Guardian as more than 8,000 GPs signed a letter to the health secretary,Wes Streeting, urging him to take action to train, recruit and retain more doctors and restore patient safety.A fully qualified full-time GP inEnglandis now responsible for 2,241 patients on average, a rise of 304 patients each (16%) in 10 years, Hawthorne said.She said: “The number of patients per GP is rising higher and higher, while our clinical work has become more complex with our ageing population. We don’t have the workforce to manage this safely or give the continuity of care that we know benefits patients.”A RCGP survey of GP practice managers found 61% needed to hire at least another GP in the next 12 months to cope with patient demand. However, 92% of those said a lack of core funding was preventing them from doing so.One practice manager, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “Without additional funding, there is nothing we can do to resolve the situation. In our area the issue used to [be a] lack of people; now we have people available and no money to recruit with.”In the 12 months to September 2025, a record 386m consultations were delivered in England alone – the equivalent of more than a million a day and 86m more than the total in 2019. Yet many patients still face an uphill battle to get an appointment.Hawthorne said: “We know how frustrating it can be for our patients when they struggle to see their GP. It’s also frustrating for us when we know patients are struggling to access our services.“The reality is GPs and our teams are delivering more appointments than ever, but we’re struggling to keep up as patient numbers grow, the care they need becomes more complex, and practices are hamstrung by a lack of funding to hire the GPs they need.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Guardian reported last week that hospital consultants were gearing up to join resident doctors in striking over pay.At the England local medical committee conference earlier this month, grassroots GPs passed a motion for medics to refuse to comply with new online access requirements for surgeries.From 1 October, GP surgeries in England have been required to keep their online consultation platform open for the duration of their working hours for non-urgent appointment requests, medication queries and admin requests.The motion condemned the changes as “a cynical political stunt that is unfunded, unsafe and knowingly undeliverable in the context of current workforce collapse”.In the letter to Streeting signed by GPs, Hawthorne wrote: “We cannot keep expecting general practice to provide timely, safe care for patients if we simply do not have the means to do so.“We know that when it comes to theNHS, access to GPs is the top priority for patients … Growing concern around GP access comes as no surprise given practices around the country cannot afford to hire enough GPs to keep up with demand.”The Department ofHealthand Social Care said it was “grateful” to GPs for their “crucial work”, adding: “We have placed them at the heart of our 10-year health plan and our neighbourhood health services.”A spokesperson said it had recruited 2,500 GPs, scrapped half of GP targets in order to reduce red tape and provided an extra £1.1bn in funding.However, Hawthorne said the extra funding had been blunted by the government’s decision to increase national insurance contributions. The RCGP survey found 83% of practice managers cited the rise in NICs as a driving factor in being unable to hire doctors.She said: “We need more GPs – thousands more – but practices also need to be funded properly to hire them. We need the government to provide real detail – including numbers – in the 10-year workforce plan, on how we are to get the promised thousands more GPs on the frontline, delivering patient care.“A plan without numbers isn’t a plan at all, and while the government has made a number of promising commitments, we need a clear roadmap out of this crisis.”Explore more on these topicsGPsDoctorsNHSEnglandWes StreetingHealthHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

Punishing vulnerable workers for standing up for their agreed terms and conditions should be illegal,” the former transport secretary said. She added that the “Labour government needs to make sure they are standing on the side of the powerless against such exploitative practices”.DPD, which reported pre-tax profits of nearly £200m last year and raised the pay of its highest-paid director by £90,000 to £1.5m including bonuses,told self-employed driversit was unilaterally cutting their delivery rates. The drivers said the move would cost them about £6,000 each per year – or up to £8,000 for those who take on extra deliveries at Christmas.View image in fullscreenLouise Haigh was transport secretary from July to November last year.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesScores refused to carry out deliveries for the firm for three days in response. While DPD partially backed down after a meeting with workers’ representatives on day one, the drivers returned to work. But it was only a temporary reprieve, with the firm vowing to go ahead with the rate-cuts in the new year.After that meeting, DPDsacked drivers for having spoken outabout the way it was treating them.Labour have put improving the lot of workers – including protecting them from unfair treatment – at the heart of its plans in government.Fears were expressed about ministers’ commitment to that when prominent backers of the employment rights bill – Angela Rayner, Justin Madders and Jonathan Reynolds – left important ministerial positions. But Downing Street insisted it would push it through parliament, and it is expected to become law soon.But, while the bill’s sweeping changes are expected togrant greater security to more than a million workers, they may not prevent firms treating their workers the way DPD has done. And Haigh has called on her party colleagues to make good on the spirit of their promises to workers by backing those fired by the delivery firm.She spoke after the Labour peer Peter Hendy said further changes to the law should be made to protect drivers such as those fired by DPD. “The protection against dismissal or detriment for trade union activities only applies to the activities of an independent trade union,” he said, adding that the drivers might not enjoy such a status.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It should be unlawful.”Dean Hawkins, who acted as a spokesperson for the DPD drivers taking action to protect their pay and was sacked for speaking out, said he was happy to have Haigh’s backing.“The government should be doing more to support workers in our position,” he said. “You’ve got to remember: it was only a few short years ago that delivery drivers were keeping the country and businesses running during the pandemic.“Any government should support our cause and make some clear rules and a lot more regulations for companies like DPD to save this happening again in future. So many have lost our income just before Christmas. It makes me sick, given how much money the drivers generate for the company.”A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said: “Every company should treat the people who work for them with respect and fulfil their obligations as a responsible employer.

Behind metal gates away from public view, specialists in hazmat suits dig through the mountain of waste dumped on an industrial scale in a woodland that is a protected site of special scientific interest.The £15m cleanup of Hoad’s Wood in Kent began this summer, five long years after local residents first started to complain about illegal dumping in the protected woodland. In some cases they provided the names of companies involved and footage of the activities to the police, the local authority and theEnvironment Agency.It took a tenacious high-profile campaign by residents and environmental NGOs, and the threat of a legal class action, to force the Environment Agency to clean up the woodland after government intervention.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of thousands of tonnes of illegal waste dumped within the ancient woodland, Hoad’s Wood.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyView image in fullscreenA view of thousands of tonnes of illegal waste dumped within Hoad’s Wood in Ashford, Kent.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PABut asorganised criminals increase their involvementin waste crime, labelled the “new narcotics”, the scale of the environmental disaster they are creating is spreading.Across the country there are another six illegal waste dumps of similar size to Hoad’s Wood, or bigger, stretching from Lancashire to Cornwall, whose locations and activities are known to the Environment Agency.But the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of waste, from household rubbish to toxic rubber, building materials and heavy metals, remain in situ with little or no prospect of any multimillion-pound cleanup in the foreseeable future.View image in fullscreenAsbestos and household waste illegally fly-tipped overnight on a country lane in Wexham, Buckinghamshire.Photograph: Maureen McLean/Alamy Live NewsIn some cases, hazardous, polluting waste on farmland and business estates has been there for several years. Two of the large dumps – one near Sittingbourne in Kent and one in Camborne, Cornwall – appeared more recently and are still receiving illegal waste despite the activities being known to the agency.The EA says that in Kent investigations are ongoing “with a view to stopping activity”, and that in Cornwall large-scale deposits have been stopped. But many argue stronger action needs to be taken much sooner by authorities to stop the dumping and prevent further environmental damage and hazards to the public.In its recent inquiry into waste crime, the House of Lords environment committee found the Environment Agency was slow to respond to even the most flagrant and serious illegality, while the environment and communities suffered.For many, Hoad’s Wood has become a symbol of the broken system; infiltrated by criminal gangs drawn by the promise of huge illegal profits and allowed to operate with impunity.“Broken systems create broken results and what we need is a fundamental change,” said John Russell, a Liberal Democrat peer who was a prominent campaigner for the cleanup of Hoad’s Wood. “I don’t want us to become like Italy where some kind of mafia is controlling all of this. It feels a bit like we are using the Keystone Cops against this criminal activity. I just want a serious organised crime approach applied to the problem of serious organised crime.”View image in fullscreenAn illegal dump site in Wigan. The local council estimates it will cost £4.5m to remove the 25,000 tonnes of putrid waste.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesToday four of the big illegal dumps known to the Environment Agency are closed and inactive. But the agency, which is the lead investigator of serious waste crime, does not have the money or the inclination to clear up the equivalent of six Hoad’s Woods itself. Its tactic is to force the perpetrators to clear up their pollution. Yet even where perpetrators are arrested, and successfully prosecuted, a cleanup is far from certain.In Burnley, Lancashire, the Environment Agency successfully prosecuted 77-year-old John Allison in 2021 for waste crime.Allison oversaw the large-scale dumping of mixed household and commercial waste, including hazardous materials, at two sites in Colne, which reaped him illegal profits of more than £800,000. He was jailed for three years in 2021, and later ordered to pay £368,682.50 after the Environment Agency pursued him under the Proceeds of Crime Act.But Allison has failed to pay up,and two years ago was sent back to prison for three years and five monthswith no money recouped.Map of UKMatthew Scott, the police and crime commissioner for Kent, said the six large illegal dump sites across the country that the Environment Agency has identified were the tip of the iceberg. “I know of six in Kent alone,” he said.Scott said Hoad’s Wood showed how even the most egregious illegal waste dumping was not dealt with quickly enough. “Everyone was aware of it for years, while there was back and forth about who was responsible,” he said. “It is now costing the agency £15m to clear it up, that is just not going to be a sustainable amount to pay for all these other six large sites.“This activity needs to be stopped much earlier, prevented from happening. That £15m is money that could have been spent on investigators to prevent this.”Labour has increased the Environment Agency budget for tackling waste crime by 50%, to £15.6m. But critics say it is just not armed for the task, either with the capability to tackle organised criminals or the investigators required to deal with the crime on such a scale.The agency has a small team dedicated to waste crime, and it is now focusing its efforts on the latest shocking example of organised criminals apparently dumping waste with impunity in a three-acre field alongside the River Cherwell, outside Kidlington, Oxfordshire.View image in fullscreenA large pile of fly-tipped waste is seen dumped in a field between the River Cherwell and the A34 near Kidlington, Oxfordshire.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesThe mountain of waste,which contains household rubbish collected by local authorities, poses an immediate risk to water quality, and is already seeping into the river.Calum Miller, the local MP, has called for an urgent ministerial direction to the Environment Agency to start a cleanup as an environmental disaster unfolds in his constituency. The agency was alerted to suspicious activity on the site and in July issued a cease and desist notice to the landowner. But under the noses of the authorities, criminals dumped what is thought to be thousands of tonnes of household waste in September, before the agency finally blocked the gates to the field with a court order last month.When images of the vast Kidlington waste mountain emerged a few days ago, Russell said he found it unbelievable. “It felt like Hoad’s Wood has been allowed to happen all over again,” he said. “The EA first knew about Kidlington in July. They responded at the time, but didn’t leave a trail cam or anything.“And now, I don’t know how many thousands of tonnes of waste has been dumped with impunity and these criminals have got away with it yet again. It is just not good enough. It is an environmental disaster.”An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “We work tirelessly to protect our environment and communities from the abhorrent act of waste crime.“Last year alone, our dedicated teams successfully stopped activity at 743 illegal waste sites and we took immediate action to close the site at Kidlington to prevent more waste from being illegally tipped.“We will always work closely with partners to bring waste-dumping criminals to justice and stopping illegal activity through tough enforcement action and prosecution. The public can also help to stop waste criminals by reporting any suspicious waste activities to our anonymous helpline.”Explore more on these topicsWasteEnvironment AgencyLocal governmentOrganised crimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I do not believe I ever met her either. Neither would I joke about killing a woman.“I only heard about the incident weeks later when I was on a military exercise in Canada. Only much later than that was I told a body had been found in a tank.“I never booked the hotel room, can’t remember ever being in it. I think we were back in camp by midnight.”He said he was a medic who had treated people on the battlefield. “Agnes was stabbed in the abdomen. She would have lost a lot of blood. If I killed her and dumped her body, there would have been blood over my clothes and hands. There was none.”He added: “There is no basis in fact to any suggestion I murdered Agnes Wanjiru. I am sorry if that is hard for her family to hear, but it was not me.”Purkiss will appear at the same court on Monday for a further bail application hearing.Explore more on these topicsUK newsKenyanewsShareReuse this content"

Their purpose was to cause prolonged incapacitation to people, including “loss of consciousness or sedation or hallucination or incoherence or paralysis and disorientation”.The only time a CNS-acting weapon was used at scale was by the Russian Federation in 2002to end the Moscow theatre siege. Security forces used fentanyl derivatives to end the siege, in which armed Chechen militants had taken 900 theatregoers hostage.Most of the hostages were freed, but more than 120 died from the effects of the chemical agents and an undetermined number suffered long-term damage or died prematurely.Since then, research has made significant advances. The academics argue that the ability exists to create much more “sophisticated and targeted” weapons that would once have been unimaginable.Dando said: “The same knowledge that helps us treat neurological disorders could be used to disrupt cognition, induce compliance, or even in the future turn people into unwitting agents.”The threat is “real and growing” but there are gaps in international arms control treaties preventing it from being tackled effectively, they say.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Crowley is an honorary visiting senior research fellow at Bradford’s peace studies and international development division.This weekend they will travel to The Hague, where an international body called the Conference of the States Parties (CSP) will gather for its 30th session. The CSP oversees the implementation of theChemical Weapons Convention.The book makes the case for a new “holistic arms control” framework, rather than relying on existing arms control treaties. It sets out a number of practical steps that could be taken, including establishing a working group on CNS-acting and broader incapacitating agents. Other proposals concern training, monitoring and definitions.“We need to move from reactive to proactive governance,” said Dando.Both men acknowledge that we are learning more about the brain and the central nervous system, which is good for humanity. They said they were not trying to stifle scientific progress and it was about preventing malign intent.Crowley said: “This is a wake-up call.

Beyond the disordered chairs and tables and the sign instructing neighbours and friends to “pay whatever you like”, the ridge falls away to fields, then a fence, then hills littered with the skeletal ruins of shattered Lebanese villages.The 44-year-old brewer is standing in front of the house his grandfather built when the Manara kibbutz was founded in the 1940s in the very far north of Israel. The building was hit repeatedly by missiles fired byHezbollahduring the conflict, which ended a year ago, and will now almost certainly be demolished, along with most of the neighbouring houses.“Wars destroy things, but bring opportunities too,” Erlich said.There is a bipartisan consensus inIsraelthis weekend that a fresh military offensive to “finish the job” of destroying Hezbollah’s military capabilities is imminent.View image in fullscreenNoam Ehrlich called the war a ‘blessing in disguise’.Photograph: Jason Burke/The GuardianIsrael threatens to step up attacks against Hezbollah in LebanonRead moreThe left-leaning Haaretz newspaper told readers last week that the“immediate flash point”was “now in Lebanon, not Gaza”, while Amit Segal, a journalist close to the ruling coalition government of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said that “a dramatic escalation against Hezbollah” was “more likely than not”.On the border, there is a tense calm.Israel’s air defence systems protected local communities from most of the rocket barrages launched by Hezbollah in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza, but 47 civilians in Israel and 83 Israeli soldiers died, with hundreds more wounded, and tens of thousands displaced. Israel’s major offensive in autumn last year delivered a series of devastating blows to Hezbollah but also killed an estimated3,800 peoplein Lebanon, including many civilians, and forced 1.2 million from their homes. Damage was estimated at $8.5bn (£6.5bn).Erlich, like many along the Israeli side of the border, is sanguine about the future. Though he has lost his home and the microbrewery that provided his income when forced to evacuate Manara, he switched production to large commercial breweries in central Israel and now sells ten times more.“The war was a blessing in disguise,” he said.Most of those Israelis who evacuated in the first days of the war have now returned to border communities, or others are taking their place.Metula, the northernmost town in Israel, was turned into an army base during the war and 80% of its houses were damaged by missiles launched by Hezbollah from positions insideLebanon, but just hundreds of metres away. The pre-war population was 1,670. It is now 900. In the war, “some won, some lost,” said David Azoulay, Metula’s mayor.The town’s 130-year-old synagogue is being reconstructed, the road repaved and the town hall’s roof replaced.View image in fullscreenDavid Azoulay said Metula would be rebuilt better than it had been.Photograph: Jason Burke/The Guardian“We didn’t have funds to fix many of the buildings that needed work before the war … Now we are going to make the whole of this town way better than it was … We can build up luxury facilities, cultural opportunities, better health and childcare, build a new neighbourhood,” said Azoulay.But it is clear that whatever the new investment in some communities along Israel’s northern border, there are some former residents who will not come back. Those with young families have children in school elsewhere in Israel, others have found new jobs, or simply enjoy the convenience and attractions of big cities such as Tel Aviv, almost 125 miles (200 kilometres) away.Students who used to rent cheaply in Metula have stayed away too, but there has been a new influx: 40 families of nationalist and religious Israelis who see the reconstruction of Metula as a worthy cause.“Metula will stay secular [but] we can’t tell them not to come,” said Azulai. “They are Zionists and Jews like us. Personally, I have no problem with them.”The social consequences of the conflict are obvious in Kiryat Shmona, the “capital city” of the north, which is still missing around a quarter of its pre-war population. In a small mall on the northern outskirts, a third of shops and restaurants remain closed, and those that have reopened struggle.“I have to work my ass off to make ends meet,” said Sergio Helman, who kept serving humus and salad in his Blue Bus cafe throughout the war, despite rocket attacks.But Helman’s children, sent away during the conflict, have got used to life elsewhere in Israel and are in no hurry to return.“Things are slowly getting back to normal but the war created inner conflicts within communities here. There are kids who went to three schools in two years,” said Helman.View image in fullscreenNew residents and businesses have moved to Metula to replace original residents who are not returning.Photograph: Jason Burke/The GuardianResidents of Kiryat Shmona have long complained of being economically disadvantaged and forgotten by national politicians.“This city is important strategically for Israel. It anchors all our defences across the north … but it’s a ghost town. If people are going to come back we need to give them confidence that we can stop the enemy reaching our children’s beds,” said Yamit Malul Yanai, a local commentator and lawyer.Like many along Israel’s northern border, Malul Yanai frequently refers to the surprise Hamas raid into Israel in October 2023 which killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostage, triggering the war in Gaza.“We need a buffer zone to push the enemy back from our towns, but we are making the same mistakes all over again,” she said.From Metula, the de facto border between Israel and Lebanon runs south and then west along across forested ridges to the Mediterranean. Known as the “blue line”, it has not been formally recognised internationally. Since the ceasefire, Israeli forces have held five hill-top bases between up to a mile and a half inside Lebanon, and are building sections of high walls. The United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon (Unifil) has said at least one is within Lebanese territory, a charge denied by Israel.At Shtula, another Israeli border community evacuated during the war, residents have also been slow to return. A row of damaged homes faces Lebanon, many as yet unrepaired. The Israeli military has built a high concrete barrier just to the north and positioned tanks.Israel used widely banned cluster munitions in Lebanon, photos of remnants suggestRead more“We are fortifying the border … We want a barrier and the military between civilians and the enemy. We also have cameras, weapons systems, soldiers monitoring,” said a senior Israeli officer based close to the border. “We have learned the lessons of Gaza. We understand that the wall is part of the system, not the [whole] system, which was the mistake in Gaza.”From an outpost near Shtula, one of the new Israeli bases inside Lebanon is clearly visible, beyond slopes cleared of forest by the military during its invasion last year. Across a swath of the dry brown hills lies the scattered rubble of destroyed houses in now-deserted villages, starkly white against under the clear blue winter sky.“As long as [the] Lebanese army is not there, then we will have to be there,” the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.Israel has accused Hezbollah of trying to rearm since a US-backed ceasefire last year, and has launched more than 1,000 attacks in Lebanon since the 2024 ceasefire, killing hundreds of people. FreshIsraeli airstrikeshave hit targets across southern Lebanon in recent days.Hezbollah says it has complied with ceasefire requirements for it to withdraw from the border region near Israel, and for the Lebanese army to deploy there. Hezbollah’s leader, Naim Qassem, has refrained so far from ordering the movement’s tens of thousands of fighters to launch any military response to the Israeli strikes.Some analysts say talk of a fresh Israeli offensive may be designed to increase pressure on the Lebanese army to move more aggressively to disarm Hezbollah, but suggest it could also be intended to reinforce support for Israel’s rightwing ruling coalition.Israeli military officials said they were “committed to the ceasefire agreement, but also to Israel’s security”.Azoulay is unconcerned by the prospect of a new attack by Hezbollah.“We will deal with it if it happens,” he said. “All the [Lebanese Shia] villages around us, they are destroyed and basically uninhabitable. If you ask what is our victory, it is that we have been rebuilding for a year and they haven’t put a single pipe back in the ground.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelLebanonHezbollahMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

An online petition garnered more than a million signatures, while many people – including the Grammy-award winning singer Tyla – changed their social media profiles to purple, a colour often associated with women’s rights.View image in fullscreenCampaigners gather in Pretoria for the Women’s Shutdown protest, organised by Women for Change, on the eve of the G20 summit in Johannesburg.Photograph: Kim Ludbrook/EPAIn response to the campaign, the head of the National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC), Dr Bongani Elias Sithole, announced on Friday that it wouldclassify gender-based violence and femicideas a national disaster.The NDMC had previously said that the categorisation did not meet the legal requirements defined in the Disaster Management Act; however, after evaluating “the persistent and immediate life-safety risks posed by ongoing acts of violence”, the centre concluded that it now met the threshold.Women march against gender violence in South Africa as G20 leaders arriveThe minister of cooperative governance and traditional affairs, Velenkosini Hlabisa, welcomed the decision, which will allow authorities to dedicate resources and strengthen their support of existing structures to combat gender-based violence.“The women of our country are crying out that they need much more focus on the issue of gender-based violence,” South African president Cyril Ramaphosa said at a G20 sideline summit for civil society on Thursday. During the event he said the government would classify gender-based violence and femicide as a “crisis”.Women For Change celebrated the announcement on its Instagram account, posting a statement saying “we have won”.“We have written history together. We forced the country to finally confront the truth.” It added that next week it is planning to convene a follow-up meeting to discuss a “detailed action plan and timeline”.Explore more on these topicsViolence against women and girlsWomenG20South AfricaAfricaWomen's rights and gender equalitynewsShareReuse this content"

In a high-risk move, Lutnick and Greer have been invited to lunch with 27 trade ministers who are gathering for a summit on Monday.One insider said: “We need to keep it focused, what we don’t want is individual countries going up to them and demanding deals on this, this and that.”Brussels struck a deal withDonald Trumpat his golf course in Scotland in July to avert his threat of 50% tariffs, instead agreeing a baseline 15% levy on most EU imports into the US.Now Washington officials have made it clear they are frustrated with the EU’s slow pace of implementation on that deal, which is not legally binding and needs to be passed by parliament, a process that could take until February.Among the significant outstanding problems expected to be discussed at Monday’s talks are the continuing50% tariffs on steel and aluminium, separatetariffs on products with steel elements, and food and drink levies.Several member states want to see the removal of the 15% tax on wine and spirits including France, which has been hit by duties on Cognac, Ireland on whiskey and all the wine-producing countries.Before a dinner on Monday night Lutnick and Greer will hold talks with the EU’s trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, its defence commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, and the commissioner responsible for technology, Henna Virkkunen, to discuss the continuing crisis involving chip supply from China.They will also meet industry bosses at a business round table expected to included the heads of Volkswagen and the French company TotalEnergies, said insiders.Persuading the US that the steel derivatives go entirely against spirit of the deal struck in July was a “top priority” said one EU insider.In September, the US listed 407 products that included an element of steel, ranging from knitting needles to wind turbines and washing machines, that would face separate tariffs.And now, as part ofa rolling programmeto protect its industries,it is looking at adding a further 700 productsincluding tin cans and bicycles.Companies such as theGerman agriculture machinery firm Krone, have said the “hidden” tariffs are alarming and causing a nightmare for exporters with US customs officials charging 200% in tariffs to anyone who has failed to complete a mountain of paperwork citing the origin of all steel from the “suppliers” and the “supplier to the supplier to the supplier”.The EU and US will also discuss the prospect of working in alignment to “ringfence” their domestic steel industries to protect against cheaper Chinese imports.Brussels hopes thatsteel anti-dumping proposals announced in October,which match Trump’s steel tariffs, will persuade the US president to slash the 50% tariffs on EU steel.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeEuropean UnionUS foreign policyTrump tariffsDonald TrumpEuropeTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

We took that advice onboard.”View image in fullscreenTom Player, who survived a snowstorm in Patagonia in Chile, which killed five people.Photograph: Tom PlayerHe said: “There is absolutely no way anyone should have been allowed. It was too risky for the mountain rescue teams so why was it open to the public?”Bond, from Truro, died along with Cristina Calvillo Tovar and Julian Garcia Pimentel from Mexico and Nadine Lichey and Andreas Von Pein from Germany.Chilean authorities have been criticised by the hikers for suggesting that the tourists became lost near the park’s Los Perros camp.Player, 39, said: “We’ve been relentlessly trying to correct the record. Claiming that anyone got lost, four out of the five people were on the trail.“I saw three of them in my efforts to go up. Our friend Victoria … was on the trail. To claim they got lost is really upsetting and inflammatory. We have GPS data to back it all up.”Player described the storm as “absolutely brutal”, with cold temperatures, downpours, sleet and snow.He said: “We had seen a forecast which gave us a heads-up, gusts of over 100km/h [60mph], sustained high winds throughout the day.“I don’t think any of us expected blizzard-like conditions, it got progressively worse throughout the day. We left at around 5.30am in the morning, there was heavy rain, lots of wind.“We were getting knocked over, even crouching down on all fours. I wasn’t prepared for mountaineering conditions where you would have spikes in your boots, rope, snow goggles. I think it took everyone by surprise.”Player said the hiking group included a head of ER, junior doctors, a helicopter paramedic and a psychologist who all helped during the rescue effort.“The rescue effort was one of those moments when you realise you have so much faith in humanity and people.”He added: “There was a general unpreparedness and lack of emergency planning. We made a stretcher out of a set of hiking poles, gaffer tape, a tent cord and a sleeping mat.”Player said he came across other hikers during his search for Bond. “One staff member came forward out of compassion. He was amazing, he and I ran up the hill.“We found someone, who later turned out to be Cristina [Calvillo Tovar], who was hypothermic. He gave her gloves and a coat and tried to walk with her to get her some help. I found another person and was later told it was Julian [Garcia Pimentel], who was dead.“I carried on up the hill and found someone else, who later turned out to be one of the German ladies. She was responsive. I tried to help her up, she was deeply hypothermic. I wrapped my sleeping bag around her and stayed with her and tried to give her a drink of hot water.”Player added: “I went up there looking for my friend and I didn’t find her, it is very hard to live with that. I had no idea how many people had succumbed to this brutal cold.”Bond, a PR manager for the Visit Isles of Scilly tourism organisation, was a “lovable, witty and creative” person, said Adrian Jones, who worked with Bond promoting the Roseland festival in Cornwall.Euan Rodger, executive vice-chair of Visit Isles of Scilly, said: “She brought life, energy, and an infectious enthusiasm to every project, making her a true joy to work alongside.”Mauricio Ruiz, the regional director of Conaf, Chile’s national forestry corporation, which employs the park’s rangers, told local news media that “there were no park rangers on the night of the 16th” because of mandatory voting in Chile’s presidential election.Explore more on these topicsChileAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Asked about the scale of the markdowns, he said it depended on location, “but I would say about 10% on average”.Asking prices fall as UK housing market hit by budget speculation, Rightmove saysRead moreHe added: “I have found the south-east andLondonparticularly affected, but this is simply down to the fact that properties have a higher value.”OfficialLand Registry data issued on Wednesdayshowed UK house price inflation running at 2.6% in the year to the end of September. However, this figure disguised wide regional variations: in London, prices fell by 1.8% over the year. Meanwhile, the property website Rightmovesaid this weekthat budget speculation “is fuelling uncertainty across much of the market”.A down valuation typically occurs when a surveyor acting on behalf of a mortgage lender carries out a valuation of a property and concludes that its market value is less – sometimes a lot less – than the agreed sale price. This can have big consequences for all involved. A buyer might be able to renegotiate the price with the seller, but if that does not work, they may opt to switch to a different mortgage lender to get another valuation.If that does not succeed, the buyer may have to borrow more to cover the shortfall, stump up a larger deposit, or abandon the purchase.Alvarez Herrera said hehad recently seen a property down valued from £3.1m to £3m. Although proportionally this was not a large markdown, the client was not willing to put down an extra £100,000 deposit and could not renegotiate the price, so the purchase fell through.Patricia McGirr, at Repossession Rescue, which focuses on people in financial difficulty, said down valuations “are turning deals and lives upside down. Even the same surveyors are cutting values within months, particularly in London”.She said: “Whether it’s lender caution, local sentiment or pre-budget jitters, valuations have become a postcode lottery.” For sellers, developers and others “it’s causing chaos and stress”.She recently had two cases down valued, one in London by 17%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You don’t want that single-use plastic lingering in your bathroom cabinet, let alone in the natural environment.”Daniel Webb, the founder and director of the charity Everyday Plastic, said: “These luxury Advent calendars are a microcosm of a bigger problem, a system that keeps producing more and more stuff we don’t need and probably can’t afford.”The research firm Ipsos found seven in 10 Britons have a some point purchase an Advent calendar. While most bought chocolate ones (84%), beauty calendars are increasingly popular (15%), along with toy calendars (14%) and non-chocolate food versions (10%).The firm’s consumer intelligence platform, Ipsos Synthesio, has found online discussions around Advent calendars begin as early as September, driven by promotions by retailers and influencer-led unboxing videos.Webb said that encouraging people to shop for Christmas in the autumn was a decision “made by marketing departments, purely designed to drive overconsumption, not celebration”.He added: “I’m sure people find it fun and this isn’t about blaming anyone for wanting to celebrate – it’s about questioning why brands are choosing to fuel the waste crisis in this way. Real change means cutting plastic production and phasing out this kind of superfluous consumerism.”The beauty expert, journalist and author Sali Hughes said it was important to focus on asking “whether you would want at least five of the advent items if sold at full price”.She added: “If the answer is yes, then the whole calendar is probably worth the spend. If it’s no, then it’s a lot of money for the sake of novelty.“I also think it’s worthwhile imagining all the products in a pile, without the seductive packaging. If it consequently loses its allure, then you’re paying all that money for something pretty ephemeral that will, if its even been designed responsibly in the first place, just go into recycling after Christmas.”Samantha Dover, the insights director of beauty at the market analyst Mintel, said: “The adult Advent calendar trend isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, but the landscape in which these calendars sit is changing. In beauty, the high cost of many Advent calendars, even if they promise significant savings compared to buying individual products, means they are out of reach for many consumers.”Dover said the perceived savings mean they were still viewed as “good value for money”, adding: “It is likely that many consumers self-gift themselves calendars, and even split the cost with others and share products, as a result.” She said this could help reduce “waste often generated by Advent calendars”.Dr Christopher Carrick, the founder of bio-plastics manufacturer Lingin Industries, said government legislation was likely to have an impact on the calendars, which he described as “more packaging intensive, compared to the amount of actual product, than almost any other aspect of Christmas”.He said: “The extended producer responsibility which charges companies based on the amount of unsustainable packaging they put into the world is putting pressure on companies producing Advent calendars to reduce the amount of packaging.“This year, brands will have more responsibility over the costs associated with the waste generated by packaging, meaning designs and materials will need to be amended.”Explore more on these topicsChristmasWastePlasticsConsumer affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

Do hordes of commenters applaud your tips on how to “scale” your startup? Do recruiters slide into your DMs to “explore potential synergies”?If not, it could be because you’re not a man.Dozens of women joineda collective LinkedIn experimentthis week after a series of viral posts suggested that, for some, changing their gender to “male” boosted their visibility on the network.Othersrewrote their profilesto be, as they put it, “bro-coded” – inserting action-oriented online business buzzwords such as “drive”, “transform” and “accelerate”. Anecdotally, their visibility also increased.The uptick in engagement has led some to speculate that an in-built sexism in LinkedIn’s algorithm means that men who speak in online business jargon are more visible on its platform.Like most large social media platforms, LinkedIn uses an algorithm to determine which posts it shows to which users – boosting some, and downgrading others.Ina blog post on Thursday, LinkedIn acknowledged the trend, but said it did not consider “demographic information” in deciding who gets attention. Instead, it said, “hundreds of signals” factor into how a given post performs.“Changing gender on your profile does not affect how your content appears in search or feed,” a spokesperson said. Be that as it may, the anecdotes are piling up.“It has certainly been exciting,” said Simone Bonnett, an Oxford-based social media consultant who changed her pronouns to “he/him” and her name to “Simon E” on LinkedIn earlier this week.“The kind of stats that I’m seeing at the moment are a 1,600% increase in profile views, which is wild if you think about what social media views look like at the moment, and a 1,300% increase in impressions. Also wild reach stats.”Megan Cornish, a communications strategist for mental health tech companies, said she started experimenting with her LinkedIn settings after seeing her reach on the platform decline precipitously earlier this year.First she changed her gender to “male”. Then she told ChatGPT to rewrite her profile in “male-coded” language, based on a LinkedIn post suggesting the platform favours “agentic” words such as “strategic” and “leader”.Finally, she asked ChatGPT to rewrite old, badly performing posts from several months ago in similarly “agentic” language, figuring that recycling old, reworked content would help her isolate what effect “bro-coding” was having on her reach.Things went great. Almost immediately, Cornish’s reach on LinkedIn spiked, increasing 415% in the week after she trialled the changes. She wrote a post about the experience, andit went viral, racking up nearly 5,000 reactions.The problem was, she hated it. Before, her posts had been “soft”, she said. “Concise and clever, but also like warm and human.” Now, bro-Megan was assertive and self-assured – “like a white male swaggering around”.She gave up after a week. “I was going to do it for a full month. But every day I did it, and things got better and better, I got madder and madder.”Not everyone had the same experience as Cornish and Bonnett. Cass Cooper, a writer on technology and social media algorithms, said she changed her gender to “male” – and then her race to “white” (Cooper is Black). The overall result, she said, was a decline in her profile’s reach and engagement – an experience other women of colour on the platform have alsodiscussed.“We know there’s algorithmic bias, but it’s really hard to know how it works in a particular case or why,” she said.While the LinkedIn experiments were “frustrating”, she said she believed they were a reflection of broader society-wide biases. “I’m not frustrated with the platform. I’m more frustrated with the lack of progress [in society].”Usershave been rumblingabout LinkedIn’s weird position as a quasi-business, quasi-social network for some time, ever since the pandemic blurred professional boundaries and injected more oversharing into work. LinkedIn’s occasional tendency to elevate extreme “bro-coding” isbest illustrated bysocial media accountsrecording the excessesof the platform.These latest “bro-coding” experiments, however, have their origins in what Cornish, Bonnett and others describe as algorithm changes in recent months that have caused female creators in particular to have markedly less visibility. This led to a seriesof informal experimentsearlier this year, in which women and men in parallel industries posted the same content – and the men got drastically more reach.LinkedIn usesan AI systemto classify posts to its feed, it says, deciding how to disseminate them based on their content, as well as the poster’s professional identity and skills. It evaluates its algorithms regularly, it says, including “checks for gender-related disparities”.A spokesperson for LinkedIn suggested that a recent decline in certain users’ reach came from a far higher volume of content on the network, adding that there had been a 24% increase in comments and a commensurate spike in video uploads in the past quarter.Bonnett said the “bro-coding,” in her experience, was on the rise. “You always think of LinkedIn as being more genteel, more businesslike. It’s not like that any more. It’s starting to become the wild west.”Explore more on these topicsLinkedInWomenGenderSocial mediaDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

That may be about to change next week: Rachel Reeves, perhaps inured to being pilloried for any money-raising proposal, is expected to introduce a charge explicitly linked to how far EVs drive.The Treasury has all butconfirmed some kind of chargewill be announced at next week’s budget, but the details have not been revealed. According to an initial report in the Telegraph, EV drivers could from 2028 pay a supplement based on how far they had driven that year on top of their annual road tax, or vehicle excise duty (VED). That could be a self-declared estimate of distance or a check on the odometer at an MOT.According to Department for Transport (DfT) figures, battery electric cars – with lower running costs than petrol – are used more: clocking up about 8,900 miles on average in 2024. At 3p a mile, that would bring in £267 a car from the 1.4m EVs currently on the road – about £375m a year in total.View image in fullscreenThe Treasury has all but confirmed that some kind of charge on EVs will be announced when Rachel Reeves delivers the budget.Photograph: Carlos Jasso/AFP/Getty ImagesThe transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, was at pains to rule out a national road pricing scheme in the face of Commons attacks on Thursday – although a later “clarification” made clear that the EV pay-per-mile was still on the table.The long-term picture is a looming shortfall in motoring tax revenues, as income fromfuel duty evaporatesin the transition to EVs. Petrol and diesel cars effectively pay a charge linked to how far they drive – but via fuel consumption at the pump.Fuel duty of 52.95p a litre (roughly 5p a mile in average cars) will bring in £24.4bn this financial year, according to the latest forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility, but the billions will dwindle away from 2030, when the ban on new pure petrol and diesel cars comes in.The challenge is to find a fair replacement for an unsustainable system – and overcome longstanding resistance on the right to any form of road charging, bundled up in the culture wars aroundLondon’s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez)andlow-traffic neighbourhoodswith their claims of curtailed freedoms and increased surveillance.View image in fullscreenLast year London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, ruled out considering a pricing scheme after being battered by anti-Ulez hostility.Photograph: PA Images/AlamySome economists have championed schemes that would price roads by time and congestion – potentially fairer and a better tool to manage road use, but bringing in another level of tracking.Any scheme should be kept simple, says Steve Gooding, the director of the RAC Foundation motoring thinktank. Although, when it comes to privacy, he adds: “The amount of data being generated by the modern car is phenomenal. If the DfT or DVLA start tracking their movements, people think Big Brother is watching.But Elon [Musk]– they’re not that fussed.”A wider concern is that pay-per-mile would discourage drivers from switching to electric vehicles, crucial for cutting carbon emissions. Manufacturers, businesses and motoring groups such as Ford, AutoTrader and the AA have allspoken outon the timing of new charges at this point in the transition. Carmakers must,under Britain’s ZEV mandate, ensure one in three cars sold next year are zero-emission, rising to 80% by 2030 (with hybrids allowed to make up the remaining 20%).While grants remain of up to £3,750 on new electric vehicles and – for some – the running costs remain much cheaper, some discounts or tax and charge exemptions have already ended. Transport for London recently confirmed EVs would beliable for the capital’s congestion charge from next year, andzero-emission cars started paying VED in April.According to a report for the Social Market Foundation (SMF) thinktank, New Zealand provides a cautionary tale. EVs were made liable last year for its road-user charge, which previously only applied to diesel vehicles, whereby drivers buy paper permits in units of 1,000km (621 miles). The move, allied to the end of buyer grants and tax exemptions, led to a sharp drop in new EV sales – now just 4% of the market, having peak 19%.View image in fullscreenElectric vehicles at a charging point in Auckland, New Zealand, where EVs were made liable last year for its road-user charge.Photograph: MIchael Craig/APSMF says that Iceland, which also brought EVs into pay-per-mile schemes last year, maintained incentives and differentials in pricing and had a much smaller decline in market share.Advocates for the new technology are alarmed. The Electric Vehicle Association England, a group representing drivers, warned in a letter to the chancellor that consumer sentiment was still sceptical about EVs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ginny Buckley, the chief executive of Electrifying.com, an EV reviews platform and marketplace, says: “If you can’t rely on off-peak, affordable home charging and you’re reliant on the public charging network, for many people it will cost you more per mile to run your EV than it will a petrol car.”Graham Parkhurst, a professor of sustainable mobility at the University of the West of England, describes the vast difference between domestic chargers and public charging points –which attract VAT at 20% on top– as a “political timebomb”, further dividing the haves and have-nots.Even long-term proponents of pay-per-mile such as Parkhurst warn of the need to tread carefully: “Charging according to how much a vehicle moves makes sense. Fuel duty does that. But we need time to work out how to do this in the context of wider transport taxation. To the extent we need cars, it’s much better that they are electric,” he says.View image in fullscreenLong-term champions of pay-per-mile warn of the need to tread carefully.Photograph: nrqemi/Getty Images/iStockphotoThe thinktank the Resolution Foundation recommends a charge based on miles driven and weight be brought in only for future EV sales, as part of VED.Tanya Sinclair, the chief executive of the industry group Electric Vehicles UK, agrees that motoring taxes need fundamental reform – but the government needs to be absolutely clear it wants people to switch to EVs. “Anything that muddies that message – such as giving a grant with one hand and introducing pay-per-mile with the other – undermines that clarity for the consumer,” she says.A government spokesperson says it would “look at further support measures” for EVs, but adds: “Fuel duty covers petrol and diesel, but there’s no equivalent for electric vehicles. We want a fairer system for all drivers whilst backing the transition to electric vehicles.”For Gooding “the best time to introduce road pricing would have been a while ago – but politics has been an interesting place”. The cross-party transport select committee recommended the urgent introduction of road pricing –replacing all motoring taxes for every type of vehicle– in 2022. But no ministers have fancied it; London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, battered by anti-Ulez hostility, last year had torule out even considering a pricing scheme, despite oncetalking of it as the sensible option.Piloting a new policy is, Gooding says, best done “with the smallest number you can get away with – and if it’s only EVs, that’s better than trying to introduce some kind of complicated charge for the 34m cars we’ve already got”.For some, including Buckley and the Campaign for Better Transport, an obvious, if also politically contentious, answer remains: end the 15-year freeze on fuel duty and thetemporary 5p cut in place since 2022.Had the levy stayed the same in real terms, almost £150bn would have accrued to the public purse, according to SMF. Whatever pay-per-mile scheme evolves, Reeves “must ensure operating taxes on EVs remain lower than on petrol”, it says. “The simplest way to maintain that difference is to raise fuel duty.”Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsBudget 2025MotoringFuel dutyGreenhouse gas emissionsTax and spendingTaxfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My Struggle had become a runaway success in Norway – a success that would subsequently be repeated across the world – but the project provoked anger in some quarters for its portrayal of friends and family members. This was a work of art that came at a price. Hence, for its creator, its Faustian aspect.That experience lies at the root of Knausgård’s latest novel, The School of Night, the fourth volume in his Morning Star sequence, in which his typical character studies and fine-grained attention to the minutiae of daily life are married to a compelling supernatural plot involving a mysterious star appearing in the sky and the dead returning to life. Volumes one and three, The Morning Star and The Third Realm, cycled between the same group of interconnected characters, while the second book, The Wolves of Eternity, moved back to the 1980s and told the story of a young Norwegian man and his discovery of a Russian half-sister. Only towards the end of its 800 pages did the novel intersect with the events of The Morning Star. The School of Night, perhaps frustratingly for some, again moves backwards instead of forwards, this time to 1985 London, and follows the art school career of a young Norwegian, Kristian Hadeland, who is pursuing his dream of fame as a photographer. Kristian, events reveal, is someone who will sacrifice anything, and anyone, to succeed. Charting Kristian’s rise and fall is an addictive and eerie reading experience.Imeet Knausgård on a perfect autumn day in Deptford, south-east London, the water gulping below us against the river wall. This is the neighbourhood where much of The School of Night takes place. Had he known, since moving to the city nearly a decade ago, he would one day write a London novel? “I think I did,” he says. “I was never here in the 80s but growing up I read NME, Sounds, I listened only to British music – some American bands, but it was all Britain, really. And then it was football. Every Saturday, British football. So I grew up as a proper anglophile, you know.” And in his 20s, he lived for a few months with a Norwegian friend in Norwich. “It was like the most uncool place in Britain,” he says, laughing. “But it was still very cool to me.”View image in fullscreenKnausgaard with his brother, Yngve.Photograph: Courtesy of Karl Ove KnausgårdIn 2018 Knausgård moved from Sweden to London to be with his fiance, now third wife, who had previously been his editor. They have a son, and Knausgård’s four children from his previous marriage divide their time between him and his ex-wife. He says life in London is much the same as it was in Sweden: “It’s the writer’s life. So I’m in the house writing and I’ve got my family – my kids and my wife. But then you have London outside.” When he isn’t writing he enjoys record shopping in Rough Trade, going to concerts, watching football matches. “I do really love it here,” he says.Knausgård wanted to have Kristian live in Deptford because of the area’s association with one of the most prominent authors of the Faust legend, the Elizabethan playwright Christopher Marlowe. He came to Marlowe via a Borges essay that described “the blasphemy, the murder, the way he was killed, the ruthlessness, the wildness, and I hadn’t heard about him [before]. I was instantly incredibly interested in him.” The School of Night takes its name from an association of supposedly atheist late 16th-century writers and scientists which included, alongside Marlowe, George Chapman, translator of Homer, and Sir Walter Raleigh. The idea of the School of Night as an actual clandestine group was advanced by the Shakespeare scholar Arthur Acheson in the early years of the 20th century, but the truth is cloaked in mystery. This is entirely appropriate for Knausgård’s novel, which is full of strange events and shadowy figures with obscure motives.Marlowe’s version wasn’t Knausgård’s first encounter with the Faust legend, though. That was Thomas Mann’s 1947 novel Doctor Faustus, which sets the story in Wilhelmian – and latterly Nazi – Germany. “I think I was 19 or 20, and I still remember one of the first scenes where Zeitblom [the book’s narrator] and Leverkühn are with Leverkühn’s father, and he shows them natural wonders, things not alive that behave like they’re alive; it has been important for me ever since I read it, that kind of crossroad between life and non-life, and art in between them.” I look up the passage after we speak and sure enough, its blend of concrete detail and philosophical musing is distinctly Knausgårdian.He says he doesn’t really do research. In the case of a meticulously detailed episode in which Kristian repeatedly boils and attempts to skin a dead cat for a photography project, this comes as something of a relief. Instead he writes with what sounds like incredible freedom. He has often said that he finds out where a story is heading as he writes, and it was the same for The School of Night. “When I started to write, Kristian was just a normal guy, there wasn’t anything unpleasant with him.” Only when he wrote the section in which Kristian visits his family did he realise this was a character completely lacking in empathy. “That’s always the way I do it,” he says. “I just write and then something happens and then you get consequences.”View image in fullscreen‘If you take one step back, and see life that way, then everything is meaningless – and then you go one step in, and it’s brimmed with meaning.’Photograph: Kate Peters/The GuardianTaking the form of a long suicide note written by Kristian after he has plummeted from the heights of worldwide artistic success, the novel is soaked in death, veined with examples of life’s ephemerality. Holed up in a cabin on a remote Norwegian island, Kristian reflects that “death was the rule, life the exception”. Looking around a train carriage in London, he thinks, “in a hundred years, everyone in it would be dead”. Home for Christmas, he compares our lives to the snow falling outside his window:Humans descended like snow through the ages. There were billions of us, we danced this way and that until our flight was abruptly over and we settled on the ground. What happened then? Billions more came falling, descending to smother us. I was one such snowflake, and I was still falling …and those whose descent would soon begin, the enormous blizzard of the as-yet unborn, all waiting to descend, would completely smother not only us, but every sign of our lives, which thereby would become less than meaningless, would become nothing, zilch, nada. They would become snow in snow, darkness in darkness. And so would we.I ask Knausgård if he feels art is a way of battling against this, of leaving a mark against the darkness. “No,” he says after a period of silence (he often pauses like this, thinking for as long as required before answering). “No, that’s not important at all. It’s more the perspective. If you take one step back and see life that way then everything is meaningless, you know? And then you go one step in, and it’s completely full: brimmed with meaning. And that is, I think, almost like how it is to write a book, really, when you go into something and it’s very much about the present, being in the moment, and it’s incredibly meaningful.”It’s from my own experience. Huge ambitions and belief, completely crushed. Then up and try againThis speaks directly to the methods Knausgård employs, a distinctive synthesis of the epic – multi-volume cycles of novels, few of which clock in under 500 pages – and the intimate, stuffed as they are with the minutiae of changing nappies, making coffee, getting drunk, snogging, and the ideal consistency of cornflakes. Here is another divergence between Knausgård and Kristian, who at one point sneers at his mother, “I can’t believe you’re actually talking about the weather”. Sticking up for herself, and for Knausgård’s project, she replies, “Life is in the everyday, Kristian.”Kristian’s everyday, at least in the novel’s early stretches, is mostly about failing. The School of Night is extremely good on the difficulty of finding one’s way creatively – that sense, artistically speaking, of falling short but maintaining the belief required to keep going. It’s territory Knausgård explored at length in Some Rain Must Fall, the fifth volume of My Struggle, which describes his time as a creative writing student in Bergen. “Yeah,” he says, “that is basically taken straight from my experience with trying to be a writer. All those kind of huge ambitions, and belief that gets completely crushed, and then,” he laughs, “up again and try again, you know.”Knausgård lived on the island of Tromøy in southern Norway until he was 13, when the family moved to the city of Kristiansand. His mother was a nurse and his father a schoolteacher. His troubled relationship with his father, who latterly became an alcoholic and a virtual shut-in, is vividly and painfully described in My Struggle. Knausgård originally went to university in Bergen with the idea of being a poet, but, as he describes in Some Rain Must Fall, he was hopelessly bad. “You understand nothing about yourself and you have no idea what you’re doing,” a classmate tells him. Kristian’s early work is also repeatedly written off – by his sister, his artist friend Hans, and a visiting tutor at his art school.That apprentice phase is so painful, Knausgård says now, because you have no idea whether or not it will ever change. “Because there’s so much you don’t know when you’re at that age and when you want to do something, and what there is to know is only accessible through experience, you know? You don’t know that you have to fail, because it’s so painful to fail at that stage, but it is the only way. But you never know if you’re continually going to fail. There’s no guarantee for anything.”In some ways Kristian gave Knausgård the opportunity to experiment with a shadow self. When the first volume of My Struggle was published in 2009, giving an explicit account of the squalor into which Knausgård’s father and grandmother descended in their final years, his father’s family threatened a lawsuit. Others also complained about their portrayal, which made Knausgård alter his approach in later volumes. Kristian, on the other hand, barely contemplates others’ feelings, or the ethics of his artistic decisions.There are some elements of myself that I magnified and put in Kristian. That was not fun at allKnausgård admits that, when he was writing My Struggle, he knew “actually I was doing something I probably shouldn’t have done”. How then did he decide where to draw the line? “My own rule was that if it was too physically painful, I didn’t go there.” You experienced physical pain? “Yeah. It was in my body. But when I wrote as Kristian, he doesn’t care. That freedom, you know, comes for him in the end. That, to me, is the Faust story.”In the book’s acknowledgments Knausgård says of his family: “Without their light I would never have been able to withstand the darkness of this novel.” Was it difficult to spend so much time in Kristian’s head? “It wasn’t pleasant. Because it wasn’t like I found him outside myself. I took him from within. It’s not that I’m like him, but there are some elements of myself that I magnified and put in him. That was not fun at all. But interesting.”The School of Night is Knausgård’s 21st book. He speaks very matter-of-factly about his productivity, which is one thing he undoubtedly shares with Kristian. “It doesn’t have to be many hours, but if you do it every day, five days a week, it’s a novel in a year.” His 22nd, volume five in the Morning Star sequence, is called Arendal and was published in Norway last autumn. When I say that the Morning Star sequence could run and run he agrees: “I can extend it for the rest of my life, really.” But as soon as he’s spoken these words he clarifies, with an edge of determination to his voice, that volume seven, which he is about to begin writing, “will be the last. I want to do other stuff.”That doesn’t mean, however, his enthusiasm for the series has waned. Just the day before, he tells me, he made the final changes to the manuscript for volume six, I Was Long Dead, due in Norwegian bookshops in a few weeks. It returns to Syvert and Alevtina, from The Wolves of Eternity, and its climax, he says with a laugh, is “real blood spatter and chainsaw kind of stuff. It’s the wildest book I’ve ever written.”The School of Night, translated by Martin Aitken, is published by Harvill (£25). To support the Guardian, buy a copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Seven-year-old John Morris showed up with 20: a case of his beloved X-Men action figures. He got the part.Playing Andy, a young boy whose toys include cowboy Woody and spaceman Buzz Lightyear, his was the first voice ever heard in a feature-length Pixar animation. Toy Story wasreleased 30 years agoon Saturday, but to Morris the memory of its premiere is as fresh as ever.Best of Pixar: our writers’ favourite movies from Toy Story to Turning RedRead more“I still have goosebumps thinking about it because it started and then there’s Andy, and everyone turned to look at me and I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, here we go,’” the41-year-old voice actorsays by phone from San Francisco. “I couldn’t believe what we were watching because it was groundbreaking. I grew up watching animation – Disney on VHS with my younger sibling – and it looked and felt new and different.”Toy Story was one of the most influential films in modern cinema. Directed byJohn Lasseterand produced by Pixar with release through Disney, it was the first fully computer-animated feature film, leading studios worldwide to pivot away from hand-drawn animation.The story features toys who spring to life when humans are not looking, notably Woody (Tom Hanks), a pull-string cowboy doll, and Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a flashy new space-ranger who threatens Woody’s status as Andy’s favourite. Their rivalry turns into friendship as they try to reunite with their owner after getting lost in the wider world.The premise grew out ofTin Toy (1988), a five-minute short film that won a first Oscar for Pixar in the days when it was part of a hardware company run by Apple’s Steve Jobs. Disney approached Pixar to produce a computer-animated feature film told from a small toy’s perspective.The initial story followed the relationship between Tinny, the wind-up one-man band toy from Tin Toy, and aventriloquist’s dummynamed Dummy. Christine Freeman, who is Pixar’s founding historian, says:“The idea was of a buddy film, which hadn’t been done in animation before, and so they had these two characters and it was interesting but it wasn’t landing.“We were lucky that we got good feedback from the folks at Walt Disney. They said, we don’t believe that this tin toy is going to be an eight-year-old’s favourite toy and also that other guy? He’s really mean. One of the amazing animators and creatives who worked on Toy Story was a guy namedBud Luckey. He said, could this ventriloquist’s dummy be a cowboy? That is how Woody was born out of this Dummy character.”Tinny would evolve into Buzz Lightyear, but even then the path zigged and zagged before reaching its original destination. Asked about the 30th anniversaryduring a recent episodeof The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on CBS, Hanks replied: “Actually, it was more than 30 years, because Tim Allen and I and everybody involved in it, we recorded a Toy Story movie, for about 80 minutes of it, that was completely thrown out. We had the animatics, the whole bit.“The people who were running the studio – not Pixar, Pixar people are great – the people running the studio said, ‘Look, it’s a cartoon. Let’s make them wisecrack-y. Let’s let them improv and insult each other and come up with goofy things,’ which we sort of did for a while. And they showed it, and quite frankly, it didn’t work. It wasn’tToy Story. It wasn’t what Pixar was going for.”Hanks, 69, added: “John [Lasseter] called up and he said, ‘We looked at it and it’s just not working, and we would like to start all over from scratch.’ We had been working on the movie for about two years. So then we began the process all over again, which is about a two and a half to three year process, which is why on the credits on the Toy Story movies, they always say Production Babies.”The stakes were high forPixarto take its time and get it right. The company had been through various iterations as a hardware company, software company and producer of TV commercials but was struggling to make ends meet.David A Price, author ofThe Pixar Touch: The Making of a Company, says from Richmond, Virginia: “If Toy Story hadn’t been a success, Pixar, I’m quite certain, wouldn’t have been able to continue for long as a company.“First of all, Pixar was in very tight, dire financial circumstances in 1995 when the movie came out. Steve Jobs had been putting money into the company for 10 years at this point, $50m cumulatively over the years. When they needed to make payroll, as often as not the top executives would be coming to Steve Jobs hat in hand, asking them to write their cheque. Without Toy Story, there wasn’t an obvious way forward for the company as a going concern.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Snap/Rex FeaturesSecondly, it was a make-or-break moment for the new medium. Price adds: “It was necessary for Toy Story to be a success simply to legitimise computer animation. It’s hard to appreciate now but, at that time, computer animation was more of a novelty than anything.“It was a real question whether computer graphics would turn out to be acceptable to mass audiences and if Toy Story had been a flop, then certainly the people who fund movies would have very likely stayed away from it as a medium. On the other hand, because Pixar was successful, it did spur tremendous interest in computer animation and a golden age of computer animated movies.”Toy Story’s animators had the key insight of grounding the film in a recognisable world that audiences could relate to, with virtual cameras that behaved like real ones. The winning formula also included a witty screenplay, perfectly cast actors and Randy Newman’s song You’ve Got a Friend in Me.Asked about Toy Story’s success, Price reflects: “The easy answer is, well, it’s all nostalgia. Parents 30 years ago when they were young watched the movie and now they’re bringing their kids into it. But it’s much more than that. In my opinion, the classic elements of movie greatness are part of the story.“Not only did they fuse new technology with old elements but it was rooted in a sub-genre that was popular at the time – or had recently been popular – and that is the buddy comedy. In the 80s, you had 48 Hours,Lethal Weapon, movies like that where very different characters start out not liking each other, circumstances force them to work together, they grow to respect each other. Toy Story was intentionally written very much in that mould. This made it more appealing then and now.”Beyond that, he argues, Toy Story works on different levels for both children and parents. “Friendship is something that’s very important to children and friendship is a central element in the story, something that the children respond to. But then for parents it’s a powerful portrayal of status anxiety. On one level you have the children’s problems, on the other level of the movie you have adult problems being addressed and so it’s a movie that brings the generations together in a powerful way.”I prepared for the role by playing in my room, essentially, and using my imagination and my creativityJohn MorrisThe part of Andy came naturally to Morris, who grew up creating imaginary worlds viaX-Men action figures, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Lego and Sylvanian Families. He recalls: “I guess my Woody equivalent would be this bear that I still have called Sunny Bear. That was my first favourite object and then I did have that experience during the holidays of getting new toys and the excitement around that, similar to Buzz.”When he was six, Morris took an acting class calledKids on Camerain San Francisco and landed an agent. He started work as a child actor, appearing in commercials. Toy Story was his first voiceover audition.“I was very small, very young, and they asked us to bring our favorite toy to the audition and I brought all my X-Men action figures in a case. My mom was even like, ‘I think this is too many toys’. I was like, ‘No, I have to bring them all. I can’t just bring Storm. I have to bring Professor X and Wolverine and all the rest of them.’“I started playing with them and creating the voices and then later, of course, that’s how we see Andy play. I prepared for the role by playing in my room, essentially, and using my imagination and my creativity.”That was invaluable for recording the role of Andy without the kind of prompts that a stage actor or live action actor might expect. “They give you what they can in terms of storyboards and character drawings and renderings and little sculpts and such, but you have to use your imagination. That’s key to voiceover.“I teach voiceover now and that’s something I talk about a lot: flood your imagination with imagery because that’s what you have to draw from, especially when you just have a script in front of you in black and white. But I remember the first time seeing Andy early in the process and thinking, oh, he looks really nice and warm and then that did help me: OK, I’m going to try to bring a warmth to his voice.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Walt Disney/Pixar/AllstarMorris fitted production around school, slipping away for solo recording sessions that did not involve other cast members. “I couldn’t talk about it while I was working on it. It can be hard for a kid to keep a secret like that. I would leave mysteriously, I guess like kids leave for doctor’s appointments or whatever.“I said I was working on a project, working on a movie, but I didn’t say what it was. But then when it came out there was a lot of excitement and some disbelief. Even to this day, people are like, ‘You’re kidding?’ I’m like, ‘No, I’m not kidding.’ Or people are like, ‘Is it true?’ ‘Yeah, it’s true.’”It was a children’s film that somehow captivated adults and a machine generated artefact that somehow was as big-hearted as a Dickens novel. Made for roughly $30m, itgrossed $401m worldwide, becoming one of the biggest hits of 1995. Morris, who was 11 at the time of its release, was as astonished as anyone by its success.How does he explain it? “At the heart of it is friendship and the ‘You’ve got a friend in me’ notion and the fact that the toys to Andy, and then later to Bonnie, are like friends. They’re almost human in the way that they are and the way that we relate to them. They’re so relatable and lovable.“It was the first computer generated animated film so it has a place in film history, too. I have to say I’ve never met someone who doesn’t like Toy Story and hasn’t seen it. Everyone’s seen it and everyone loves it. I’m so honoured to be part of it, so grateful. I got to bring Andy to life: I mean, how incredible!”’Morris returned in 1999 forToy Story 2and in 2010 forToy Story 3, which climaxes with a college-bound Andy donating his toys to a girl called Bonnie; Woody watches Andy leave and says softly, “So long … partner,” a scene about the bittersweet passage of time that reduced many a grown parent to a blubbering wreck.Toy Story 4appeared in 2019 andToy Story 5is due for release next June. Morris would be happy to return to the franchise some day. “I hear from a lot of fans that they’re curious about Andy. What did he focus on in college? Does he have kids? Is he married? I’m like, well, what do you think? It’s open.“As we know, the story can go in any number of directions. A lot of fans tell me that would bring the whole thing full circle if Andy was an adult and he has kids; maybe he has Andy Jr and maybe Bonnie babysits them and maybe some of the toys are missing and Andy is a little surprised by that. I of course would love to come back and voice Andy as an adult.That would be like a full circle moment for me too.”Explore more on these topicsToy StoryPixarAnimation in filmWalt Disney CompanyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The upcoming advancements for those with disabilities are life-changingRhik SamadderSat 22 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTShareWashing machines liberated women to get soul-crushing jobs that ate up their free time. Social media gave the world one revolution – before it destabilised democracies everywhere else. Now AI is here, and its main job seems to be replacing screenwriters. It’s easy to fall into techno-pessimism, but new documentary Seeing into the Future (Sunday 23 November, 8pm, BBC Two) has a different angle. For disabled people, tech has already brought about life-changing advancements. And we haven’t seen anything yet.It is presented by comedian and StrictlywinnerChris McCausland, who is blind. Some of the most casually astonishing scenes occur early on, showing how he uses his phone – essentially, an eye with a mouth. “What T-shirt is this?” he asks, holding up a garment. “A grey T-shirt with a graphic logo of Deftones,” his phone obliges. It can even tell him if the shirt needs ironing. But it’s where all this is going that fascinates McCausland, so he heads to the US, to see what’s in development at the houses of our tech overlords.He swings by a facility belonging to Meta to try out some smart glasses. To my mind, he may as well be entering the lair of the White Worm, or popping round for macarons at Dracula’s castle. But that’s partly because I’m not in direct need of such technology, and the documentary’s job is to highlight possibility not jump on pitfalls. It’s not like Zuckerberg is personally in the lab, stroking a cat and spinning round on an egg chair.I love having my perspective shaken up. A glass screen with no buttons sounds like the most excluding device imaginable, McCausland acknowledges, yet his phone became the most accessible tool he’s ever used. He’s similarly excited by the Meta Specs – I don’t think that’s what they’re actually called – which are always on and offer live video interpretation, telling you what you’re looking at. Like a phone but, crucially, wearable. “The one thing blind people never have is two hands free,” he observes.View image in fullscreenMcCausland with Maxine Williams, VP of accessibility and engagement at Meta, trying out their smart glasses.Photograph: BBC/Open Mike ProductionsAt MIT, a nanotechnologist tells him how molecular devices could repair cells inside our bodies. He tries bionic gait assistance – a device that straps on to the calf, giving the wearer added power. It looks like the knee brace Bruce Wayne uses inThe Dark Knight Risesto kick through a brick wall when he learns he’s got no cartilage in his knee. Most moving, in every sense, he takes a trip in a driverless car. It’s the first time McCausland has taken a car journey alone.Driverless cars will arrive in the UK next spring. (That’s a long journey.) They are what I would call an instinctive NOPE. But “It’s not massively different to trusting a driver I don’t know,” McCausland reflects. They are extraordinary: mounted with spinning radars, making calculations involving the speed of light to 3D-model the environment in real time. They may as well have gullwing doors. The fact the steering wheel moves on its own is McCausland’s favourite thing about them, which is charming. Coolness is certainly the second best thing technologists can pursue, after equality of access to lives of dignity and independence. In my defence, it’s not just that I don’t trust technology. It’s that I don’t trust profit-driven Big Tech companies to behave for the public good, or with any accountability.Driverless cars are coming to the UK – but the road to autonomy has bumps aheadRead moreThere’s a parallel pleasure in the documentary – transatlantic cultural difference. These are not just Americans, remember. These are San Franciscan Futurists. The inadvertent comedy is amplified by the addition of the dry McCausland. A man so British that, even when he’s interviewing a nanotechnologist about blood-borne computers that could potentially restore his sight, he sounds as if he’d hand you thirty English notes right now if you could teleport him to the pub instead.Even the tech is unmistakably American. “I can hear a plane?” prompts McCausland, trialling Zuckerberg’s glasses. “Yes, a plane is visible in the clear blue sky,” responds the earnest spectacles. Later, our presenter wryly looks back toward his own camera crew. “Do they look like they know what they’re doing?” he provokes. “Judging by their equipment, yes, they are professionals.” Go-go-gadget-missing-the-joke. Computers may increasingly be able to play God, but irony remains a step beyond. Even with a Batman leg brace.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherChris McCauslandFactual TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Though it slightly overextends its central idea, Jurassic is a boxing match of a play, drawing the world’s current quality of political debate into a daft, furious comedy of dinosaurs and destruction.Jay (Alastair Michael) loses his university job in the paleontology department because the new dean, whose name is actually Dean (Matt Holt), believesJurassic Parkis real. What use is a man who studies fossils of dinosaurs now they’ve got the real thing? As Jay tries not to pop a blood vessel while arguing against Dean’s obvious lunacy, this caustic play taps into the impossibility of winning an argument with someone who is playing by an entirely different set of rules.View image in fullscreenAbsurdly funny … Holt and Michael.Photograph: Richard SouthgateFrom that daft base of illogic, the play snowballs. Dean uses disinformation to dismember the university in an effort to save costs and suppress freedom of thought, with Eleanor Ferguson’s cage-framed set nodding neatly to this ongoing dismantling. Holt is eye-clawingly infuriating as the humourless head, wilfully ignorant and blindingly literal. “Is this a bit?” Jay asks, when he’s first presented with Dean’s wild reasoning. “A bit of what?” Dean asks innocently. Events escalate when Jay stops clinging to reason and starts to play dirty, Michael playing him winningly as a desperate man with nothing left to lose.Foley’s absurdly funny premise would work just as well with another cultural launchpad to display Dean’s ignorance; this type of conspiracy theorist, who makes up statements and calls them facts, is not limited by subject matter. But then we wouldn’t get director Piers Black’s delicious between-scene moments where the two men screech and claw at each other, necks taut and elbows outstretched. Two dinosaurs ready to rumble.Reality bends as the story is hauled through to its logical extreme, where the drama stretches a little thin. There are only so many ways for the men to shout each other down and menacingly circle a desk. But the show never loses its dark comic bite or sharpened claws. Foley’s writing is a dotty delight and a searing indictment of the way our world is going.AtSoho theatre, London, until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Jurassic ParkSoho theatreDinosaursPalaeontologyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Lightning has struck twice with this magnificent, shuddering production of Miller’s 1946 play – it perfects the art of doing less for more effect and is performed at the same West End venue where its predecessor transferred.Van Hove, known for giving the classics his own stamp, steps back here, it seems, letting the cast (and what a cast this is) not just inhabit their parts but somehow become them as if by magic. They articulate the devastating truths in this play about the corruptions of the American dreamand the toxic inheritance handed down from fathers to sons. How relevant these truths seem today: it is as if Miller were speaking directly about now. A line can be drawn from the play’s themes of selling faulty equipment to government and the unaccountability of corrupt capitalist patriarchs to Trumpian facts and delusions, Grenfell and the Covid-era PPE scandal.Yet the story is followed with fidelity to the original: wealthy industrialist Joe Keller (Bryan Cranston) served time in jail for knowingly supplying defective aircraft cylinder heads to the army during the second world war, leading to the deaths of 21 US pilots, but has since cleared his name by blaming his business partner, Steve Deever. War has claimed its victims in this family nonetheless. His wife, Kate (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), is waiting for their son, Larry, to return, several years on. Their other son, Chris (Paapa Essiedu), is getting ready to propose to Larry’s fiancee, Ann (Hayley Squires), the daughter of Joe’s jailed partner.View image in fullscreenSins of the father … Bryan Cranston (Joe), Paapa Essiedu (Chris) and Hayley Squires (Ann).Photograph: Jan VersweyveldIngenious tweaks render it a radically different experience. Miller’s three acts come with an interval but this runs straight through at a pace that is reminiscent of ancient Greek theatre in its fateful tragedy. There is a Sophoclean examination of the family, what it means for a son to inherit a father’s crimes, and the production lays out the psychology of blame, guilt and complicity in an incredibly full-bodied and clarifying way.Everyone colludes with the lie that Joe is innocent, to some degree, and every character here seems to know the truth, deep down, guiltily blind right from the start, which compounds their grief at the end. Ann is ready to put aside Joe’sculpability in order to secure her marriage to Chris while Kate, as the play’s most vulnerable character, cannot admit Larry is dead because then she must contend with her husband’s crimes (which are entwined in his dying). Joe, for his part, shows us how lies this damaging must necessarily contain self-delusion and deflection, or else it is too awful to live with them.Ivo van Hove’s All My Sons extends the UK’s special relationship with Arthur MillerRead moreThe old felled tree of the opening scene lies across the stage, looking vaguely Godot-like. A plain house front is the backdrop, with a circular portal that might be a window but also transforms into something more elemental – variously the sun and the moon.The symbolist sparseness of Jan Versweyveld’s set design drives the production further into the realm of the epic and timeless. Then there is the cast; it is a rare thing to see a group of actors quite this brilliant gel so completely. Essiedu is magnetic from the moment he steps on to the stage, his fractious face-offs with his father full of jeopardy. So are Jean-Baptiste and Cranston, along with Squires’ quietly desperate Ann. Tom Glynn-Carney brings intensity as Ann’s angry brother, who is also seduced into collusion with Keller’s lies. Every scene is strong, no actor stealing the show, each raising the power of the ensemble as a whole. There is so much alchemy here – it just dazzles and dazzles.AtWyndham’s theatre, London, until 7 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreIvo van HoveArthur MillerPaapa EssieduHayley SquiresBryan CranstonWest EndreviewsShareReuse this content"

Shame the Traitors don’t run Britain | Marina HydeRead moreThe perils of making a celebrity appearance on a gameshow known for attracting eggheads would appear obvious and can cause lasting reputational damage. So why do celebrities ever agree to appear on such quizzes?Their agents claim it can increase their clients’ profile and show off their human side.Bronagh Monahan, cofounder of Mon Rae Management, which specialises in representing YouTubers, said: “These things are generally for charity so there’s a nice halo effect for appearing.“It’s the taking part that counts. If you get something wrong, it shows you are fallible which makes you popular.”Don’t believe it, says the Guardian’s sketch writer John Crace, who is stilltraumatised by spelling mozzarella wrongon Celebrity University Challenge.“I still get humiliated on a regular basis by my family reminding me of Mozzarellagate,” he said.Crace’s tip to anyone tempted to appear on such quizzes is: don’t.“Unless you are exceptionally clever you are likely to make a fool of yourself,” he said. “The producers are hoping you make an arse of yourself as that makes the best TV.”View image in fullscreenMonty Panesar’s disastrous appearance on Celebrity Mastermind six years ago was used to taunt him this week by Australia’s cricket captain Steve Smith.Photograph: BBCCrace warned that University Challenge is even more prone to humiliation than Mastermind, because it involves buzzing in with embarrassingly wrong answers, and it does not involve a specialist subject that you can prepare for.Crace said: “Doing it on the TV is far harder than being a know-all at home. I am quite handy at UC at home and thought I was going to be a star. I wasn’t.”Not all quizshow appearances end in shame. Journalist and author David Hepworth wanted to turn down an invitation to appear on University Challenge for fear of being shown up. He only agreed after his wife pointed out “you wouldn’t be asked again”.He didn’t regret after he helped his Middlesex team win the 2023 competition.But even after this success he would not be tempted to appear onCelebrityMastermind, describing it as “an exercise in TV exploitation”.Maths teacher Bobby Seagull has built a media career on his successful performances on University Challenge.

He insisted that Panesar’s Mastermind flop could have happened to anyone.Seagull said: “If you make a couple of mistakes, it really knocks your confidence. As a maths teacher I see that in class all the time.View image in fullscreenBobby Seagull on University Challenge in 2017.Photograph: BBC“It doesn’t matter how clever you are – you could be Stephen Fry and a brain fog can still obscure your ability to retrieve information under pressure.”He warned celebrities to stay off social media if they do blunder. Online pile-ons can now be so harsh that Seagull questions the future of such shows.“The risk of social media blowback is getting to a point when its becoming difficult for producers to recruit celebrities of note to these shows,” he said.Alex Segal, managing director of the talent agency InterTalent, disagrees. “People do these shows for visibility, they can win good money for charity and its fun. It’s not that deep.”Segal does warns clients they could be made to “look silly”, and occasionally he has advised against appearances on Mastermind when celebrities do not have time to read up on their specialist subject.But he said even wrong answers can be entertaining. “I had Omid Djalili do Mastermind. When he didn’t know the answers, he came up with the most ludicrous answers. He didn’t look bad, he just looked funny.”Asked for the alternative name for the horned rattlesnake based on its movement, Djalili answered “writhing erotically”.

After last year’s chaotic press tour for the first instalment, giving rise to some of 2025’s biggest and most bizarre pop culture moments, all eyes are now on the rollout of the sequelWicked: For Goodand the theatre-kid capers of its stars, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. Here’s what you need to know.1. They are still ‘holding space’ forone another…Last year’s Wicked press tour was an infamous love-in for Grande and Erivo. Such was the intensity of their connection and mutual affection, both were frequently moved to tears in interviews. The enduring image was of Erivo stroking Grande’s index finger in response to a journalist’s unintelligible remark about people “holding space” with the song Defying Gravity. Grande poked fun at her and Erivo’s histrionics, declaring them “insufferable” and “the most annoying” – but their bond still appears unbreakable. At the New York premiere of Wicked: For Good on Monday, Erivo declined to give interviews to preserve her voice. Grande was reported to also be skipping press “in solidarity”, but couldn’t help plugging her costar’s forthcoming projects “as Erivo looked on smiling”, asCNN described the scene. Asked what they were feeling, ahead of the film’s final instalment, Grande spoke for them both: “overwhelming gratitude”. Late on Thursday, she tested positive for Covid.Cynthia Erivo has lost her voice and will not be doing interviews at the ‘Wicked: For Good’ premiere in New York tonight, Variety reports.Ariana Grande will also be skipping interviews in solidarity.pic.twitter.com/UYgayrrMNt— Pop Crave (@PopCrave)November 17, 20252. … and, often, ‘holding a hand’The sight of two accomplished thirtysomething women compulsively fussing over each other, gushing and otherwise behaving like teenagers has sparked much speculation online. Erivo and Grande share not one, not two, butfourmatchingWickedtattoos, including “For good” on their inside palms. The most “intense” one has not been shared with the public, Grande told the Today Show last year. This week, on Amy Poehler’s Good Hang podcast, Grande laughed off Poehler’s comment about her and Erivo’s touchy-feely relationship, saying that they were only looking “to take care of each other”. “I channel a lot of energy through my hands,” Grande said. “I’m always holding a hand.”Cynthia Erivo on fame, fear and not fitting in: ‘I’ve never talked about how tough my journey has been’Read more3.

Video footage showed Erivo instantly stepping in to shield her before the assailant was pinned by security. He was later identified as 26-year-old Johnson Wen, a self-described “troll” who has built an online profile around disrupting public events. After his arrest, Wen posted footage on Instagram of him grabbing Grande with the caption: “Dear Ariana Grande Thank You for letting me Jump on the Yellow Carpet with You ❤️”, which was widely condemned by commenters. On Monday, he was charged with being a public nuisance and sentenced to nine days in prison.4. Grande and Slater are‘doing great!!!’View image in fullscreenEthan Slater with Grande at the New York premiere.Photograph: Erik Pendzich/ShutterstockGrande’s partner, actor and singer Ethan Slater, also appears in Wicked: For Good. The pair met in December 2022 while working on the first film, and reportedly got together while both were still married (Grande to real estate broker Dalton Gomez; Slater to therapist Lilly Jay, who went onto publish a thinly veiled essayabout her experience of the split). Grande and Slater have regularly featured on each other’s social media. In promoting Wicked: For Good, however, they have not done any press together and have appeared far apart in group shots, prompting persistent speculation of a split. Sources “close to the couple” recently felt moved to shoot down the rumours,telling TMZ that“everything’s great between them, and … they always make time for each other”.5. The film is turning stars vegan ‘for good’View image in fullscreenJonathan Bailey has been ‘encouraged’ to follow a plant-based diet, like his costars.Photograph: Bruce Glikas/WireImageJeff Goldblum, who plays The Wizard of Oz,recently told This Morningthat working on the film – which deals with themes of animal cruelty – led him to give up eating meat. Grande and Erivo are both longtime vegans, while Michelle Yeoh follows a “plant-based diet”, emboldening Peta to target their co-star Jonathan Bailey. In a somewhat laboured PR stunt, the animal rights organisation sent Bailey a bottle of non-dairy Baileys (Baileys for Bailey, geddit?) in the hopes of encouraging him to “join the vegan side of his Wicked family, and let the plant-based magic begin!” Bailey has not yet engaged, but did, however, praise the film’s message of tolerance (and expressed hope that it would reach the men who had bullied him at school).‘I was born in a melting pot. Melting isn’t fun’: Jon M Chu on Wicked: For Good, Ariana Grande – and living the American dreamRead more6. The yellow-brick road is paved with gold …As Bailey crowingly suggested, his former bullies may well have “tickets for opening night”. In the UK, advance tickets to Wicked: For Good were selling at more than twice the rate of the first film, according to Vue. Odeon had likewise sold more than 250,000 presale tickets as of Wednesday, almost double what it sold for part one. Whether you intend to see it or not, the film has been inescapable in endless product tie-ins (including, notably, Robinsons “Amazafying” Elphaba-green squash). Last month, the US version of Dancing With the Stars landed its first-ever movie tie-in with “Wicked Night”, featuring the films’ choreographer. This week, London’s Brick Lanewas paved with promotional yellow bricksabove a Tracey Emin-type light installation, holding space for lyrics from the song, For Good. No wonder Grande has kept the door open for a third movie to be somehow adapted from the musical, recently saying: “There’s always a farewell tour.”7. … and may be leading Grande away from musicGranderevealed to Amy Poehler that her upcoming tour– her first in seven years, and finally promoting her 2024 album Eternal Sunshine – will likely be her last for a “long, long, long, long time”. Grande’s description of it as a “last hurrah” won’t be welcomed by her fan army of Arianators, but tracks with her move away from pop since Wicked. Not only is she being hotly tipped for an Oscar nomination for Wicked: For Good, Grande will star alongside Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller in the Meet the Fockers threequel Focker-in-Law, scheduled for release next November. In the meantime, she has cultivated other interests,telling Poehlerthat she has got into birdwatching viathe Merlin app, which she declared “fabulous”. The next string she would like to add to her bow is the study of insects. “I wish I were a person who, like, had endless entomology knowledge,” she said. “I could look at a bug and be like, ‘Ah,Lepidopterapieridae’.” Arianators may be well advised not to hold their breath for an eighth album.Explore more on these topicsAriana GrandeCelebrity crib sheetCynthia ErivoWickedWicked: For GoodCelebrityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I wandered through the crowds with my phone, observing rituals and soaking up the powerful atmosphere.”Verma credits the light with helping him “bring out the sharp shadows, soft tones and vibrant textures. Two women had been bathing in the Ganges River and were holding this red saree up to dry. Against the blue sky, the flowing red fabric looked incredibly striking.When it aligned just right over these people, I knew I had found something special.”Later, Verma made minor adjustments to contrast, saturation and vibrancy in order “to bring out the richness of the colours. The limitations of mobile photography push me to think more creatively,” Verma adds. “It keeps me grounded and reminds me that powerful storytelling doesn’t always need expensive gear: it needs presence, emotion and intention.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographySmart shotArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not a problem. Fake fringes are everywhere – and I tried one outChloe Mac DonnellSat 22 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 22 Nov 2025 05.02 ESTShareThe 70s had “the Fawcett.” In the 90s it was all about “the Rachel.” But now there’s a new era-defining hair cut. “The Claudia.” Yes, the glossy inky-black block fringe that mostly shrouds the face of its owner, the presenterClaudia Winkleman, has become a seminal moment on and off TV screens.It is a fringe that has spawned memes, online forums dedicated to debating its length and a fan account on X. “Thoughts and opinions from the highest paid fringe on the BBC” reads the bio. Alan Carr has described it, not Winkleman, as a national treasure.View image in fullscreenWinkleman’s famous fringe.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherryWhile Winkleman’s signature Traitors style, including her chunky roll-necks and fingerless gloves, is easily emulated, her fringe is a little trickier. It requires a steadfast faithfulness, the type Joe Marler thought Nick Mohammed had on the most recent Celebrity series. Well, until now. It turns out, just likepert bumsandperky boobs, you can just fake it. A quick search online brings up a range of commitment free clip-in fringes.For someone like me with a longstanding fringe fantasy but whose only big hair change over the past three decades has been growing it from clavicle to nipple length, it’s ideal.“We created them so customers can experience what it is like to have a fringe without actually having a fringe,” says Hadley Yates, a London based hairstylist and extensions specialist who recently launched his own range of fraudulent fringes underhis brand Curated.View image in fullscreenChloe before her fake fringe.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The GuardianWhile online retailers sell synthetic versions for as little as £2, Yates’s £35 full fringes are made from real hair which he says he sources from ethically approved suppliers in India. I quickly discover that the fake hair fake fringe versus real hair fake fringe debate is a bit like comparing a cashmere jumper to a polyester knit. A synthetic fringe is made from plastic which means it has an overly shiny finish. It is also prone to becoming static. Meanwhile, a fake fringe made of real hair behaves like real hair. It moves in the wind and you can blast it with a hairdryer. If this was an episode of Is it Cake?, Yates’s fringes would definitely not be chosen to be sliced.View image in fullscreenThe fringe is sprayed to mimic Chloe’s natural hair.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The GuardianThe fringes come in six colours and are sold as ready to wear. However, if you want something a little more bespoke, you can pop into Yates’s salon or take it to your own hairdresser to trim or even colour.The fake fringe sits on a lace base into which the hair has been hand sewn. On top of that sits a snap hair clip to secure it into your real hair. The toffee shade blends with my natural colouring, but the base is lighter than my parting. To fix it, Yates darkens it with a spritz of L’Oréal root touch up spray.View image in fullscreenIt is clipped into place.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The GuardianWinkleman’s fringe icons include Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler and the Pretenders’ Chrissie Hynde. She says a fringe shouldn’t be “apologetic”. Meanwhile, I want a fringe that sitsen terrassewith a glass of red in hand – think Jane Birkin and Brigitte Bardot. It turns out that with a fake version, you can get the best of both. Rather than a blunt cut, the clip-in has a curtain bang shape so you can easily part it.We choose to place it halfway back on my natural parting so I have enough length to play with. Inserting it takes seconds. You place the fringe upside down and backwards, then flip it over and push down the clip. Winkleman has described herself as “half-fringe” and as I raise my head to look in the mirror I can see why. Well, I actually can’t see. Yates gives my fringe a little trim. It still titillates my eyelids but my visibility is increased.I head to the office. From Emily’s “trauma bangs” in Emily in Paris to Esther’s “crisis bangs” in the most recent series of Nobody Wants This, everyone knows that cutting a fringe is never really about the fringe. So compliments come with a concerned head tilt until I blurt out that it’s fake. It’s like I’ve got one of those handbag-sized dogs. I have never felt so popular. Everyone wants to pet it.View image in fullscreenEmily’s ‘trauma bangs’.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixI quickly learn that unlike Fight Club, all anyone in Fringe Club wants to do is talk about fringes. But unlike bona fide members, I don’t need to worry about dry shampoo and constant trimming. The temperature plummets and I discover another fringe issue – headwear. A hood is fine but a beanie means I have to re-comb it. No big deal, but instead I pop it in my bag then put it in back when I’m indoors.Twenty-four hours later and I still can’t get used to the feeling that a fruit fly is hovering above my eyelids. I can’t stop fluttering them. Forget blondes, maybe it’s fringes who have more fun?Explore more on these topicsWomen's hairBeautyClaudia WinklemanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Unlike with most foods, however, it doesn’t do to rationalise this love for ragu, because it is a mash of things chopped up so small that they all lose their texture. This might sound a bit woo-woo, but the joy of ragu comes from feeling your way through it, from the chopping and standing with your thoughts, to stirring a bubbling pot and the smell creeping under the door. A ragu isn’t just a ragu, it’s a coming-together of good things: thoughts, feelings, ingredients, time and effort.Gochujang and tofu ragu with gnocchi and pickled cucumberThe greens of the spring onions will need a proper wash. Slice the whole spring onions from top to bottom, then put them in a sieve resting in a bowl of cold water, swoosh with your hand to dislodge any dirt, then lift out to drain when you need them. You’ll need a food processor to blitz the tofu.Prep20 minCook40 minServes2-3For the pickled cucumber200g cucumber, very thinly sliced½ tsp fine sea salt2 tbsp rice vinegar1 tbsp toasted blackor white sesame seedsFor the gnocchiFine sea salt500g gnocchi2 tbsp rapeseed oil200g spring onions, whites and greens, finely sliced and rinsed2 garlic cloves, peeled and grated2cm x 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated280g firm tofu, drained and blitzed to a fine mince1½ tbsp chilli bean sauce– I likeLee Kum Kee1 tbsp gochujang paste2 tbsp tomato puree1 tbsp light soy sauce2 tsp toasted sesame oil2 tsp light agave syrupBring a saucepan of water to a boil, and add a teaspoon of salt per litre of water. Boil the gnocchi according to the packet instructions, then drain.To make the pickle, put the cucumber slices in a bowl, sprinkle over a half-teaspoon of salt and mix. Tip into a sieve set over a bowl and leave to drain.Put two tablespoons of oil in a wide frying pan on a medium heat and, once it’s hot, add two-thirds of the drained spring onions (whites and greens) and all the garlic and ginger. Cook for about five minutes, until the garlic no longer smells raw and the spring onions have wilted nicely.Add the tofu mince, turn up the heat to high and fry, stirring, for about eight minutes, until golden and browned in places. Stir in the chilli bean sauce, gochujang, tomato puree, soy sauce, sesame oil and agave syrup, then add the cooked gnocchi and 200ml cold water, and bring to a boil. Take off the heat and toss through the remaining spring onions.Drain the salted cucumber, put it in a small bowl and stir in the rice vinegar and sesame seeds.Transfer the gnocchi to a platter, arrange the cucumber pickle on top and serve at once.Join Meera Sodha at aspecial eventcelebrating the best of Guardian culture on Wednesday 26 November, hosted byNish Kumarand alongside writersStuart HeritageandTim Dowling, withGeorgina LawtonhostingYou Be The Judgelive.

The scheduling conflict arises late in the day, which is galling because I’ve already read the book, and I can’t very well unread it.“You won’t be missed,” my wife says.“Are you kidding?” I say. “Everyone will be gutted. I had a lot of insights ready.”“You’re not even really in book club,” she says.“I am the beating heart of book club,” I say.Here’s what happened: my wife started a book club with four local women. The first meeting was at our house, and although I wasn’t invited, I noticed that fine cheeses were being served. I dutifully shut myself up in the living room for the first half hour, but when I realised the book club was standing between me and my next glass of wine, I crept into the kitchen, where the women were sitting round the table with paperbacks in their hands, eating cheese.“I’ve actually read that book,” I said, opening the fridge.“Really?” said Emma. “What did you think?”“Oh my God,” my wife said. “Don’t ask him that!”“Well,” I said, sitting down …I send a text to the WhatsApp club: ‘I’m sorry I can’t make it – I would totally understand if you wanted to cancel the whole thing’That was six years ago. My wife tried to bar me from subsequent meetings, but by then I was in the WhatsApp club. Membership of book club has expanded and shrunk slightly since then – for a while there was even another man in it, but for the past five years I’ve been the only one. And in all that time I’ve maintained a perfect attendance record. Until now.I send a text to the book WhatsApp club that says: “I’m sorry I can’t make it to this one, and in the circumstances I would totally understand if you wanted to cancel the whole thing.”Sasha sends a reply that says: “We’ll somehow manage without you.”The morning after the meeting the WhatsApp club is full of sly references to bits of conversation from the previous evening. Evidently they spent a lot of time talking about Fran’s kitchen floor. I can’t really bring myself to read it all – I feel too left out – and I lose track of the subsequent negotiations over the date and venue of the next meeting.“It’s book club on Wednesday,” my wife says to me four weeks later, while we’re driving back from somewhere.“This Wednesday?” I say.“Yes,” she says. “But I figured you might not want to come after you skipped the last one.”“I had a conflict,” I say. “An unavoidable conflict.”“And you haven’t read the book,” she says.“I don’t even know what the book is,” I say.“Exactly,” she says. “You’ve lost interest. It’s OK to let go. No one would mind.”“Wait, are you trying to get me kicked out of book club?” I say.“I’ve always been trying to get you kicked out of book club,” she says.I go on to the WhatsApp page, find the name of the book, and order it. It arrives the next afternoon; I read the whole thing in 48 hours. On Wednesday evening my wife and I walk to book club, which is just round the corner at Suzy’s. I’m carrying a pudding I made.“We don’t have to spend every single waking moment together,” my wife says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The charity added: “We urge people to take caution, especially if they are struggling with bills already.”Meanwhile, Money Wellness, an organisation that provides free money and debt advice, said last month had been a record month for people seeking help with BNPL debt, with another spike expected in January and February as festive spending feeds through.The number of shoppers turning to BNPL has increased steeply in recent years, with banking industry data showing the use of this type of credit risingfrom 14% to 25% of UK adultsin the space of 12 months.The credit, which is common at online checkouts, and increasingly available at physical shops too, lets people spread payments for everything from dresses and trainers to concert tickets, takeaway pizzas and hotel rooms.Typically, the cost is split into three or four instalments, and if consumers keep up with their repayment plan they will not usually pay interest or charges. However, regulators and consumer bodies have long voiced worries that some people will end up taking out loans they cannot afford to pay back on time, thereby incurring charges, tipping them into debt and damaging their credit score.In the UK, more than 3 million customers missed payments in 2024, some of whom will have ended up being pursued by debt collectors.With the US-inspired Black Friday discount day on 28 November swiftly followed by Cyber Monday on 1 December and then a final burst of festive shopping, this is a bumper time of year for the BNPL industry, which in the UK is dominated by three brands: Klarna, Clearpay and PayPal.UK consumers will spend £6.4bn on Black Friday purchases this year – up slightly on the £6.3bn spent last year, according to a forecast from the accountancy firm PwC UK.The average transaction using BNPL is £114, according to the banking body UK Finance, with fashion – clothes, shoes and jewellery – accounting for almost half of all spending using this form of credit last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Missed or late payments often come with fees, and debt can spiral before people realise.”The Financial Conduct Authoritywill start regulating BNPLon 15 July 2026, which could require lenders to carry out affordability checks on even the smallest loans, so this will be the last Black Friday and Christmas when shoppers will not be protected by consumer legislation. From that date, BNPL loans will become regulated credit agreements.Explore more on these topicsBorrowing & debtConsumer spendingBlack FridayBuy now, pay laterRetail industryDebt reliefnewsShareReuse this content"

Elaine Welteroth, then the editor-in-chief,told NPRthat the day it published, Teen Vogue sold “in that month, more copies of the magazine than we had that entire year”. It was a transformative moment for the publication: proof that a magazine long associated with Disney child stars and headlines like “Prom Fever!” could shine light on the political dimensions of young people’s lives.Over the following years, Teen Vogue deepened its coverage of politics and identity, becoming an unlikely hearth for progressive, even radical, feminism within the manicured offices of its publisherCondé Nast.Now, nearly a decade since that “Gaslighting America” story, Trump is once again in the White House and Teen Vogue as it was once known is gone.View image in fullscreenElaine Welteroth helmed Teen Vogue through a politically turbulent time.Photograph: Monica Schipper/The Hollywood Reporter via Getty ImagesEarlier this month, a Vogue Business article announced that Condé Nast was folding Teen Vogue into its flagship property, Vogue, to “provide a more unified reader experience across titles”. Although the article promised that Teen Vogue would “keep its unique editorial identity and mission”, it also said the outlet would now focus on “career development” and “cultural leadership” while its editor-in-chief would be stepping down. Condé Nast also laid off six unionized Teen Vogue employees, including its politics editor. Most of the laid-off employees were “BIPOC women or trans”,according to the Condé Nast union.After Condé staffers questioned the head of HR over the layoffs,the company fired four of them, prompting pushback from the union and a pledge from New York’s attorney general, Letitia James: “Condé Nast, I’ll see you in court.”How Anna Wintour’s Vogue front covers made a statement to the endRead moreA Condé Nast spokesperson told the Guardian that changes to Teen Vogue were driven solely by business concerns, not by politics, and added: “The employment terminations were lawful and based on clear violations of company policies.”Teen Vogue’s unraveling comes at a time of intensifying turbulence for journalism, particularly of the progressive variety. Many of the blogs that once studded the feminist media universe and made “gaslighting” a mainstream term – Jezebel, Feministing, the Hairpin, the Toast – now lay dead or dying. Several of their staid older sisters, the women’s magazines, have started publishing fewer print issues a year or going digital-only. Youth-oriented websites once believed to be the future of media, like Vice and Vox, have shed jobs at astonishing rates. (Note: I worked at Vice for years before quitting in 2023, after the company laid off wide swathes of the newsroom and filed for bankruptcy.)These outlets frequently focused on the people whose lives have fallen under the glare of the Trump administration’s microscope:women, people of color, LGBTQ+ folks, anybody to the left of Ben Shapiro. Taken together, their downfall can feel like an industry-wide retreat from covering long-marginalized voices.“People change their policies based on reading the vibe in the room, if you will,” said Christina Bellantoni, director of Annenberg’s Media Center at the University of Southern California. (Bellantoni is friends with Teen Vogue’s outgoing editor-in-chief.) “We’ve got three more years of this administration making clear its priorities do not lay with having newsrooms that are reflective of the diverse world we cover.”View image in fullscreenThe Teen Vogue Summit in Los Angeles on 2 December 2017.Photograph: Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for Teen VogueThe dismal economics of trying to make money off the internet have decimated outlets of all political stripes. Between 2008 and 2024,74% of newsroom jobs vanished. Condé is a part of that trend, having endured multiple rounds of layoffs over the last several years.But it’s a unique set of pressures that have been responsible for crushing feminist publications. During the reign of the 2010s #girlboss, the feminist blogosphere generated takes on everything from Christmas songs to Edward Snowden’s girlfriend. Women’s magazines took note and started publishing uncomplicated odes to “the notorious RBG” and the Wing, a now-shuttered women-focused club and co-working space.That type of coverage evaporated after the 2016 election, which saw most white women vote for Trump instead of voting for Hillary Clinton to shatter “the highest and hardest glass ceiling.” During that same time, social media algorithms became increasingly opaque, sending feminist media’s online traffic plummeting at the same moment that Trump’s policies started tothreaten long-held feminist victories.Now, under Trump 2.0,all journalism is more fraught, particularly for women. Earlier this month, Trumptold a female journalist: “Quiet, piggy.”“These glossy magazines are generally wary of political coverage, because they say advertisers don’t want to sponsor it,” said Amy Odell, an independent journalist who runs the fashion news Substack Back Row and closely covers Vogue.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Palm Beach, Florida, on 14 November 2025.Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images“This cuts deep with women’s publications because they probably get that feedback more than men’s publications do. With women’s publications, it’s like: ‘Just do lip liner tutorials and we’ll sell those to beauty advertisers’.”Condé outlets like Wired, the New Yorker and Vanity Fair have continued to cover politics; Glamour, a Condé women’s magazine, also sometimes covers it. But some ex-employees have said that they felt company brass undermined Teen Vogue’s political coverage. Alma Avalle, a Bon Appetit journalist fired after the confrontation with Condé leadership,told the New York City local news outlet Hell Gatethat she had heard that “an executive said something to the effect of: ‘The company is trying to avoid the attention of the Trump administration, and trying to avoid the attention and the scrutiny of the right.’”Allegra Kirkland, Teen Vogue’s former politics director,wrote in Talking Points Memothat ahead of Trump’s second inauguration, she was told that Anna Wintour – Condé’s global chief content officer and artistic director – didn’t want to hear the word “politics” during Teen Vogue’s annual strategy meeting.In response to questions for this story, a Condé spokesperson said in an email: “Teen Vogue has faced ongoing challenges around scale and audience reach for some time. Rather than continuing to operate independently, bringing Teen Vogue under the Vogue umbrella allows it to tap into a larger audience, stronger distribution and more resources.”They added: “This was a business decision, not a political one.”Some staff from folded feminist publications have gone independent, writing for platforms like Substack. But many of the most popular outlets covering the intersection of politics, identity and women are now on the right.As feminist and progressive outlets have receded, aconservative “womanosphere” has blossomed, peopled by podcasts like Culture Apothecary, a Turning Point USA production hosted by Maga influencer Alex Clark, and the wannabe “conservative Cosmo” magazine Evie, which recently puttradwife royalty Hannah Neelemanon the cover. The denizens of the womanosphere tend to thread their talk of style, wellness and beauty with antifeminist rhetoric and support for traditional gender roles.View image in fullscreenDaniel and Hannah Neeleman at the Time100 Creators launch party in New York on 10 July 2025.Photograph: Craig Barritt/Getty Images for TIMEOne recent Evie email blast, entitled “5 Ways Single Girls Are Repelling Good-Hearted Masculine Men”, advised: “An empowered woman who is overflowing with joy about her career, and knows that it won’t ever be as important as being a wife and mother, does not need to turn a date into a staff meeting where she is respected for her ideas.”Shara Crookston, an associate professor of women’s and gender studies at the University of Toledo who has studied Teen Vogue, said that the rise of the womanosphere is easily explained: “I read that as a backlash to feminist progress.”Crookston fears that it is young people, Teen Vogue’s core audience, who seem set to pay the highest price for these changes in media. Not only are they the inheritors of whatever the Trump administration leaves behind, but they are increasingly and uniquely restricted by the harshest of rightwing policies, such as bans on gender-affirming care, access to internet porn and interstate travel for abortions.“I worry that young girls are going to have less options for media content that helps them explore different aspects of their life, and I think that could be pretty damaging,” she continued. “What if you are a teenage girl who knows that you don’t want to get married and have kids and all that you’re seeing is: ‘This is why this is important to be straight, to get married, to have kids’? What options are going to be available to her?”Over the last three years, I interviewedmore than 100 Americans under 30about their sexual and romantic lives, their political leanings and the forces that shaped both. While influencers may make up the bulk of young people’s media diet, my interviewees often relied on – and longed for – information from factchecked publications.View image in fullscreenThe Teen Vogue Summit in Los Angeles on 12 November 2022.Photograph: Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for Teen VoguePaxton Smith, a 20-year-old Texan, was once riveted by a Snapchat story from Cosmopolitan that had emphasized that women have the right to choose how to style their body hair. Smith had never realized she had a choice; she just wanted to do what she thought boys wanted.“That was a crazy thing for me to see,” she recalled. “No one had ever framed a woman’s body – especially in a sexual way – as being [able to be] whatever floated their boat. It didn’t have anything to do with what anybody else thought.”From that Cosmo story, Smith said she learned that “what’s sexy is what’s sexy to you and you should prioritize you”. It was part of her political awakening. Years later,Smith went viralfor giving a speech at her Dallas area high school about the importance of abortion rights.Lex McMenamin, a Teen Vogue staffer who was laid off when the outlet was folded into Vogue, said they thought about the future of young people “every day, on weekends, at night, for years”.“Feminist media is not dead,” McMenamin said. “Young people are so smart. I lack the nihilism that people have about young people and learning and self-development, including for marginalized people. There’s more trans people and more queer people every day, even though they’re doing their damnedest to make us want to die. It doesn’t matter. Our readers will always exist.”This story was updated on 20 November 2025 to add a post-publication statement from Condé Nast on staff terminations.Explore more on these topicsVogueMagazinesYoung peopleWomenFeminismCondé NastAnna WintourfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then, I hear the birdsong and the rustling of the palm trees. The harsh sun dims and there’s water and the smell of damp earth. It’s easy to understand why desert travellers yearned to reach these havens and why they have become synonymous with peace. I’m an explorer who’s walked through many oases with loaded camels, crossing Morocco and the Sahara on foot, but Skoura, a four-hour drive from Marrakech, is a place I visit to decompress.View image in fullscreenIllustration: GraphicsYou may be imagining some kind of cartoon mirage oasis – a sole date palm shimmering above the endless sands. In fact, Skoura has a population of around 3,000 people living in a small town on the edge of the palms with 10 sq miles (25 sq km) of agricultural land. Many visitors to Morocco start in Fez or Marrakech and stop off in Aït Benhaddou, then go down to the Sahara towns of Zagora or Merzouga. Skoura, less than an hour from Ouarzazate, is an ideal stop-off point for a couple of days, or you could combine it with aMarrakech city break. The bus from Marrakech (CTM or Supratours) takes six hours, or you can hire a car (or car with driver) from Marrakech or Fez.Founded in the 12th century by Sultan Yaqub al-Mansur and developed as an important stop for the trans-Sahara trade, Skoura is in the Dadès valley, nicknamed the Valley of a Thousand Kasbahs, along the old trade routes from the Sahara to Europe and the Middle East. Caravans carrying everything from gold to ostrich feathers used to come up from southern Africa. Over the next three centuries it thrived, until the trade started to break up and it lost its importance. Now, it is mainly an agricultural hub – and one of Morocco’s biggest date producers.View image in fullscreenA palm grove near Skoura.Photograph: Andrew Wilson/AlamyA visit is not a high-octane, sight-filled adventure. It’s a chance to connect with a world that is so unchanged it is almost otherworldly. The houses are built from clay, people eat what they grow and water runs down from the mountains. It is a study in how humans can live with nature and in tranquillity.There’s still a magnificent collection of kasbahs scattered through the trees, but the town is worth a visit for a glimpse of everyday life in rural Morocco. I love the chicken and chips sold in the roadside cafes of the main street. The skin has a perfect crispiness, and it is served with fresh bread, spicy harissa sauce and salted tomatoes. However, I come to Skoura for the peace and to immerse myself in the unique surroundings.Skoura is a great place to sample traditional local, affordable food. The tagine is an everyday stapleA bicycle, I find, offers the best way of doing this. Many of the lodges have them or rent them, or you can go on a tour with a guide fromSkoura VTT Aventures. There is nothing like whizzing down the dirt paths that wind through the date palms. Being on a bike means you can really look around and investigate. It was how I found out there are male and female palm trees. A farmer saw me taking pictures and came over to explain: males are needed for pollination but don’t bear any fruit, so there is only one planted for every 20-50 females. In spring, they have big, heavy clusters of pollen-filled flowers. He also showed me how he climbs the palms in his bare feet for harvesting, using a sharp curved scythe and a rope to ratchet himself up the trunk. I decided to have a go, egged on by my new friend, and abjectly failed. October/November is harvest time (Skoura specialises in the fat, soft medjool dates), which brings a bustle of activity and excitement, so it is a particularly good time to visit.Palms need water, and the oasis is fed by an intricate series of irrigation canals calledkhettara. I am not an engineering nerd, but thesedate back more than 2,500 years, so you can’t help but be impressed. They bring water all the way down from the Atlas mountains, which you can see in the distance, just using gravity. They look like a series of round tunnels.Like the canals, the houses are made of the natural materials to hand and are among the best remaining examples of rammed-earth architecture in north Africa. They are naturally cool in the summer and warm in the winter because of their thick walls made of mud and palms or wood. Roofs are flat and there are grass or palm fronds poking out above the gutters to direct the water away. When it rains your house “melts”, so constant repair is necessary; many people are now rebuilding with concrete as it is cheaper.View image in fullscreenA tomb of an Islamic saint in Skoura.Photograph: Hemis/AlamySkoura is a great place to sample traditional local, affordable food. The tagine is an everyday staple. Lamb tagine with vegetables, chicken tagine with olives and preserved lemon and meatballs cooked in tomato sauce are on the menu in all the restaurants. As I live in Morocco, I’m always looking for something a bit different andL’ma Lodgeis my special treat. It was created over a period of six years by French/Belgian couple Vanessa and Xavier on the site of an old football pitch. They slowly won over the community by building in a traditional way and planting hundreds of trees in their organic garden. Lunch and an afternoon at the pool is just €25, and all the fruit and vegetables are their own. I often start with a salad with pomegranate and end happily with a pudding fragranced with orange blossom water. Then I float in the pool, full belly up.A couple of days in the oasis is like decompression therapy. It is a world away from the crowded markets of MarrakechMorocco’s happy valley – the wilderness that lies just beyond the souks of MarrakechRead moreKasbah Amridil is another must-visit, a kind of living museum. The Nassiri family, who founded it more than 300 years ago, are still there and it has all the features of the traditional kasbah construction: a courtyard for the merchants and animals, with rooms and stables round the sides and storeys above where the family and guests eat, sleep and pray, with turrets on each corner of the building once used for defence. The small museum has artefacts from an everyday rural life that is only just beginning to die out. There are some rooms here too, if you want tostay.For a small town, Skoura has a reasonably wide range of accommodation for every budget. It is not a highly developed spot, which is its great charm, but there is still plenty of choice from about €25 for a double room in family-runAuberge Famille Ben Moro, to €89 for a double atSawadi Ecolodge, or more for something really luxurious.View image in fullscreenTraditional old pottery in Kasbah Amridil.Photograph: Luisa Puccini/AlamyIf you want to leave the calm, Ouarzazate, just 45 minutes away, is a bustling desert city. You can visit the film studios (huge productions from Gladiator to Game of Thrones have been made here), ride a quad bike out into the desert or have dinner at one of the many great restaurants. Another interesting option is Aït Benhaddou, an hour away. This red clay town emerges out of a dry river bed, and you can walk up steep winding stairs to get a view of the desert beyond.But once in Skoura, I always want to stay put. A couple of days in the oasis is like decompression therapy. It is a world away from the crowded markets of Marrakech, the clubs of Casablanca or the surfing vibes of Taghazoute. In times past, Skoura was part of the lifeline of trade for Morocco, now it is a tranquil reminder of how to live in a simpler way.Alice Morrison is an explorer, presenter and author, whoiscurrently crossing Saudi Arabia on foot.

We were heading towards theMusselburgh Lagoons nature reserve, where there is a marshy wetland area made from reclaimed land. As I cycled along the track, I could hear the geese honking and chattering on the sand. It was mid-autumn and I wondered whether they were resting midway through their migration to warmer countries.I could see an oystercatcher pecking hungrily at the mud and using its blood-red legs to energetically kick at the sand. There was a curlew scouring through pebbles with its curved beak.View image in fullscreenSachin cycling through the reserve towards the bird hide.Photograph: Family handoutI cycled into the forest. The sunlight was bouncing off the leaves. When we got to the bird hide it was silent, even though there were lots of people inside. Their telescopes and cameras were all trained on a small, speckled, brown bird in the distance. It had long, pale yellow legs and was wading next to the muddy bank: a marsh sandpiper! It was so exciting that it was hard to be quiet.I learned that it was an unusual sight as these beautiful birds are rare to see inScotland. They would usually be in Africa, India or Australia in winter. In the UK we have similar birds like greenshanks, green sandpipers and common sandpipers instead. They feed on aquatic insects and small fish and weigh only 60g-100g. I felt lucky – I only saw it because a lovely man let us look through his spotting scope.Sachin,eightRead today’s other YCD, by Mia, 11: ‘Finding fly agaric was a fairytale’The Young Country Diarysubmission formis now closed, but keep hold of the link, it will reopen for winter articles on Friday 3 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsBirdsYoung country diaryRural affairsAnimalsScotlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After all,Donald Trumphad calledZohran Mamdania “100% Communist Lunatic” and “total nut job.” The incoming democratic socialist New York mayor in turn had called the Republican US president a “despot” and “fascist”.But anyone expecting to see fists fly and shirts torn in the Oval Office was in for a disappointment. Trump, 79, and 34-year-old Mamdaniactually got on rather well. In fact beautifully, bewilderingly, bizarrely well. Instead of Batman v Superman, this was Toy Story besties Woody and Buzz Lightyear.‘I’ll stick up for you’: key moments from the cordial Trump-Mamdani meetingRead morePerhaps the old left v right binaries really are dead. This was a case of game recognising game – of Queens recognising Queens. Trump is now on much better terms with Zohran Mamdani thanMarjorie Taylor Greene, his fellow Republican. Mamdani got a warmer reception from Trump than from the leaders of his own party – a world turned upside down.The buddy movie began with Trump sitting behind the Resolute Desk and Mamdani standing to his side, a statuette of George Washington behind him. “We have one thing in common – we want this city of ours that we love to do very well,” the president said, referring toNew York.He added: “I think you’re going to have hopefully a really great mayor. The better he does – the happier I am. I will say there’s no difference in party, there’s no difference in anything, and we’re going to be helping him to make everybody’s dream come true, having a strong and very safe New York.”That great thud was the sound of White House reporters’ jaws hitting the floor of the Oval Office. That shredding noise was the sound of Republican strategists destroying their playbook to demonise Mamdani as the Marxist face of the Democrats.The bromance – as incongruous as Trumplaughing and jokingwith Barack Obama at Jimmy Carter’s funeral – went on with plenty of tactile body language. Mamdani, who will be the first Muslim mayor of New York and once proclaimed himself “Donald Trump’s worst nightmare,” reported: “It was a productive meeting focused on a place of shared admiration and love, which is New York City, and the need to deliver affordability to New Yorkers.”Once reporters started asking questions, Trump acknowledged that Mamdani has views that are “out there” but predicted he is “going to change” and “is going to surprise some conservative people, actually”.Both men noted that some Mamdani voters had also voted for Trump. The democratic socialist said it was because of “cost of living, cost of living, cost of living” – and he looked forward to delivering with the president on “the affordability agenda”. Trump acknowledged: “Some of his ideas really are the same ideas that I have.”So when Mamdani was asked about his past description of Trump as a despot with a fascist agenda, he artfully pivoted from points of disagreement back to affordability. The president then interjected: “And I’ve been called much worse than a despot, so it’s not that insulting.”Whatwouldcount as an insult these days? Totalitarian? Tyrant? Dictator? Führer? When a Fox News reporter asked if Mamdani stood by his comments that Trump is a fascist, Trump interjected before he could fully answer the question.“That’s OK. You can just say yes. OK?” Trump said, patting Mamdani affectionately on the arm. “It’s easier … than explaining it. I don’t mind.”Cute – but historians may opine that a US president lightly shrugging off the term fascist was not a stellar moment in the history of the republic.Trump jumped in again when a reporter asked Mamdani why he flew to Washington instead of taking a train, which uses less fossil fuels. “I’ll stick up for you,” the president said, before saying flying was faster and Mamdani was busy.And when someone asked about Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a staunch Trump allyrunning for governor of New York state, having branded Mamdani “a jihadist”, the president said he did not agree, calling him “a very rational person”.One can imagine Stefanik being reached for comment and saying, “NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!”Indeed, it was hard to get a wafer between Mamdani and Trump. The president, who had previously threatened to strip federal funding from the biggest US city if Mamdani won the 4 November mayor’s race, said: “I expect to be helping him not hurting him – a big help. Because I want New York City to be great.”Asked if he would feel comfortable living in New York under a Mamdani administration, the billionaire Trump responded: “Yeah, I would, I really would – especially after the meeting, absolutely. We agree on a lot more than I would have thought.”He elaborated by saying they had discussed how, when democratic socialistBernie Sandersdropped out of the 2016 presidential race, Trump picked up “a lot” of his voters on his way to the first of his two presidencies because Sanders had raised issues such as rip-off trade deals. “Bernie Sanders and I agreed on much more than people thought,” Trump said.The comment implied that the far left and far right ends of the political spectrum are not at opposite ends in a straight line but rather curve toward each otherlike the ends of a horseshoe. Hence Trump and Mamdani might have more in common than they do with the establishment moderates of their own parties.Certainly both channeled frustration with the status quo and the elites. But as Trump courts oligarchs,plans a lavish ballroomand enriches his own family, his claim to economic populism is hard to swallow.Perhaps his warm handshake with Mamdani on Friday was less about ideology than Trump’s love of a winner leaving the president willing to flatter the mayor-elect.As Trump put it: “It’s an amazing thing that he did.”Perhaps the president recognises a fellow savant when it comes to insurgent election campaigns. Or perhaps two New Yorkers sitting in a room and saying I ❤ NY is a language no one else can quite understand.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe US politics sketchZohran MamdaniUS politicsNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nearby states have also shuttered all their schools as a precaution.In addition, the national education ministry has ordered that 47 boarding secondary schools across the country be shut.President Bola Tinubu has cancelled international engagements, including attending the G20 summit in Johannesburg, to handle the crisis.The two abduction operations and an attack on a church in the west of the country, in which two people were killed and dozens abducted, have happened since the US president,Donald Trump, threatened military actionover what he called the killing of Christians by radical Islamists in Nigeria.US defence secretary Pete Hegseth called on the government to “take both urgent and enduring action to stop violence against Christians”, during talks with the Nigerian national security adviser, Nuhu Ribadu, the Pentagon said on Friday.Nigeria is still scarred by the kidnapping ofnearly 300 girls by Boko Haramjihadists at Chibok in northeastern Borno state more than a decade ago. Some of those girls are still missing.View image in fullscreenParents pick up their children from a girls’ college in Abuja, Nigeria after the federal government ordered the temporary closure of 41 schools.Photograph: Afolabi Sotunde/EPAIn a video clip shared by CAN, a distraught-looking, unidentified St Mary’s staff member describes hearing the sounds of motorcycles and cars before “there was serious bang, bang on different gates of the compound”.“Children were crying,” she said, describing her panic while looking for keys to the section where the crying was loudest. A security guard was heard groaning and after some time she heard the gang driving away.The “attackers operated aggressively and without interruption for nearly three hours, moving through dormitories”, said the local Catholic diocese.Meanwhile, about 600km away, on the outskirts of Abuja, 40-year-old nurse Stella Shaibu collected her daughter on Saturday from a school in Bwari, after the directive to close some boarding schools.“How can 300 students be taken away at the same time?” she asked, concluding that the “government is not doing anything” to curb insecurity.“If there is something that the American government can do to salvage this situation, I’m totally in support,” she told AFP.In a separate attack on a church in western Nigeria on Tuesday, gunmen killed two people during a service that was being broadcast online. Dozens of worshippers are believed to have been abducted.For years, heavily armed criminal gangs have been killing thousands and conducting kidnappings for ransom in rural areas of northwest and central Nigeria, where there is little state presence.No group has claimed responsibility for the latest attacks but bandit gangs seeking ransom payments often target schools in rural areas where security is weak.Gangs have camps in a vast forest straddling several states in the west.Although bandits have no ideological leanings and are motivated by financial gain, their increasing alliance with jihadists from the north-east has been a source of concern for authorities and security analysts.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

An online petition garnered more than a million signatures, while many people – including the Grammy-award winning singer Tyla – changed their social media profiles to purple, a colour often associated with women’s rights.View image in fullscreenCampaigners gather in Pretoria for the Women’s Shutdown protest, organised by Women for Change, on the eve of the G20 summit in Johannesburg.Photograph: Kim Ludbrook/EPAIn response to the campaign, the head of the National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC), Dr Bongani Elias Sithole, announced on Friday that it wouldclassify gender-based violence and femicideas a national disaster.The NDMC had previously said that the categorisation did not meet the legal requirements defined in the Disaster Management Act; however, after evaluating “the persistent and immediate life-safety risks posed by ongoing acts of violence”, the centre concluded that it now met the threshold.Women march against gender violence in South Africa as G20 leaders arriveThe minister of cooperative governance and traditional affairs, Velenkosini Hlabisa, welcomed the decision, which will allow authorities to dedicate resources and strengthen their support of existing structures to combat gender-based violence.“The women of our country are crying out that they need much more focus on the issue of gender-based violence,” South African president Cyril Ramaphosa said at a G20 sideline summit for civil society on Thursday. During the event he said the government would classify gender-based violence and femicide as a “crisis”.Women For Change celebrated the announcement on its Instagram account, posting a statement saying “we have won”.“We have written history together. We forced the country to finally confront the truth.” It added that next week it is planning to convene a follow-up meeting to discuss a “detailed action plan and timeline”.Explore more on these topicsViolence against women and girlsWomenG20South AfricaAfricaWomen's rights and gender equalitynewsShareReuse this content"

Developing countries achieved part of their goal at the global talks, which was a tripling of the financial support available from rich countries to help them adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis. They should receive $120bn (£92bn) a year for adaptation, from the $300bn developed countries pledged to them last year, but not until 2035, instead of the 2030 deadline they were demanding. Many had also hoped the increase would be on top of the $300bn.‘The Amazon insisted on being heard’: seven key takeaways from Cop30Read moreA roadmap to the halting of deforestation was dropped from the final deal, a bitter disappointment for nature advocates at this “rainforest Cop” held in Belém, near the mouth of the Amazon River.The agreement among 194 countries – excluding the US, which did not send a delegation – was reached in the early morning after 12 hours of nonstop extra-time talks among ministers in deserted conference halls, and completed at a closing meeting at 1.35pm, after negotiations were hauled back from the brink of collapse on Friday evening.In the plenary, many country delegations, including Colombia, complained vociferously that they were not allowed to speak before the deal was gavelled through, despite Brazil having said this would be “Cop of truth”. The session was briefly paused but the Cop president, André Corrêa do Lago, then confirmed that the decisions that were gavelled through earlier had been adopted.Jennifer Morgan, the Cop veteran and former German climate envoy, said: “While far from what’s needed, the outcome in Belém is meaningful progress. The Paris agreement is working, the transition away from fossil fuels agreed in Dubai [at the Cop28 talks in 2023] is accelerating. Despite the efforts of major oil-producing states to slow down the green transition, multilateralism continues to support the interests of the whole world in tackling the climate crisis.”Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: “With an increasingly fractured geopolitical backdrop,Cop30gave us some baby steps in the right direction, but considering the scale of the climate crisis, it has failed to rise to the occasion. Despite calling themselves climate leaders, developed countries have betrayed vulnerable nations by failing to deliver science-aligned national emission reduction plans.”View image in fullscreenA drought-stricken village in Turkana, northern Kenya, in 2023, when climate breakdown caused the worst drought in the region’s history.Photograph: SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesAisha Humaira, Pakistan’s head of delegation, accused developed countries of hypocrisy: “Countries that have used all sources of energy in the last 200 years and have achieved the pinnacle of industrial growth and yet not stopped using all those sources of energy are telling us ‘stop growing,’” she said. “The right to growth and security is fundamental for every country.”Efforts to limit global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, in line with the goals of the Paris agreement, were also addressed in the final text, but less robustly than vulnerable countries had hoped. Before the conference, countries were supposed to present new national plans on cutting emissions, but they fell short of the commitments needed to maintain the 1.5C limit, which has already been breached but which analysts say could be returned to.Instead of censuring this failure, the conference agreed to set up an “accelerator” programme to address the shortfall in the nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which will report back at next year’s Cop, to be held in Turkey but presided over by Australia. The text exhorted countries to “full implementation of NDCs while striving to do better”.The final deal also recognised the “just transition” that social justice campaigners have been calling for, which means helping workers affected by the move away from fossil fuels and towards clean energy. But key provisions on the exploitation of “critical minerals” – which has been accompanied by soaring human rights abuses in some countries – were blocked by China and Russia.0:38Moment world secures compromise deal at Cop30 that sidesteps fossil fuels – videoInsiders said the talks came close to foundering on Friday, after a hectic few weeks in Brazil that began with a summit of world leaders held by Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and attended by about 50 heads or deputy heads of state.But after the leaders left and Cop30 formally began on Monday 10 November, discussions among ministers and high-ranking officials degenerated into a bitter standoff. A fire near the delegation offices on Thursday afternoon, in which no one was seriously hurt, forced evacuation of the conference centre and disrupted negotiations at a crucial stage.‘It’s like arguing with robots’: negotiators on the state of Cop30 talksRead moreWhen they resumed late on Thursday evening, the rift was clear: more than 80 countries had declared in favour of including a commitment to “transition away from fossil fuels” in the final outcome, but scores of countries – led by the Arab group, which includes Saudi Arabia – lined up against it.That opposition forced the relegation of the “transition away from fossil fuels” – that scientists say is essential to staving off the worst effects of climate breakdown – to a voluntary commitment rather than the legally binding decision many had hoped for.Teresa Anderson, the global lead on climate justice at ActionAid International, said: “A lack of climate finance is throwing a spanner in the works of climate progress. Global south countries, [which] are already carrying the costs of the climate crisis they have not caused, desperately need support from rich countries if they are to take on any more commitments. Nowhere was this more stark than on the issue of fossil fuels, where specific text once again ended up unfunded and on the cutting-room floor.”Nikki Reisch, from the Center for International Environmental Law, said: “This is an empty deal. Cop30 provides a stark reminder that the answers to the climate crisis do not lie inside the climate talks – they lie with the people and movements leading the way toward a just, equitable, fossil-free future.”Explore more on these topicsCop30Climate crisisBrazilClimate financeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The 70-year-old politician was taken to a federal police base, seven miles from the presidential palace he occupied from 2019 to 2022, when he lost the election and tried to launch a military coup.The arrest of Bolsonaro, who had been living under house arrest in the capital, Brasília, since August, was ordered by the supreme court justice, Alexandre de Moraes, as a result of fears the former president might make a run for one of Brasília’s many diplomatic compounds to avoid punishment for the failed power grab.View image in fullscreenA supporter of Jair Bolsonaro holds a Brazilian flag outside the federal police headquarters in Brasília, where Bolsonaro is under arrest, on 22 November.Photograph: Eraldo Peres/APIn September, Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison over a scheme to stop the 2022 election winner, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, taking office. However, the court has yet to order Bolsonaro’s imprisonment for those crimes while a series of legal procedures and appeals play out.Amid growing speculation that Bolsonaro would be imprisoned in the coming days, supporters had been planning to hold a “vigil” on Saturday night outside the luxury condominium where their leader has been living under house arrest.The protest had been called by Bolsonaro’s senator son, Flávio Bolsonaro, in a social media video: “Are you going to fight for your country or are you going to watch everything on your mobile phone while sitting at home on your sofa?” He invited Bolsonaristas to “come and fight with us”.In his ruling ordering Bolsonaro’s arrest on Saturday morning, Moraes said it was possible the vigil could be used as a diversion to help the former president escape to a foreign embassy.Adding to those suspicions, Moraes said Bolsonaro’s electronic ankle monitor had been tampered with at 12.08am on Saturday. That suggested “the convict had planned to break the ankle monitor in order to ensure the success of his escape, aided by the confusion caused by the protest called by his son”.Moraes noted how Bolsonaro, who counts the US president, Donald Trump, among his international allies, lived about 15 minutes from the US embassy. In August, Bolsonaro was accused of seeking asylum in Argentina, where another rightwing ally, Javier Milei, holds power. In 2024, Bolsonaro mysteriouslyspent two nights inside the embassyof Hungary.Speculation that Bolsonaro’s arrest was imminent had reached fever pitch in recent days as allies voiced outrage at the prospect of the former president beingsent to a maximum security prison in Brasilía called Papuda.Lula supporters have voiced satisfaction that the ex-president appeared jail bound. “The message toBrazil, and to the world, is that crime doesn’t pay,” said Reimont Otoni, a Workers’ party (PT) congressman, noting how Bolsonaro’s plot included a conspiracy to assassinate Lula.Bolsonaro’s evangelical wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, responded to her husband’s arrest by posting an excerpt from Psalm 121 on social media. “The Lord will keep you from all harm – he will watch over your life; the Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore,” it said.Congressman Sóstenes Cavalcante, one of Bolsonaro’s closest allies, called the arrest “the biggest [act of] political persecution in Brazilian history”.Bolsonaro’s lawyers voiced “profound perplexity” at their client’s detention in a sparsely decorated 12 sq metre police bedroom and vowed to appeal against a decision they claimed would put the former president’s life at risk, given his “delicate” health.Talíria Petrone, a leftwing congresswoman from Rio, captured the joy among progressives, as Bolsonaro’s detractors were filmed opening bottles of sparkling wine and setting off fireworks outside the federal police HQ. “Today the alarm clock sounded different: it was the news of Bolsonaro’s arrest illuminating the morning,” she tweeted, adding: “Brazil smiles. A wonderful day.”Petra Costa, a film-maker and the director of documentaries about Bolsonaro’s attacks on Brazilian democracy, was also celebrating. “Brazil just succeeded where America failed. Bringing a former president who assaulted democracy to justice,” she wrote on Facebook.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

We took that advice onboard.”View image in fullscreenTom Player, who survived a snowstorm in Patagonia in Chile, which killed five people.Photograph: Tom PlayerHe said: “There is absolutely no way anyone should have been allowed. It was too risky for the mountain rescue teams so why was it open to the public?”Bond, from Truro, died along with Cristina Calvillo Tovar and Julian Garcia Pimentel from Mexico and Nadine Lichey and Andreas Von Pein from Germany.Chilean authorities have been criticised by the hikers for suggesting that the tourists became lost near the park’s Los Perros camp.Player, 39, said: “We’ve been relentlessly trying to correct the record. Claiming that anyone got lost, four out of the five people were on the trail.“I saw three of them in my efforts to go up. Our friend Victoria … was on the trail. To claim they got lost is really upsetting and inflammatory. We have GPS data to back it all up.”Player described the storm as “absolutely brutal”, with cold temperatures, downpours, sleet and snow.He said: “We had seen a forecast which gave us a heads-up, gusts of over 100km/h [60mph], sustained high winds throughout the day.“I don’t think any of us expected blizzard-like conditions, it got progressively worse throughout the day. We left at around 5.30am in the morning, there was heavy rain, lots of wind.“We were getting knocked over, even crouching down on all fours. I wasn’t prepared for mountaineering conditions where you would have spikes in your boots, rope, snow goggles. I think it took everyone by surprise.”Player said the hiking group included a head of ER, junior doctors, a helicopter paramedic and a psychologist who all helped during the rescue effort.“The rescue effort was one of those moments when you realise you have so much faith in humanity and people.”He added: “There was a general unpreparedness and lack of emergency planning. We made a stretcher out of a set of hiking poles, gaffer tape, a tent cord and a sleeping mat.”Player said he came across other hikers during his search for Bond. “One staff member came forward out of compassion. He was amazing, he and I ran up the hill.“We found someone, who later turned out to be Cristina [Calvillo Tovar], who was hypothermic. He gave her gloves and a coat and tried to walk with her to get her some help. I found another person and was later told it was Julian [Garcia Pimentel], who was dead.“I carried on up the hill and found someone else, who later turned out to be one of the German ladies. She was responsive. I tried to help her up, she was deeply hypothermic. I wrapped my sleeping bag around her and stayed with her and tried to give her a drink of hot water.”Player added: “I went up there looking for my friend and I didn’t find her, it is very hard to live with that. I had no idea how many people had succumbed to this brutal cold.”Bond, a PR manager for the Visit Isles of Scilly tourism organisation, was a “lovable, witty and creative” person, said Adrian Jones, who worked with Bond promoting the Roseland festival in Cornwall.Euan Rodger, executive vice-chair of Visit Isles of Scilly, said: “She brought life, energy, and an infectious enthusiasm to every project, making her a true joy to work alongside.”Mauricio Ruiz, the regional director of Conaf, Chile’s national forestry corporation, which employs the park’s rangers, told local news media that “there were no park rangers on the night of the 16th” because of mandatory voting in Chile’s presidential election.Explore more on these topicsChileAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In October, he was cleared to return home by a Paris appeals court after most of the charges against him were dropped.However, Tein says he is unable to return because French authorities have not re-issued him with a passport.“It’s been a while since I submitted my passport application,” Tein said in an interview in Montpellier. “But we can see that [the French government] are deliberately dragging it out.”“A year in solitary confinement, it was very, very hard,” Tein said of his stint in prison. “Psychologically, you never come out of this kind of situation unscathed,” added Tein, who is now living in Alsace in north-east France. He remains under formal investigation for conspiracy and organised robbery, both of which he denies.New Caledonia, also known by its Indigenous name, Kanaky, is a group of islands in the south-west Pacific Ocean about 750 miles east of Australia.Ruled from Paris since 1853, it is one of several overseas territories that remain an integral part of France.View image in fullscreenA street blocked by debris and burnt-out items after overnight unrest in the Magenta district of Noumea, New Caledonia, May 2024.Photograph: Delphine Mayeur/AFP/Getty ImagesIn May last year, unrest and rioting erupted after Emmanuel Macron’s attempt to change voting laws to allow thousands of mostly white French residents who had lived on the islands for 10 or more years to vote. Kanaks – who make up about41% of the population– said the proposal would permanently derail any hope for independence. Paris said the measure was needed to improve democracy.Fourteen people– most of them Kanak – were killed in the worst violence on the islands since the pro-independence protests of the 1980s.The French president responded by declaring astate of emergency, temporarily shutting down the borders and flying inthousandsof military police. The prison in the capital, Nouméa, waspartly burned down, so dozens of incarcerated Kanaks were transferred with little or no notice to the mainland.View image in fullscreenA Kanak flag flies next to a burning vehicle at a roadblock at La Tamoa, in the commune of Paita, New Caledonia, during the violence of May 2024.Photograph: Delphine Mayeur/AFP/Getty ImagesAt the time, Tein was the leader of the Field Action Coordination Cell, the pro-independence movement which had led calls for peaceful protests against the electoral law change. Hisarrest, as well as those of six other Kanak activists, caused protests toflare up again.“Many in New Caledonia saw it as a ‘deportation’, like that of so many others in colonial history,” said Johann Bihr, of theInternational Prison Observatory.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Tein – who was elected president of the Kanak National and Socialist Liberation Front while in prison – was not among them. “We reject Bougival, but I need to be at the table to discuss the future of the country,” Tein said, alluding to his inability to return home.View image in fullscreenFrench police forces take part in an operation to remove a roadblock set up by pro-independence supporters in the Vallee du Tir district of Noumea, June 2024.Photograph: Delphine Mayeur/AFP/Getty ImagesConcerns have also been raised about the alleged mistreatment of other Kanak independence figures and activists.Among the six Kanak activists flown on the private chartered plane to France with Tein in June 2024 was 31-year-oldGuillaume Vama, a Kanak agroforestry expert who spent a year in a French jail in Bourges.Vama said of his arrest that he initially thought he was being abducted by loyalists who wanted to remain part of France. A man armed with a machine gun ordered him to raise his hands, while another pointed a rifle at him and placed a hood over his head. “I thought my life was going to end,” he said.He added that after being told by a judge that he was being transferred to France, he was handcuffed for 96 hours and struck on the knee by gendarmes, and did not receive any treatment for the injury while in prison.“I felt completely dehumanised, treated like an animal,” Vama said of his flight to France. “To me, it was a clear message that the [French] state had no limits.”Naïma Moutchou, France’s overseas territories minister, and Gérald Darmanin, the justice minister, have been approached for comment.View image in fullscreenTein: “A year in solitary confinement, it was very, very hard. Psychologically, you never come out of this kind of situation unscathed.”Photograph: Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty ImagesUrko Aiartza, a co-president of the European Association of Lawyers for Democracy & World Human Rights, said the delay to the issuing of Tein’s passport “may amount to an unlawful restriction on his right to freedom of movement”.Tein’s legal team said the same administration that rapidly issued him with a temporary passport before being ordered to prison in France was now delaying the issuing of a new passport.Until his imprisonment, Tein had never travelled to mainland France. “I always refused because I said I would come when my country was independent,” he said, laughing.Asked about his plans if he makes it back to New Caledonia, he said: “I am 57 years old and I don’t think I have the right to pass this problem on to future generations. [Independence] is our only ambition.”Explore more on these topicsNew CaledoniaPacific islandsFranceEuropeAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Last week he said a banner reading “Abolish the Jewish Lobby” at a neo-Nazi rally in Sydney was “political speech” that should be “protected”.Chavura has denied being a white nationalist and called the Herald’s reporting an “attempt to strangle a rising new conservative movement in its infancy”.McInerney, a former deputy head of the Ramsay Centre for Western Civilisation who also serves on Campion’s academic board and board of trustees, attended theMarch for Australiarally in Sydney this August, where he warned of a “radical transformation” of Australia caused by “reckless levels of immigration”.On X McInerney describes himself as an “Australian nationalist”.“I love the Commonwealth created by & for White Australians & want my people to flourish in it again,” his bio says.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailHe posted a string of comments on X this month encouraging the public to become “political supporters” of the White Australia party (WAP), which was formed this year by the National Socialist Network, a coalition of neo-Nazis led by Thomas Sewell.McInerney’s comments were directly responding to concerns raised by an Australian federal police acting deputy commissioner, Nigel Ryan,at a parliamentary committee examining the 2025 electionover the National Socialist Network’s bid to enter politics.McInerney reiterated to Guardian Australia that the WAP should be free to stand in elections, not because it was the “most ideal answer to our nation’s problems” but in the “interests of our democracy and the larger cause of the anti-mass-immigration movement”.He described himself as an “ethno-religious nationalist” but said he did not espouse personal political views in class and they formed “no part” of his curriculum, while adding he would be “happy to explain or clarify my views” outside the college.“Whether or not I would vote for the White Australia party would depend on what other parties were running. Ideally, I’d rather vote for a pro-White and explicitly pro-Christian party,” he said.“I believe European peoples should have their own homelands, like every other race, where they are unquestioned super majorities, and that it is legitimate for them to organise politically to preserve or achieve that reality,” he said.He said his “ideological disagreements with National Socialism are a matter of the public record”.Chauvra has also reiterated his views, writing on X that “Anglo-Celtic” people should be the “overwhelming demographic majority” in Australia. “Yes, it is an ethnic conception of the Australian nation and culture,” he wrote on Wednesday.Campion, a small private institution in western Sydney, was founded in 2006 and offers degrees in history, literature, philosophy and theology at the “heart of the Western intellectual tradition”.Its academic freedom policy permits staff to “include content in their teaching that may offend or shock any student or class of students”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Members of its board of trustees include Joseph de Bruyn, whocame under firelast year for comparing abortion to the“human toll of world war two”at an Australian Catholic University graduation ceremony, and the former Liberal minister Zed Seselja.De Bruyn and Seselja did not respond to requests for comment.This year the college unveiled a grand hall named after the late cardinalGeorge Pell. The former Liberal prime ministers John Howard and Tony Abbott, both longtime supporters of the college, spoke at the event.Howard declined to comment on McInerney’s public remarks. “I maintain my respect for Campion College,” he said. Abbott did not respond to a request for comment.Campion received $5m in federal government funding under the former Coalition government as part of its $20m capital works appeal, and an additional $5m from the state government towards infrastructure between 2021 and 2024.A spokesperson for Teqsa said the compliance processes related to the “extent to which Campion is meeting its obligations under theHigher Education Standards Framework (2021)in relation to matters that have been publicly reported”. They did not confirm which parts of the framework were in question.The chief executive of Teqsa, Mary Russell,told a Senate inquiryinto higher education governance last week the body had requested answers on how the college was responding to “safety, wellbeing, discrimination and inclusion”.“If we felt that they were not compliant and there were evidence of that, we would consider taking action in the form of conditions or other requirements,” she said.The deputy Greens leader and higher education spokesperson, Mehreen Faruqi, has been a subject of McInerney’s posts. She said: “There should be no place for white supremacy and white nationalism in higher education,” she said. “It is shocking that public funding has been provided to this college.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian universitiesFar rightAustralian educationAustralian politicsLiberal partyRaceFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

In excess of 700 of the fighter jet’s “critical pieces” aremanufactured in Victoria alone, according to the state government. Australia also hosts a regional distribution hub for F-35 parts in NSW.“Every F-35 contains crucial parts made in Australia,” said Duncan Frewin, the clerk of the pacifist group Quakers Australia, which researches arms exports.“Any bomb dropped by these planes can only do so because the Australian government has written a blank cheque to Lockheed Martin, selling them Australian-made parts with no human rights restrictions or monitoring.”Frewin said Saudi Arabia had a “deplorable human rights record and it is reckless to sell them the world’s most lethal aircraft”.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe national president of the Medical Association for Prevention of War, Dr Sue Wareham, said Saudi Arabia had an “appalling human rights record”, in particular in its prosecution of the war in Yemen.“To pretend that weaponry in the hands of the Saudi rulers would only be used lawfully and in accordance with human rights principles is not plausible.”Frewin and Wareham are advocates for peace and disarmament, but their concerns are also shared by more hawkish defence analysts who worry that Australia is losing control of which militaries it supports.The Saudification of America is under way | Karen AttiahRead moreThe founder of the defence and security thinktank Strategic Analysis Australia, Michael Shoebridge, said the sale of up to 48 F-35s to Saudi Arabia presented issues for Australia that “we’ve tried desperately to ignore with the Israelis”.“We will be supporting the Saudis’ use of the aircraft however they choose to use it, and the Saudis’ involvement in the Yemeni civil war in recent years shows this isn’t a hypothetical,” said Shoebridge.Shoebridge, a former senior defence policy official in the Australian embassy in Washington DC, has previously said the complex F-35 supply chain allows governments to deny direct support for foreign militaries.The US economy is so dependent on weapons sales that there appear to be few constraintsSue WarehamAt Senate estimates last month defence department deputy secretary, Hugh Jeffrey, told senators the global F-35 supply chain was a “unique arrangement”.“It’s a global supply chain. We participate in that. Goods are moved around the world. These are US-owned goods. They’re managed by Lockheed Martin. Australia does not direct the export of those goods. It does not control the export of those goods.Goods manufactured in Australia require an export permit. The Department of Defence did not answer questions about whether Australia could – or would – refuse to supply parts for jets bound for Saudi Arabia.And the US itself does not comprehensively monitor where its weapons end up or how they are used.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMorning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While spruiking democracy, the US in fact sells weapons toover half the world’s autocracies.

Washington has given Kyiv a deadline of Thursday to respond.European leaders met on the sidelines of the summit to discuss their response to the plan.Zelenskyy says Ukraine has impossible choice as Trump pushes plan to end warRead moreIn a joint statement they said the draft “includes important elements that will be essential for a just and lasting peace”, but it is “a basis which will require additional work”.They were clear that “borders must not be changed by force”.They added that any elements relating to the EU and Nato would need their agreement, and that they “are ready to engage in order to ensure that a future peace is sustainable”.The statement was signed by the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Ireland, Finland, Norway, and of the EU, as well as the prime ministers of Canada and Japan.Ukraine and the US will meet in Switzerland in the coming days to discuss Washington’s plan, a Ukrainian official wrote on social media.Speaking to reporters at the summit in Johannesburg, the British prime minister,Keir Starmer, said the leaders were concerned about the US proposals to cap Ukraine’s military “because it’s fundamental that Ukraine has to be able to defend itself if there’s a ceasefire”.He described the Ukraine meeting on the sidelines of the summit as being between “mainly allies from the coalition of the willing” and repeated that “the consensus was that there are elements in the 28-point plan which are essential to lasting peace but it requires additional work, and we are going to engage on that”.1:50Zelenskyy warns of 'most difficult moment in history' amid pressure to accept US plan – videoLater on Saturday No 10 said Starmer had spoken to Trump on the phone and agreed their teams would work together on the peace plan during talks in Geneva.The call came after Starmer spoke to Zelenskyy and reiterated the UK’s “steadfast support” for Kyiv.US, Ukrainian and European national security advisers were due to gather in Switzerland on Sunday to “go through quite a bit of detail” of the framework, the prime minister said.More broadly, France’s president,Emmanuel Macron, called into question the efficacy of the G20, saying that the group of the world’s biggest economies is “at risk” because of its inability to find common ground and resolve major crises.“TheG20may be coming to the end of a cycle,” warned the French leader. “We are living in a moment of geopolitics in which we are struggling to resolve major crises together around this table, including with members who are not present today.”Washington boycotted the gathering of world leaders in South Africa over several issues, including the widely discredited claim that the host country’s white minority are the victims of large-scale killings. The South African government has strenuously denied these allegations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added: “We must absolutely demonstrate that we have concrete actions to re-engage this forum and provide responses for our economies collectively around this table.”Starmer agreed, saying the “road ahead is tough” but that “we need to find ways to play a constructive role again today in the face of the world challenges”.Although peace in Ukraine was the main focus, the G20 leaders also called for peace in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and in occupied Palestinian territory.There were concerns before the summit that Trump’s absence, alongside several other leaders including fromRussiaand China, would risk undermining the credibility of the G20 meeting, the first to take place on the African continent.But the summit’s host, President Cyril Ramaphosa, argued the group remained crucial for international cooperation. “The G20 underscores the value of the relevance of multilateralism. It recognises that the challenges that we face can only be resolved through cooperation, collaboration and partnership,” he said.The US will assume the G20 presidency in 2026, followed by the UK in 2027.Explore more on these topicsG20EuropeUkraineRussiaEuropean UnionKeir StarmerEmmanuel MacronnewsShareReuse this content"

In a high-risk move, Lutnick and Greer have been invited to lunch with 27 trade ministers who are gathering for a summit on Monday.One insider said: “We need to keep it focused, what we don’t want is individual countries going up to them and demanding deals on this, this and that.”Brussels struck a deal withDonald Trumpat his golf course in Scotland in July to avert his threat of 50% tariffs, instead agreeing a baseline 15% levy on most EU imports into the US.Now Washington officials have made it clear they are frustrated with the EU’s slow pace of implementation on that deal, which is not legally binding and needs to be passed by parliament, a process that could take until February.Among the significant outstanding problems expected to be discussed at Monday’s talks are the continuing50% tariffs on steel and aluminium, separatetariffs on products with steel elements, and food and drink levies.Several member states want to see the removal of the 15% tax on wine and spirits including France, which has been hit by duties on Cognac, Ireland on whiskey and all the wine-producing countries.Before a dinner on Monday night Lutnick and Greer will hold talks with the EU’s trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, its defence commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, and the commissioner responsible for technology, Henna Virkkunen, to discuss the continuing crisis involving chip supply from China.They will also meet industry bosses at a business round table expected to included the heads of Volkswagen and the French company TotalEnergies, said insiders.Persuading the US that the steel derivatives go entirely against spirit of the deal struck in July was a “top priority” said one EU insider.In September, the US listed 407 products that included an element of steel, ranging from knitting needles to wind turbines and washing machines, that would face separate tariffs.And now, as part ofa rolling programmeto protect its industries,it is looking at adding a further 700 productsincluding tin cans and bicycles.Companies such as theGerman agriculture machinery firm Krone, have said the “hidden” tariffs are alarming and causing a nightmare for exporters with US customs officials charging 200% in tariffs to anyone who has failed to complete a mountain of paperwork citing the origin of all steel from the “suppliers” and the “supplier to the supplier to the supplier”.The EU and US will also discuss the prospect of working in alignment to “ringfence” their domestic steel industries to protect against cheaper Chinese imports.Brussels hopes thatsteel anti-dumping proposals announced in October,which match Trump’s steel tariffs, will persuade the US president to slash the 50% tariffs on EU steel.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeEuropean UnionUS foreign policyTrump tariffsDonald TrumpEuropeTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is here,” the education minister, Sofia Zacharaki, said ahead of the pilot programme launch.The initiative, which is to be expanded nationally in January, makes Greece one of the first countries to pioneer the use of generative AI in the classroom.Workshops will initially focus on teachers mastering the new technology to assist lesson planning, research and personalised tuition, before ChatGPT Edu is gradually integrated into schools. Next spring, when older secondary school students are allowed to use the tool, access will be tightly monitored, officials say.Greece follows Estonia in its embrace of the technology. Prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s pro-business government has ambitions for Greece to become a technological hub, with Athens hosting one of Europe’s first AI factories.Although Mitsotakis has warned of “significant social unrest” if the AI revolution is seen only to enrich tech companies, his administration is among the first to devise a national strategy to prepare Greeks “for the developments that all kinds of applications of this technology will bring”.In schools where the majority of pupils already use apps such as ChatGPT, the government has been guided by the belief that “if you can’t beat the bot, befriend the bot.”But among some Greeks the response has been less enthusiastic.Secondary school pupils, citing the pressures of an education system overly concentrated on exams, express fears of being “outsmarted and controlled” by AI if it is allowed to develop unrestricted.“It terrifies me,” said 17-year-old Aristidis Tolos, attending a demonstration in central Athens, held in part to protest against the direction of education reforms. “They’re asking so much of us, and now this. AI doesn’t have a soul, it’s a machine.”OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer, Chris Lehane, says Greece’s commitment to test-run the chatbot amounts to a “new educational chapter” for the country. Under the deal, the US company has pledged to oversee that “best practices for safe, effective classroom use” are applied.Sceptics are concerned that Greece is becoming a laboratory for a technology whose inherent risks include the erosion of critical and creative thinking.In the downtown offices of the federation of secondary school teachers, Olme, the prospect of its introduction has ignited consternation.“At our recent congress it was the main issue of discussion, with many voicing disquiet,” said top official Dimitris Aktypis, adding that there is concern about whether these changes could ultimately lead to “teacherless” classes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It poses a huge threat to critical thinking if kids are spoon-fed answers.”The government, he said, should instead focus on improving facilities in a nation where the education sector is allotted less than 5% of the budget, despite demands for increases going back decades.“In the winter you see kids shivering in classrooms because we are only allowed to put the heating on for a single hour,” said Panayiotokopoulos. “They talk about the digital age, but often basic things like electricity and plugs don’t work. It’s an atrocious situation that needs to be urgently tackled.”Olme represents 85,000 teachers, most of them permanent staff, who speak of an ingrained culture in classrooms of rote-learning.“We shouldn’t be technophobic. AI, after all, can help educators be more effective,” said Panos Karagiorgos, a secondary school physics teacher.“But it’s problematic when AI is used in a system whose sole aim is to produce pupils who can pass exams. There’s no interest in schools producing well-rounded kids, which in itself stifles creativity.”View image in fullscreenPhysics teacher Panos Karagiorgos: ‘We shouldn’t be technophobic’ but AI ‘stifles creativity’.Photograph: Helena Smith/The GuardianUntil now, AI has been exclusively used in private schools in Greece. Athens College, the alma mater of several Greek leaders, including Mitsotakis, was among the first to use AI to aid course design and instruction.“I don’t think Greece should miss this passing train,” said Alexis Phylactopoulos, chair of the school’s board of directors, adding that he wholeheartedly supported AI’s integration into the national curriculum if critical thinking and creativity was safeguarded.“There’s no easy answers with AI.

Beyond the disordered chairs and tables and the sign instructing neighbours and friends to “pay whatever you like”, the ridge falls away to fields, then a fence, then hills littered with the skeletal ruins of shattered Lebanese villages.The 44-year-old brewer is standing in front of the house his grandfather built when the Manara kibbutz was founded in the 1940s in the very far north of Israel. The building was hit repeatedly by missiles fired byHezbollahduring the conflict, which ended a year ago, and will now almost certainly be demolished, along with most of the neighbouring houses.“Wars destroy things, but bring opportunities too,” Erlich said.There is a bipartisan consensus inIsraelthis weekend that a fresh military offensive to “finish the job” of destroying Hezbollah’s military capabilities is imminent.View image in fullscreenNoam Ehrlich called the war a ‘blessing in disguise’.Photograph: Jason Burke/The GuardianIsrael threatens to step up attacks against Hezbollah in LebanonRead moreThe left-leaning Haaretz newspaper told readers last week that the“immediate flash point”was “now in Lebanon, not Gaza”, while Amit Segal, a journalist close to the ruling coalition government of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said that “a dramatic escalation against Hezbollah” was “more likely than not”.On the border, there is a tense calm.Israel’s air defence systems protected local communities from most of the rocket barrages launched by Hezbollah in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza, but 47 civilians in Israel and 83 Israeli soldiers died, with hundreds more wounded, and tens of thousands displaced. Israel’s major offensive in autumn last year delivered a series of devastating blows to Hezbollah but also killed an estimated3,800 peoplein Lebanon, including many civilians, and forced 1.2 million from their homes. Damage was estimated at $8.5bn (£6.5bn).Erlich, like many along the Israeli side of the border, is sanguine about the future. Though he has lost his home and the microbrewery that provided his income when forced to evacuate Manara, he switched production to large commercial breweries in central Israel and now sells ten times more.“The war was a blessing in disguise,” he said.Most of those Israelis who evacuated in the first days of the war have now returned to border communities, or others are taking their place.Metula, the northernmost town in Israel, was turned into an army base during the war and 80% of its houses were damaged by missiles launched by Hezbollah from positions insideLebanon, but just hundreds of metres away. The pre-war population was 1,670. It is now 900. In the war, “some won, some lost,” said David Azoulay, Metula’s mayor.The town’s 130-year-old synagogue is being reconstructed, the road repaved and the town hall’s roof replaced.View image in fullscreenDavid Azoulay said Metula would be rebuilt better than it had been.Photograph: Jason Burke/The Guardian“We didn’t have funds to fix many of the buildings that needed work before the war … Now we are going to make the whole of this town way better than it was … We can build up luxury facilities, cultural opportunities, better health and childcare, build a new neighbourhood,” said Azoulay.But it is clear that whatever the new investment in some communities along Israel’s northern border, there are some former residents who will not come back. Those with young families have children in school elsewhere in Israel, others have found new jobs, or simply enjoy the convenience and attractions of big cities such as Tel Aviv, almost 125 miles (200 kilometres) away.Students who used to rent cheaply in Metula have stayed away too, but there has been a new influx: 40 families of nationalist and religious Israelis who see the reconstruction of Metula as a worthy cause.“Metula will stay secular [but] we can’t tell them not to come,” said Azulai. “They are Zionists and Jews like us. Personally, I have no problem with them.”The social consequences of the conflict are obvious in Kiryat Shmona, the “capital city” of the north, which is still missing around a quarter of its pre-war population. In a small mall on the northern outskirts, a third of shops and restaurants remain closed, and those that have reopened struggle.“I have to work my ass off to make ends meet,” said Sergio Helman, who kept serving humus and salad in his Blue Bus cafe throughout the war, despite rocket attacks.But Helman’s children, sent away during the conflict, have got used to life elsewhere in Israel and are in no hurry to return.“Things are slowly getting back to normal but the war created inner conflicts within communities here.

It anchors all our defences across the north … but it’s a ghost town. If people are going to come back we need to give them confidence that we can stop the enemy reaching our children’s beds,” said Yamit Malul Yanai, a local commentator and lawyer.Like many along Israel’s northern border, Malul Yanai frequently refers to the surprise Hamas raid into Israel in October 2023 which killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostage, triggering the war in Gaza.“We need a buffer zone to push the enemy back from our towns, but we are making the same mistakes all over again,” she said.From Metula, the de facto border between Israel and Lebanon runs south and then west along across forested ridges to the Mediterranean. Known as the “blue line”, it has not been formally recognised internationally. Since the ceasefire, Israeli forces have held five hill-top bases between up to a mile and a half inside Lebanon, and are building sections of high walls. The United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon (Unifil) has said at least one is within Lebanese territory, a charge denied by Israel.At Shtula, another Israeli border community evacuated during the war, residents have also been slow to return. A row of damaged homes faces Lebanon, many as yet unrepaired. The Israeli military has built a high concrete barrier just to the north and positioned tanks.Israel used widely banned cluster munitions in Lebanon, photos of remnants suggestRead more“We are fortifying the border … We want a barrier and the military between civilians and the enemy. We also have cameras, weapons systems, soldiers monitoring,” said a senior Israeli officer based close to the border. “We have learned the lessons of Gaza. We understand that the wall is part of the system, not the [whole] system, which was the mistake in Gaza.”From an outpost near Shtula, one of the new Israeli bases inside Lebanon is clearly visible, beyond slopes cleared of forest by the military during its invasion last year. Across a swath of the dry brown hills lies the scattered rubble of destroyed houses in now-deserted villages, starkly white against under the clear blue winter sky.“As long as [the] Lebanese army is not there, then we will have to be there,” the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.Israel has accused Hezbollah of trying to rearm since a US-backed ceasefire last year, and has launched more than 1,000 attacks in Lebanon since the 2024 ceasefire, killing hundreds of people. FreshIsraeli airstrikeshave hit targets across southern Lebanon in recent days.Hezbollah says it has complied with ceasefire requirements for it to withdraw from the border region near Israel, and for the Lebanese army to deploy there. Hezbollah’s leader, Naim Qassem, has refrained so far from ordering the movement’s tens of thousands of fighters to launch any military response to the Israeli strikes.Some analysts say talk of a fresh Israeli offensive may be designed to increase pressure on the Lebanese army to move more aggressively to disarm Hezbollah, but suggest it could also be intended to reinforce support for Israel’s rightwing ruling coalition.Israeli military officials said they were “committed to the ceasefire agreement, but also to Israel’s security”.Azoulay is unconcerned by the prospect of a new attack by Hezbollah.“We will deal with it if it happens,” he said. “All the [Lebanese Shia] villages around us, they are destroyed and basically uninhabitable. If you ask what is our victory, it is that we have been rebuilding for a year and they haven’t put a single pipe back in the ground.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelLebanonHezbollahMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

And 41% of those who backed Starmer for the leadership in 2020 said a new leader should be in place, with 40% wanting him to stay.Poll results showing how Labour members would vote in head-to-head contests between Keir Starmer and potential leadership rivalsThe poll exposed a rift among those who backed either candidate in the recent deputy leadership contest, with 69% of those who supported Lucy Powell calling for a new leader by the next election while 51% of Bridget Phillipson supporters want Starmer to remain as leader.Emma Burnell, the editor of LabourList, said: “Starmer’s team have made it clear that he would contest a leadership contest were one to arise. Of course, that was a week ago and we all know that’s a long time in politics.“It may well be that if it came to it Starmer would decide a contest in which he ran – and was possibly defeated – was too damaging to the party in the long term.”Should Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, take part in a leadership contest, he would defeat Starmer with the largest margin of any potential challenger – 26 percentage points, the research found. Burnham would need to return to Westminster as a Labour MP in order to be able to challenge for the party leadership.Rayner, the former deputy prime minister, would also defeat Starmer by a 19-point margin, polling 52% compared with 33% for the prime minister. Last weekend, allies of Rayner said she would seek to renew her public profile in the coming months andwould be likely to runin a future leadership contest.Streeting, the health secretary, would edge out Starmer by 33% to 31% but the result is within the margin of error and is effectively a dead heat.Both candidates would also have to win over the 36% of members who said they would be unsure who to back in such a contest. Earlier this month,Streeting denied leading a plotto overthrow the prime minister and called for those briefing against him to be sacked.Miliband, Labour leader from 2010 until his resignation in 2015, would lead Starmer by four points should a leadership contest take place, the poll found.Burnell added: “The two leading contenders to Starmer both face significant challenges. Rayner because it may be that not enough time has passed since she, very unfortunately, had to step down.“Burnham because he faces several hurdles to being able to run. If things move quickly, he may not be able to return to parliament in time to be a candidate. This might give Starmer and his team hope. If there is no obvious candidate that can beat him, he will feel much more secure in place.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsLabourAndy BurnhamEd MilibandAngela RaynerWes StreetingKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

This is part of our wider plans to rebuild Great British Railways the public can be proud of and rely on.”View image in fullscreenTransport secretary Heidi Alexander with a Great British Railways train in Bournemouth in May.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAA typical commuter work three days week in an office, travelling using flexi season tickets, would save £315 a year between Milton Keynes to London or £57 annually from Bradford to Leeds. A traditional full-time commuter to the capital from Canterbury could have seen their annual season ticket rise by more than £400, to £8,929.The announcement was welcomed by public transport advocates, many of whom have long contrasted the fuel duty freeze for motorists since 2010 with the rapid rise in rail fares.Ben Plowden, chief executive of Campaign for BetterTransport, said: “We know that cost is the number one concern for people wanting to travel by train.“This will enable more people to choose rail, reducing traffic on our roads, benefiting the economy, helping the environment. This is a positive sign that affordability for passengers is being given the high priority it deserves.”Aslef, the train drivers’ trade union, said it was “the right decision to help grow our railway”.The outgoing general secretary, Mick Whelan, said: “We are pleased that after 14 years of the Tories pricing people off our railways, this Labour government is helping people to commute to work and travel for pleasure.”The announcement will come as some relief to passengers, and to those dismayed by Labour’s first decision of fares in government. In last year’s budget, accompanying documents revealed thatfares would rise by 1% more than RPI, or 4.6%, in March this year.The preceding two years had seen even higher rises under the Conservative government, of 5.9% and 4.9% – albeit significantly below RPI as inflation soared.Decisions on fares within Scotland and Wales are taken by the devolved governments and are yet to be announced.Explore more on these topicsRail faresConsumer affairsTransportEnglandRail transportBudget 2025Heidi AlexandernewsShareReuse this content"

You can’t incentivise people to get EVs while also floating the idea of pay-per-mile chargers. Prospective buyers feel like they are being green-lit to buy a new car and then immediately met with a stop sign in the form of a pay-per-mile tax.”Under the government’s electric vehicle mandate, carmakers have to make sure one in three cars sold next year are zero-emission, rising to 80% by 2030.At the spending review earlier this year, the chancellor announced a £400m electric car grant scheme to reduce the upfront price of new EVs by up to £3,750.That scheme has so far helped 35,000 drivers buy a new EV, and has proved so popular that it is due to run out in two years’ time.The chancellor will use next week’s budget to top up that fund by an extra £1.3bn and extend eligibility until 2029-2030. She will allocate a further £200m for extra charging points, with many prospective owners listing range anxiety as a key reason not to buy.At the same budget, however, Reeves is also expected to announcea consultation into a new pay-per-mile scheme, which will probably increase the average cost of owning an EV by £276 a year. Such a tax would raise about £375m for the Treasury each year based on the number of EVs now on the road.View image in fullscreenThe chancellor will also review the costs of on-street charging, which attracts 20% VAT, whereas charging at home is taxed at only 5%.Photograph: Xiu Bao/AlamyThe scheme is designed to plug the looming budget gap caused by a collapse in fuel duty as drivers move away from petrol and diesel cars, but experts say it could cause the EV market to stall.Reeves will also announce a review into the costs of on-street charging, amid calls for the government to reduce the 20% rate of VAT which applies only to charging by the roadside.Charging at home, by contrast, is taxed at only 5%, prompting warnings that poorer EV owners without driveways are being penalised. Reeves’s review into on-street charging will not report until next autumn.Reeves is also under pressure from some inside and outside government to increase the level of fuel duty in part as a way to make it more attractive to buy an EV.Rishi Sunakcut the rate of fuel duty by 5pin 2022 when he was chancellor in what was meant to be a temporary measure to deal with high oil prices caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Since then the price of crude oil has fallen by about 40% and yet the rate of fuel duty has remained the same.Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025Rachel ReevesElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsMotoring (Money)Motoring (Technology)Ethical and green livingFuel dutynewsShareReuse this content"

The former prince had a long friendship with Epstein and is alleged to have sexually assaulted one of his victims, Virginia Giuffre – allegations he denies.Starmer’s comments came after Mountbatten-Windsor failed to respond to an interview request from the committee, prompting an angry response from two of its members.Starmer said: “I won’t comment on his particular case. But as a general principle I’ve held for a very long time is that anybody who has got relevant information in relation to these kind of cases should give that evidence to those that need it.”He added that Mountbatten-Windsor’s response would be a “decision for him” but said: “My general position is if you have relevant information you should be prepared to share it.”Former prince Andrew accused of ‘hiding’ from US House’s Epstein inquiryRead moreThe committee is conducting an inquiry into Epstein, who died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. As part of that investigation, members of the committee wrote to Mountbatten-Windsor asking for an interview and giving him a deadline of 20 November to respond.Two Democrats on the committeesaid this weekthe former prince had not responded by the deadline. Robert Garcia, the most senior Democrat on the committee, and his colleague Suhas Subramanyam said in a statement Andrew’s silence “speaks volumes”.“The documents we’ve reviewed, along with public records and Virginia Roberts Giuffre’s testimony, raise serious questions he must answer, yet he continues to hide,” the pair said.“Our work will move forward with or without him, and we will hold anyone who was involved in these crimes accountable, no matter their wealth, status, or political party. We will get justice for the survivors.”Despite their comments, the Democrats are unlikely to be able to compel Mountbatten-Windsor to speak to them without the backing of the Republicans, who chair the committee and are in the majority.The banality of evil: how Epstein’s powerful friends normalised himRead moreJames Comer, the Republican who chairs the committee, has not said whether he would seek to force the former prince to testify, though the subject of Epstein remains highly sensitive for his party, given President Donald Trump’s involvement in it.Earlier this week Trump signed into law the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which will compel the attorney general, Pam Bondi, to release documents related to the government’s handling of his case within 30 days.If Congress did decide to issue a subpoena, Mountbatten-Windsor – who has denied wrongdoing – could avoid the legal penalties for non-compliance by not coming to the US.Explore more on these topicsAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorUS CongressJeffrey EpsteinKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

RedBird Capital, the US group led by Gerry Cardinale, had dropped its own bid in the face of campaigning from the Telegraph’s newsroom for its links to China to be investigated.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyThe culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, has said she will review any buyer.While DMGT has pledged the Daily Telegraph will remain editorially independent from other titles, there is a concern that it represents a consolidation of media organisations on the right that are already emboldened by the scalps of Tim Davie at the BBC in recent weeks, as well as Angela Rayner and Lord Mandelson.While there are few things generations ofLabourleaders are in total agreement on, all have felt they have been on the receiving end of harsh treatment by part of the press.Tom Baldwin, who was director of communications for Ed Miliband when he was leader of the Labour party and was political editor at the Sunday Telegraph, said he was concerned about the effect the merger would have.Baldwin said: “Britain’s media is already tilted dangerously to a homogenous, rightwing, angry point of view. A merger between the Mail and the Telegraph will only exacerbate that.“There are lots of grounds to be concerned about this on reasons of plurality, for competition, but more than anything else this Labour government should consider whether it is good for Britain, and good for its democracy, for the Daily Mail to strengthen its pernicious grip on Britain’s media.”His view was backed up by the former Labour leader Lord Kinnock, who said: “Everyone should be able to recognise that the creation of a rightwing press giant will plainly not improve balance of opinion and presentation.“Indeed, it is likely to diminish competition and diversity in providing information and opinion – the most precious of all commodities.“That would harm discernment and, therefore, democracy. I hope that the competition authority will attach prime significance to that reality.”Baldwin added: “Given the last 16 months, where from day one of this government there’s been a wall of angry, sometimes hyperbolic, often misleading coverage against everything, and that has I think affected the government’s fortunes.“I think there will be pressure from Labour MPs on Lisa Nandy. There are a lot of people who are concerned that the government hasn’t spoken out enough in recent weeks about the BBC, the idea that Labour will just silently nod through a deal to strengthen the Daily Mail’s grip on national discourse, seems really counterintuitive.“From day one of this government, those newspapers were set out to damage and destroy in any way possible. There would never be any intention by the Mail or the Telegraph to treat the government fairly. They do no favours at all to this government, this government shouldn’t do any favours to them.”However, Barber said: “They didn’t try and defend the RedBird bid, they never kind of looked at it in the mirror and said, here’s the Telegraph that hates us. A ruthless politician would have said, that’s fine, we’ll just let RedBird through.“Now for any Labour party member or even minister to be complaining about the consolidation of the right in the media, it just rings rather hollow, doesn’t it, because the government didn’t do anything to stop this.”Explore more on these topicsTelegraph Media GroupNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesLabourDaily TelegraphDaily MailanalysisShareReuse this content"

But today is an important moment of hope,” said Bass.“With more and more projects nearing completion across Pacific Palisades, the City of Los Angeles remains committed to expediting every aspect of the rebuilding process, until every family is back home,” Bass added.The Pacific Palisades home features four bedrooms and 4.5 bathrooms spread across nearly 4,000 sq ft. It replaces a 1,600 sq ft ranch-style home destroyed in January. Across the Palisades and Eaton fire zones, nearly 2,000 rebuilding permits have been issued, according to theLA Times.Scrutiny grows over LA fire origins after bombshell report: ‘Our Pearl Harbor moment’Read moreFire-resistant upgrades include closed eaves to prevent ember entry and pre-installed plumbing for an optional fire-defense system that sprays the home with water and retardant when flames approach.A grand opening for the newly completed home is scheduled for 6 December, when the community will be invited to tour the property.A two-bedroom, 630 sq ft accessory dwelling unit (ADU) in Altadena received its certificate of occupancy on Monday, according toPolitico. The new ADU, commonly used as a guesthouse or rental, replaced a garage destroyed in the Eaton fire. The property’s main residence survived the blaze.Reconstruction timelines differ across neighborhoods and projects. The city’s press release reports that roughly 340 projects are currently under construction in Pacific Palisades.In total, the Palisades and Eaton fires destroyed 13,000 homes. More than 2,500 property owners in Los Angeles county and the city of Los Angeles have filed complete rebuilding applications, and roughly 1,100 permits have been approved, Politico reported.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesCalifornia wildfiresWildfiresCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

I wasn’t sick. I didn’t feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew.”Later in the essay, as she described her ongoing treatments, Schlossberg criticized Kennedy’s policies as health secretary. She expressed strong disapproval of his anti-vaccine positions and his decisions to cut funding for medical research, emphasizing the harm such actions cause to patients like herself.“As I spent more and more of my life under the care of doctors, nurses, and researchers striving to improve the lives of others, I watched as Bobby cut nearlya half billiondollars for research into mRNA vaccines, technology that could be used against certain cancers,” she wrote.She continued that Kennedy “slashed billions in funding from the National Institutes of Health, the world’s largest sponsor of medical research; and threatened to oust the panel of medical experts charged with recommending preventive cancer screenings”.Schlossberg added that doctors at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving medical center, where she was receiving care, were uncertain about their future after the Trump administration withdrew federal funding from the university.“Suddenly, the health-care system on which I relied felt strained, shaky,” Schlossberg wrote. The university later reached an agreement with the Trump administration that reinstated the funding.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jill Imbler isn’t bothering with any of that.The 69-year-old has lived in Moberly – aMissouritown of about 14,000 people – her entire life. She doesn’t use a GPS when she drives around, knows where people live, and what time they’re likely to be home. And there’s a pretty good chance that she,or one of her six siblings, knows them personally.She also knows there’s a pretty good chance they don’t agree with her politically. Imbler is the President of the Randolph county Democrat club, and Randolph county is just about as Republican as you can get. Donald Trump won the county by more than 50 points in the 2016, 2020 and 2024 elections. He also handily carried the state in all three elections.But Imbler nevertheless started collecting signatures to repeal a new congressional map abruptly passed by Missouri Republicansin mid-September. At the request of Donald Trump, Republicans called a special legislative session and carved out the Kansas City congressional district of longtime Democratic representative Emanuel Cleaver, and replaced it with a Republican one.It was part of a nationwide push by Trump to get about half a dozen Republican-controlled states to rejigger maps to find more GOP seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. But Missouri offers something distinct: a chance for voters to rebuke politicians and stop the map from going into effect.A provision added to the Missouri constitution in 1908 allows voters to pause most enacted laws from going into effect and put them up for a referendum if they gather enough signatures. Since 1908, Missouri voters have used the citizens veto process about two dozen times. Innearly every case, voters have chosen to repeal the statute they have been asked to vote on.The Missouri legislature approved the map in mid-September and Governor Mike Kehoe, a Republican, signed it into law at the end of the month. Imbler, her husband Lynn, and canvassers across Missouri have until 11 December to turn in more than 106,000 signatures that must come from six of the state’s eight congressional districts. If they can, the new map will be on hold until voters decide whether to adopt it in a 2026 referendum. Canvassers say they have already collected more than 200,000signatures and say they plan to turn in more. “We turn in signatures, the map goes on hold,” said Richard Von Glahn, the executive director of People not Politicians, the group leading the signature gathering effort.The Missouri effort is being closely watched amid an all out mid-decade redistricting war between Democrats and Republicans that will shape which party controls the US House of Representatives. Republicans currently have a razor-thin three seat majority, but have redrawn congressional districts in Missouri, Texas and North Carolina to add as many as seven seats. (The Texas mapwas recently struck downby a three-judge panel, but the US supreme court temporarily halted the ruling on Friday while an appeal is pending.) Democrats are poised to counter those gains with their own redrawn maps in California and Virginia.Recognizing the huge consequences of the Missouri effort, outside groups have poured money into the campaign. Committees on both sides have raised about$7m, which includes funds from national Republicans opposing the effort.Imbler, a retired teacher’s aide, ran for a few local offices in the 90s, and said she was outraged when she saw Missouri lawmakers move to weaken ballot referendums approved by Missouri voters last year that protected abortion and raised the minimum wage.“I realized, ‘wait a minute, we don’t have the final say,’” she said over a cup of coffee at the Bean, a coffee shop just a few blocks from the old train depot at the center of town. “It pissed me off – I realized this is not right.“When we first took this on, there were several comments made about ‘oh my gosh,’ you’re actually going to go door to door here in Moberly,” she said. “I said, ‘Yeah I’m going to. If the door shuts in my face, it shuts in my face.”But on a warm fall afternoon earlier this month, doors weren’t closing in front of Imbler at all.As Imbler popped door to door at an apartment complex for retirees, she barely had to mention gerrymandering before people would say they were willing to sign. “Have you heard about the gerrymandering, where they’re redistricting all the congressional districts,” she would begin. “They changed all of our congressional districts to try to push the power so Republicans can have most of the seats. They’re trying to get Emanuel Cleaver out,” she said.“Normally we do that at the end of the decade after a census, and Governor Kehoe decided – he hasn’t given us any reason – for why he decided to do it in the middle of the decade,” she added. Nearly everyone she spoke with over the course of an hour decided to sign.“I feel that way because I think they’re manipulating to stack their votes up in one spot,” said one of the voters who signed the petition.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A few weeks ago, she said she had been in Cairo, a tiny town just outside of Moberly, to track down a man who had wanted to sign. She left her phone number with him and told him to pass it along to anyone else who might be interested. By the time she got home, she had gotten nine more signatures on the gerrymandering petition.“People know me. I mean, if I don’t know you personally, I either taught your kid, or I went to school with your brother, or I rode the bus with your sister, or worked with you,” she said. “When people see that this is an issue that I’m willing to get out and ask for signatures for, they understand I’m not a radical either way.Her tour also included a stop at a local motorcycle shop in town in late October during a toy drive. Imbler went to school with the two men who now run the shop and they agreed to let her set up a table in their showroom. She and Lynn set up a table in between a Trump 2024 sign and a rebel flag. “[They] were willing to sign and willing to agree that this isn’t about Democrat or Republican, this is about the vote of the people,” she said. By the end of the day they collected 56 signatures.Recognizing the likelihood of the new map being blocked, Republicans have launched an all-out effort to halt the referendum. Missouri secretary of state Denny Hoskins, a Republican, is trying to getmore than 90,000 signaturesthrown out. A group funded by the Republican National Committee recently sent out a text message encouraging people towithdraw their signatureson the petitions.The Missouri attorney general has also filed aseparate lawsuitbased on a fringe legal theory arguing that the state legislature has the exclusive power to draw congressional districts, so it cannot be overturned through a citizens veto. A shadowy group has offered canvassers $5,000 to stop collecting signatures, the Kansas City Starreported.“This isn’t an easy undertaking. It’s not just something you do because maybe you’re a little upset,” Von Glahn said. “It’s really reserved for major infractions of the legislature.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

For all her talk, she’s STILL voting with them to gut healthcare … ”Greene voted in the summer for cuts to Medicaid and the reduction of enhanced tax credits for the Affordable Care Act, but then in October criticized the ACA cuts as premiums soared.Ocasio-Cortez also repeated some of her criticism of shares bought by Greene earlier this year before Trump said he was pausing tariffs. Greene hasdeniedany impropriety in her stock trading.Kentucky Republican congressman Thomas Massie, who has also taken public stands against Trump including over the Epstein files release,saidon X that he was “very sad for our country but so happy for my friend Marjorie. I’ll miss her tremendously.”Massie added that Greene “embodies what a true Representative should be. Everyone should read her statement; there’s more honesty expressed in these four pages than most politicians will speak in a lifetime.”Early on Saturday, Trump also reacted to Greene’s announcement,posting on Truth Socialthat “Marjorie ‘Traitor’ Brown” had decided to call it “quits” because of “PLUMMETING Poll Numbers, and not wanting to face a Primary Challenger with a strong Trump Endorsement (where she would have no chance of winning!) … ”Trump also said that Greene’s political relationship with Massie “did not help her”.“For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went BAD,” he added. “Nevertheless, I will always appreciate Marjorie, and thank her for her service to our Country!”But Trump latertold NBC Newshe would like to see Greene resume her political career.“It’s not going to be easy for her” to revive her career in politics, he said, adding: “I’d love to see that.” In the meantime, “she’s got to take a little rest”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hogg and other Parkland survivors used the video as evidence to call for Greene’s resignation when she was appointed to the House Republican committee in 2021.Barbara Comstock, a former Republican House member and a Trump critic, lauded Greene’s decision on social media. “She doesn’t want to be a Republican ‘battered wife’ taking Trump’s abuse and getting death threats and pretending it’s all ok only to end up in the minority. Good for her,” Comstockposted.Greene’s decision to leave Congress came soon after another plot twist was playing out in the White House between Trump and New York City’s mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, who spoke of their shared commitment to the future of the nation’s most populous city.Trump, who had in the past called Mamdani a “100% Communist Lunatic” and a “total nut job”, spoke of how impressed he was with the man who had called his administration “authoritarian” and said he anticipates a productive relationship.“I expect to be helping him, not hurting him,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office after a private meeting on Friday afternoon that lasted under an hour. “Because I want New York City to be great.”Mamdani said that he appreciated that during their meeting they “had focused not on places of disagreement, which there are many, and also focused on the shared purpose that we have in serving New Yorkers”.Both said they had shared ideas about affordability and developing new housing in the city. “Some of his ideas are really the same ideas that I have,” the president said of Mamdani about inflationary issues.Explore more on these topicsMarjorie Taylor GreeneAlexandria Ocasio-CortezDonald TrumpRepublicansDemocratsHouse of RepresentativesUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

Carr has resuscitated several complaints that were filed by Suhr and dismissed at the end of Joe Biden’s administration and has seemingly factored in Suhr’s suggestions when reviewing media mergers.One of those complaints, in October 2024, dealt with the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with then vice-president Kamala Harris. It preceded by about two weeks a$10bn lawsuitby Trump against CBS that made similar claims and upended the political-media world for the next nine months. Suhr’s complaint led to CBS’s unprecedented decision to release the full, unedited transcript and video library from the Harris interview under pressure from Carr. And when Carr’s FCC ultimately approved Paramount’s long-delayed merger with Skydance Media in July, it includedconditions that Suhr had asked for: the appointment of an ombudsman to handle complaints of bias at CBS News andthe elimination of all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.‘Unforgivable’: Trump’s ‘piggy’ insult is stoking more outrage than usualRead more“I think the commission did a great job in the final order,” Suhr said in a recent sit-down with the Guardian. “The commission’s ordersaid that Paramount committed to news that was ‘fair, unbiased, and fact-based.’ I think those are great words. I would love to see all of our news be fair, unbiased and fact-based. I think that articulation of the standard is in many ways the fruition of what started with the one complaint.”It’s all a bit of a whirlwind for Suhr, who filed his first media complaint in September 2024. Critics of the way that Carr has used the commission’s limited regulatory oversight over the content of television networks to exert pressure have some questions – and some concerns – about how Suhr suddenly became such a key player in the administration’s regulatory apparatus, even as they say he’s very pleasant to deal with.“When you talk to him, he seems like a very reasonable, very articulate, smart guy,” said Gigi Sohn, a longtime consumer advocate who was nominated by former president Joe Biden to serve on the FCC but did not ultimately do so. “It’s just kind of curious that this person has come out of nowhere and is so active and is so tied with the chair. I think it raises questions that should be answered.”One of those questions is whether Suhr is taking his cues directly from Carr, who shares his belief that the mainstream media is biased in favor of Democrats.Over coffee recently in Washington DC, where Suhr had traveled to attend a dinner hosted by the conservative Federalist Society, he sought to explain how exactly his organization became a central actor in the conservative case against alleged bias in the media – and how he became what Sohn called “a cog in the Carr wheel”, though Suhr sees it differently.While Suhr said he’s a “big fan” of Carr, he pushed back on the notion that he works hand-in-glove with him. “I don’t run my complaints by [Carr] ahead of time,” he said. “I don’t run my complaints by his staff ahead of time.”Still, it’s undeniable that Suhr “has the ear of FCC Chairman Brendan Carr on a number of policy issues,” as former telecommunications association executiveTed Hearn wrote last week, noting that he had endorsed the $34.5bn merger between Charter Communications and Cox Communications.Suhr said he has only met Carr once – though he did not disclose that his one meeting had occurred just hours before meeting with the Guardian for an interview. Carrposted a photo of the two of them on X, writing that Suhr is “doing fantastic work advancing the public interest in media policy”. (Carr did not respond to a text message seeking further comment about Suhr.)Great to visit with@danielsuhrat the FCC today.He’s doing fantastic work advancing the public interest in media policy.pic.twitter.com/Vkp9C9I22E— Brendan Carr (@BrendanCarrFCC)November 6, 2025Asked about it later, Suhr explained the visit as just a “get-to-know-you” session – they didn’t talk about pending cases, which means there won’t be an official notice of their meeting – just a photo that Carr posted on X.In late September 2024,Suhr filed a complaint against ABCover its handling of the presidential debate it hosted between Trump and Harris. There was alsoa complaint against NBCover a pre-election appearance by Harris on Saturday Night Live,which Suhr argued was a violation of the equal time rule.Both complaints were closed at the end of Biden’s term by then-FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel and then reopened by Carr – though the chair chose not to bring back a petition to deny a local Fox station a license because of the Fox News Channel’s coverage of the 2020 election.“The dismissals by the FCC were so obviously correct under established precedent that I became a little curious about who would be dumb enough to file these things,” said Robert Corn-Revere, a first amendment litigator for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, when asked how he first became aware of Suhr. “There is no reason whatsoever for these proceedings to still be open and there was never a basis for them to be open in the first place.” (“[Corn-Revere] is entitled to his opinion,” Suhr responded. “I think our results speak for themselves.”)When ABC indefinitely suspended late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel’s show on 17 September Suhr was all over that as well. Earlier that day,he had filed a complaintto the FCC seeking consequences for ABC unless Kimmel’s show was taken off the air. That followed another complaintabout two weeks earlieraccusing Kimmel of using his show to benefit Democrats.Critics wonder whether Carr is keeping the complaints open to serve as a potential pressure point for networks – like NBC owner Comcast – that might need the FCC’s blessing for future transactions.Despite their issues with Suhr’s filings, which often allege violations of the FCC’s poorly defined “news distortion” standard, both Sohn and Corn-Revere acknowledged that there is nothing unusual about an outside organization filing motions that are aligned with an FCC chair’s priorities. But, Corn-Revere said, “I’ve just never seen it to be this sort of open and obvious as is going on now.”While he’s relatively new to taking on the media, Suhr is no stranger to politics. After graduating with a law degree in 2008, Suhr spent several years managing the Federalist Society’s law school chapters before joining the administration of Scott Walker, the Republican former Wisconsin governor . He then became a public interest lawyer, working for an organization called the Liberty Justice Center before forming the Center for American Rights with his partner Patrick Hughes. It was Hughes, who leads CAR’s board, who first suggested that Suhr should look into ways to combat what he saw as mainstream media misinformation after watching the ABC News-hosted presidential debate in September.“It was an unfair debate – the moderators were clearly in favor of the Democrats – and it made me think: ‘How can this be?’” Hughes recalled. “And so I said to Daniel: ‘We’ve got to do something about this. What are the standards under which the FCC regulates this?’ Because it can’t be right.”Hughes said he’s been pleased with the impact that Suhr has been able to have. “He’s brilliant,” he said. “He’s a terrific person and a fabulous lawyer and he’s doing a great job.”Sohn agreed that Suhr has “obviously been very successful” in his efforts.Suhr’s complaint againstCBSis still open, even though the relief sought – forcing the network to release the 60 Minutes transcript – was already granted months ago. When asked recently why the FCC has not acted on complaints, Carr said they are still being investigated.Either way, Suhr is feeling better about CBS News these days, particularly after the selection of Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief and the appointment of a prominent Washington conservative, Kenneth R Weinstein, as ombudsman.“We appreciate the change that is happening. We applaud it. We’re going to continue to be vigilant for consumers, but so far I’ve been thrilled,” Suhr said. “We just want journalists to be better journalists.”Explore more on these topicsMediaJimmy KimmelCBSUS politicsDonald TrumpUS television industryTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a high-risk move, Lutnick and Greer have been invited to lunch with 27 trade ministers who are gathering for a summit on Monday.One insider said: “We need to keep it focused, what we don’t want is individual countries going up to them and demanding deals on this, this and that.”Brussels struck a deal withDonald Trumpat his golf course in Scotland in July to avert his threat of 50% tariffs, instead agreeing a baseline 15% levy on most EU imports into the US.Now Washington officials have made it clear they are frustrated with the EU’s slow pace of implementation on that deal, which is not legally binding and needs to be passed by parliament, a process that could take until February.Among the significant outstanding problems expected to be discussed at Monday’s talks are the continuing50% tariffs on steel and aluminium, separatetariffs on products with steel elements, and food and drink levies.Several member states want to see the removal of the 15% tax on wine and spirits including France, which has been hit by duties on Cognac, Ireland on whiskey and all the wine-producing countries.Before a dinner on Monday night Lutnick and Greer will hold talks with the EU’s trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, its defence commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, and the commissioner responsible for technology, Henna Virkkunen, to discuss the continuing crisis involving chip supply from China.They will also meet industry bosses at a business round table expected to included the heads of Volkswagen and the French company TotalEnergies, said insiders.Persuading the US that the steel derivatives go entirely against spirit of the deal struck in July was a “top priority” said one EU insider.In September, the US listed 407 products that included an element of steel, ranging from knitting needles to wind turbines and washing machines, that would face separate tariffs.And now, as part ofa rolling programmeto protect its industries,it is looking at adding a further 700 productsincluding tin cans and bicycles.Companies such as theGerman agriculture machinery firm Krone, have said the “hidden” tariffs are alarming and causing a nightmare for exporters with US customs officials charging 200% in tariffs to anyone who has failed to complete a mountain of paperwork citing the origin of all steel from the “suppliers” and the “supplier to the supplier to the supplier”.The EU and US will also discuss the prospect of working in alignment to “ringfence” their domestic steel industries to protect against cheaper Chinese imports.Brussels hopes thatsteel anti-dumping proposals announced in October,which match Trump’s steel tariffs, will persuade the US president to slash the 50% tariffs on EU steel.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeEuropean UnionUS foreign policyTrump tariffsDonald TrumpEuropeTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

The French company itself has tumbled several times in the past two decades and always bounced back, but never quite as spectacularly as when, earlier this month, it asked the public for money.An appeal for €5m (£4.4m) of emergency funding to secure the immediate future of the glassworks took just five hours and 40 minutes to reach its target. Within 48 hours, the total amount pledged had topped €19m.François Marciano, 59, the director general of Duralex, said the response had astonished everyone at the company. “We thought it would take five or six weeks to raise the €5m. When it reached nearly €20m we had to say stop. Enough,” he said.View image in fullscreenFrançois Marciano, chief executive of Duralex, holds up a Picardie glass.Photograph: Magali Delporte/The GuardianAs a staff cooperative, €5m is the maximum Duralex can accept in public investment under financial rules.Beloved French brandMention Duralex to any French person and they will be transported back to childhood and a school canteen. The brand evokes a mix of nostalgia and pride and is a symbol of French patriotism and industrialsavoir faire.“We’re likeProust’s madeleines,” Marciano said. “The French people want to save us. They are fed up with factories closing and the country’s industries declining.”At the Duralex factory on an industrial estate in La Chapelle-Saint-Mesmin on the banks of the Loire just outside Orléans, Marciano says he and his colleagues are “floating on a cloud” after the appeal.Eighteen months ago, Marciano oversaw a staff buyout of the company, which had been placed in receivership for the fourth time in 20 years. Today, 180 of the 243 employees are “associates” in the company.View image in fullscreenSuliman El Moussaoui, the leader of the CFDT union at Duralex.Photograph: Magali Delporte/The GuardianSuliman El Moussaoui, 44, a union representative at the factory where he has worked for 18 years, said the appeal had prompted “a tsunami of orders, so many that we’re struggling to keep up. Every time the company is mentioned on the television or radio we have more orders. It’s been amazing.”Inside the factory, a simple but magical alchemy takes place. A mix of sand, soda ash and limestone, the exact proportions of which are a closely guarded secret, is heated in a vast overhead oven to 1,400C. Glowing globs of molten glass drop into iron casts that are blasted with a flame of gas. The red-hot glass is instantly pounded into shape, sprung from the mould, snatched by metal pincers and placed on a conveyor belt.View image in fullscreenThe iconic Picardie glasses coming out of the 1,440-degree ovenPhotograph: Magali Delporte/The GuardianDuralex production videoThe process has changed little since Duralex – which is said to take its name from the Latin expressionDura lex, sed lex, meaning “the law is harsh, but it is the law” – opened in 1945. When the Guardian visited, the production line was turning out small clear glasses in the Provence range.View image in fullscreenWorkers in the factory starting a new production of glasses.Photograph: Magali Delporte/The GuardianView image in fullscreenEach glass is carefully inspected.Photograph: Magali Delporte/The GuardianA worker brandishing tongs lifted a glass to the light to inspect it for faults. During a production run, more than a dozen samples of whatever is being made – glasses, plates, bowls – will be randomly removed and subjected to stress tests. In the quality control room, they will be heated to 150C then plunged into cold water to see if they resist a thermic shock, and dropped from the height of a kitchen counter on to a metal sheet to see if they shatter. They will be tested for stackability and then weighed and the glass thickness measured. If they pass, they are thrown in a bin and the production line is given a thumbs up. If they fail, everything stops and the machines are recalibrated.‘The ultimate drinking vessel’It is not known who invented the company’s trademark Picardie glass, the tumbler used in school canteens with a thick curved rim and semi-fluted shape that first appeared in 1954. The British design guruPatrick Taylor has rankedthe Picardie alongside Levi’s jeans and the Swiss Army knife as an icon of modern design. Taylor describes it as: “An object whose form gives the impression it was discovered rather than designed. It is the ultimate drinking vessel created by man, and of its type cannot be improved.”View image in fullscreenThe instantly recognisable Picardie glasses.Photograph: Magali Delporte/The GuardianDuralex says its glass is microwave, freezer and dishwasher-safe and will not turn cloudy or lose its colour, which is in the glass rather than on it. When they do break, Duralex glasses shatter into small pieces rather than shards, reducing the injury risk.Joël Cardon, 59, who has worked at the factory for 35 years, said the soaring cost of gas and electricity were the firm’s largest and most worrying expense.On his screen, the oven containing the liquid glass showed a temperature of 1,440C. It can never be allowed to cool or the glass will solidify. Another screen showed the factory was using 360 cubic metres of gas an hour. According to the regulator Ofgem, the average UK house uses 97.3 cubic metres of gas a year.View image in fullscreenDuralex’s oven, in the background, is held at a temperature of 1,440C.Photograph: Magali Delporte/The GuardianLast weekend, potential investors were asked to come good on their promises on a first come, first served basis. They will be issued with securities that pay 8% interest over seven years but give no company voting rights. The maximum investment was set at €1,000.“We want to involve as many people as possible but with almost €20m in pledges obviously some people will be disappointed,” Marciano said.Since the company became a staff cooperative, turnover has increased by 22% and Marciano said he hoped Duralex would be breaking even by 2027.The €5m raised will be used to modernise the factory and develop new products. These include a partnership with the Élysée presidential palace shop to sell a set of three of its Gigogne glasses in red, white and blue, marked RF for République Française.Set of 3 Gigogne glasses in Tricolor, advertised online for €24.90Photograph: boutique.elysee.frDuralex plans to commission moulds to make “pint” glasses with a measure line for British pubs and bars and the US, both regions identified by the company as untapped markets.“Selling abroad is more difficult because there isn’t the same nostalgia for Duralex as there is inFrance,” said Vincent Vallin, the head of strategy and development. “Interest in the company is high and this is positive, but now we have to focus on increasing sales.”Explore more on these topicsFranceManufacturing sectorEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Elaine Welteroth, then the editor-in-chief,told NPRthat the day it published, Teen Vogue sold “in that month, more copies of the magazine than we had that entire year”. It was a transformative moment for the publication: proof that a magazine long associated with Disney child stars and headlines like “Prom Fever!” could shine light on the political dimensions of young people’s lives.Over the following years, Teen Vogue deepened its coverage of politics and identity, becoming an unlikely hearth for progressive, even radical, feminism within the manicured offices of its publisherCondé Nast.Now, nearly a decade since that “Gaslighting America” story, Trump is once again in the White House and Teen Vogue as it was once known is gone.View image in fullscreenElaine Welteroth helmed Teen Vogue through a politically turbulent time.Photograph: Monica Schipper/The Hollywood Reporter via Getty ImagesEarlier this month, a Vogue Business article announced that Condé Nast was folding Teen Vogue into its flagship property, Vogue, to “provide a more unified reader experience across titles”. Although the article promised that Teen Vogue would “keep its unique editorial identity and mission”, it also said the outlet would now focus on “career development” and “cultural leadership” while its editor-in-chief would be stepping down. Condé Nast also laid off six unionized Teen Vogue employees, including its politics editor. Most of the laid-off employees were “BIPOC women or trans”,according to the Condé Nast union.After Condé staffers questioned the head of HR over the layoffs,the company fired four of them, prompting pushback from the union and a pledge from New York’s attorney general, Letitia James: “Condé Nast, I’ll see you in court.”How Anna Wintour’s Vogue front covers made a statement to the endRead moreA Condé Nast spokesperson told the Guardian that changes to Teen Vogue were driven solely by business concerns, not by politics, and added: “The employment terminations were lawful and based on clear violations of company policies.”Teen Vogue’s unraveling comes at a time of intensifying turbulence for journalism, particularly of the progressive variety. Many of the blogs that once studded the feminist media universe and made “gaslighting” a mainstream term – Jezebel, Feministing, the Hairpin, the Toast – now lay dead or dying. Several of their staid older sisters, the women’s magazines, have started publishing fewer print issues a year or going digital-only. Youth-oriented websites once believed to be the future of media, like Vice and Vox, have shed jobs at astonishing rates. (Note: I worked at Vice for years before quitting in 2023, after the company laid off wide swathes of the newsroom and filed for bankruptcy.)These outlets frequently focused on the people whose lives have fallen under the glare of the Trump administration’s microscope:women, people of color, LGBTQ+ folks, anybody to the left of Ben Shapiro. Taken together, their downfall can feel like an industry-wide retreat from covering long-marginalized voices.“People change their policies based on reading the vibe in the room, if you will,” said Christina Bellantoni, director of Annenberg’s Media Center at the University of Southern California. (Bellantoni is friends with Teen Vogue’s outgoing editor-in-chief.) “We’ve got three more years of this administration making clear its priorities do not lay with having newsrooms that are reflective of the diverse world we cover.”View image in fullscreenThe Teen Vogue Summit in Los Angeles on 2 December 2017.Photograph: Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for Teen VogueThe dismal economics of trying to make money off the internet have decimated outlets of all political stripes. Between 2008 and 2024,74% of newsroom jobs vanished. Condé is a part of that trend, having endured multiple rounds of layoffs over the last several years.But it’s a unique set of pressures that have been responsible for crushing feminist publications. During the reign of the 2010s #girlboss, the feminist blogosphere generated takes on everything from Christmas songs to Edward Snowden’s girlfriend. Women’s magazines took note and started publishing uncomplicated odes to “the notorious RBG” and the Wing, a now-shuttered women-focused club and co-working space.That type of coverage evaporated after the 2016 election, which saw most white women vote for Trump instead of voting for Hillary Clinton to shatter “the highest and hardest glass ceiling.” During that same time, social media algorithms became increasingly opaque, sending feminist media’s online traffic plummeting at the same moment that Trump’s policies started tothreaten long-held feminist victories.Now, under Trump 2.0,all journalism is more fraught, particularly for women. Earlier this month, Trumptold a female journalist: “Quiet, piggy.”“These glossy magazines are generally wary of political coverage, because they say advertisers don’t want to sponsor it,” said Amy Odell, an independent journalist who runs the fashion news Substack Back Row and closely covers Vogue.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Palm Beach, Florida, on 14 November 2025.Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images“This cuts deep with women’s publications because they probably get that feedback more than men’s publications do. With women’s publications, it’s like: ‘Just do lip liner tutorials and we’ll sell those to beauty advertisers’.”Condé outlets like Wired, the New Yorker and Vanity Fair have continued to cover politics; Glamour, a Condé women’s magazine, also sometimes covers it. But some ex-employees have said that they felt company brass undermined Teen Vogue’s political coverage. Alma Avalle, a Bon Appetit journalist fired after the confrontation with Condé leadership,told the New York City local news outlet Hell Gatethat she had heard that “an executive said something to the effect of: ‘The company is trying to avoid the attention of the Trump administration, and trying to avoid the attention and the scrutiny of the right.’”Allegra Kirkland, Teen Vogue’s former politics director,wrote in Talking Points Memothat ahead of Trump’s second inauguration, she was told that Anna Wintour – Condé’s global chief content officer and artistic director – didn’t want to hear the word “politics” during Teen Vogue’s annual strategy meeting.In response to questions for this story, a Condé spokesperson said in an email: “Teen Vogue has faced ongoing challenges around scale and audience reach for some time. Rather than continuing to operate independently, bringing Teen Vogue under the Vogue umbrella allows it to tap into a larger audience, stronger distribution and more resources.”They added: “This was a business decision, not a political one.”Some staff from folded feminist publications have gone independent, writing for platforms like Substack. But many of the most popular outlets covering the intersection of politics, identity and women are now on the right.As feminist and progressive outlets have receded, aconservative “womanosphere” has blossomed, peopled by podcasts like Culture Apothecary, a Turning Point USA production hosted by Maga influencer Alex Clark, and the wannabe “conservative Cosmo” magazine Evie, which recently puttradwife royalty Hannah Neelemanon the cover. The denizens of the womanosphere tend to thread their talk of style, wellness and beauty with antifeminist rhetoric and support for traditional gender roles.View image in fullscreenDaniel and Hannah Neeleman at the Time100 Creators launch party in New York on 10 July 2025.Photograph: Craig Barritt/Getty Images for TIMEOne recent Evie email blast, entitled “5 Ways Single Girls Are Repelling Good-Hearted Masculine Men”, advised: “An empowered woman who is overflowing with joy about her career, and knows that it won’t ever be as important as being a wife and mother, does not need to turn a date into a staff meeting where she is respected for her ideas.”Shara Crookston, an associate professor of women’s and gender studies at the University of Toledo who has studied Teen Vogue, said that the rise of the womanosphere is easily explained: “I read that as a backlash to feminist progress.”Crookston fears that it is young people, Teen Vogue’s core audience, who seem set to pay the highest price for these changes in media. Not only are they the inheritors of whatever the Trump administration leaves behind, but they are increasingly and uniquely restricted by the harshest of rightwing policies, such as bans on gender-affirming care, access to internet porn and interstate travel for abortions.“I worry that young girls are going to have less options for media content that helps them explore different aspects of their life, and I think that could be pretty damaging,” she continued. “What if you are a teenage girl who knows that you don’t want to get married and have kids and all that you’re seeing is: ‘This is why this is important to be straight, to get married, to have kids’? What options are going to be available to her?”Over the last three years, I interviewedmore than 100 Americans under 30about their sexual and romantic lives, their political leanings and the forces that shaped both. While influencers may make up the bulk of young people’s media diet, my interviewees often relied on – and longed for – information from factchecked publications.View image in fullscreenThe Teen Vogue Summit in Los Angeles on 12 November 2022.Photograph: Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for Teen VoguePaxton Smith, a 20-year-old Texan, was once riveted by a Snapchat story from Cosmopolitan that had emphasized that women have the right to choose how to style their body hair. Smith had never realized she had a choice; she just wanted to do what she thought boys wanted.“That was a crazy thing for me to see,” she recalled. “No one had ever framed a woman’s body – especially in a sexual way – as being [able to be] whatever floated their boat. It didn’t have anything to do with what anybody else thought.”From that Cosmo story, Smith said she learned that “what’s sexy is what’s sexy to you and you should prioritize you”. It was part of her political awakening. Years later,Smith went viralfor giving a speech at her Dallas area high school about the importance of abortion rights.Lex McMenamin, a Teen Vogue staffer who was laid off when the outlet was folded into Vogue, said they thought about the future of young people “every day, on weekends, at night, for years”.“Feminist media is not dead,” McMenamin said. “Young people are so smart. I lack the nihilism that people have about young people and learning and self-development, including for marginalized people. There’s more trans people and more queer people every day, even though they’re doing their damnedest to make us want to die. It doesn’t matter. Our readers will always exist.”This story was updated on 20 November 2025 to add a post-publication statement from Condé Nast on staff terminations.Explore more on these topicsVogueMagazinesYoung peopleWomenFeminismCondé NastAnna WintourfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Indeed, he had been so cool in advance that he took in spot of shut-eye before it began and then weathered the hazardous conditions with insouciance.The Disneyfication of F1: Goofy in the pitlane and Fantasia in Vegas underline sport’s US transformationRead more“To be honest, I was having a quick nap before qualifying and I was expecting it to be dry but I woke up and saw that it was raining,” he said. “I thought: ‘Oh crap, this isn’t going to go well.’”Yet he had its measure, although his pleasure at mastering a “nasty” surface in cool temperatures and with a intimidating volume of water thrown in stood in stark contrast to the frustration ofLewis Hamiltonand Ferrari, for whom it seems the season’s end cannot come soon enough.Hamilton finished plum last in 20th, the first time he has been at the back of the grid on pace alone in his 19-season career. He struggled to make the tyres work in Q1 and was unlucky with a late yellow flag. “[The full-wet tyre] was as bad as it gets,” Hamilton said. “I couldn’t see anything. I think I hit the wall out at one point.”View image in fullscreenMcLaren’s Lando Norris’s pole position gives him a great chance of extending his lead in the title race over his teammate Oscar Piastri, at present 24 points.Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Formula 1/Getty ImagesHaving shown pace in the final practice session, Hamilton, who had been told by theFerrarichair, John Elkann, to “talk less and focus more on his driving”, was disappointed once more in a trying first season with Ferrari. “Today was amazing. I just didn’t get a lap at the end,” he added. “I felt like we were quickest and then you come out of qualifying 20th. This year is definitely the hardest year.”Ferrari have had problems with switching tyres on in the wet all season but while Hamilton’s teammate Charles Leclerc did fare better, finishing in ninth, he was equally angry with the his car. “My God, embarrassing, fucking embarrassing, fucking hell,” he told the team on his in-lap. “I don’t get how we can be so off the pace, there’s like zero grip, zero fucking grip.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterOur picture editors select their favourite sporting images from the past week, from the spectacular to the powerful, and with a little bit of fun thrown inEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The British record signing, Alexander Isak, was again anonymous and Liverpool argued Murillo’s opener should have been ruled out for similar reasons to Virgil van Dijk’s disallowed effort against Manchester City before the international break. But Slot admitted the buck stopped with him and made no excuses.Liverpool in disarray as Nottingham Forest storm Anfield again with 3-0 winRead more“No one wants to hear me now talking about refereeing decisions if you lose 3-0 at home to Forest,” said the Liverpool head coach. “I should look at myself first and my team, but it does show you how a goal can change the momentum of a game. Before I was just waiting for us to score a goal. Afterwards we hardly created anything.“Of course there is a way out, especially with the quality players we have. No matter if you win or lose when you look back you are always thinking: ‘Where can we do better, where can we adjust?’ but that is something else from doubting yourself.“I want to emphasise I am responsible for the current losses. You are responsible when you are winning but also responsible when you are losing. I can never come up with enough excuses for us to have the results we have. That is far from good enough and I am responsible for that.”Liverpool’s performance unravelled as Slot made several attacking substitutions when chasing the game. “It was the same away at Forest last season,” he said. “I took Ibou [Ibrahima Konaté] off and put on [Diogo] Jota and he scored straight away to make it 1-1.

In part this is because the pictures from Donald Trump’sstate dinner with Mohammed bin Salmanand his in-house hype men Cristiano Ronaldo and Gianni Infantino were everywhere, recycled feverishly across the internet, dusted with their own drool-stained commentary by the wider Ronaldo-verse.Mainly there were just so many jaw-droppers. Perhaps you liked the one of Trump and Ronaldo strolling the halls of power, Ronaldo dressed all in black and laughing uproariously, like a really happy ninja. Or the one of Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez standing either side of a weirdly beaming Trump at his desk, holding up some kind of large heraldic key as though they’ve just been presented with their own wind-up wooden sex-grandad.David Squires on … Fifa’s peace prize and Donald Trump’s eligibilityRead morePerhaps you preferred footage of the dinner itself where even the air in the room looks thick and smudged and strange, the kind of room where you look down and notice the chair you’re sitting on is made out of human fingernails. There was the bit where Trump is giving a speech about all the “unbelievable dignitaries”, impresario-style, like he’s cutting the ribbon on a shopping mall in Boca Raton. As you look closer it becomes clear his hair has now decisively evolved from its previous form as a kind of flat orange hat and has gone full 1980s newsreader bouffant, so thick with spray and chemicals it’s closer to a kind of gauze, hair you could stick your hand in and then never get it out, like flypaper.Maybe it’s the simple game of trying to work out what might have been on the menu given Ronaldo dines off swordfish, lettuce and a gallon of mineral water, whereas an average Trump dinner is two Filets-O-Fish covered in ketchup, 12 cans of Diet Coke and a wheelbarrow full of biscuits.My favourite bits are where Infantino keeps wandering into shot. There he is again, gurning at the back of Ronaldo’s post-dinner power-selfie, looking as ever like a vampire who does card tricks, but also seeming, at this ultimate level of weirdness, to be showing some slight sense of impostor syndrome.Albeit, in Infantino’s case this is not a syndrome. He is an actual impostor, out there pretending to be a disinterested administrator. And he is correct to feel this way, in so much as essence of human vanity compacted into a dinner jacket and taught to say the phrase “Today I feel like a hazelnut” can feel anything.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump meets Cristiano Ronaldo in the Oval Office. Gianni Infantino almost certainly just out of shot.Photograph: Daniel Torok/White HouseIt is worth being totally clear on what was happening here. This was, first of all, a state visit and a significant refresh of US-Saudi relations. But it was also a kind of executive benediction. First for Ronaldo, who hadn’t been photographed in the US since the leaking in 2017 of allegations of sexual assault, which he denies and have never been proven.Not being in the US has cost the Ronaldo brand millions. A final pension-pot World Cup is looming. With Trump in the White House and MBS at his back, it seems this is now a safe space. The quid pro quo is obvious. CR7 is huge among young men on the internet. He’s the most winningest World Cup mascot. He’s a tall handsome guy. This is where we are, why Trump is up at his dais saying the word “Roonnnallldoo” in those sensuous cooing tones, like he’s whispering into the ear of his favourite doughnut.The second returnee is MBS, overlord of the next World Cup-but-two. The crown prince was on his first visit to the US since being accused by its intelligence service of complicity inthe murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Herehe was casually exonerated by Trump(“He knew nothing about it”) in an aside to journalists.How do you get hold of one of these off-the-cuff pardons? By sheer coincidence, on Wednesday night Trump also got to announce that Saudi Arabia is investing $1tn in the US. But whatever the lines of cause and effect, here was a man previously accused of complicity in murder and a man previously accused of sexual assault being welcomed back by the most indicted president in US history. All of them talking about the power of love and peace. All of it glossed and legitimised by the presence at the table of football.And so here we have it, the ultimate in grotesque sporting spectacles. For Ronaldo, this represents a convincing nadir, confirmation of the moral emptiness of his entire schlocky persona. But Ronaldo is also a private individual who can come and go as he pleases. Football, Fifa, the World Cup. These things belong to us and they really shouldn’t be in this room.View image in fullscreenCristiano Ronaldo takes a selfie with Georgina Rodríguez (front left), Elon Musk (left) and Gianni Infantino (second left).Photograph: DavidSacks/X/ReutersThere is a sense of outrage fatigue about all this. Infantino is doing something awful again? No way dude. Maybe humans just prefer evil stuff on some level. It’s more cinematic. Like Satan in Paradise Lost, the world’s first unintended rock star, out there throwing TVs out the hotel window, the bad guy usually does steal the show.But it is still necessary to ramp up the anger thrusters again, because this is a level up. Here we have an all-time footballer, who doesn’t need more money, being paid hundreds of millions of dollars to play in Saudi Arabia and who is now a mascot to the travelling court.Extortionate tickets and matches moved at Trump’s whim: are you ready for the ‘greatest World Cup ever’? | Marina HydeRead moreFor all Ronaldo’s alpha-dog stylingthis is such invertebrate behaviour. I will perfect my physical form. I will rise to become the most famous human. All the better to polish the boots of power. None of this will dissuade any of Ronaldo’s online supplicants. This is the point. His influence is being entirely co-opted, the greatest one-man act of multiple regime-washing yet devised.It also matters because of next year’s World Cup.Infantino’s dog-like devotion to Trumpis not just a personal oddity, but a breach of his duty of care. Fifa is non-political. Fifa is an administrator, not a player on the stage. Fifa has no mandate to use football’s popularity to endorse a movement, to be present while globally significant arms sales and nuclear cooperation are agreed.The day before the Ronaldo buffet, Infantino sat nodding along whileTrump talked about moving World Cup gamesfrom cities run byhis political opponentsand threatened to bomb Fifa’s co-host Mexico. Trump is already shaping this global show as a projector screen for his own divisive politics and the power-play with fellow autocrats, to the extent it is fair to say the US World Cup is as bad as Qatar and Russia on a register of political cynicism. At least neither of those two ever pretended to be the world’s leading liberal democracy.There was an obvious emotional counterpoint this week in the glimpses of that other sporting world,Troy Parrottsaying: “That’s why we love football,”the joy of Scotland’s qualification, little shots of beauty that keep you coming. We don’t have to give up on the World Cup. But we can give up on the people who have weaponised it. And demand, wherever it is still possible, a great deal better than this.Explore more on these topicsCristiano RonaldoDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

But I got up and I’m still here’Bryan Armen GrahamA year and a half after his unstoppable rise was hijacked, the 26-year-old boxing star aims to become a three-weight champion against big-punching Brian Norman JrSat 22 Nov 2025 09.42 ESTShareRain falls in thin, needling lines over Hell’s Kitchen as Devin Haney walks into the VictoryBoxingGym. Somewhere along Ninth Avenue an ambulance threads through the congestion, its siren drawn out into a long, mournful ribbon that slips past the gym’s walls. He nods to a few familiar faces, peels off a Supreme Vanson leather jacket and begins to unwrap himself from the city. His father, Bill, arrives a step behind him, not so much entering the room as taking possession of it.“The youngest undisputed champion!” Bill cries out, half to the gym, half to himself. “He’s done it on three continents! Twenty-six years old and still writing history! Let the sparks fly!”The energy in the room seems to tilt toward the Haney clan, as it always does. Devin keeps his head down after taking a seat on the ring apron, winding the gauze around his knuckles with the same slow, practiced patience he’s carried since boyhood. Bill continues barking, rights and resentments and triumphs spilling out in a proud, protective crescendo. It’s a familiar ritual for the Haneys, father and son moving in concert. Bill has been here from the start, a self-styled Richard Williams of the hurt business: promoter, strategist, architect and hype man rolled into one. He has been shaping this trajectory since Devin was a boy, arranging professional fights in Tijuana when American commissions said he was too young. Lately, it’s a relentless leverage of social mediato breathlessly tout his son’s achievements. “Everything we built came from a plan,” he says. “We believed in the plan before anyone else did.”The first time I saw Haney up close he was 17 years old, newly licensed by special exemption from the Nevada commission after building a 4–0 start in Mexico andfighting in a four-rounderon the Manny Pacquiao–Timothy Bradley III undercard before a sea of empty seats in Las Vegas. His hand speed was already blinding, the eyes calm and alert, the movements unusually assured for a teenager still growing into his limbs. Nine years later, that stillness has only hardened. He glides around the ring working the pads with former world champion Mickey Bey, the mitts cracking like distant gunshots. Bey murmurs faint instructions between flurries. Haney grins, plants his feet and fires again.On Saturday night in Riyadh, Haney will move up to challenge the undefeated Brian Norman Jr for his WBO welterweight title. The fight is still three weeks away when we catch up at an open workout in Manhattan. “I feel great: strong, sharp, happy.” A small smile tucks into the corner of his mouth. “At 135, I was fighting the scale more than the guy in front of me. I’d make weight, and feel drained. Now I can eat. I can train for skills, not survival.”Two years ago, Haney seemed on an unstoppable rise. After defending the WBC lightweight title four times, he flew to Melbourne tooutpoint George Kambosos Jrand unify all four belts at 135lb. He went back again seven months laterto beat him more conclusively. Then came acareer-defining win over Vasiliy Lomachenkoin a fight that demanded uncommon nerve and ring intellect. Afterseeing off Regis Prograisfor a 140lb belt, Haney was 31-0, a two-weight champion and a fixture in the pound-for-pound conversation, all by the age of 25.But in one night, everything changed.The Ryan Garcia fight was almost entirely overshadowed byGarcia’s erratic behaviorboth in personand online. Weeks of unravelling – or performative unravelling – unsettled everything around the promotion. Then Garcia weighed in at 143.2lbs, a yawning 3.2lbs above the division limit, costing him money and the chance to win Haney’s title, but giving him a clear physical advantage. Still, the Haneys went through with the bout.Nothing prepared the sport for the night itself in April 2024, when the Haneys’ master plan was left in tatters by boxing’s biggest chaos agent. Haney was knocked down three times, all from the same left hook, and declareda majority-decision loser after 12 shocking rounds. The result was later overturned to a no contest after Garciafailed a drug test for ostarine, a performance-enhancing drug that promotes muscle growth. But the visuals of Haney getting battered to the floor repeatedly are much harder to wipe from the public consciousness, much less his own.View image in fullscreenDevin Haney, right, and Brian Norman Jr face off at Friday’s weigh-in at the Anb Arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Photograph: Hamad I Mohammed/ReutersIn the aftermath the Haneys filed a lawsuit against Garcia alleging fraud and battery, which only redoubled the ridicule from boxing’s unsparing chattering class, a complaint that has since been withdrawn. But even that, he admits, never sat right. “That wasn’t me,” he says. “That was the business side. I’m a fighter. I want to get it back in blood. I never wanted to do it that way. But I had people around me saying, ‘You lost millions, you’ve got to hold him accountable.’ I get that. But the truth is, I just want to fight. That’s who I am.”The rematch that might have rewritten the narrative never materialized. Haney had already signed his part of the contract, but Garcia lost to Rolly Romero before it could be finalized on the Saudi-backed cardthat took over Times Square. “We had a fight signed,” he says. “He didn’t want the rematch. But I still want it back in blood. I want to right that wrong.”On that same card, Haney’s return against José Ramírez signaled that something had been shaken. Haney won comfortably, but he mostly pirouetting around the perimeter, jabbed sparingly, flinched at feints and landed only 70 punches across 12 rounds. Surely there were mitigating factors: a 13-month layoff, the strain of staying at 140lb, the emotional debris of the Garcia nightmare. But the shift was noticeable.Haney doesn’t bother engaging with the criticism. “They’re going to say something regardless,” he says. “If you can punch, they’ll say it’s all you do. If you’ve got speed, they’ll say it’s because you can’t punch. All I want is to keep beating the guys they put in front of me.”Which is why Saturday night in Riyadh matters. Standing across from him will be Norman, unbeaten at 28-0 with 22 knockouts, and the owner of one of the most violent left hooks thrown this year: the punch that flattened Jin Sasaki in June and announced his arrival. A win would make Haney a world champion in a third division. A loss would represent a far more complicated detour.If Garcia embodied chaos, Norman represents danger. A younger, heavier fighter entering the ring with the kind of confidence Haney once carried. The fight came together very quickly, but Haney says the choice was deliberate. “I want to fight the best available guys,” he says. “I went down the list. Ryan lost and didn’t want it. So what better guy than the best one right now at 147?”Haney respects Norman’s potential but not the mystique. “He’s good,” he says. “But it’s hard to say how good. They put him in with guys who made him look the way they wanted him to look. We’ll see what happens when he’s in there with somebody who can think.”There is relief, too, in the move upward. “I’m much happier,” he says. “My mental [state] is better. I can focus more on game-planning instead of losing weight. At 135, everything in camp was about the scale. Now I finally feel like I’m training to fight again.”He’s become his own dealmaker, too, negotiating directly with promoters, including Turki al-Sheikh. “I’ve been negotiating my own deals for a while,” he says. “I love what Riyadh Season is doing for boxing. The best fighters are fighting the best fighters. Everybody’s making money. It’s a good time to be a boxer.”What keeps him moving forward, after belts and criticism and business? The answer lands softly but with certainty. “We set a goal as a kid,” he says. “I want my name to be mentioned with the greats when it’s all said and done. I won’t stop until I get there.“They said I couldn’t punch. They said I couldn’t take a punch. But I got up. I’m still here.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingUS sportsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

In 16 previous Premier League matches against Guardiola’sManchester City, with Bournemouth and Newcastle, Howe had lost 14 and drawn two. All that changed as, with Harvey Barnes scoring twice, his players dealt a potentially debilitating blow to City’s title hopes. Guardiola’s side now sit third, four points behind Arsenal and one in arrears of Chelsea.Newcastle United v Manchester City: Premier League – liveRead moreAlthough the visitors frequently shone on the ball here, Newcastle were better out of possession as Howe revelled in the sight of his nemesis coming undone on the transition and Erling Haaland malfunctioning in the face of Malick Thiaw’s marking. “It all came together today,” he said. “It was a really high-level game. I hope it’s the turning point we’re looking for.”Video assistant referee (VAR) reviews decreed two potential City penalties should not be awarded but, despite making a beeline for the referee, Sam Barrott, at the final whistle, Guardiola was, outwardly, sanguine. “Everything is fine with the referee,” he said, after claiming he did not see the incidents in questions. “VAR knows perfectly.” Turning serious, he added: “Newcastle are a top side with top players and a top manager, there was a momentum shift and, ultimately, we could not win.”Haaland spurned a wonderful early opening during an initial 45 minutes punctuated by a series of chances missed by both sides. With the Norwegian clean through, everyone waited for him to round Nick Pope but, for once, his robotic reliability in front of goal vanished and he hashed an attempt to lift the ball over the goalkeeper.View image in fullscreenHarvey Barnes fires home his first goal against Manchester City.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersShortly afterwards the growing nervousness among home fans very nearly turned to celebration as Nick Woltemade rose to meet a gloriously looping delivery from the impressive Tino Livramento but his header was kept out by a stunning save from Gianluigi Donnarumma.City demanded a penalty after a challenge from Fabian Schär – who played well as he returned to the starting XI in place of Sven Botman – on Phil Foden but a VAR review disagreed.By half-time VAR had also decided that Thiaw did not, after all, handle a Jérémy Doku shot and Donnarumma had again done well to dive low to divert a Woltemade strike. Even so, it might have been different had the £70m striker calibrated that shot a little better.Generally, though, Newcastle were playing much better than in recent weeks. Howe is proud of his capacity for reinvention and here Sandro Tonali and Bruno Guimarães swapped midfield roles, with the latter dropping into the No 6 position and Tonali adopting the No 8 brief.View image in fullscreenAn unhappy Pep Guardiola confronts a camera operator after the final whistle at St James’ Park.Photograph: George Wood/Getty ImagesIf this mini reshuffle seemed to suit the outstanding Guimarães – singled out for a “private chat” with an admiring Guardiola at the final whistle – better than an initially subdued Tonali, the wider home gameplan frequently frustrated the visitors with the return of Livramento and Lewis Hall in the full-back positions particularly welcome.Yet City still had their moments, often initiated by Foden. Not that his finishing was too hot following a sharp exchange of passes with Rayan Cherki that concluded with Cherki cueing Foden up for what should have been a sitter. Significantly that move began with a superlative, defence bisecting ball from the influential Rúben Dias.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Thiaw’s minding of Haaland proved a masterclass.Ditto Barnes’s finishing. The left winger would almost certainly not have started had Anthony Gordon not failed a late fitness test but here he opened the scoring after playing a cute one-two with Guimarães before atoning for a first-half miss by unleashing a first-time shot of such power and precision that even Donnarumma proved unequal to it.Guardiola’s suddenly manic body language spelled implosion but the Catalan was swiftly, if temporarily, calmed. Very shortly after Barnes deposited that opener in the bottom corner, Newcastle failed to clear a corner.First Doku, then Foden played the ball back into the box and eventually it fell to Dias whose shot flew through Schär’s legs and past an unsighted Pope.Not that Guardiola could relax. Almost immediately Guimarães’s header rebounded off the bar and Barnes reacted first to volley the rebound home for his sixth goal of the season. Another VAR intervention, exploring a possible offside against Guimarães this time, ensued but the goal stood and Newcastle, by now arranged in a back five, appeared thoroughly renascent. At the 17th top-tier attempt Howe had bested Guardiola.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Tottenham had won the derby and would go on to win their last two games of the season to take fourth place and the final Champions League qualification spot fromArsenal. It was the end of the 2021-22 campaign, and the sixth season in a row in which Tottenham had finished above Arsenal and, for the first time since the 60s, it seemed that they had a definitive superiority in north London.Since when – although Spurs will point out theyhave won a trophyand Arsenal have not – the pendulum has swung decisively back the other way. Mikel Arteta has remade Arsenal, but the question is whether, after three straight second-place finishes, they can go one better and win the league for the first time since 2004, a drought that itself makes success more difficult.Gabriel is a big loss for Arsenal – Arteta’s conundrum is how to replace himRead moreThe long wait intensifies desire. Even at this stage of the season, there is an acute consciousness of where the finish line is: games are not just games, they are steps towards that final goal and that, inevitably, leads to a heightened emotional state.Adraw at Sunderland is not a bad result. Nobody has beaten them at home so far this season. There is no reason for Arsenal to panic. And nobody is panicking. But there is a faint glimmer of unease before a testing week. On the one hand, that is positive: Arteta should be frustrated at his side twice conceding by being beaten to the second ball in the box and should be determined to maintain the standards that had been set previously. But on the other, it’s impossible to win the title if the base level of nervous energy is too high. And Manchester City are looming.Erling Haaland looks unstoppable. Somehow, while Arsenal have had an excellent start to the season, setting records for consecutive clean sheets, and City began uncertainly enough to drop 11 points (only three fewer than they dropped in the whole of 2017-18), the gap from first to second at the beginning of the weekend was only four points.Arsenal have felt City’s breath on their neck before and it has not ended well for them. Not even a third of the season has gone; they cannot let the run-in start now. It happened in 2022-23 when the winter World Cup distorted the sense of the calendar and for Arsenal, with a lead to protect, each game became impossibly freighted. The memory of that season, the yearning for another league title, the early lead, all risk something similar.View image in fullscreenRicharlison celebrates after making it 2-1 against Manchester United in early November. The Brazilian is Spurs’ top scorer this season in the league, with four goals.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAIn that sense, a derby may not be the worst way to reset after the international break. It has a meaning in and of itself. The ramifications for the Premier League table, at least temporarily, retreat behind issues of parochial pride. And those are real enough, not least because the two sides, since Arsenal made the journey north from Woolwich in 1913, have had so much in common. Yet Arsenal, since the moment in 1919 when they were granted what Tottenham believe should rightfully have been their place in the First Division, have taken on the role of older cousin.Both benefited from innovative managers in the 20s: Herbert Chapman at Arsenal and Peter McWilliam at Tottenham. Chapman won an FA Cup and two league titles before his death midway through another title-winning season. It was thanks to the foundations he laid that Arsenal won a seventh league title in 22 years in 1952-53. McWilliam’s success was delayed, but it was two of his proteges, Arthur Rowe and Bill Nicholson, who brought Spurs’ two league titles.Both, by the end of the last century, found themselves restricted by old-fashioned stadiums that could not be expanded without complete rebuilding. But as Arsenal began the construction of the Emirates,Roman Abramovicharrived in English football and the rules of the game changed. It would be unfair to say the move to the Emirates has failed – Arsenal would be in a worse position without it – but it has not yet yielded the dividends on the pitch that many would have anticipated.Tottenham’s move came 13 years later. Their stadium can host five times as many non-football events a year as Arsenal’s andis more profitablebut whatever the merits of their homes, Spurs and Arsenal are unusual among the elite in relying more on stadium revenue than the generosity of their owners.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mauricio Pochettino and Arteta successfully cleared out the old guard while imposing a modern style that has influenced others in the league. The difference is that while Pochettino’s revolution came during the stadium move which, ultimately, cost focus, investment and momentum, Arteta has benefited from taking over with the stadium mature and its income streams reliable.Pochettino fell narrowly short of a league title twice (although Arsenal ended up pipping his side to second in 2015-16, it was Tottenham who were Leicester’s most serious challengers); Arteta’s story similarly is, so far, of near misses. The danger is that if that doesn’t change this season the perception of him, not only among the public but more damagingly his squad, will become of somebody who is somehow not a winner, despite the vast improvements he has brought to Arsenal.Injuries have struck again, Gabriel Magalhães joining Martin Ødegaard, Kai Havertz, Noni Madueke, Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Jesus on the sidelines with Riccardo Calafiori also a doubt for Sunday. Arsenal have probably the strongest and most coherent squad in the league, but this is its most severe test.Yet whatever doubts there are for Arsenal, at Tottenham they are far greater, poor home form magnifying the doubts of those who wondered whether Thomas Frank could make the step up from Brentford. And they are without Dominic Solanke, James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Lucas Bergvall.Spurs may be much better away from home this season, but Frank has won only one of nine games against Arsenal, who have won seven of their past nine Premier League games against Spurs.Whatever pressure they may be beginning to feel, Arsenal remain the elder cousin.Explore more on these topicsArsenalInside footballMikel ArtetaTottenham HotspurcommentShareReuse this content"

In the away technical area, Oliver Glasner was also on the move, the Palace manager briefly dancing on ice as he almost lost his footing. “Almost,” he said, grinning, “but fortunately I am Austrian, I am a really good skier so I am used to being on slippery surfaces.”By the end, the delirious away support were asking their goalkeeper Dean Henderson for song suggestions after the substitute Eddie Nketiah went close to adding a third goal. For Wolves and Rob Edwards, this his first game in permanent charge, there was only more pain. Pino scored six minutes after Daniel Muñoz opened the scoring to earn a win that propels Palace into fourth. Wolves remain on two points and rooted to the bottom of the table after a dozen matches; they are the only winless team in the top seven tiers of English football and hurtling towards the Championship.Harvey Barnes double helps Newcastle derail Manchester City revivalRead moreFor Edwards, this was a moment that had felt like a long time coming. He made more than a century of appearances for the club as a defender and returned to the club after retiring as a player, taking the role of Under-18s head coach. Stints as Under-23s and first-team coach followed, as well as two matches in caretaker charge in 2016.View image in fullscreenWolves’ manager Rob Edwards acknowledges the home fans before kick-off in his first match as permanent head coach.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAEdwards never strayed too far from the radar of the Wolves hierarchy and this week the chair, Jeff Shi, compared the 42-year-old’s return to that of “an old friend joining us as a leader of the club, to start a new chapter”. Edwards could not hide his smile as Hi Ho Silver Lining thumped over the speakers before kick-off.All of the prematch sound bites had been encouraging from a Wolves perspective but in the game, save for a period early in the second half where they generated momentum, Palace were superior. Jean-Philippe Mateta should have given Palace the lead after 16 minutes but after a slick move, kick-started by a swish of Adam Wharton’s left foot on halfway, the France striker got his bearings wrong.Wharton located Pino with a nonchalant first-time pass with the outside of his boot and Pino flicked the ball on to Mateta, who shot wide after racing through on Sam Johnstone’s goal. A few minutes later Johnstone denied Daichi Kamada.Wolves had a rare sight of goal when João Gomes’s skittled free-kick deflected off Wharton, sparking Henderson into an instinctive save, before the rebound cannoned off Ladislav Krejci and over the bar. Marc Guéhi blocked a lashed David Møller Wolfe shot during that wave of Wolves pressure early in the second half but the substitute Jhon Arias spurned their best opening. Wolfe presented Arias with a golden opportunity a couple of yards out but he got his feet in a muddle.Edwards insisted there were encouraging signs, including an increase in high-intensity runs and sprints, though he conceded those numbers are ultimately secondary to the result. “I’ve been saying to the lads if we win more duels and we run harder and faster than them: good things will come,” he said. “Unfortunately it hasn’t today.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After a short corner, Wharton’s shot from the edge of the area sent Johnstone sprawling to his left, but the ball clattered into Maxence Lacroix and it dropped kindly for Muñoz with the goal gaping.Pino’s strike was a beauty after the Wolves substitute Hwang Hee-chan ran into trouble. Wharton was again influential in the buildup.

Withoutthe injured Cole Palmer, who fractured a toe after colliding with a door at home, they avoided a slip here, escaping without even a fissure.There was the occasional early threat of a bloody nose, but even not at full speed,Chelseawere able to halt Burnley’s industry. Pedro Neto and Enzo Fernández were the match-winners on a day Chelsea did not make the most of dominating, but they have moved to three points off top spot with four wins in a row without conceding. A timely boost going into a big week with Barcelona and Arsenal to play.Burnley v Chelsea: Premier League – liveRead more“We are confident, we are doing well,” Enzo Maresca said. “We could have done many, many things better. It was a tough game for many reasons. Again, after the international break, 12 o’clock in the morning.“They probably had one important chance. We conceded some chaos inside the box, but it’s part of the game. Overall, we deserve to win and we are happy.”View image in fullscreenPedro Neto leaps to head Chelsea in front during the first half at Turf Moor.Photograph: Gary Oakley/PABurnley matched Chelsea for more than a third of the game, looking dangerous thanks to balls over the top that their wingers latched on to, but Loum Tchaouna and Jaidon Anthony never made a clinical decision when they mattered. They either wanted too long on the ball or sent loose crosses to no one.“The first half I thought we were brilliant,” Scott Parker said. “The slight critical edge to us is maybe the half chances we have that maybe one falls to us or goes in or the final little bit of detail.”Chelsea were sloppy in the early stages, unable to keep possession. Their front three came alive when the ball reached the edge of the box, offering neat touches and clever runs but without creating a chance of note. Moisés Caicedo’s absence from the starting XI, caused by a gruelling international break with Ecuador, caused problems in the their midfield and it took time to settle into a rhythm, but Andrey Santos eventually showed he was a worthy understudy.Slow thinking was a wider problem for Chelsea as they risked giving away a penalty after Robert Sánchez seemingly took a goal kick to Trevoh Chalobah, who put his hand on the ball before restarting play. Burnley barely said a word on the matter, but with little else going on at the time, the incident at least brought some interest. “It does look like a penalty,” Parker said.Chelsea finally found a groove and almost opened the scoring when Neto’s low cross looked destined for Jamie Gittens at the back post, only for Kyle Walker to intervene with a last-ditch tackle. The two wingers combined soon after to give the visitors the lead when Gittens’s curling cross from the left was headed home at the far post for Neto’s third goal in five league games.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Burnley lacked the cutting edge whereas, even in moments of toil, Chelsea gave off the impression they could produce a moment of quality.Marc Cucurella was causing Burnley the most problems. The left-back was allowed to drift inside and make runs beyond Liam Delap, regularly catching out the defence. The Spaniard played his part in the goal with one such action. Burnley were unable to track the defender nor stop him receiving the ball in dangerous positions.Chelsea were able to find greater control in the second half, constantly putting Burnley under pressure. Where the home side had at least posed questions before the break, Chelsea were not required to provide answers.A Chelsea second was far more likely than an equaliser. Burnley, who have lost three in a row, worked hard in an attempt to get back into the game, but fell short when it mattered despite an overhaul in attacking personnel. Chelsea were little better on a day Delap was anonymous, often floundering in the final third, but a quick break up the right by Neto resulted in Marc Guiu setting up Fernández to confirm the result.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBurnleyChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

This is the thing with João Palhinha, whether in matches or in life. The Tottenham midfielder fights back.The statistics from his time at Fulham between 2022 and 2024 are telling. The 30-year-old made the most tackles in the league in each season, winning more than anyone else in the first and coming second on the list in season two – one behind Sheffield United’s Vinícius Souza.Tottenham not close to spending £100m on one player like Arsenal, says FrankRead moreIt was a big part of the reason whyBayern Munich signed Palhinha for £42.3min July 2024, havingnarrowly failed in a deadline-day movefor him 12 months previously. If things did not work out at Bayern last season, an injury in November ruling him out for two and a half months, he has picked up where he left off on loan at Spurs. Before the weekend’s games, Palhinha was again the No 1 ranked player for tackles made and won.The Portugal international has long used setbacks as fuel, beginning when he was rejected as a boy by Benfica and Belenenses. He did not make it to Sporting’s academy until the age of 17, and he was 25 when he established himself in their first team after a series of loans. The breakdown of the transfer to Bayern was one of the toughest moments and yet he kept on coming.Palhinha is now looking at Sunday’s north London derby againstArsenalat the Emirates Stadium and it says plenty about his club’s situation that he finds himself talking about giving a “good answer”. Because after a good start to the season under Thomas Frank, certainly in terms of results, it has become increasingly hard to ignore the undercurrent of frustration.There is a precarious feel to Frank’s project. Is the glass half full or half empty? Look at the away form, which is the best in the division. The highlight was astunning win at Manchester Cityin August. Spurs began the weekend in fifth place; nobody should forget how they finished last season in 17th. Meanwhile, they are unbeaten in four Champions League ties, two of them victories.View image in fullscreenJoão Palhinha has chipped in with four goals for Tottenham this season.Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty ImagesAnd yet the home form in the league has been dismal, the natives restless mainly because of a dearth of entertainment. The low point came in adefeat by Chelseaat the start of the month when the players were booed off while they were underwhelming in thedraw against Manchester Unitedlast time out. Again, there were jeers. Would the vibes be different if the encouraging performances had been at home rather than away? Perhaps.What is unmistakably true is that Spurs have been bad more often than good in the past 10 matches in all competitions and with the City game feeling like a long time ago, they are due something to pep them. How everyone at the club would love it to come at Arsenal, where they have not won in the league since 2010-11. Put that right and Frank’s tenure would have the ultimate ignition point.“It’s like the environment is always different when you have these kind of games, especially this rivalry,” Palhinha says. “You live these moments in a different way. We need to respond really well after the last games. But football is momentum. I think it’s going to be the perfect test for us.View image in fullscreenJoão Palhinha produced the perfect reaction to criticism from Jamie Carragher by scoring against Copenhagen in the Champions League.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty Images“It’s a similar feeling to when we played Paris Saint-Germain in the European Super Cup at the beginning of the season [when Spurs lost on penalties]. They had won the league, the Champions League, everything. When you have these teams that are on the top moment, the pressure is probably more on their side. And we know what we can do. Hopefully we can reach what we really want, which is the victory. We don’t want to draw.”If Palhinha’s defensive contributions have been no surprise, then his goals have. He has chipped in with four, including thestoppage-time equaliser at home to Wolvesat the end of September. He was on the scoresheet at City, as well. Only Micky van de Ven, with six, has more for Spurs this season.Palhinha has nonetheless heard criticism, most searingly from Jamie Carragher after the Chelsea debacle, the Sky pundit accusing him of not being good enough to progress the ball. There has also been muttering from the Spurs support about Frank’s use of Palhinha alongside Rodrigo Bentancur in front of a back four. Does the partnership lack zip in possession?“I saw it [the Carragher analysis] because some people sent it to me,” Palhinha says. “But what can I say? If he speaks bad things about [Cristiano] Ronaldo, he can speak about everyone. Some people need to speak about another to be on the screens on the TV. My life is not about that, definitely.View image in fullscreenJoão Palhinha scored a late equaliser for Fulham at Arsenal in August 2023.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters“It makes it a bit embarrassing seeing the ex-players speaking that way and they look sometimes like superstars on their past. He should have seen probably more games of me at Tottenham. I am doing a top season and the things that he says about me go to the back of my mind. I don’t care too much because we have a lot of people speaking about us and trying to drop us [down]. The way is how we react. The way I reacted after what he said was to score against Copenhagen [in the Champions League win three days later].”Carragher’s comments miss the point about Palhinha because he is precisely what Spurs need: a pure No 6, a foundation stone, a leader. It is incumbent on Frank to find the right balance around him as Ruben Amorim did at Sporting. Amorim, who is now at United, first worked with Palhinha at Braga in 2019-20 when the latter was on loan; they won the Taca da Liga together. When Amorim went to Sporting and Palhinha returned there, they won the Portuguese league title and two more Taca da Liga trophies.View image in fullscreenJoão Palhinha scores with an acrobatic effort against Doncaster in the Carabao Cup in September.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAThe No 6, which Palhinha wears at Spurs, is fundamental to him for emotional reasons. At each of his clubs, he has either had the No 6 or a six as part of his number. He was No 26 at Fulham; No 16 at Bayern. It is because of his maternal grandfather, João, to whom he was extremely close. João died when Palhinha was 16.“He was born on 6 December and he left us on the sixth of a month – I don’t actually remember which one,” Palhinha says. “He was a man who made everything with his hands. At our family home, he made goals with fish nets and he did it to see my happiness; that of my brother and cousin, as well, because we played together.“I don’t know if my mother gave me my name because of my grandfather. My father is João, too, and so of course I named my first son, João. He is three and my other son, Francisco, is 10 months. The memories of my grandfather are here and every time I reach something special in my career, I dedicate it to him and to my grandmother, who has also passed.”Gabriel is a big loss for Arsenal – Arteta’s conundrum is how to replace himRead morePalhinha is asked whether he sees his future at Spurs because the fans are keen to know. “They should ask the owner or [the sporting directors] Fabio [Paratici] or Johan [Lange] … not myself,” he says. “Of course this is like a marriage. Both parts need to want [it]. I am really glad [to be] here. I feel the support from the supporters, as well, which is really special. We have until the end of the season. You know how it is in football.”What truly stands out as Palhinha prepares for the derby are his comments about the Bayern move that fell apart. They reinforce everything.“The reaction that I had is probably the same reaction I have on the pitch when a teammate loses the ball and I try to get it again,” he says. “In that moment, it was really tough for me to digest. But I like to think that everything that happens in our lives is because it needs to happen. If it doesn’t happen, it’s because it doesn’t need to happen. I kept focused and after one season, I had the opportunity again [to join Bayern].“I need to give credit to myself because the second opportunity came because of my reaction. I think I can be an example for some kids as well on these moments because before I became a professional I was rejected by a few clubs. The thing that I am most proud of in my career is that my trajectory has been upwards. And it’s because I work. A lot. I reached Sporting, Fulham, Bayern and Tottenham because of my work. It was not because of other things in football that we see a lot.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurArsenalBayern MunichPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Five minutes later aFreiburgcorner sailed to the far post where the unmarked Johan Manzambi headed past Manuel Neuer for a 2-0 lead.Bayern, who travel to Arsenal in the Champions League on Wednesday, almost immediately launched a comeback with Lennart Karl scoring a fine goal in the 21st minuted from an Olise assist.

But McGregor, theCelticcaptain, came to the rescue deep into added time when he lashed home the winner from 25 yards to claim the points for Martin O’Neill’s side.Scotland’s World Cup qualifying win reactions equivalent to small earthquakeRead moreO’Neill, the interim manager, described his skipper’s contribution as “absolutely massive” and added: “It was a great goal from a great player. The game was obviously heading for a draw. I’m not so sure that we deserved any more than that.“He scores a fabulous goal. Strangely enough, he moved it out of his feet just at the edge of the box and I thought: ‘He could hit this’. So it was a great goal. Maybe it didn’t belong with the game, but it was just great to win.”St Mirren had come closer to a breakthrough on several occasions before the added time. Conor McMenamin was close to converting from close range and then hit the post from 20 yards, before being penalised for offside after Liam Scales scooped the ball past Kasper Schmeichel into his own net.The St Mirren manager, Stephen Robinson, felt the referee, Kevin Clancy, should have been asked to look at the decision again. Robinson, whose side have had a string of disallowed goals in recent games, said: “We lost to an incredible goal. I thought we were very good.“I don’t think Shamal (George) had a save to make. We created numerous chances against Celtic. The fine margins of football at this moment in time are going against us.”View image in fullscreenCeltic interim manager Martin O’Neill watches on as his side struggled to create chances against St Mirren.Photograph: Steve Welsh/PAMohamed Diomandé’s late goal gaveRangersa hard-fought 2-1 win overLivingstonas the home side struggled badly on their return from a costly international break.John Souttar, Derek Cornelius, Mikey Moore and Youssef Chermiti were all ruled out through injuries sustained with their countries. That allowed Emmanuel Fernandez to make his third start since signing from Peterborough in the summer and the 24-year-old centre-back headed his side in front after nine minutes.Livi’s Australian striker Tete Yengi levelled after 18 minutes when he took advantage of awful defending and the home side’s overall play deteriorated, lacking urgency and guile. However, in the 78th minute Diomandé tapped into an empty net after Bojan Miovski had stretched to set him up for his first goal of the season.Danny Röhl admitted that improvement was needed from hisRangersside, though praised their battling qualities. “Yesterday in the press conference I spoke about a dirty win, maybe today it was exactly this. I said to my team it was a hard-working victory but more than this, it’s three points. I wasn’t here a few weeks ago, but maybe a few weeks ago we wouldn’t win this game.”View image in fullscreenMohammed Diomandé (right) prepares to score Rangers’ winner against Livingston from Bojan Miovski’s assist.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAKieron Bowie provided a goal and assist asHibernianswatted asideDundeein a comfortable 2-0 victory. The striker broke the deadlock on the half-hour mark with a well-taken effort before then setting up Jamie McGrath for the second. Bowie had failed to score in his previous nine outings and it looked like his frustration would continue after he missed a gilt-edged chance just moments before scoring. But the Hibs head coach, David Gray, insisted he was never overly worried about Bowie’s struggles in front of goal.“Strikers get confidence from scoring goals clearly, but I’ve had a lot of conversations with Kieron recently about what he actually does for the team. It’s not just scoring goals, I know that’s what they get judged on but the rest of the players certainly benefit from unselfish work he does for the team. But this will definitely do his confidence a world of good as well. He is still young. He’s 23 years old.

The centre was in fine form for France.Photograph: Thibaud Moritz/AFP/Getty Images“We’re happy to finish with a big win today,” said France’s captain, Grégory Alldritt. “In defence we need to work a bit, be a bit cleaner as well, less penalties against us. A few steps to work on.”Schmidt, who is stepping down after taking charge following the 2023 World Cup fiasco, praised his team’s efforts. “We’re disappointed we didn’t finish with the victory you would have loved to see,” he said.Tom Rogers makes hat-trick history in vain as New Zealand surge past WalesRead more“But the players have made a heck of an effort – 15 Tests in 22 weeks with the amount of travel we’ve had. I admire the way they’ve dusted themselves off and gone again.”The Wallabies scored on the first possession of the game, working through the phases before Faessler bundled over. France hit back when Bielle-Biarrey ghosted past two defenders and found Depoortère on the inside for the hosts’ first try.France missed routine tackles to allow Bell to touch down between the sticks and put Australia ahead again before the hosts shifted the ball sharply through the hands to create an overlap, freeing Ramos to glide over and level at 12-12.France extended the lead in style as the ball was worked wide to Bielle-Biarrey and the winger exploded into space, chipping ahead and regathering before stepping inside the last defender to finish a brilliant solo try.Australia levelled before the break after Maxime Lucu was sent to the sin-bin, Faessler crossing again from a maul.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But here, on a perfect night for rugby and with a game promising to develop into a gripping contest, we saw four players banished for crimes and misdemeanours in the first half alone. Mad stuff, at the end of which – after well over two exhausting hours – the world champions stumbled to a win that should have been managed with half the effort.Ireland v South Africa: Autumn Nations Series rugby union – liveRead more“I’d say it was chaotic,” Andy Farrell said. “I haven’t seen a game like that ever. First and foremost you look at ourselves and why things happened but my overriding reaction is that I’m incredibly proud. If you can’t learn from that then you’re in the wrong place really.”The passage to the overflowing sin-bin was halted only by the half-time whistle, at which point the referee, Matt Carley, was booed off the field with a venom you don’t often see. Their sense of injustice kicked off with the decision not to card Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu for a dangerous tackle on Tommy O’Brien. Both Farrell and his captain Caelan Doris felt a card should have been shown.So South Africa took with them a 19-7 lead and the knowledge they would be starting the second half against 12 men, albeit not for long. Ireland meantime were down the corridor with Farrell wondering what pieces he could move around a very bare-looking chessboard.The coach had seen James Ryan go first, on a yellow card escalated to red for a no-arms clean out on Malcolm Marx. The traffic became turbo charged in the last eight minutes of the half with Sam Prendergast, replacement Jack Crowley and then Andrew Porter all going off for a variety of offences.View image in fullscreenMalcolm Marx, bottom right, after a clean-out by James Ryan which earned the Ireland player a 20 minute red card.Photograph: Brendan Moran/Sportsfile/Getty ImagesIt was only in that bizarre passage that the Boks actually got to grips with turning their pronounced dominance at the scrum to something material on the scoreboard. They looked less confused when playing against 15 men, putting Damian Willemse over for a try inside four minutes. That said, they looked happy enough early in the second half when Sam Prendergast was back on the field to kick a penalty, only for his brother Cian to spill the restart. With yet another scrum penalty advantage to play with Feinberg-Mngomezulu, a serious athlete with a surfeit of skill, fended Jamison Gibson-Park en route to the line. That put the Boks 24-10 ahead, and looking safe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think the crowd recognised that and supported them for it. To be able to win the second half 6-5 in those sorts of circumstances was fantastic and that doesn’t tell the whole story of the second half. ” Consider that in a six-minute spell in the second quarter South Africa put Ireland on the rack, twisting seven penalties from the home side with the scrum the primary source. And that was before the hemorrhage of home players started.Even so, South Africa spent the last few minutes frantically defending their own line, with the slim comfort of a two-score lead, which they held until Carley blew for the last time, kicking off another chorus of boos.Quick GuideIreland v South Africa teams and scorersShowIrelandHansen (Farrell 65); O’Brien (HIA Crowley 32), Ringrose (Gibson-Park 75), Aki, Lowe; Prendergast, Gibson-Park (Casey 66); Porter (McCarthy 73), Sheehan (Kelleher 56), Furlong (Bealham 60), Ryan (C Prendergast 40), Beirne, Baird (Conan 60), Van der Flier (McCarthy 42; Porter 50; McCarthy 60; Porter 63), Doris (capt).Red cardRyan 21.Yellow cardPrendergast 34, Crowley 40, Porter 42, McCarthy 63.TrySheehan.PensPrendergast 2.ConCrowley 1.South AfricaWillemse; Moodie, Kriel, De Allende, Kolbe; S Feinberg-Mngomezulu (Libbok 59) C Reinach (Williams 69); B Venter, (Steenekamp 42), M Marx (Grobbelaar 66; Marx 73), T du Toit (Louw 42; Du Toit 73), E Etzebeth (Snyman 50), R Nortje, S Kolisi (Esterhuizen 59), P-S du Toit, J Wiese (Smith 54).Yellow cardWilliams 79.TriesWillemse, penalty try, Reinach, Feinberg-Mngomezulu.ConFeinberg-Mngomezulu.RefereeMatthew Carley (Eng).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Boks looked relieved, but that will last only until the review: how could a team so dominant at set–piece, and with a decent all-court game to match, end up in hand to hand combat to get over the finish line.

This latest one was 52-26 and to those who missed it will look like just another in their lengthy list of losses to New Zealand, which stretches back 34 matches. But it is possible, too, that for the men who coached it, and the men who played in it, for the tens of thousands watching in the ground and the hundreds of thousands watching on TV, it might yet come to stand for something more significant.Wales did not exactly turn a corner here, but they took a little look around one and got a glimpse of what a better future might be like. “A lot of what we want to do and what we’ve been working on as a team shone through today,” said their captain, Dewi Lake. “We made them work for it.”They were “courageous and fluent” said the All Black coach, Scott Robertson. Not to mention coherent and committed in defence, and smart and incisive in attack. Three times the All Blacks stretched ahead by scoring a try, the first of them after three minutes, and three times Wales managed to force their way straight back into the match by scoring one of their own.View image in fullscreenTom Rogers spins home for his historic third try.Photograph: Nigel French/PAThey were all finished by Scarlets’ wing Tom Rogers, who became the first Welshman to score a hat-trick against New Zealand. But they belonged to his teammates, too, especially Tomos Williams, who made one with an ingenious grubber kick, Louis Rees-Zammit, who set up another with a superb catch, and Joe Hawkins, who made the third with a fine long pass.Five minutes into the second half it was 24-21, with only a penalty kick by Damian McKenzie between the teams. Two of New Zealand’s three tries came from lineouts, one a simple finish by Caleb Clarke, the other an even simpler one by Tamaiti Williams off the back of a driving maul.Quick GuideWales v New Zealand teams and scorersShowWalesMurray; Rees-Zammit, Llewellyn, Hawkins, Rogers (Tompkins 55); Edwards (Evans 68), Williams (Hardy 68); Carré (G Thomas 52), Lake (Coghlan 76), Assiratti (Griffin 52), Jenkins, Beard (F Thomas 70), Mann, Deaves (Morse 68), Plumtree.Yellow cardsThomas 58, Plumtree 68.TriesRogers 3, Rees-Zammit.ConsEvans 3.New ZealandLove (Reece 55); Jordan, Ioane, Lienert-Brown (Fainga’anuku 68),Clarke; McKenzie, Ratima (Christie 55); Williams (Bower 55), Taukei’aho (Bell 65), Tosi (Newell 55), Barrett, Holland (Lord 64), Parker, Kirifi (Lio-Willie 68), Sititi.TriesClarke 2, Reece 2, Love, Williams, Ioane.ConsMcKenzie 7.PenMcKenzie.RefereeHollie Davidson (Eng).Attendance68,388.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The third was a brilliant finish by Ruben Love, who cracked open a gap between Rhys Carré and Harri Deaves with a dummy and slipped through with a fine side-step, then sprinted 30 metres to score. If no one in the stadium really believed Wales would win, everyone enjoyed pretending that they might.The atmosphere was feverish. The WRU had already laid on indoor fireworks and a light show, along with an a capella rendition of the national anthem and a brilliantly spot-lit haka, which was staged on a black pitch against the bright red backdrop of the grandstands. But what their paying public really wanted was a performance they could take some pride in. Their team delivered that for them.It could not last. As the match approached the final quarter, New Zealand slipped into a higher gear. They scored three tries in five minutes. The first two were awarded but then disallowed by the TMO, one for a knock-on, and another after replays showed Rogers had just managed to hold the ball up by wrapping his arm around Will Jordan as he dived for the line. But the third, which was not awarded because the referee suspected there had been a knock-on before Rieko Ioane scored off a crossfield kick, was given after an intervention by the TV official.View image in fullscreenRieko Ioane scrambles over the top of Wales fly-half Dan Edwards for New Zealand’s fourth try.Photograph: Dan Mullan/Getty ImagesFrom then on, things started to fall apart. Wales’s discipline had been bad all match, but it got worse when the All Blacks started to put them under really heavy pressure. First Gareth Thomas was sent to the sin-bin for a dangerous tackle. Then, just as he was coming back on, Taine Plumtree went off as well for the same offence. So Wales played most of the last 20 minutes with 14 men.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As an AI worker on Amazon Mechanical Turk – a marketplace that allows companies to hire workers to perform tasks like entering data or matching an AI prompt with its output – Pawloski spends her time moderating and assessing the quality of AI-generated text, images and videos, as well as some factchecking.Roughly two years ago, while working from home at her dining room table, she took up a job designating tweets as racist or not. When she was presented with a tweet that read “Listen to that mooncricket sing”, she almost clicked on the “no” button before deciding to check the meaning of the word “mooncricket”, which, to her surprise, was a racial slur against Black Americans.“I sat there considering how many times I may have made the same mistake and not caught myself,” said Pawloski.The potential scale of her own errors and those of thousands of other workers like her made Pawloski spiral. How many others had unknowingly let offensive material slip by? Or worse, chosen to allow it?After years of witnessing the inner workings of AI models, Pawloski decided to no longer use generative AI products personally and tells her family to steer clear of them.“It’s an absolute no in my house,” said Pawloski, referring to how she doesn’t let her teenage daughter use tools likeChatGPT. And with the people she meets socially, she encourages them to ask AI about something they are very knowledgable in so they can spot its errors and understand for themselves how fallible the tech is. Pawloski said that every time she sees a menu of new tasks to choose from on the Mechanical Turk site, she asks herself if there is any way what she’s doing could be used to hurt people – many times, she says, the answer is yes.A statement fromAmazonsaid that workers can choose which tasks to complete at their discretion and review a task’s details before accepting it. Requesters set the specifics of any given task, such as allotted time, pay and instruction levels, according to Amazon.“Amazon Mechanical Turk is a marketplace that connects businesses and researchers, called requesters, with workers to complete online tasks, such as labeling images, answering surveys, transcribing text or reviewing AI outputs,” said Montana MacLachlan, an Amazon spokesperson.ChatGPT may be polite, but it’s not cooperating with youRead morePawloski isn’t alone. A dozenAI raters, workers who check an AI’s responses for accuracy and groundedness, told the Guardian that, after becoming aware of the way chatbots and image generators function and just how wrong their output can be, they have begun urging their friends and family not to use generative AI at all – or at least trying to educate their loved ones on using it cautiously. These trainers work on a range of AI models – Google’s Gemini, Elon Musk’s Grok, other popular models, and several smaller or lesser-known bots.One worker, an AI rater withGooglewho evaluates the responses generated by Google Search’s AI Overviews, said that she tries to use AI as sparingly as possible, if at all. The company’s approach to AI-generated responses to questions of health, in particular, gave her pause, she said, requesting anonymity for fear of professional reprisal. She said she observed her colleagues evaluating AI-generated responses to medical matters uncritically and was tasked with evaluating such questions herself, despite a lack of medical training.At home, she has forbidden her 10-year-old daughter from using chatbots. “She has to learn critical thinking skills first or she won’t be able to tell if the output is any good,” the rater said.“Ratings are just one of many aggregated data points that help us measure how well our systems are working, but do not directly impact our algorithms or models,” a statement from Google reads. “We also have a range of strong protections in place to surface high quality information across our products.”Bot watchers sound the alarmThese people are part of a global workforce of tens of thousands who help chatbots sound more human. When checking AI responses, they also try their best to ensure that a chatbot doesn’t spout inaccurate or harmful information.When the people who make AI seem trustworthy are those who trust it the least, however, experts believe it signals a much larger issue.“It shows there are probably incentives to ship and scale over slow, careful validation, and that the feedback raters give is getting ignored,” said Alex Mahadevan, director of MediaWise at Poynter, a media literacy program. “So this means when we see the final [version of the] chatbot, we can expect the same type of errors they’re experiencing. It does not bode well for a public that is increasingly going to LLMs for news and information.”AI workers said they distrust the models they work on because of a consistent emphasis on rapid turnaround time at the expense of quality. Brook Hansen, an AI worker on Amazon Mechanical Turk, explained that while she doesn’t mistrust generative AI as a concept, she also doesn’t trust the companies that develop and deploy these tools. For her, the biggest turning point was realizing how little support the people training these systems receive.“We’re expected to help make the model better, yet we’re often given vague or incomplete instructions, minimal training and unrealistic time limits to complete tasks,” said Hansen, who has been doing data work since 2010 and has had a part in training some of Silicon Valley’s most popular AI models. “If workers aren’t equipped with the information, resources and time we need, how can the outcomes possibly be safe, accurate or ethical? For me, that gap between what’s expected of us and what we’re actually given to do the job is a clear sign that companies are prioritizing speed and profit over responsibility and quality.”Dispensing false information in a confident tone, rather than offering no answer when none is readily available, is a major flaw of generative AI, experts say. An audit of the top 10 generative AI models including ChatGPT, Gemini and Meta’s AI by the media literacy non-profit NewsGuard revealed that the non-response rates of chatbots went down from 31% in August 2024 to 0% in August 2025. At the same time, the chatbots’ likelihood of repeating false informationalmost doubled from 18% to 35%, NewsGuard found. None of the companies responded to NewsGuard’s request for a comment at the time.“I wouldn’t trust any facts [the bot] offers up without checking them myself – it’s just not reliable,” said another Google AI rater, requesting anonymity due to a nondisclosure agreement she has signed with the contracting company. She warns people about using it and echoed another rater’s point about people with only cursory knowledge being tasked with medical questions and sensitive ethical ones, too. “This is not an ethical robot.

He was tasked with stumping the model – meaning he had to ask Google’s AI various questions that would expose its limitations or weaknesses. Having a degree in history, this worker asked the model historical questions for the task.“I asked it about the history of the Palestinian people, and it wouldn’t give me an answer no matter how I rephrased the question,” recalled this worker, requesting anonymity, having signed a nondisclosure agreement. “When I asked it about the history of Israel, it had no problems giving me a very extensive rundown. We reported it, but nobody seemed to care at Google.” When asked specifically about the situation the rater described, Google did not issue a statement.For this Google worker, the biggest concern with AI training is the feedback given to AI models by raters like him. “After having seen how bad the data is that goes into supposedly training the model, I knew there was absolutely no way it could ever be trained correctly like that,” he said. He used the term “garbage in, garbage out”, a principle in computer programming which explains that if you feed bad or incomplete data into a technical system, then the output would also have the same flaws.The rater avoids using generative AI and has also “advised every family member and friend of mine to not buy newer phones that have AI integrated in them, to resist automatic updates if possible that add AI integration, and to not tell AI anything personal”, he said.Fragile, not futuristicWhenever the topic of AI comes up in a social conversation, Hansen reminds people that AI is not magic – explaining the army of invisible workers behind it, the unreliability of the information and howenvironmentally damaging it is.“Once you’ve seen how these systems are cobbled together – the biases, the rushed timelines, the constant compromises – you stop seeing AI as futuristic and start seeing it as fragile,” said Adio Dinika, who studies the labor behind AI at the Distributed AI Research Institute, about people who work behind the scenes. “In my experience it’s always people who don’t understand AI who are enchanted by it.”The AI workers who spoke to the Guardian said they are taking it upon themselves to make better choices and create awareness around them, particularly emphasizing the idea that AI, in Hansen’s words, “is only as good as what’s put into it, and what’s put into it is not always the best information”. She and Pawloski gave a presentation in May at the Michigan Association of School Boards spring conference. In a room full of school board members and administrators from across the state, they spoke about the ethical and environmental impacts of artificial intelligence, hoping to spark a conversation.“Many attendees were shocked by what they learned, since most had never heard about the human labor or environmental footprint behind AI,” said Hansen. “Some were grateful for the insight, while others were defensive or frustrated, accusing us of being ‘doom and gloom’ about technology they saw as exciting and full of potential.”Pawloski compares AI ethics to that of the textile industry: when people didn’t know how cheap clothes were made, they were happy to find the best deal and save a few bucks. But as the stories of sweatshops started coming out, consumers had a choice and knew they should be asking questions. She believes it’s the same for AI.“Where does your data come from? Is this model built on copyright infringement? Were workers fairly compensated for their work?” she said. “We are just starting to ask those questions, so in most cases the general public does not have access to the truth, but just like the textile industry, if we keep asking and pushing, change is possible.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)AmazonGoogleChatGPTWorkers' rightsEthicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Do hordes of commenters applaud your tips on how to “scale” your startup? Do recruiters slide into your DMs to “explore potential synergies”?If not, it could be because you’re not a man.Dozens of women joineda collective LinkedIn experimentthis week after a series of viral posts suggested that, for some, changing their gender to “male” boosted their visibility on the network.Othersrewrote their profilesto be, as they put it, “bro-coded” – inserting action-oriented online business buzzwords such as “drive”, “transform” and “accelerate”. Anecdotally, their visibility also increased.The uptick in engagement has led some to speculate that an in-built sexism in LinkedIn’s algorithm means that men who speak in online business jargon are more visible on its platform.Like most large social media platforms, LinkedIn uses an algorithm to determine which posts it shows to which users – boosting some, and downgrading others.Ina blog post on Thursday, LinkedIn acknowledged the trend, but said it did not consider “demographic information” in deciding who gets attention. Instead, it said, “hundreds of signals” factor into how a given post performs.“Changing gender on your profile does not affect how your content appears in search or feed,” a spokesperson said. Be that as it may, the anecdotes are piling up.“It has certainly been exciting,” said Simone Bonnett, an Oxford-based social media consultant who changed her pronouns to “he/him” and her name to “Simon E” on LinkedIn earlier this week.“The kind of stats that I’m seeing at the moment are a 1,600% increase in profile views, which is wild if you think about what social media views look like at the moment, and a 1,300% increase in impressions. Also wild reach stats.”Megan Cornish, a communications strategist for mental health tech companies, said she started experimenting with her LinkedIn settings after seeing her reach on the platform decline precipitously earlier this year.First she changed her gender to “male”. Then she told ChatGPT to rewrite her profile in “male-coded” language, based on a LinkedIn post suggesting the platform favours “agentic” words such as “strategic” and “leader”.Finally, she asked ChatGPT to rewrite old, badly performing posts from several months ago in similarly “agentic” language, figuring that recycling old, reworked content would help her isolate what effect “bro-coding” was having on her reach.Things went great. Almost immediately, Cornish’s reach on LinkedIn spiked, increasing 415% in the week after she trialled the changes. She wrote a post about the experience, andit went viral, racking up nearly 5,000 reactions.The problem was, she hated it. Before, her posts had been “soft”, she said. “Concise and clever, but also like warm and human.” Now, bro-Megan was assertive and self-assured – “like a white male swaggering around”.She gave up after a week. “I was going to do it for a full month. But every day I did it, and things got better and better, I got madder and madder.”Not everyone had the same experience as Cornish and Bonnett. Cass Cooper, a writer on technology and social media algorithms, said she changed her gender to “male” – and then her race to “white” (Cooper is Black). The overall result, she said, was a decline in her profile’s reach and engagement – an experience other women of colour on the platform have alsodiscussed.“We know there’s algorithmic bias, but it’s really hard to know how it works in a particular case or why,” she said.While the LinkedIn experiments were “frustrating”, she said she believed they were a reflection of broader society-wide biases. “I’m not frustrated with the platform. I’m more frustrated with the lack of progress [in society].”Usershave been rumblingabout LinkedIn’s weird position as a quasi-business, quasi-social network for some time, ever since the pandemic blurred professional boundaries and injected more oversharing into work. LinkedIn’s occasional tendency to elevate extreme “bro-coding” isbest illustrated bysocial media accountsrecording the excessesof the platform.These latest “bro-coding” experiments, however, have their origins in what Cornish, Bonnett and others describe as algorithm changes in recent months that have caused female creators in particular to have markedly less visibility. This led to a seriesof informal experimentsearlier this year, in which women and men in parallel industries posted the same content – and the men got drastically more reach.LinkedIn usesan AI systemto classify posts to its feed, it says, deciding how to disseminate them based on their content, as well as the poster’s professional identity and skills. It evaluates its algorithms regularly, it says, including “checks for gender-related disparities”.A spokesperson for LinkedIn suggested that a recent decline in certain users’ reach came from a far higher volume of content on the network, adding that there had been a 24% increase in comments and a commensurate spike in video uploads in the past quarter.Bonnett said the “bro-coding,” in her experience, was on the rise. “You always think of LinkedIn as being more genteel, more businesslike. It’s not like that any more. It’s starting to become the wild west.”Explore more on these topicsLinkedInWomenGenderSocial mediaDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

The upcoming advancements for those with disabilities are life-changingRhik SamadderSat 22 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTShareWashing machines liberated women to get soul-crushing jobs that ate up their free time. Social media gave the world one revolution – before it destabilised democracies everywhere else. Now AI is here, and its main job seems to be replacing screenwriters. It’s easy to fall into techno-pessimism, but new documentary Seeing into the Future (Sunday 23 November, 8pm, BBC Two) has a different angle. For disabled people, tech has already brought about life-changing advancements. And we haven’t seen anything yet.It is presented by comedian and StrictlywinnerChris McCausland, who is blind. Some of the most casually astonishing scenes occur early on, showing how he uses his phone – essentially, an eye with a mouth. “What T-shirt is this?” he asks, holding up a garment. “A grey T-shirt with a graphic logo of Deftones,” his phone obliges. It can even tell him if the shirt needs ironing. But it’s where all this is going that fascinates McCausland, so he heads to the US, to see what’s in development at the houses of our tech overlords.He swings by a facility belonging to Meta to try out some smart glasses. To my mind, he may as well be entering the lair of the White Worm, or popping round for macarons at Dracula’s castle. But that’s partly because I’m not in direct need of such technology, and the documentary’s job is to highlight possibility not jump on pitfalls. It’s not like Zuckerberg is personally in the lab, stroking a cat and spinning round on an egg chair.I love having my perspective shaken up. A glass screen with no buttons sounds like the most excluding device imaginable, McCausland acknowledges, yet his phone became the most accessible tool he’s ever used. He’s similarly excited by the Meta Specs – I don’t think that’s what they’re actually called – which are always on and offer live video interpretation, telling you what you’re looking at. Like a phone but, crucially, wearable. “The one thing blind people never have is two hands free,” he observes.View image in fullscreenMcCausland with Maxine Williams, VP of accessibility and engagement at Meta, trying out their smart glasses.Photograph: BBC/Open Mike ProductionsAt MIT, a nanotechnologist tells him how molecular devices could repair cells inside our bodies. He tries bionic gait assistance – a device that straps on to the calf, giving the wearer added power. It looks like the knee brace Bruce Wayne uses inThe Dark Knight Risesto kick through a brick wall when he learns he’s got no cartilage in his knee. Most moving, in every sense, he takes a trip in a driverless car. It’s the first time McCausland has taken a car journey alone.Driverless cars will arrive in the UK next spring. (That’s a long journey.) They are what I would call an instinctive NOPE. But “It’s not massively different to trusting a driver I don’t know,” McCausland reflects. They are extraordinary: mounted with spinning radars, making calculations involving the speed of light to 3D-model the environment in real time. They may as well have gullwing doors. The fact the steering wheel moves on its own is McCausland’s favourite thing about them, which is charming. Coolness is certainly the second best thing technologists can pursue, after equality of access to lives of dignity and independence. In my defence, it’s not just that I don’t trust technology. It’s that I don’t trust profit-driven Big Tech companies to behave for the public good, or with any accountability.Driverless cars are coming to the UK – but the road to autonomy has bumps aheadRead moreThere’s a parallel pleasure in the documentary – transatlantic cultural difference. These are not just Americans, remember. These are San Franciscan Futurists. The inadvertent comedy is amplified by the addition of the dry McCausland. A man so British that, even when he’s interviewing a nanotechnologist about blood-borne computers that could potentially restore his sight, he sounds as if he’d hand you thirty English notes right now if you could teleport him to the pub instead.Even the tech is unmistakably American. “I can hear a plane?” prompts McCausland, trialling Zuckerberg’s glasses. “Yes, a plane is visible in the clear blue sky,” responds the earnest spectacles. Later, our presenter wryly looks back toward his own camera crew. “Do they look like they know what they’re doing?” he provokes. “Judging by their equipment, yes, they are professionals.” Go-go-gadget-missing-the-joke. Computers may increasingly be able to play God, but irony remains a step beyond. Even with a Batman leg brace.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherChris McCauslandFactual TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That may be about to change next week: Rachel Reeves, perhaps inured to being pilloried for any money-raising proposal, is expected to introduce a charge explicitly linked to how far EVs drive.The Treasury has all butconfirmed some kind of chargewill be announced at next week’s budget, but the details have not been revealed. According to an initial report in the Telegraph, EV drivers could from 2028 pay a supplement based on how far they had driven that year on top of their annual road tax, or vehicle excise duty (VED). That could be a self-declared estimate of distance or a check on the odometer at an MOT.According to Department for Transport (DfT) figures, battery electric cars – with lower running costs than petrol – are used more: clocking up about 8,900 miles on average in 2024. At 3p a mile, that would bring in £267 a car from the 1.4m EVs currently on the road – about £375m a year in total.View image in fullscreenThe Treasury has all but confirmed that some kind of charge on EVs will be announced when Rachel Reeves delivers the budget.Photograph: Carlos Jasso/AFP/Getty ImagesThe transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, was at pains to rule out a national road pricing scheme in the face of Commons attacks on Thursday – although a later “clarification” made clear that the EV pay-per-mile was still on the table.The long-term picture is a looming shortfall in motoring tax revenues, as income fromfuel duty evaporatesin the transition to EVs. Petrol and diesel cars effectively pay a charge linked to how far they drive – but via fuel consumption at the pump.Fuel duty of 52.95p a litre (roughly 5p a mile in average cars) will bring in £24.4bn this financial year, according to the latest forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility, but the billions will dwindle away from 2030, when the ban on new pure petrol and diesel cars comes in.The challenge is to find a fair replacement for an unsustainable system – and overcome longstanding resistance on the right to any form of road charging, bundled up in the culture wars aroundLondon’s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez)andlow-traffic neighbourhoodswith their claims of curtailed freedoms and increased surveillance.View image in fullscreenLast year London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, ruled out considering a pricing scheme after being battered by anti-Ulez hostility.Photograph: PA Images/AlamySome economists have championed schemes that would price roads by time and congestion – potentially fairer and a better tool to manage road use, but bringing in another level of tracking.Any scheme should be kept simple, says Steve Gooding, the director of the RAC Foundation motoring thinktank. Although, when it comes to privacy, he adds: “The amount of data being generated by the modern car is phenomenal. If the DfT or DVLA start tracking their movements, people think Big Brother is watching.But Elon [Musk]– they’re not that fussed.”A wider concern is that pay-per-mile would discourage drivers from switching to electric vehicles, crucial for cutting carbon emissions. Manufacturers, businesses and motoring groups such as Ford, AutoTrader and the AA have allspoken outon the timing of new charges at this point in the transition. Carmakers must,under Britain’s ZEV mandate, ensure one in three cars sold next year are zero-emission, rising to 80% by 2030 (with hybrids allowed to make up the remaining 20%).While grants remain of up to £3,750 on new electric vehicles and – for some – the running costs remain much cheaper, some discounts or tax and charge exemptions have already ended. Transport for London recently confirmed EVs would beliable for the capital’s congestion charge from next year, andzero-emission cars started paying VED in April.According to a report for the Social Market Foundation (SMF) thinktank, New Zealand provides a cautionary tale. EVs were made liable last year for its road-user charge, which previously only applied to diesel vehicles, whereby drivers buy paper permits in units of 1,000km (621 miles). The move, allied to the end of buyer grants and tax exemptions, led to a sharp drop in new EV sales – now just 4% of the market, having peak 19%.View image in fullscreenElectric vehicles at a charging point in Auckland, New Zealand, where EVs were made liable last year for its road-user charge.Photograph: MIchael Craig/APSMF says that Iceland, which also brought EVs into pay-per-mile schemes last year, maintained incentives and differentials in pricing and had a much smaller decline in market share.Advocates for the new technology are alarmed. The Electric Vehicle Association England, a group representing drivers, warned in a letter to the chancellor that consumer sentiment was still sceptical about EVs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ginny Buckley, the chief executive of Electrifying.com, an EV reviews platform and marketplace, says: “If you can’t rely on off-peak, affordable home charging and you’re reliant on the public charging network, for many people it will cost you more per mile to run your EV than it will a petrol car.”Graham Parkhurst, a professor of sustainable mobility at the University of the West of England, describes the vast difference between domestic chargers and public charging points –which attract VAT at 20% on top– as a “political timebomb”, further dividing the haves and have-nots.Even long-term proponents of pay-per-mile such as Parkhurst warn of the need to tread carefully: “Charging according to how much a vehicle moves makes sense. Fuel duty does that. But we need time to work out how to do this in the context of wider transport taxation. To the extent we need cars, it’s much better that they are electric,” he says.View image in fullscreenLong-term champions of pay-per-mile warn of the need to tread carefully.Photograph: nrqemi/Getty Images/iStockphotoThe thinktank the Resolution Foundation recommends a charge based on miles driven and weight be brought in only for future EV sales, as part of VED.Tanya Sinclair, the chief executive of the industry group Electric Vehicles UK, agrees that motoring taxes need fundamental reform – but the government needs to be absolutely clear it wants people to switch to EVs. “Anything that muddies that message – such as giving a grant with one hand and introducing pay-per-mile with the other – undermines that clarity for the consumer,” she says.A government spokesperson says it would “look at further support measures” for EVs, but adds: “Fuel duty covers petrol and diesel, but there’s no equivalent for electric vehicles. We want a fairer system for all drivers whilst backing the transition to electric vehicles.”For Gooding “the best time to introduce road pricing would have been a while ago – but politics has been an interesting place”. The cross-party transport select committee recommended the urgent introduction of road pricing –replacing all motoring taxes for every type of vehicle– in 2022. But no ministers have fancied it; London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, battered by anti-Ulez hostility, last year had torule out even considering a pricing scheme, despite oncetalking of it as the sensible option.Piloting a new policy is, Gooding says, best done “with the smallest number you can get away with – and if it’s only EVs, that’s better than trying to introduce some kind of complicated charge for the 34m cars we’ve already got”.For some, including Buckley and the Campaign for Better Transport, an obvious, if also politically contentious, answer remains: end the 15-year freeze on fuel duty and thetemporary 5p cut in place since 2022.Had the levy stayed the same in real terms, almost £150bn would have accrued to the public purse, according to SMF. Whatever pay-per-mile scheme evolves, Reeves “must ensure operating taxes on EVs remain lower than on petrol”, it says. “The simplest way to maintain that difference is to raise fuel duty.”Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsBudget 2025MotoringFuel dutyGreenhouse gas emissionsTax and spendingTaxfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Five theories to explain the Donald-Zohran meet-cuteDave SchillingWhy was the US president so pleased to hang with the democratic socialist? Perhaps we’ll never knowSat 22 Nov 2025 16.22 ESTLast modified on Sat 22 Nov 2025 16.27 ESTShareZohran and Donald. Donald and Zohran. Not sinceTurner met Hoochhas a couple so captivated the American psyche. This might be the meet-cute of the decade, unless you countRFK Jr and Olivia Nuzzi. Which was actually not cute at all, when I think about it.Why can’t we all stop talking about the New York City mayor-elect and his No 1 fan in the White House? Probably because absolutely none of this makes even a tiny bit of sense. From almost the beginning of his rise,Zohran Mamdanipositioned himself as an anti-Trump democratic socialist who would use the bully pulpit of Gracie Mansion to battle Maga attacks on the city. Trump, sensing an opportunity to create yet another punching bag,called Mamdaniacommunist and questionedhis American citizenship. He even went to the trouble ofendorsing Mamdani’s opponent, Andrew Cuomo, in the mayoral election.Something changed. Hard to say where or when, but clearly, after their meeting,Donald Trumpstarted to see Zohran in a different way. Why would two politicians with seemingly nothing in common suddenly seem so chummy in the Oval Office?I have some theories, some more speculative than others:1 New York City is the center of the attention economyNew York is a place where tabloids scream all-caps headlines at people every day, wherecon artists can become legitimate celebritiessimply for being somewhat successful at crime, and real estate developers with a taste for the spotlight can become president of the United States. I doubt I’m saying anything that will shock or concern you here, but it should be articulated: this meeting was an epic photo op for a couple of bros perhaps looking to grow their follower count. Donald Trump can smell a camera from 60 yards away, like some kind of bloodhound trained to chase paparazzi. He’s been putting himself inphotoswithsuccessfulpeoplefor years. It’s just one of those things he’s good at, and he learned that skill in New York. Zohran is also a New Yorker and understands the economy of attention. He had to go from polling below 5% to winning the entire election. Trump might live in Washington DC and Florida, but he’ll never stop being a New Yorker at heart. Game recognizes game.2 Donald Trump loves a winnerThen again, don’t we all? My son only started rooting for the Dodgers once they won the World Series last year. Nothing more fickle than a young child desperate to avoid even the hint of failure. And no one is more disgusted by losing than our Big Boy in Chief. The idea of losing is so repugnant to him that he has regularlydenied it. Zohran won with a clear majority and has support across numerous demographics. It was a clear and decisive victory. Trump might as well find a way to get some of that Zohran magic to rub off on him.3 Zohran is a millennial, and therefore completely nonthreateningSo much of Donald Trump’s political career has been defined by petty grievances and inside-baseball rivalry.Getting flamed at the White House correspondents’ dinnermight have set him on the path to the presidency. People like Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton are all in the same general age bracket, travel in similar social circles and probably ran into Donald Trump on more than one occasion before he became president. Jealousy, frustration or just plain old competitiveness might make all of the hectoring and political gamesmanship more fun for him, or at least more rewarding. Zohran is 10 years younger than Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and probably has never played golf with anyone he went to college with.4 Maybe they’re both really bullish on the Knicks this seasonIf Karl-Anthony Towns can find his shooting form and Landry Shamet stays hot, New York’s got a decent chance to make it out of the East.5 Donald Trump is a huge fan of the films of Zohran’s mother, Mira Nair?We don’t know what kinds of movies Donald Trump watched in the past. Maybe he really connected with the culture-clash romance of Mississippi Masala? Perhaps Monsoon Wedding was a VHS he wore out from incessant rewatch? I can definitely see him connecting with 1996’s Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love. Splendid performance from Indira Varma.I guess, though, we’ll never know why Donald Trump said Zohran Mamdanicould call him a fascist. Maybe he was just happy to have adistraction.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionZohran MamdaniUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But it’s certainly not the prospect of running out of toilet paper in the minimum-security prison where she’s residing. Maxwell is serving a 20-year-sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation. Rather than doing hard time, however, it seems Maxwell is having a relatively easy go of it. While most inmates get an allocation of two rolls of toilet paper per week, for example,CNN reportsthat Maxwell gets an unlimited supply.Bountiful bog roll isn’t the only privilege being extended to Maxwell. The very fact that she was transferred to the federal prison camp (FPC) in Bryan, Texas, has prompted uproar and claims of special treatment. Maxwell, to jog your memory, was originally held at a federal detention facility in Brooklyn, New York, then sent to a Florida facility in 2022, where she complained about poor conditions and “possumsfalling from the ceiling”.It’s not entirely clear why she was transferred out of the possum prison, but it may have had something to do with a visit paid to her in July by Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, who was previously Trump’s personal defense attorney. What did the pair talk about? I’m so glad you asked! In the interests of transparency, which the Trump administration is very keen on when it suits them, the chat between Blanche and Maxwell was recorded and released to the public. And, what do you know, Maxwell wasemphaticthat she “never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way”. She was moved from the Florida facilitywithin days.Ever since the transfer, which a prison consultant called “unprecedented”, there have been reports that Maxwell is being treated like a VIP. Earlier this month, for example, the Democratic congressman Jamie Raskinsent a letterto Trump noting that “the deference and servility to Ms. Maxwell [at FPC Bryan] have reached such preposterous levels that one of the top officials at the facility has complained that he is ‘sick of having to be Maxwell’s bitch’”.Raskin’s letter also claims that “FPC Bryan Warden Hall, has heaped favorable concierge-style treatment on Ms. Maxwell since her bizarre arrival at the institution,” including special meals, access to technology, puppies to play with, and special use of the exercise facilities.Emails written by Maxwell that were recentlyseen by the Atlanticfurther reinforce the idea that the disgraced socialite is having a relatively comfortable time behind bars. “The food is legions better [than at the facility in Florida], the place is clean, the staff responsive and polite,” Maxwell wrote in one email to her brother reviewed by the Atlantic. “I am much much happier.”Well, good for you, Ghislaine. But the fact that the US seems to have a two-tiered legal system should make everyone else very unhappy indeed. This isn’t really about Maxwell: it’s about who our legal system protects and who it punishes.Maxwell, it cannot be stressed enough, is no victim or unwitting accomplice. She came from a world of power and privilege and used her status to prey on vulnerable young girls. Maxwell hasn’t just been accused of procuring girls for Epstein to abuse; she’s been accused of actively participating in the abuse. In 2021, for example, a woman identified by the pseudonym “Jane”testifiedin Maxwell’s sex-trafficking trial that she’d met the socialite when she was 14. At first Maxwell and Epstein made her feel special. Then, according to Jane, the abuse started, and Maxwell would occasionally join in.The fact that she has been accused of serious crimes isn’t to say that Maxwell should be thrown into a dungeon and left to sustain herself on foraged possum. I strongly believe that all incarcerated people should be held in humane conditions and given a chance to rehabilitate themselves. Alas, that’s far from the case. While Maxwell apparently doespilatesand plays with puppies, prisoners without the sort of connections she has are rotting away.This is particularly true of women in the US, who aredisproportionatelylocked up in jails rather than state prisons. According to a2024 reportby the Prison Policy Initiative, more than 60% of women in jails under local control haven’t been convicted of a crime yet and are awaiting trial. This, the Prison Policy Initiative posits, is because “incarcerated women, who have lower incomes than incarcerated men, have an even harder time affording money bail.” Local jails tend to offer fewer services and programs than prisons do and offer more limited communication options; it’s significantlymore expensiveto call people from jail than prison, for example.The lesson from all this? If you’re going to be a criminal, make sure you’ve got a lot of money and the right connections. Worst case scenario you end up in a plush correctional facility with unlimited toilet paper. Best case scenario, you end uppresidentof the US.South Carolina fails (for now) to advance the most restrictive abortion bill in the USThe state currently has a six-week abortion ban with limited exceptions for rape, incest and the mother’s health. That’s not enough forsome anti-abortion advocates, who recently advanced a bill that would repeal exceptions for the rape, incest and fetal anomalies and, asABC Newsput it, “make abortion a felony comparable to ‘the homicide of a person born alive’”. The bill, which was discussed on Tuesday, also contained language which might be used to ban hormonal birth control and limit in vitro fertilization. While thisparticular billhas now stalled, expect more efforts to criminalize abortion.Donald Trump told a female reporter: ‘Quiet, piggy’Trump didn’t justlash outat the Bloomberg reporter.The president also lashed outat another female journalist after she asked Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (sometimes nicknamedMohammed Bone Saw) about the brutal murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “These incidents are not isolated; they are part of an unmistakable pattern of hostility – often directed at women – that undermines the essential role of a free and independent press,” the Society of Professional Journalists said in astatementWednesday.

After promising “severe consequences” in August if Vladimir Putin continued to obstruct ceasefire talks – but then doing nothing as Putin did just that – Trump finally on 22 October imposed significantsanctionson Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, seriouslycompromisingPutin’s ability to finance his invasion. But now, with his28-point peace planfor Ukraine,draftedby US and Russian officials without Ukrainian or European participation, Trump has reverted to his pro-Putin norm.Trump’s plan would reward Putin for invadingUkrainewhile leaving Ukraine’s democracy in jeopardy. The plan’s ringing proclamation that “Ukraine’s sovereignty will be confirmed” rings hollow when so much of the plan compromises that sovereignty. A Kremlin dream, the plan would be a Ukrainian nightmare.Betraying his real-estate background, Trump continues to treat the Ukrainian conflict as a mere territorial dispute, as if handing Putin a chunk of Ukrainian land will satisfy the despot. But Putin’s war is not about controlling a charred swath of deindustrialized territory in eastern Ukraine. It is about Ukraine’s democracy – and Putin’sdesireto snuff it out so it no longer serves as an enticing model for the Russian people of the accountable government that Putin’s deepening dictatorship denies them.While freezing in place the divided Ukrainian provinces of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, Trump’s plan would force Ukraine to abandon all of Donetsk province. Beyond rewardingRussiawith territory that its forces have been unable to seize in more than a decade of fighting, this surrender would leave Ukrainian defenses perilously weakened.Donetsk is the location of Ukraine’s much-vaunted “fortress belt”, the entrenched defensive positions that are a key obstacle to Russian advances. Trump would have Ukraine abandon these defenses, leaving Putin a clear path to Kyiv should he later choose to resume the war.Then, in a move that would make renewed fighting easier for Russia, Trump would require Ukraine todiminishthe size of its armed forces from their current 800,000 to 850,000 troops to a maximum of 600,000. Trump’s plan places no such limits on Russian forces.In an apparent sop to Putin’s efforts to portray Ukraine’s democratically elected government as a bunch ofNazis, Trump’s planproclaims: “All Nazi ideology and activities must be rejected and prohibited.” As if to underscore the point, it insists that “Ukraine will hold elections in 100 days” of a ceasefire agreement. Trump imposes no requirement that Putin jeopardize his dictatorship by holding elections in Russia.To be sure, the plan makes Russia promise not to “invade neighboring countries” and to “enshrine in law its policy of non-aggression towards Europe and Ukraine”. But given that Putin has breached similar agreements in the past – the 1994Budapest memorandum, in which Russia promised to respect Ukraine’s borders in return for giving up its Soviet-era nuclear weapons, and the 2014-2015Minsk agreements, in which Russia promised a ceasefire and a return of occupied territory in eastern Ukraine to Kyiv – why should we trust Putin this time?That is why Ukraine has been so insistent on western security guarantees. The plan threatens a “decisive coordinated military response” should Russia resume its invasion, and provides that “Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees,” but the details range from fuzzy to troubling. The plan would not only deny Ukraine Nato membership but also preclude Nato members from stationing troops on Ukraine’s soil, precluding thereassurance force, presumptively led by Britain and France, on which Ukraine had been counting to prevent Putin from replenishing his diminished forces, rearming, and reinvading.Aseparate side agreementreportedly would provide Ukraine with a Nato-style security guarantee, in which any future “significant, deliberate, and sustained armed attack” by Russia on Ukraine “shall be regarded as an attack threatening the peace and security of the transatlantic community.” That suggests a military response. But unlike a strong Ukrainian military – Ukraine’s most reliable defense against renewed Russian aggression – the effectiveness of the side agreement would depend on the commitment of Nato leaders, including Trump, to respond militarily to Putin’s aggression, something they have not done to date for fear of a nuclear conflagration.To make a deterrent more credible, European leaders have long insisted on a USbackstopto any peacekeeping force in Ukraine, but for now that depends on the unreliable Trump. Moreover, despite the Nato-sounding language, Trump reportedly isofferingonly “intelligence and logistical assistance” or “other steps judged appropriate”, not direct military assistance. That will hardly leave Putin quaking in his boots.As if this embrace of Putin’s wishlist were not enough, Trump’s plans move toward lifting sanctions against Russia and readmitting it to the Group of 8, from which it wasexcludedwhen it forcibly seized Ukraine’s Crimea. The removal of sanctions would make it easier for Putin to rebuild his military for a possible next invasion.One insidiously dangerous part of the plan is the amnesty it promises Russian forces for their atrocities in Ukraine. Beyond the brazen criminality of Putin’s invasion – a clear act ofaggression– Russian forces have systematicallytargetedUkrainian civilians and civilian infrastructure – blatant war crimes. The international criminal court (ICC) has already charged four Russian militarycommandersforattackingUkraine’s electrical infrastructure. Putin himself, and his children’s rights commissioner, have beenchargedfor kidnapping Ukrainian children. If he has his way, Trump will sweep these and future charges under the rug.Fortunately, Trump has no such power over the ICC. The only way todeprivethe ICC of jurisdiction would be through repeated annual resolutions of the UN security council. Even assuming that the United States and Russia (along with Russia’s ally, China) would support such amnesties, Britain and France, as the other veto-wielding permanent members, would have to go along, year after year.Dangling such an amnesty is a virtual invitation to more atrocities. Trump’s offer suggests to Putin that, as ceasefire negotiations progress, he may as well continue committing atrocities because in the end, Trump will arrange to absolve him. The day after Trump’s plan became public, another Russian glide bombhitan apartment in southern Ukraine, killing five people and injuring 10, including a teenage girl.The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has understandably treated the plan as a “vision” rather than a final offer. Wary of offending Trump, who must approve continuingsalesof US arms to Ukraine, Zelenskyy said he wouldnegotiateon the basis of the plan. But to underwrite a lasting peace in Ukraine, Trump’s plan needs not a few Band-Aids but major surgery. Let’s hope that Trump hasn’t again fallen so much under Putin’s spell that he has lost the ability to see the major faults in his proposal.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.

After his 2024 victory,Donald Trumpclaimed he had an “unprecedented and powerful mandate”, that his “mandate” was “massive” and that his “Maga movement” was irresistible, the wave of the future. It lasted 10 months, in which he had betrayed his chief promise to lower inflation, turned the public against him on every issue and Republicans at last faced a battering by voters.Trump’s image of omnipotence has rested upon a pyramid of dread. His ability to maintain the servility of the Republican Congress, whose members are intimidated by the danger that if they defy him he would support primary opponents to run against them, has been the political foundation for all the other forms of fear he incites throughout American institutions. Trump could not have leveraged himself as “dictator on day one” without congressional abdication. TheRepublicansimmediately fell into lockstep. But within two weeks of the 4 November elections, only one Republican in the House voted against the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, which Trump had called a “hoax” before he felt compelled to bend in the cyclone to sign the bill – and yet still suppresses the files.The Republicans in Congress now have another fear that places them in a terrible tightening vise. They have allowed Trump to avoid accountability and in next year’s midterms – of which these elections are an augury – they will be held mercilessly to account in his stead. Trump is the cause for which they will suffer the effect. He will not be on the ballot. Only they will pay the butcher’s bill.Trump’s ‘affordability’ efforts are a mess of absurdity and magical thinking | Steven GreenhouseRead moreThe Republicans are helpless. Through their abject obedience to him they have permitted Trump to sever their organic connection to their voters. None dare venture any longer to town halls in their districts. They cower before their constituents’ wrath over Trump. He is more unpopular than any president of recent time, including himself after January 6, with the exception of George W Bush at the end of his presidency in the financial collapse. The colossus whoproclaims“I have the right to do anything I want to do, I’m the president” has reduced the Republicans to ciphers. They are not public servants, but his sycophants. Their lord, however, is not their protector. The closer they attach themselves to him, the more vulnerable they become. The voters repudiate Trump by rejecting Republicans.If the Republicans had paid more attention to his career, they would have observed that he always maneuvers to set up fall guys to take the rap. Trump has his Roy Cohns and his Michael Cohens. “He directed me to make the payment,” Cohentestifiedabout the hush money paid to Stormy Daniels in order to shut her up to affect the outcome of the 2016 election. Trump was ultimately convicted in 2024 of 34 felonies of business fraud in an election scheme. “Michael has great liability to me!” Trump tweeted. Cohen served two and a half years in prison for tax evasion, lying to a bank, and campaign finance violations for the payments to Daniels and Karen McDougal, a Playboy model with whom Trump had an affair. “The man doesn’t tell the truth,” said Cohen. “And it is sad that I should take responsibility for his dirty deeds.” Trump called Cohen, who testified in the trial, a “rat”, a Mafia term for an informant. “The more people that follow Mr Trump as I did blindly are going to suffer the same consequences that I’m suffering,” Cohentolda congressional committee in 2019. The Republicans collectively are now Michael Cohen.AMarist-NPRpoll on 19 November sent a shock wave. Democrats held a towering 14-point advantage. Then aMarquette Universitypoll rolled in later that day showing Democrats with an 11-point advantage among likely voters. In the 2018 midterms, a Democratic lead of around seven to eight points on the generic ballot translated into a gain of 40 seats. The latest numbers might project roughly 60 seats. The supposedly dead Democrats would easily carry a large majority. With those margins, they would also likely take the Senate.The much touted newly consolidated Trump electorate has vanished. Trump in office has built no mandate. His coalition has disintegratedIf that seems too breathless, consider what the recent 4 November elections portend. Republican turnout cratered; Democratic enthusiasm ran high. The polls, which were weighted on the basis of the 2024 results, were distorted in showing closer races than the final counts. In the New Jersey gubernatorial contest, in the highestvoter turnoutin an off-year election in two decades there, the Republican vote count declined 42% for the Republican candidate, Jack Ciattarelli, compared with Trump’s 2024 total. In the Virginia gubernatorial race, the Republican vote count dropped by nearly 45% compared with 2024, while the Democratic vote fell by only 22%.The final polls significantly underestimated the winning margins for the Democratic candidates, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey. Late polls had Spanberger leading by seven to 11 points, while others suggested a lead as narrow as 2.5 points or a virtual “dead heat”. In New Jersey, final polls had the race even closer. A RealClearPolling average showed Sherrill’s lead at approximately four to eight points, with some polls placing the race within a single point’s margin of error. Spanberger won by 15 points, Sherill by 13. The polls generally, in election after election, miscalculated the Democratic margin of victory by approximately five to nine percentage points compared with the actual results.All of Trump’s gains were swept away in every demographic group. In the two New Jerseycitieswith the greatest percentage of Hispanic voters, Union City and Perth Amboy, Sherill won by 69 points compared with Kamala Harris’ 17, and by 56 points compared with nine, respectively. Sherill won all 21 counties. The Democrats picked up enough state legislative seats, including in a district held by Republicans for more than three decades, to achieve a super-majority in the assembly.In Virginia, Spanberger outperformed Harris in more than 95% of Virginia’s counties and independent cities. The Democratsgainedmore than 16 points in small cities and 12 in rural areas. Before the election, Democrats held 51 seats and Republicans 48 in the house of delegates, with one vacancy. The Democrats won 13 seats and now have 64 delegates. Voter urgency to defeat Republicans was so persuasive that Jay Jones, the Democratic candidate for state attorney general, whose emails expressing his desire to shoot the Republican speaker of the house of delegates in the head were a central focus of the campaign, won by six points.Elections elsewhere demonstrated the same pattern. In Erie county, Pennsylvania, which Trump had narrowly won, the Democratic candidate for county executive beat the Republican by 25 points. For the first time since 2006, Democrats in Georgia won statewide nonfederal offices with two candidates gaining about 60% of the vote for seats on the Georgia public service commission. Little noticed, Democrats flipped two state senate seats in Mississippi, which broke the Republican super-majority.The claim that Trump’s 2024 election represented a fundamental realignment of American politics has swiftly turned into a mirage. He hadwonby a slender margin of 1.5 points, overwhelmingly on the issue of inflation, and dependent on winning the 7% of voters who decided in the last week for him by nine points, generally considered low-propensity voters. This time, many of them apparently either switched to vote for the Democrats or stayed home. The much touted newly consolidated Trump electorate has vanished. Trump in office has built no mandate. His coalition has disintegrated and been reduced to his base, which is beginning to splinter over continuing inflation, increases in premiums for Obamacare and the Epstein files.Projecting forward, accounting for the discrepancy between the polls and the results in 2025, conservatively giving the Democrats running for the Congress an additional five points to make up for it, and assuming similar party turnout, the outcome would be startling. If that formula is to be believed, Democrats would win more than 60 seats in the 2026 midterms and capture the Senate, too.The circumstances that produced the Democratic sweep in 2025 will not be replaced by election day next year with the dawning of Trump’s “Golden Age”. His economic damage through his draconian and chaotic tariffs, a major contributing factor to inflation and unemployment, the poisonous combination of stagflation, can hardly be unraveled quickly, even if the supreme court supports lower court rulings against his invocation of emergency authority as unlawful. The rest of Trump’s policies radically redistributing wealth and resources upward and immiserating the working and middle classes, which have had unanimous Republican support, will not be reversed. In 2026, the midterms will be fought on even more difficult ground for Republicans of an even lengthier period of economic decline.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In any case, they have mostly evaporated, as the 2025 results demonstrated. It is a further illusion about the past election that if Trump campaigns on the stump for Republicans it will benefit them. In fact, Trump’s vote in 2024 was for Trump, but even so the congressional Republicans actually performed better than Trump. Overall, Trump did better in 198 congressional districts and the GOP House candidates did better in 237. For districts with GOP incumbents, Trump did better in 29, but the House candidates did better in 191, according to calculations derived from theDownballot.Now Trump’s enveloping presence casts a shadow over Republicans which they cannot escape. His unpopularity is deep and settled. The more he appears next to them, the more intensely the larger public is galvanized against them, if they need the reminder that the Republicans and Trump are one and the same. The Republicans have trapped themselves, willingly so. He is their cement shoes.The key propulsive numbers for turnout in the 2026 election are to be found among those who strongly approve and disapprove of Trump. In the latestMarist Poll, 68% of Republicans strongly approve of Trump, while 81% of Democrats and 60% of independents strongly disapprove. Those numbers can get worse for Republicans. Polarization now works against them. The numbers are inexorable harbingers of 2026.Trump himself is an immutable factor. He is hardwired against flexibility and self-reform, which he believes is the core of his strength and appeal. He is certain that his intransigence is his greatest asset. If he never gives in, he will always win. His only road to victory is that everyone must fear him. He cannot admit a mistake. It would violate his canon of power. Any erosion of his followers’ subservience is taken as not only an unjustifiable attack on his authority, but on his very being.Trump perceives every challenge, no matter how sensible, as an existential threat. He prizes unstinting fealty above reason. He can respond in only one way. Refusing to acknowledge the repudiation of the 4 November elections, he explodes in rage and aggravates alienation.He must call Marjorie Taylor Greene for questioning him a “traitor”. He must shout at a Bloomberg News reporter for asking a question about the Epstein files: “Quiet, quiet, piggy!” He must label an ABC News correspondent who also asks a question about his suppression of the Epstein files “insubordinate”. He mustdeclarethat Democratic members of the Congress, all military and national security veterans, invoking the law that the armed forces and intelligence officials are obligated not to follow illegal orders, are “traitors” who should be “ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL” for “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”But in the midterm elections to come, however distant they may still seem, it is the Republicans in the Congress who will stand alone to receive the final verdict before the people for their cowardice in collaborating with Trump and as contemptible exemplars of all his collaborators.Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to the Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

The BBC is used to coming under pressure from political parties, well-funded pressure groups and powerful newspaper publishers. But thethreat of a lawsuitfrom the US president is unprecedented.This latest furore is dangerous because it comes at a time when democracy faces an information crisis. The foundations of informed democratic debate are under attack across the globe from a combination of AI-generated deepfakes, hostile state propaganda and algorithms that amplify divisions through social media. We have already seen how Elon Musk, the wealthiest man on the planet, is prepared to use his own social media platform, X,to interfere in the affairsof other countries and exert a chilling influence on democracies.The tech platforms through which most media and news content is distributed, discovered, consumed and shared – X, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Amazon Web Services and Prime Video, TikTok USA, YouTube and Google – are owned or controlled by six American billionaires who pursue self-interested agendas, aided by a litigious president intent on browbeating the media. In the US, the communications regulator has acted as an arm of the executive rather than defending free speech, and sycophantic media executives have caved in to politically motivatedlegal threats. Meanwhile, Trump has removedvirtually all fundingfrom public television andradio.0:53Donald Trump says he has 'obligation' to sue BBC in Fox News interview – videoIt could happen here. The BBC is our most effective defence against the dangers of global media power concentrated in the hands of a few private individuals, but we have very few obstacles to prevent a populist or authoritarian government from undermining it. This is a moment of peril that demands a new approach to governance and funding that secures the BBC’s future. We at theBritish Broadcasting Challengehave set out a number of proposals for achieving this.First, the government must grant theBBCa permanent charter that establishes it in perpetuity and enshrines its core principles of independence, public service and universality. To ensure proper accountability, an agreement with the culture secretary – renewable every 10 years – would set the parameters for BBC services and priorities in accordance with those core principles.Second, it should create a new BBC governance board whose members – crucially – should be appointed by an independent body, and be responsible for regulating the BBC’s editorial performance and setting its strategic direction. Its members would possess genuine areas of expertise, be truly representative of different regions of the UK, and would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and approval through the culture, media and sport select committee. This governance board would be separate from the BBC management board, which would be chaired by the director general, who would be responsible for day-to-day leadership and management.Third, the government must recommit to the fundamental principle of BBC universality. That means geographical universality, ensuring BBC services are free at the point of use throughout the UK, and universality of content, providing quality programmes across the board that reflect the lives of nations and regions throughout the country. The unifying nature of the BBC is more important than ever in an increasingly fragmented and polarised media world, particularly as premium content moves behind paywalls. The rich will always have the means to access quality news and content; the BBC guarantees that privilege as a right for everyone.It is therefore essential that the BBC continues to offer popular audience-pulling programmes, such as The Traitors, Match of the Day, Gavin and Stacey and natural history, alongside major national events, if it is to stay at the heart of public life. But it must also continue to offer content that the market does not deliver: programmes for minority and niche audiences, current affairs programmes in prime time, creative risks that promote the work of new talent in music, drama and the arts, and coverage of women’s and disabled sports.Fourth, the BBC must have a proper funding settlement that recognises the 30% cut in funding imposed over the past 15 years. At £3.35 a week, the licence fee is astonishing value for money, and the BBC still reaches95% of the adult populationeach month. But it also provides a guaranteed stream of investment in the UK creative economy, sustaining directly or indirectly more than 50,000 jobs, as well as giving young people the opportunity to learn transferable creative and technical skills.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In part this is because the pictures from Donald Trump’sstate dinner with Mohammed bin Salmanand his in-house hype men Cristiano Ronaldo and Gianni Infantino were everywhere, recycled feverishly across the internet, dusted with their own drool-stained commentary by the wider Ronaldo-verse.Mainly there were just so many jaw-droppers. Perhaps you liked the one of Trump and Ronaldo strolling the halls of power, Ronaldo dressed all in black and laughing uproariously, like a really happy ninja. Or the one of Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez standing either side of a weirdly beaming Trump at his desk, holding up some kind of large heraldic key as though they’ve just been presented with their own wind-up wooden sex-grandad.David Squires on … Fifa’s peace prize and Donald Trump’s eligibilityRead morePerhaps you preferred footage of the dinner itself where even the air in the room looks thick and smudged and strange, the kind of room where you look down and notice the chair you’re sitting on is made out of human fingernails. There was the bit where Trump is giving a speech about all the “unbelievable dignitaries”, impresario-style, like he’s cutting the ribbon on a shopping mall in Boca Raton. As you look closer it becomes clear his hair has now decisively evolved from its previous form as a kind of flat orange hat and has gone full 1980s newsreader bouffant, so thick with spray and chemicals it’s closer to a kind of gauze, hair you could stick your hand in and then never get it out, like flypaper.Maybe it’s the simple game of trying to work out what might have been on the menu given Ronaldo dines off swordfish, lettuce and a gallon of mineral water, whereas an average Trump dinner is two Filets-O-Fish covered in ketchup, 12 cans of Diet Coke and a wheelbarrow full of biscuits.My favourite bits are where Infantino keeps wandering into shot. There he is again, gurning at the back of Ronaldo’s post-dinner power-selfie, looking as ever like a vampire who does card tricks, but also seeming, at this ultimate level of weirdness, to be showing some slight sense of impostor syndrome.Albeit, in Infantino’s case this is not a syndrome. He is an actual impostor, out there pretending to be a disinterested administrator. And he is correct to feel this way, in so much as essence of human vanity compacted into a dinner jacket and taught to say the phrase “Today I feel like a hazelnut” can feel anything.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump meets Cristiano Ronaldo in the Oval Office. Gianni Infantino almost certainly just out of shot.Photograph: Daniel Torok/White HouseIt is worth being totally clear on what was happening here. This was, first of all, a state visit and a significant refresh of US-Saudi relations. But it was also a kind of executive benediction. First for Ronaldo, who hadn’t been photographed in the US since the leaking in 2017 of allegations of sexual assault, which he denies and have never been proven.Not being in the US has cost the Ronaldo brand millions. A final pension-pot World Cup is looming. With Trump in the White House and MBS at his back, it seems this is now a safe space. The quid pro quo is obvious. CR7 is huge among young men on the internet. He’s the most winningest World Cup mascot. He’s a tall handsome guy. This is where we are, why Trump is up at his dais saying the word “Roonnnallldoo” in those sensuous cooing tones, like he’s whispering into the ear of his favourite doughnut.The second returnee is MBS, overlord of the next World Cup-but-two. The crown prince was on his first visit to the US since being accused by its intelligence service of complicity inthe murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Herehe was casually exonerated by Trump(“He knew nothing about it”) in an aside to journalists.How do you get hold of one of these off-the-cuff pardons? By sheer coincidence, on Wednesday night Trump also got to announce that Saudi Arabia is investing $1tn in the US. But whatever the lines of cause and effect, here was a man previously accused of complicity in murder and a man previously accused of sexual assault being welcomed back by the most indicted president in US history. All of them talking about the power of love and peace. All of it glossed and legitimised by the presence at the table of football.And so here we have it, the ultimate in grotesque sporting spectacles. For Ronaldo, this represents a convincing nadir, confirmation of the moral emptiness of his entire schlocky persona. But Ronaldo is also a private individual who can come and go as he pleases. Football, Fifa, the World Cup. These things belong to us and they really shouldn’t be in this room.View image in fullscreenCristiano Ronaldo takes a selfie with Georgina Rodríguez (front left), Elon Musk (left) and Gianni Infantino (second left).Photograph: DavidSacks/X/ReutersThere is a sense of outrage fatigue about all this. Infantino is doing something awful again? No way dude. Maybe humans just prefer evil stuff on some level. It’s more cinematic. Like Satan in Paradise Lost, the world’s first unintended rock star, out there throwing TVs out the hotel window, the bad guy usually does steal the show.But it is still necessary to ramp up the anger thrusters again, because this is a level up. Here we have an all-time footballer, who doesn’t need more money, being paid hundreds of millions of dollars to play in Saudi Arabia and who is now a mascot to the travelling court.Extortionate tickets and matches moved at Trump’s whim: are you ready for the ‘greatest World Cup ever’? | Marina HydeRead moreFor all Ronaldo’s alpha-dog stylingthis is such invertebrate behaviour. I will perfect my physical form. I will rise to become the most famous human. All the better to polish the boots of power. None of this will dissuade any of Ronaldo’s online supplicants. This is the point. His influence is being entirely co-opted, the greatest one-man act of multiple regime-washing yet devised.It also matters because of next year’s World Cup.Infantino’s dog-like devotion to Trumpis not just a personal oddity, but a breach of his duty of care. Fifa is non-political. Fifa is an administrator, not a player on the stage. Fifa has no mandate to use football’s popularity to endorse a movement, to be present while globally significant arms sales and nuclear cooperation are agreed.The day before the Ronaldo buffet, Infantino sat nodding along whileTrump talked about moving World Cup gamesfrom cities run byhis political opponentsand threatened to bomb Fifa’s co-host Mexico. Trump is already shaping this global show as a projector screen for his own divisive politics and the power-play with fellow autocrats, to the extent it is fair to say the US World Cup is as bad as Qatar and Russia on a register of political cynicism. At least neither of those two ever pretended to be the world’s leading liberal democracy.There was an obvious emotional counterpoint this week in the glimpses of that other sporting world,Troy Parrottsaying: “That’s why we love football,”the joy of Scotland’s qualification, little shots of beauty that keep you coming. We don’t have to give up on the World Cup. But we can give up on the people who have weaponised it. And demand, wherever it is still possible, a great deal better than this.Explore more on these topicsCristiano RonaldoDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a huge opportunityThom Woodroofe and Dean BialekAustralia may not be hosting Cop31, but the unprecedented Turkey partnership is a real chance to secure global influence and turbocharge a new green zeitgeistSign up for climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s free Clear Air newsletter hereSat 22 Nov 2025 18.41 ESTLast modified on Sat 22 Nov 2025 18.42 ESTShareThe Cop30 climate conference hasfinally come to an end, with Australia having lost out on the grand prize of hosting next year’s gathering. But Australia’sformal partnership agreement with Turkeynevertheless provides an opportunity to secure unparalleled global influence and turbocharge our own transformation to a net zero, green export economy. Here are three ways to make it happen.First, Chris Bowen’s new role as Cop31 “president of negotiations” puts the climate and energy minister at the helm of the most complex and consequential multilateral process in the world.The process iseasily and often criticised as a triumph of incrementalism, but the negotiating texts are where the geopolitical rubber hits the road, capturing important statements of political will and a tapestry of international commitments that galvanise global consensus.End of fossil fuel era inches closer as Cop30 deal agreed after bitter standoffRead moreBowen’s new and somewhat unprecedented role makes him the curator and custodian of language capable of becoming the new zeitgeist guiding government and business action alike. A global goal to triple renewable energy and double energy efficiency are now benchmarks for the world’s efforts. One idea is for Bowen to consider proposing an electrification target to these objectives, bolstering efforts in an area that is currently lagging behind.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterSecond, and most central to the government’s narrative in recent weeks, is delivery on the much-vaunted “partnership with the Pacific”. Bowen has spoken of his motivation to ensure the Pacific’s voice is heard internationally and the region’s priorities reflected fully in next year’s deliberations – a high yardstick.In that vein, Bowen’s deal with Turkey secures a commitment to hold the annual pre-Cop gathering in the Pacific. While this is usually a relatively small affair for senior officials, Australia has projected a much higher aspiration for attendance by world leaders and ministers, hopefully with a core focus on a plan to make the Pacific the first 100% renewable energy region in the world, fully capitalise the Pacific Resilience Facility and innovate solutions to integrate oceans and climate conservation efforts.But a Pacific pre-Cop must also serve as a preparatory stepping stone, or rather an ambitious springboard, to set parameters and expectations for an ambitiousCop31.It is notable that in Belém, Australia at the last minute joined a number of Pacific islands, Latin Americans and a spattering of Europeans to promote a new declaration for the just transition away from fossil fuels, by far the strongest statement Australia has ever made on the issue.At one level, the statement simply reflects the reality that we need to achieve deep, rapid and sustained reductions in global emissions to reach net zero emissions by 2050 or earlier if we are to achieve the goals of the Paris agreement (once again highlighting the inconsistency embedded in the Coalition’s new policy position). Broader efforts to secure a more formal and universal timeline and trajectory for transitioning away from fossil fuels ultimately failed in Belém, but these calls will only get louder. We need to grapple now with our addiction, and quickly decarbonise not just our national electricity market, but our trade balance sheet as well.Third, while Bowen’s role will not formally kick off until Cop31 opens next November, in reality it begins next week. Friday’s detailed agreement with Turkey commits him to conduct an extensive process of consultations, preparations, and communications to shape the contours and build momentum for the negotiated outcomes in Antalya.But this is not just about negotiated outcomes. There will be new and unprecedented high-level contacts, networks, platforms and other opportunities for him to highlight Australia’s climate leadership and energy transition in partnership with a number of thematic “champions” we will jointly appoint, and this will help us take our national efforts to the next level.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And we should look to leverage every visit by a world leader to Australia next year to secure a series of big, juicy climate or green industry-related investment to help inject real world momentum and energy into the negotiating process Bowen now oversees.Through that lens, and in parallel to Cop31 diplomatic preparations, Australia should be thinking about what it can do to bring the “world’s largest green trade fair” component of a Cop to Adelaide, the previous candidate for an Australian Cop31. This will require some creativity, but it is exactly the kind of launching pad we need to attract international interest, technology, and investment to fully harness our new Future Made in Australia green industrial policy. An event like this is unlikely to cost us a dime, but instead deliver a substantial return on investment through new economic opportunities, jobs and exports.Diplomacy rarely produces black and white outcomes. There is no sugar coating the fact that, based on the overwhelming support for our bid, and the depth of the government’s policy preparations, Australia deserved a chance to host Cop31 in partnership with the Pacific. But we are where we are. The most important thing now is to ensure that our Cop31 role delivers tangibly for the Australian people, our companies and the Pacific.Thom Woodroofe is a senior international fellow with the Smart Energy Council and a former climate diplomatDean Bialek is a former diplomat and international lawyer with 15 years of Cop experienceExplore more on these topicsCop31OpinionClimate crisisChris BowenAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s distracting us from addressing the issues that would improve livesSat 22 Nov 2025 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 22 Nov 2025 20.31 ESTShareThe Liberal-National Coalition, a political “party” that has almost no chance of assuming office before the 2030s, is being allowed to set the Australian political agenda.From a short-term tactical perspective, you can see why this may be attractive to the government.Let them squabble.If the attention is on the opposition, there is less focus on what those with their hands on the levers of power are actually doing.Staring down the barrel of three leadership changes in two weeks, are the Liberals near rock bottom? | Tom McIlroyRead moreBut like all tactical measures it only works in the short term.Ever since the National partyupset the tentative consensus– that it was past time that First Peoples had meaningful and permanent recognition in Australia – the Coalition’s tail has been wagging the dog. One Nation, once the home of reactionary, racially framed views, is nowgathering supporters as its ideas enter the mainstream.David Littleproud clearly likes the power of agenda-setting as leader of the Nationals. It is decades since his party played such a pivotal role.For weeks, too much time and attention has been devoted to the resolution of policy issues that have beset the Coalition for decades –net zero emissionsandmigration numbers. Promises that by any reasonable assessment they will not be able to make good on and, if they did, would probably cause economic and social chaos.Allowing the opposition to set the national agenda has provoked an absurd situation that is debasing national politics, stymying important decisions and distracting us from the issues that really need to be addressed to improve lives and opportunities – in health, education, the care sector, inequality, social cohesion, climate change and innovation.Maybe in an unhinged world this is what happens – any sense of proportion is lost and yet another rabbit hole beckons us tocome on in and have a look around.Incrementalism will do, even if that produces a vicious cycle of cynical disengagementWhen in the burrow the big questions grow dim. Everyone wants cheaper energy but saying that repeatedly won’t make it happen. Infrastructure is under pressure but cutting migration numbers won’t magic that away.These structural issues are decades in the making, and for too long Australia has cruised: one of the richest countries in the world, with the strategic benefit of being a continent, a population less than some cities and relatively robust institutions.But it is one where – as Sean Kelly points out in his Quarterly Essay The Good Fight: What Does Labor Stand For? – political leaders have stopped trying to define their ambitions and even an expansive sense of the nation, partly because of the fear of failure.Incrementalism will do, even if that produces a vicious cycle of cynical disengagement. “This means you can’t attempt large things, because they might fail and provoke more cynicism,” Kelly writes. “So you do small things that seem more likely to succeed. But because they are so small nobody notices them – which only breeds more cynicism about the effectiveness of government.”The emerging “debate” about immigration is a cruel example. Australian politicians love to boast that the country is the “greatest multicultural nation in the world”. Saying it repeatedly doesn’t make it true.The turnaround from the nation that was proudly founded on an exclusionary migration policy is remarkable. The fact that millions of people have come from elsewhere and made happy and successful lives in Australia is something to be proud of. But the shadow of the old approach lingers in the national DNA, and things are now being said in the public debate that would have been unacceptable just a few years ago. Many of those who have come to this country from elsewhere – about a third of the population – still feel that their place here is “conditional”. After all, if they maintain two passports, as many choose to do, they can’t stand for election to the federal parliament.The division exposed by the March for Australia was a test for our politicians. They failed it – and put the nation last | Zoe DanielRead moreOver the past month I have spoken at public events about the idea of Australia. At every one, people have said how threatened they felt by the shadowyMarch for Australiaand the increasingly frequentneo-Nazi rallies. Some spoke about how, as visibly non-Anglo people, they felt their contribution, wellbeing and safety was threatened. How the talk about multicultural success felt performative. How any bamboozlingdiscussion of migration using big numbers missed the point that real people’s lives are at stake. How without an immigrant workforce whole sectors of the economy would collapse.When Pauline Hanson was disendorsed from standing as a Liberal party candidate in Oxley in 1996 forexpressing racist viewsthat the party at the time deemed unacceptable, no one anticipated that three decades on she would be heading a party that behaves like a sheepdog rounding up a flock.Now she draws cover from the cruel actions ofher dining companion at Mar-a-Lagoand once again another prime minister steps cautiously around the issue.If only it were as easy as saying, as Amyl and the Sniffers frontwomanAmy Taylor did as she accepted the Aria award for album of the year, “As the new prime minister of Australia, I’d like to say: all immigrants welcome.”Instead, as Kelly writes, the prime minister we actually elected “avoids conflict, postpones it indefinitely. As long as he does so, he inevitably helps those who benefit from things hewing close to their current condition.”That’s the danger of allowing a political party that polls show is now unelectable set the agenda. Labor might become the natural party of government but have little to show for it.Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAustralian politicsOpinionNational partyLiberal partyPauline HansonOne NationGreenhouse gas emissionsAustralian immigration and asylumcommentShareReuse this content"

It was the sense of palpitating trepidation felt when opening your school lunchbox, knowing that what lay within was going to be seen as “weird” in comparison with the sliced-white-bread-plastic-ham sandwiches, cheesy Wotsits and Club biscuits everyone else was gobbling.What’s that?” your classmate would ask, their nose wrinkling as they took in yesterday’s veggie curry, crumbling homemade falafel or – my mother’s speciality – a “deconstructed sandwich” of doorstop-thick fresh bread, filling of some kind (often cucumber) and attendant crumbs floating freely in the bag. (Why bother assembling at all?, my father asked once, when you could simply throw in all the elements and shake?)Now, though, it’s 2025, and the weird-lunchbox kids, but more importantly their parents, have been vindicatedby continuing revelations about the dire health outcomes ofeating ultra-processed foods(UPFs). Most recently, diets with high levels of UPFhave been linked toharm in every major organin the human body, not to mention a range of health conditions. News to some but not my mother, a pioneer of healthy eating and cooking from scratch, an early adopter of quinoa and reader of food-packet ingredients. This was the age ofCheestringsandMicro Chips– I still know the jingle for the latter by heart – yet my mother doggedly resisted. At best, her insistence that such food was unhealthy fell on deaf ears, and at worst, was rudely mocked, not least by me. I knewwhat an E-number wasbefore I knew my times tables. If an unrefined carb existed, my mother knew about it.These days,people talk about UPFsin general conversation. Books and social media accounts devoted to eliminating them from your diet have hundreds of thousands of followers. It must be a strange feeling for my mother, after being ignored – and even actively fought – on the topic for so long. I’ve written before about having tohide Super Noodles packetsin the same way my friends hid packs of 10 cigarettes, a line that still makes her laugh uproariously. We once had a row about a packet of Pom-Bear crisps. There were times where all I wanted to do was eat like other children, and that battle played out on a weekly basis in our house. Mine can’t be the only weird-lunchbox mum who is left with an abiding feeling of “I told you so”. And I can’t be the only weird-lunchbox kid who, after decades of pushback, is left with a feeling of … what’s that – guilt? Or, perhaps even stranger, could it be gratitude?6:52How we created ultra-processed food from industrial waste – videoI’m a mother myself, now, and I mostlycook from scratch, as does my husband. Ready meals are a rarity in our house. Now I’m the one standing in the supermarket aisle, reading long lists of ingredients on the back of packets. Like my own mother, I try to do a roast most Sundays and, while I have occasionally resorted to gravy granules, I mostly make my own from meat juices, as she taught me, and as her mother taught her. I say this not to boast, but to highlight the benefits of education around food and cooking. Those skills have made such a difference to my ability to feed myself and my family in a healthy way. I feel I owe my mum a great deal of thanks for that.Too much discussion of UPFs is divorced from issues of class and economics, and feels shaming, particularly of women. Cooking from scratch doesn’t make me better than someone who can’t. It only means that I was taught how to do so, and have the resources to. I am fortunate enough to be able to buy the sausages from the butcher that have fewer additives. In the 90s, my mum, who was feeding us on a shoestring budget, used to have to go to the health food shop, or would drive out of her way to the supermarket that sold the cheapest cuts of meat. Not everyone has enough time to do that, or to cook from scratch,especially in 2025 when we are working longer hours than ever.In some ways, it is easier than ever to eat healthily, in thatalternatives to UPFsare more widely and readily available. That’s a positive outcome of this debate’s prominence, though the cost of living remains a huge barrier. What I like less is when the moral burden is placed on individuals, usually poor ones, as opposed to the retailers and corporations profiting from the sale of UPFs. Years before this conversation reached the mainstream,my mum would insistthat the problem was systemic, and requires systemic solutions. She’s also never gone full Gwyneth Paltrow: I’m pretty sure she’d still rather consume cheese from a can thansmoke crack cocaine.And look, I’m not going to say sorry to her for being 13 and wanting to eat a packet of Pom-Bears. Sometimes, I just don’t want to hear it, especially as everyone else is banging on about junk food now as well. We still don’t see eye to eye on Super Noodles, though I’ve graduated to proper packet ramen.A recent studylinked instant noodles to serioushealth conditionsdue to their high levels of salt, so in that sense my mum has always been right. In another, they’re just so delicious I can’t help myself.

The problem is, it doesn’t even work in DenmarkCas MuddeThis week’s local elections are the latest reminder that when social democrats move rightwards, they’re making a mistakeCas Mudde is the author of The Far Right TodaySat 22 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 22 Nov 2025 08.34 ESTShareAfter more than 100 years, Copenhagenno longer has a Social Democrat mayor. Sisse Marie Welling, the new lord mayor, represents neither the mainstream right nor the far right but the Green Left (Socialistisk Folkeparti, known as SF). This should be a major wake-up call for centre-left parties across Europe. After more than a decade taking the wrong lessons from Denmark, it is finally time to learn theright lesson: copying the far right not only fails to turn on far-right voters, it also turnsoffprogressive voters.The 21st century has so far seen two simultaneous electoral developments in western Europe: the decline of social-democratic parties and the rise of far-right parties. This has created thepowerful narrativethat social democrats are losing votes to the far right, in particular because of their (alleged) “pro-immigration” positions. And although research shows that theirvoters mainly movedto centre-right and green parties, social-democratic parties have been chasing this mythical “left behind” voter ever since.Research by social scientistsoverwhelmingly showsthat adopting far-right positions leads neither to electoral success for centrist parties nor to electoral defeat for far-right parties. But this has not stopped centre-left advisers, politicians and strategists. Whenever my colleagues and I refer to this research, someone will point to the alleged success of the “Danish model”. The lure is so great that even as polls werepredicting the lossof Copenhagen, Britain’s Labour government ignoredinternal oppositionand introduced a number of policiesdesigned to emulateDenmark’s extremely stringent asylum rules.To be clear, the Danish model has never worked. Although the nativist turnpredatesthe current Social Democrat party leader, Mette Frederiksen made it her signature policy, not just asprime ministerof Denmark but also during theDanish presidencyof the EU. Her victory in 2019’s general election did not represent a great electoral surge: the party lost 0.4% of the vote but, because of specific bloc politics, regained the premiership. In 2022, her party did make small electoral gains (1.6%) but only remained in office by governing with the mainstream right. Currently, the party pollsjust above 20%, and is expected to reach a historic low result in next year’s legislative election.At the same time, the far right has not been defeated. The main far-right party, the Danish People’s party (DPP), which was already on adownward trendbefore the ascent of Frederiksen, saw a modest comeback in this week’s local elections. At the same time, new far-right parties, such as the New Right (NB) and the Denmark Democrats (DD) have emerged. Today, the DPP and DD togetherpoll closeto the record high of the DPP in 2015.Other social democrats should learn the right lessons this time. Opportunistic and often half-hearted anti-immigrant policies will not win over far-right voters. Moreover, their nativist turnwillpush away progressive voters, particularly younger ones, who want a party that is socioeconomically and socioculturally leftwing. This is particularly visible in Britain, where Keir Starmer’s desperate attempts to win over Reform UK voters is failing miserably, asLabour haemorrhages supportto the Greens and Lib Dems.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rather than cherish these cities and voters, the centre left has taken them for granted; even worse – again copying the far right – some of their politicians have insulted them, for instance as “woke warriors”.This has led to the rise of green and new-left parties, such as SF and Unity List in Copenhagen, and even a return of reformed communists, as in Austria’s second city,Graz. What sets these progressive competitors apart from the Social Democrats is not just their more outspoken leftwing agendas, but also theage of their electorate. Whereas social-democratic parties have some of theoldest electoratesand their membership is often literally dying off, their left competitors are particularly popular among young voters, including many with a minority background.In short, social-democratic parties should stop chasing after far-right voters. This strategy is not just unsuccessful in the short run; by failing to win over these voters, it leads to the loss of progressive voters and prevents the rejuvenation of their ageing electorate in the future. To remain relevant, they must promote an outspokenprogressive agenda, both in terms of cultural and economic issues. If they don’t, they will lose their last remaining political strongholds and their potential future electorate. That is the real lesson from the failed Danish model.Cas Mudde is the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, and author of The Far Right TodayDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Seven-year-old John Morris showed up with 20: a case of his beloved X-Men action figures. He got the part.Playing Andy, a young boy whose toys include cowboy Woody and spaceman Buzz Lightyear, his was the first voice ever heard in a feature-length Pixar animation. Toy Story wasreleased 30 years agoon Saturday, but to Morris the memory of its premiere is as fresh as ever.Best of Pixar: our writers’ favourite movies from Toy Story to Turning RedRead more“I still have goosebumps thinking about it because it started and then there’s Andy, and everyone turned to look at me and I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, here we go,’” the41-year-old voice actorsays by phone from San Francisco. “I couldn’t believe what we were watching because it was groundbreaking. I grew up watching animation – Disney on VHS with my younger sibling – and it looked and felt new and different.”Toy Story was one of the most influential films in modern cinema. Directed byJohn Lasseterand produced by Pixar with release through Disney, it was the first fully computer-animated feature film, leading studios worldwide to pivot away from hand-drawn animation.The story features toys who spring to life when humans are not looking, notably Woody (Tom Hanks), a pull-string cowboy doll, and Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a flashy new space-ranger who threatens Woody’s status as Andy’s favourite. Their rivalry turns into friendship as they try to reunite with their owner after getting lost in the wider world.The premise grew out ofTin Toy (1988), a five-minute short film that won a first Oscar for Pixar in the days when it was part of a hardware company run by Apple’s Steve Jobs. Disney approached Pixar to produce a computer-animated feature film told from a small toy’s perspective.The initial story followed the relationship between Tinny, the wind-up one-man band toy from Tin Toy, and aventriloquist’s dummynamed Dummy. Christine Freeman, who is Pixar’s founding historian, says:“The idea was of a buddy film, which hadn’t been done in animation before, and so they had these two characters and it was interesting but it wasn’t landing.“We were lucky that we got good feedback from the folks at Walt Disney. They said, we don’t believe that this tin toy is going to be an eight-year-old’s favourite toy and also that other guy? He’s really mean. One of the amazing animators and creatives who worked on Toy Story was a guy namedBud Luckey. He said, could this ventriloquist’s dummy be a cowboy? That is how Woody was born out of this Dummy character.”Tinny would evolve into Buzz Lightyear, but even then the path zigged and zagged before reaching its original destination. Asked about the 30th anniversaryduring a recent episodeof The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on CBS, Hanks replied: “Actually, it was more than 30 years, because Tim Allen and I and everybody involved in it, we recorded a Toy Story movie, for about 80 minutes of it, that was completely thrown out. We had the animatics, the whole bit.“The people who were running the studio – not Pixar, Pixar people are great – the people running the studio said, ‘Look, it’s a cartoon. Let’s make them wisecrack-y. Let’s let them improv and insult each other and come up with goofy things,’ which we sort of did for a while. And they showed it, and quite frankly, it didn’t work. It wasn’tToy Story. It wasn’t what Pixar was going for.”Hanks, 69, added: “John [Lasseter] called up and he said, ‘We looked at it and it’s just not working, and we would like to start all over from scratch.’ We had been working on the movie for about two years. So then we began the process all over again, which is about a two and a half to three year process, which is why on the credits on the Toy Story movies, they always say Production Babies.”The stakes were high forPixarto take its time and get it right. The company had been through various iterations as a hardware company, software company and producer of TV commercials but was struggling to make ends meet.David A Price, author ofThe Pixar Touch: The Making of a Company, says from Richmond, Virginia: “If Toy Story hadn’t been a success, Pixar, I’m quite certain, wouldn’t have been able to continue for long as a company.“First of all, Pixar was in very tight, dire financial circumstances in 1995 when the movie came out. Steve Jobs had been putting money into the company for 10 years at this point, $50m cumulatively over the years. When they needed to make payroll, as often as not the top executives would be coming to Steve Jobs hat in hand, asking them to write their cheque. Without Toy Story, there wasn’t an obvious way forward for the company as a going concern.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Snap/Rex FeaturesSecondly, it was a make-or-break moment for the new medium. Price adds: “It was necessary for Toy Story to be a success simply to legitimise computer animation. It’s hard to appreciate now but, at that time, computer animation was more of a novelty than anything.“It was a real question whether computer graphics would turn out to be acceptable to mass audiences and if Toy Story had been a flop, then certainly the people who fund movies would have very likely stayed away from it as a medium. On the other hand, because Pixar was successful, it did spur tremendous interest in computer animation and a golden age of computer animated movies.”Toy Story’s animators had the key insight of grounding the film in a recognisable world that audiences could relate to, with virtual cameras that behaved like real ones. The winning formula also included a witty screenplay, perfectly cast actors and Randy Newman’s song You’ve Got a Friend in Me.Asked about Toy Story’s success, Price reflects: “The easy answer is, well, it’s all nostalgia. Parents 30 years ago when they were young watched the movie and now they’re bringing their kids into it. But it’s much more than that. In my opinion, the classic elements of movie greatness are part of the story.“Not only did they fuse new technology with old elements but it was rooted in a sub-genre that was popular at the time – or had recently been popular – and that is the buddy comedy. In the 80s, you had 48 Hours,Lethal Weapon, movies like that where very different characters start out not liking each other, circumstances force them to work together, they grow to respect each other. Toy Story was intentionally written very much in that mould. This made it more appealing then and now.”Beyond that, he argues, Toy Story works on different levels for both children and parents. “Friendship is something that’s very important to children and friendship is a central element in the story, something that the children respond to. But then for parents it’s a powerful portrayal of status anxiety. On one level you have the children’s problems, on the other level of the movie you have adult problems being addressed and so it’s a movie that brings the generations together in a powerful way.”I prepared for the role by playing in my room, essentially, and using my imagination and my creativityJohn MorrisThe part of Andy came naturally to Morris, who grew up creating imaginary worlds viaX-Men action figures, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Lego and Sylvanian Families. He recalls: “I guess my Woody equivalent would be this bear that I still have called Sunny Bear. That was my first favourite object and then I did have that experience during the holidays of getting new toys and the excitement around that, similar to Buzz.”When he was six, Morris took an acting class calledKids on Camerain San Francisco and landed an agent. He started work as a child actor, appearing in commercials. Toy Story was his first voiceover audition.“I was very small, very young, and they asked us to bring our favorite toy to the audition and I brought all my X-Men action figures in a case. My mom was even like, ‘I think this is too many toys’. I was like, ‘No, I have to bring them all. I can’t just bring Storm. I have to bring Professor X and Wolverine and all the rest of them.’“I started playing with them and creating the voices and then later, of course, that’s how we see Andy play. I prepared for the role by playing in my room, essentially, and using my imagination and my creativity.”That was invaluable for recording the role of Andy without the kind of prompts that a stage actor or live action actor might expect. “They give you what they can in terms of storyboards and character drawings and renderings and little sculpts and such, but you have to use your imagination. That’s key to voiceover.“I teach voiceover now and that’s something I talk about a lot: flood your imagination with imagery because that’s what you have to draw from, especially when you just have a script in front of you in black and white. But I remember the first time seeing Andy early in the process and thinking, oh, he looks really nice and warm and then that did help me: OK, I’m going to try to bring a warmth to his voice.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Walt Disney/Pixar/AllstarMorris fitted production around school, slipping away for solo recording sessions that did not involve other cast members. “I couldn’t talk about it while I was working on it. It can be hard for a kid to keep a secret like that. I would leave mysteriously, I guess like kids leave for doctor’s appointments or whatever.“I said I was working on a project, working on a movie, but I didn’t say what it was. But then when it came out there was a lot of excitement and some disbelief. Even to this day, people are like, ‘You’re kidding?’ I’m like, ‘No, I’m not kidding.’ Or people are like, ‘Is it true?’ ‘Yeah, it’s true.’”It was a children’s film that somehow captivated adults and a machine generated artefact that somehow was as big-hearted as a Dickens novel. Made for roughly $30m, itgrossed $401m worldwide, becoming one of the biggest hits of 1995. Morris, who was 11 at the time of its release, was as astonished as anyone by its success.How does he explain it? “At the heart of it is friendship and the ‘You’ve got a friend in me’ notion and the fact that the toys to Andy, and then later to Bonnie, are like friends. They’re almost human in the way that they are and the way that we relate to them. They’re so relatable and lovable.“It was the first computer generated animated film so it has a place in film history, too. I have to say I’ve never met someone who doesn’t like Toy Story and hasn’t seen it. Everyone’s seen it and everyone loves it. I’m so honoured to be part of it, so grateful. I got to bring Andy to life: I mean, how incredible!”’Morris returned in 1999 forToy Story 2and in 2010 forToy Story 3, which climaxes with a college-bound Andy donating his toys to a girl called Bonnie; Woody watches Andy leave and says softly, “So long … partner,” a scene about the bittersweet passage of time that reduced many a grown parent to a blubbering wreck.Toy Story 4appeared in 2019 andToy Story 5is due for release next June. Morris would be happy to return to the franchise some day. “I hear from a lot of fans that they’re curious about Andy. What did he focus on in college? Does he have kids? Is he married? I’m like, well, what do you think? It’s open.“As we know, the story can go in any number of directions. A lot of fans tell me that would bring the whole thing full circle if Andy was an adult and he has kids; maybe he has Andy Jr and maybe Bonnie babysits them and maybe some of the toys are missing and Andy is a little surprised by that. I of course would love to come back and voice Andy as an adult.That would be like a full circle moment for me too.”Explore more on these topicsToy StoryPixarAnimation in filmWalt Disney CompanyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My Struggle had become a runaway success in Norway – a success that would subsequently be repeated across the world – but the project provoked anger in some quarters for its portrayal of friends and family members. This was a work of art that came at a price. Hence, for its creator, its Faustian aspect.That experience lies at the root of Knausgård’s latest novel, The School of Night, the fourth volume in his Morning Star sequence, in which his typical character studies and fine-grained attention to the minutiae of daily life are married to a compelling supernatural plot involving a mysterious star appearing in the sky and the dead returning to life. Volumes one and three, The Morning Star and The Third Realm, cycled between the same group of interconnected characters, while the second book, The Wolves of Eternity, moved back to the 1980s and told the story of a young Norwegian man and his discovery of a Russian half-sister. Only towards the end of its 800 pages did the novel intersect with the events of The Morning Star. The School of Night, perhaps frustratingly for some, again moves backwards instead of forwards, this time to 1985 London, and follows the art school career of a young Norwegian, Kristian Hadeland, who is pursuing his dream of fame as a photographer. Kristian, events reveal, is someone who will sacrifice anything, and anyone, to succeed. Charting Kristian’s rise and fall is an addictive and eerie reading experience.Imeet Knausgård on a perfect autumn day in Deptford, south-east London, the water gulping below us against the river wall. This is the neighbourhood where much of The School of Night takes place. Had he known, since moving to the city nearly a decade ago, he would one day write a London novel? “I think I did,” he says. “I was never here in the 80s but growing up I read NME, Sounds, I listened only to British music – some American bands, but it was all Britain, really. And then it was football. Every Saturday, British football. So I grew up as a proper anglophile, you know.” And in his 20s, he lived for a few months with a Norwegian friend in Norwich. “It was like the most uncool place in Britain,” he says, laughing. “But it was still very cool to me.”View image in fullscreenKnausgaard with his brother, Yngve.Photograph: Courtesy of Karl Ove KnausgårdIn 2018 Knausgård moved from Sweden to London to be with his fiance, now third wife, who had previously been his editor. They have a son, and Knausgård’s four children from his previous marriage divide their time between him and his ex-wife. He says life in London is much the same as it was in Sweden: “It’s the writer’s life. So I’m in the house writing and I’ve got my family – my kids and my wife. But then you have London outside.” When he isn’t writing he enjoys record shopping in Rough Trade, going to concerts, watching football matches. “I do really love it here,” he says.Knausgård wanted to have Kristian live in Deptford because of the area’s association with one of the most prominent authors of the Faust legend, the Elizabethan playwright Christopher Marlowe. He came to Marlowe via a Borges essay that described “the blasphemy, the murder, the way he was killed, the ruthlessness, the wildness, and I hadn’t heard about him [before]. I was instantly incredibly interested in him.” The School of Night takes its name from an association of supposedly atheist late 16th-century writers and scientists which included, alongside Marlowe, George Chapman, translator of Homer, and Sir Walter Raleigh. The idea of the School of Night as an actual clandestine group was advanced by the Shakespeare scholar Arthur Acheson in the early years of the 20th century, but the truth is cloaked in mystery. This is entirely appropriate for Knausgård’s novel, which is full of strange events and shadowy figures with obscure motives.Marlowe’s version wasn’t Knausgård’s first encounter with the Faust legend, though. That was Thomas Mann’s 1947 novel Doctor Faustus, which sets the story in Wilhelmian – and latterly Nazi – Germany. “I think I was 19 or 20, and I still remember one of the first scenes where Zeitblom [the book’s narrator] and Leverkühn are with Leverkühn’s father, and he shows them natural wonders, things not alive that behave like they’re alive; it has been important for me ever since I read it, that kind of crossroad between life and non-life, and art in between them.” I look up the passage after we speak and sure enough, its blend of concrete detail and philosophical musing is distinctly Knausgårdian.He says he doesn’t really do research. In the case of a meticulously detailed episode in which Kristian repeatedly boils and attempts to skin a dead cat for a photography project, this comes as something of a relief. Instead he writes with what sounds like incredible freedom. He has often said that he finds out where a story is heading as he writes, and it was the same for The School of Night. “When I started to write, Kristian was just a normal guy, there wasn’t anything unpleasant with him.” Only when he wrote the section in which Kristian visits his family did he realise this was a character completely lacking in empathy. “That’s always the way I do it,” he says. “I just write and then something happens and then you get consequences.”View image in fullscreen‘If you take one step back, and see life that way, then everything is meaningless – and then you go one step in, and it’s brimmed with meaning.’Photograph: Kate Peters/The GuardianTaking the form of a long suicide note written by Kristian after he has plummeted from the heights of worldwide artistic success, the novel is soaked in death, veined with examples of life’s ephemerality. Holed up in a cabin on a remote Norwegian island, Kristian reflects that “death was the rule, life the exception”. Looking around a train carriage in London, he thinks, “in a hundred years, everyone in it would be dead”. Home for Christmas, he compares our lives to the snow falling outside his window:Humans descended like snow through the ages. There were billions of us, we danced this way and that until our flight was abruptly over and we settled on the ground. What happened then? Billions more came falling, descending to smother us. I was one such snowflake, and I was still falling …and those whose descent would soon begin, the enormous blizzard of the as-yet unborn, all waiting to descend, would completely smother not only us, but every sign of our lives, which thereby would become less than meaningless, would become nothing, zilch, nada. They would become snow in snow, darkness in darkness. And so would we.I ask Knausgård if he feels art is a way of battling against this, of leaving a mark against the darkness. “No,” he says after a period of silence (he often pauses like this, thinking for as long as required before answering). “No, that’s not important at all. It’s more the perspective. If you take one step back and see life that way then everything is meaningless, you know? And then you go one step in, and it’s completely full: brimmed with meaning. And that is, I think, almost like how it is to write a book, really, when you go into something and it’s very much about the present, being in the moment, and it’s incredibly meaningful.”It’s from my own experience. Huge ambitions and belief, completely crushed. Then up and try againThis speaks directly to the methods Knausgård employs, a distinctive synthesis of the epic – multi-volume cycles of novels, few of which clock in under 500 pages – and the intimate, stuffed as they are with the minutiae of changing nappies, making coffee, getting drunk, snogging, and the ideal consistency of cornflakes. Here is another divergence between Knausgård and Kristian, who at one point sneers at his mother, “I can’t believe you’re actually talking about the weather”. Sticking up for herself, and for Knausgård’s project, she replies, “Life is in the everyday, Kristian.”Kristian’s everyday, at least in the novel’s early stretches, is mostly about failing. The School of Night is extremely good on the difficulty of finding one’s way creatively – that sense, artistically speaking, of falling short but maintaining the belief required to keep going. It’s territory Knausgård explored at length in Some Rain Must Fall, the fifth volume of My Struggle, which describes his time as a creative writing student in Bergen. “Yeah,” he says, “that is basically taken straight from my experience with trying to be a writer. All those kind of huge ambitions, and belief that gets completely crushed, and then,” he laughs, “up again and try again, you know.”Knausgård lived on the island of Tromøy in southern Norway until he was 13, when the family moved to the city of Kristiansand. His mother was a nurse and his father a schoolteacher. His troubled relationship with his father, who latterly became an alcoholic and a virtual shut-in, is vividly and painfully described in My Struggle. Knausgård originally went to university in Bergen with the idea of being a poet, but, as he describes in Some Rain Must Fall, he was hopelessly bad. “You understand nothing about yourself and you have no idea what you’re doing,” a classmate tells him. Kristian’s early work is also repeatedly written off – by his sister, his artist friend Hans, and a visiting tutor at his art school.That apprentice phase is so painful, Knausgård says now, because you have no idea whether or not it will ever change. “Because there’s so much you don’t know when you’re at that age and when you want to do something, and what there is to know is only accessible through experience, you know? You don’t know that you have to fail, because it’s so painful to fail at that stage, but it is the only way. But you never know if you’re continually going to fail. There’s no guarantee for anything.”In some ways Kristian gave Knausgård the opportunity to experiment with a shadow self. When the first volume of My Struggle was published in 2009, giving an explicit account of the squalor into which Knausgård’s father and grandmother descended in their final years, his father’s family threatened a lawsuit. Others also complained about their portrayal, which made Knausgård alter his approach in later volumes. Kristian, on the other hand, barely contemplates others’ feelings, or the ethics of his artistic decisions.There are some elements of myself that I magnified and put in Kristian. That was not fun at allKnausgård admits that, when he was writing My Struggle, he knew “actually I was doing something I probably shouldn’t have done”. How then did he decide where to draw the line? “My own rule was that if it was too physically painful, I didn’t go there.” You experienced physical pain? “Yeah. It was in my body. But when I wrote as Kristian, he doesn’t care. That freedom, you know, comes for him in the end. That, to me, is the Faust story.”In the book’s acknowledgments Knausgård says of his family: “Without their light I would never have been able to withstand the darkness of this novel.” Was it difficult to spend so much time in Kristian’s head? “It wasn’t pleasant. Because it wasn’t like I found him outside myself. I took him from within. It’s not that I’m like him, but there are some elements of myself that I magnified and put in him. That was not fun at all. But interesting.”The School of Night is Knausgård’s 21st book. He speaks very matter-of-factly about his productivity, which is one thing he undoubtedly shares with Kristian. “It doesn’t have to be many hours, but if you do it every day, five days a week, it’s a novel in a year.” His 22nd, volume five in the Morning Star sequence, is called Arendal and was published in Norway last autumn. When I say that the Morning Star sequence could run and run he agrees: “I can extend it for the rest of my life, really.” But as soon as he’s spoken these words he clarifies, with an edge of determination to his voice, that volume seven, which he is about to begin writing, “will be the last. I want to do other stuff.”That doesn’t mean, however, his enthusiasm for the series has waned. Just the day before, he tells me, he made the final changes to the manuscript for volume six, I Was Long Dead, due in Norwegian bookshops in a few weeks. It returns to Syvert and Alevtina, from The Wolves of Eternity, and its climax, he says with a laugh, is “real blood spatter and chainsaw kind of stuff. It’s the wildest book I’ve ever written.”The School of Night, translated by Martin Aitken, is published by Harvill (£25). To support the Guardian, buy a copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Dor (formerly known as Dorothy) and Tin 2.0 need guidance on how to take down the Wicked Witch and save the borough of Oz-lington from a great blizzard.But wait! Who’s that Facetiming? It’s onlyJeremy Corbyn, the wise Wizard of Oz-lington! The 200-person audience cheers and applauds the Islington North MP, who looks as if he’s beaming in from the allotment.“It’s me, the Wizard,” Corbyn says. “I’ve been very busy planning a party, a new party. It’s harder than it sounds.”Shortly thereafter, we’re treated to an even battier on-screen cameo: SirIan McKellenas Toto the dog, complete with a pair of furry ears and a fluffy coat.The Olivier winner licks, pants and expresses relief that he’s no longer in Cats with James Corden. “We didn’t even tell him to mention Corden,” Dor quips, much to the audience’s delight.The cameos from two national figures have done much to raise the profile of this local panto in recent weeks, underlining how familiar faces can still bolster the art form.Tickets for the Pleasance’s adult version of the kid-friendly show have “flown out the door”, according to Ellie Simpson, the venue’s head of theatre.“This is our first panto in 20 years,” Simpson said. “We knew it would be a huge risk, with no additional funding. But we’re now looking at putting on extra shows.“Jeremy’s involvement has added a stamp of approval, and Sir Ian playing one of the world’s smallest on-screen dogs has been brilliant – the ad libs had us shaking behind the camera trying not to laugh.”View image in fullscreenIan McKellen as Toto the dog.Photograph: Pleasance theatrePantomime has long traded on celebrity casting, a tradition that took hold in the mid-20th century when soap stars and pop acts began treating the festive season as a reliable sideline. A familiar name on the poster can lift a theatre’s December takings, while audiences relish the chaos of seeing a star muddle through “he’s behind you!”“There’s a truism, particularly in regional theatre, that goes: ‘no panto, no Pinter’,” says Nick Curtis, chief theatre critic at the Standard. “Pantos basically bankroll the rest of the year, including the more serious work theatres do.“They’re also very important for relationship building. If you get the families when they’re young, they may come back to join your youth theatre, or take a punt on a Shakespeare later in your season.”West End venues such as the Andrew Lloyd Webber-owned Palladium represent the top end of the market, with glossy spectacles and ticket prices to match. But regional theatres balance modest budgets with the need to draw audiences night after night. “Having a celebrity name attached can make a difference,” Curtis added.In recent years, ticket sales for pantomimes have continued to climb,highlighting their role as the “lifeblood” of UK theatres. Hannah Essex, co-CEO of Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, told the Guardian that pantomime is “one of the most powerful entry points into theatre”.Data from 52 regional venues shows that in 2024, nearly a third of all performances and more than a quarter of attendances and ticket revenue came in December. About 1.1 million people saw a Christmas production at regional theatres, generating almost £31m in revenue.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Stars can increasingly contribute via short on-screen cameos or pre-recorded voiceovers, without having to commit to weeks of nightly performances.This year, Stephen Fry voices the Giant in Jack and the Beanstalk at Watford Palace theatre, while Brian Cox voices the same role at Dundee Rep theatre. Last year, Judi Dench lent her voice to the Magic Mirror in Snow White at the Theatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds. And it’s a phenomenon evident beyond panto: John Malkovichappears in an on-screen cameoin the London stage adaptation of The Hunger Games.Steve Marmion, chief executive of Watford Palace theatre, notes that pantos make up about a quarter of his venue’s turnover and a third of its audience.“Funding cuts have made panto more important than ever,” he said. “The generational tradition of it means it’s not dropped off the list of things to do. My mum always described it as the only time of year she saw her mum wear lipstick.”According to Marmion, celebrity involvement is a nice extra detail. “We can’t afford to take thousands a week out of our income to pay for a big star, but technology means stars can now support multiple theatres in a single afternoon with high-quality home recordings. Having Stephen Fry voicing the Giant is a really good balance for us.”At the end of the show at the Pleasance, I overhear audience members debriefing on the performances of Corbyn and McKellen.Simpson emphasises that the fun of the cameo goes hand in hand with its practical impact. “Isn’t this what a local MP should be doing – getting involved with the community, especially the arts, which have struggled so much after the pandemic? All in the name of fun and silliness.”Explore more on these topicsPanto seasonTheatreJeremy CorbynIan McKellenLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Shame the Traitors don’t run Britain | Marina HydeRead moreThe perils of making a celebrity appearance on a gameshow known for attracting eggheads would appear obvious and can cause lasting reputational damage. So why do celebrities ever agree to appear on such quizzes?Their agents claim it can increase their clients’ profile and show off their human side.Bronagh Monahan, cofounder of Mon Rae Management, which specialises in representing YouTubers, said: “These things are generally for charity so there’s a nice halo effect for appearing.“It’s the taking part that counts. If you get something wrong, it shows you are fallible which makes you popular.”Don’t believe it, says the Guardian’s sketch writer John Crace, who is stilltraumatised by spelling mozzarella wrongon Celebrity University Challenge.“I still get humiliated on a regular basis by my family reminding me of Mozzarellagate,” he said.Crace’s tip to anyone tempted to appear on such quizzes is: don’t.“Unless you are exceptionally clever you are likely to make a fool of yourself,” he said. “The producers are hoping you make an arse of yourself as that makes the best TV.”View image in fullscreenMonty Panesar’s disastrous appearance on Celebrity Mastermind six years ago was used to taunt him this week by Australia’s cricket captain Steve Smith.Photograph: BBCCrace warned that University Challenge is even more prone to humiliation than Mastermind, because it involves buzzing in with embarrassingly wrong answers, and it does not involve a specialist subject that you can prepare for.Crace said: “Doing it on the TV is far harder than being a know-all at home. I am quite handy at UC at home and thought I was going to be a star. I wasn’t.”Not all quizshow appearances end in shame. Journalist and author David Hepworth wanted to turn down an invitation to appear on University Challenge for fear of being shown up. He only agreed after his wife pointed out “you wouldn’t be asked again”.He didn’t regret after he helped his Middlesex team win the 2023 competition.But even after this success he would not be tempted to appear onCelebrityMastermind, describing it as “an exercise in TV exploitation”.Maths teacher Bobby Seagull has built a media career on his successful performances on University Challenge. He has also won celebrity versions of Mastermind and Pointless and now coaches celebrity contestants.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you treat it too seriously then you panic and get into that circle of doom we’ve seen so many times in celebrity quizzes.”Seagull’s tips include listening to recordings of the quizmaster to get used to their pronunciations, and binge watching other quizshows.Even Seagull is haunted by the questions that he has got wrong, such as mistaking Barry Manilow for Rod Stewart. He insisted that Panesar’s Mastermind flop could have happened to anyone.Seagull said: “If you make a couple of mistakes, it really knocks your confidence. As a maths teacher I see that in class all the time.View image in fullscreenBobby Seagull on University Challenge in 2017.Photograph: BBC“It doesn’t matter how clever you are – you could be Stephen Fry and a brain fog can still obscure your ability to retrieve information under pressure.”He warned celebrities to stay off social media if they do blunder. Online pile-ons can now be so harsh that Seagull questions the future of such shows.“The risk of social media blowback is getting to a point when its becoming difficult for producers to recruit celebrities of note to these shows,” he said.Alex Segal, managing director of the talent agency InterTalent, disagrees. “People do these shows for visibility, they can win good money for charity and its fun. It’s not that deep.”Segal does warns clients they could be made to “look silly”, and occasionally he has advised against appearances on Mastermind when celebrities do not have time to read up on their specialist subject.But he said even wrong answers can be entertaining. “I had Omid Djalili do Mastermind. When he didn’t know the answers, he came up with the most ludicrous answers. He didn’t look bad, he just looked funny.”Asked for the alternative name for the horned rattlesnake based on its movement, Djalili answered “writhing erotically”. The correct answer was sidewinder.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionCelebritynewsShareReuse this content"

As a child of the 80s and 90s, pop culture was awash with extra-terrestrial sightings. “How can you be a kid watching movies like ET and Close Encounters, TV shows like The X Files, and not end up curious about whether or not we’re alone in the universe?” he said in an interview with the Guardian. “And whether or not the US government does, in fact, hold secrets from the public.”‘80 years of lies and deception’: is this film proof of alien life on Earth?Read moreFarah’s exposure to otherworldly beings in fiction kickstarted an interest that’s now morphed into a professional quest, and the subject of his documentary debut The Age of Disclosure. Here, Farah makes the case that the United States has been hiding, for decades, a fount of information related to UAP (unidentified anomalous phenomena) – the acronym rebrand of the stigma-ridden UFO.It would be easy to assume this is the stuff of tin-foil hats and Reddit forums, and in some ways the documentary’s pseudo-narrator, Luis Elizondo, could come across as a type of conspiracy theorist at first glance. He’s armed with a blackboard and piece of chalk, working to sell the viewer, running through a lot of overwhelming military and intelligence jargon, like “hypersonic velocity” and “trans medium travel” with undeniable passion.But there’s a reason why Farah gravitated towards Elizondo (who also serves as an executive producer on the film). He’s got genuine credentials. A former Pentagon official, who helped lead the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), Elizondo eventually left his role in 2017, claiming the department was hiding vital information from the public. He also claims there was a “powerful disinformation campaign” from the Department of Defense to discredit his work.Making a point to “only interview people who have direct knowledge” of these programs from working within the US government was a north star for Farah – who has served as a producer on several films, including Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One. While filming The Age of Disclosure, as more former officials and experts got on board, it helped to convince others to take part.But Farah ran a tight ship over the three years it took to make the film. “Everyone’s names would be kept silent until it was done,” he said, noting that he only told documentary subjects about who had agreed to take part in order to make them comfortable. “We would make the movie in secrecy, so this information of who’s in it would not get out there until we were done with this film, and these people I was approaching would have safety in numbers.”Farah also opted to make the film independently, unattached from a studio or streamer. “None of them would ever want to participate in a big commercial documentary,” Farah explained. “They would be afraid of it being sensationalized. They would be afraid of being intercut with someone who was not on their level, who would undermine them.”His first big commitment came from Jay Stratton, one of the defense officials who started AATIP. He had an established career investigating UAP and non-human intelligence life on behalf of the government, and was responsible for briefing senior lawmakers in Congress and the White House. “I have seen with my own eyes non-human craft and non-human beings,” Stratton says plainly at the beginning of the film.After Stratton agreed to “break his silence” it had tremendous “ripple effects” on the rest of the film, and convinced others to come forward. When the current secretary of state, Marco Rubio, agreed to take part, that escalated things. “Then next thing you know, general Jim Clapper was participating,” Farah said of the former director of national intelligence under Barack Obama, who sat for an interview.The sheer wealth of contributions, 34 to be exact, from members of Congress across the political spectrum, as well as people with rich national security experience – many of whom might balk at the prospect of a cable news hit let-alone an independent documentary – certainly lends a veneer of credibility. Off the bat you’re confronted with a propulsive string score, and a supercut of former military and intelligence officials ensconced in armchairs. They all offer brief summaries of their CVs, spell out that we are not alone, and why the American public ought to know more about it.View image in fullscreenDan Farah.Photograph: Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images“This [UAP] technology does stuff that we can’t do, and if we can’t figure out what it is or what it wants, or what it’s being used for,” says a former director of aviation security at the National Security Council. The former chief scientist for AATIP claims that those who are tasked with ensuring information about UAPs doesn’t leak “will use whatever tool they can find to try to convince people they shouldn’t come forward”. Meanwhile a former defense official notes that if we’re able to understand the technology that we’re observing, it opens the door to so many “potentially beneficial impacts, including clean energy”.In many ways, Rubio offers one of the more convincing arguments. He says that much of the research and intelligence about UAPs is on a need-to-know basis, with incoming administrations being left out of the loop on the details. “But that begins to ramp out of control,” he notes, leading to a lack of transparency that might give US adversaries a head start by analyzing UAP technology. It’s a theory that sounds all the more convincing coming from the noted foreign policy hawk, who spent time in the senate spearheading a bipartisan effort to understand more about UAPs.The geopolitical arms race to reverse engineer UAP technology is, what Farah came to see, one of the biggest reasons behind the alleged cover-up. “You can’t tell your friends without telling your enemies,” Farah says in our interview, reciting one of Stratton’s lines in the documentary. He traces a line from the debunked 1947 Roswell “alien crash retrieval” (generally considered the genesis of modern UAP conspiracies) to what he sees as the ongoing effort to withhold information – for fear of enemies getting wind of how much the US knows about extraterrestrial life.“Put yourself in the shoes of US government and military officials in the 40s,” Farah said, explaining that, fresh off a second world war victory, the Truman administration couldn’t tell the American people that “we’re in another conflict that we can’t protect anyone from, because we don’t even know anything about it”.He says this race escalated when the US found out that other countries, like Russia, were capturing and retrieving UAP technology. “Here we are now where the people who run our country are not aware of the facts,” he added. “Those people are supposed to be aware of significant information like this that has high stakes for us. And at a base level, the public deserves to know the truth about fundamental facts, like we’re not alone in the universe.”In The Age of Disclosure, it’s clear that there is little room for pushback or skepticism, particularly since there’s not a single detractor in the film to serve as a foil to the plethora of resolute interviewees. And Farah, for his part, doesn’t see the need for those voices to cloud the documentary’s throughline. “I think when people watch this movie, one of the realizations will be that the stigma around this topic is completely illogical and makes no sense and is not good for humanity,” he said. “We need the scientific community, not only in the United States, but in every nation, accepting the fact that this is a real situation, this is a valid area of inquiry, and that they should put their brain power towards learning about this and answering a lot of the big questions that remain.”Testimony is ultimately what film hinges on, and it’s really the only “proof” it can offer. This, for Farah, is more compelling. He believes that “the strongest evidence” is “credible people putting their name and reputation on the line to tell you what they know at great risk”. When it comes to video and photos, the director notes that it would do little to quieten claims that it’s all a hoax. “You could put a picture or a video of the most extraordinary thing on the cover of a major news publication or on major plants on TV, and half the human population would tell you they think it’s AI or they think it’s visual effects,” he said.As more people, like Elizondo and Stratton, speak out about their experiences, Farah hopes it will encourage more people who have been silenced in the past to attempt to reveal the truth. “For way too long, the public has been lied to, kept in the dark, completely misled by a heavily financed and very sophisticated disinformation campaign,” Farah said.“I think it is only a matter of time before a sitting US president steps to the podium, and tells the world that we are not the only intelligent life in the universe, and that the United States government intends to lead in this new chapter by ending the era of secrecy and beginning the era of transparency.”The Age of Disclosure is out now in the US with a UK date to be announcedExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsAlien lifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The upcoming advancements for those with disabilities are life-changingRhik SamadderSat 22 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTShareWashing machines liberated women to get soul-crushing jobs that ate up their free time. Social media gave the world one revolution – before it destabilised democracies everywhere else. Now AI is here, and its main job seems to be replacing screenwriters. It’s easy to fall into techno-pessimism, but new documentary Seeing into the Future (Sunday 23 November, 8pm, BBC Two) has a different angle. For disabled people, tech has already brought about life-changing advancements. And we haven’t seen anything yet.It is presented by comedian and StrictlywinnerChris McCausland, who is blind. Some of the most casually astonishing scenes occur early on, showing how he uses his phone – essentially, an eye with a mouth. “What T-shirt is this?” he asks, holding up a garment. “A grey T-shirt with a graphic logo of Deftones,” his phone obliges. It can even tell him if the shirt needs ironing. But it’s where all this is going that fascinates McCausland, so he heads to the US, to see what’s in development at the houses of our tech overlords.He swings by a facility belonging to Meta to try out some smart glasses. To my mind, he may as well be entering the lair of the White Worm, or popping round for macarons at Dracula’s castle. But that’s partly because I’m not in direct need of such technology, and the documentary’s job is to highlight possibility not jump on pitfalls. It’s not like Zuckerberg is personally in the lab, stroking a cat and spinning round on an egg chair.I love having my perspective shaken up. A glass screen with no buttons sounds like the most excluding device imaginable, McCausland acknowledges, yet his phone became the most accessible tool he’s ever used. He’s similarly excited by the Meta Specs – I don’t think that’s what they’re actually called – which are always on and offer live video interpretation, telling you what you’re looking at. Like a phone but, crucially, wearable. “The one thing blind people never have is two hands free,” he observes.View image in fullscreenMcCausland with Maxine Williams, VP of accessibility and engagement at Meta, trying out their smart glasses.Photograph: BBC/Open Mike ProductionsAt MIT, a nanotechnologist tells him how molecular devices could repair cells inside our bodies. He tries bionic gait assistance – a device that straps on to the calf, giving the wearer added power. It looks like the knee brace Bruce Wayne uses inThe Dark Knight Risesto kick through a brick wall when he learns he’s got no cartilage in his knee. Most moving, in every sense, he takes a trip in a driverless car. It’s the first time McCausland has taken a car journey alone.Driverless cars will arrive in the UK next spring. (That’s a long journey.) They are what I would call an instinctive NOPE. But “It’s not massively different to trusting a driver I don’t know,” McCausland reflects. They are extraordinary: mounted with spinning radars, making calculations involving the speed of light to 3D-model the environment in real time. They may as well have gullwing doors. The fact the steering wheel moves on its own is McCausland’s favourite thing about them, which is charming. Coolness is certainly the second best thing technologists can pursue, after equality of access to lives of dignity and independence. In my defence, it’s not just that I don’t trust technology. It’s that I don’t trust profit-driven Big Tech companies to behave for the public good, or with any accountability.Driverless cars are coming to the UK – but the road to autonomy has bumps aheadRead moreThere’s a parallel pleasure in the documentary – transatlantic cultural difference. These are not just Americans, remember. These are San Franciscan Futurists. The inadvertent comedy is amplified by the addition of the dry McCausland. A man so British that, even when he’s interviewing a nanotechnologist about blood-borne computers that could potentially restore his sight, he sounds as if he’d hand you thirty English notes right now if you could teleport him to the pub instead.Even the tech is unmistakably American. “I can hear a plane?” prompts McCausland, trialling Zuckerberg’s glasses. “Yes, a plane is visible in the clear blue sky,” responds the earnest spectacles. Later, our presenter wryly looks back toward his own camera crew. “Do they look like they know what they’re doing?” he provokes. “Judging by their equipment, yes, they are professionals.” Go-go-gadget-missing-the-joke. Computers may increasingly be able to play God, but irony remains a step beyond. Even with a Batman leg brace.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherChris McCauslandFactual TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Roberts plays the largely unlikable Alma, a philosophy professor up for tenure alongside her colleague and close friend Hank (Andrew Garfield). That is until student Maggie (Ayo Edebiri) accuses him of sexual assault. Questions of privilege, feminism, restorative justice and generational ignorance swirl round Alma as she is asked to choose who to believe – while her own conduct also comes up for debate.Simon WardellOne Shot With Ed Sheeran, out now, NetflixAdolescence director Philip Barantini adapts his single-take expertise to the rather less zeitgeisty subject of the Suffolk-raised, world-conquering singer.

A little bundle of anger and (possibly naive) optimism, she absorbs whatever life throws at her – whether that’s on the nighttime streets or in a film star’s bedroom, meeting a charitable stranger or a man who may make an honest woman of her.

Lightning has struck twice with this magnificent, shuddering production of Miller’s 1946 play – it perfects the art of doing less for more effect and is performed at the same West End venue where its predecessor transferred.Van Hove, known for giving the classics his own stamp, steps back here, it seems, letting the cast (and what a cast this is) not just inhabit their parts but somehow become them as if by magic. They articulate the devastating truths in this play about the corruptions of the American dreamand the toxic inheritance handed down from fathers to sons. How relevant these truths seem today: it is as if Miller were speaking directly about now. A line can be drawn from the play’s themes of selling faulty equipment to government and the unaccountability of corrupt capitalist patriarchs to Trumpian facts and delusions, Grenfell and the Covid-era PPE scandal.Yet the story is followed with fidelity to the original: wealthy industrialist Joe Keller (Bryan Cranston) served time in jail for knowingly supplying defective aircraft cylinder heads to the army during the second world war, leading to the deaths of 21 US pilots, but has since cleared his name by blaming his business partner, Steve Deever. War has claimed its victims in this family nonetheless. His wife, Kate (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), is waiting for their son, Larry, to return, several years on. Their other son, Chris (Paapa Essiedu), is getting ready to propose to Larry’s fiancee, Ann (Hayley Squires), the daughter of Joe’s jailed partner.View image in fullscreenSins of the father … Bryan Cranston (Joe), Paapa Essiedu (Chris) and Hayley Squires (Ann).Photograph: Jan VersweyveldIngenious tweaks render it a radically different experience. Miller’s three acts come with an interval but this runs straight through at a pace that is reminiscent of ancient Greek theatre in its fateful tragedy. There is a Sophoclean examination of the family, what it means for a son to inherit a father’s crimes, and the production lays out the psychology of blame, guilt and complicity in an incredibly full-bodied and clarifying way.Everyone colludes with the lie that Joe is innocent, to some degree, and every character here seems to know the truth, deep down, guiltily blind right from the start, which compounds their grief at the end. Ann is ready to put aside Joe’sculpability in order to secure her marriage to Chris while Kate, as the play’s most vulnerable character, cannot admit Larry is dead because then she must contend with her husband’s crimes (which are entwined in his dying). Joe, for his part, shows us how lies this damaging must necessarily contain self-delusion and deflection, or else it is too awful to live with them.Ivo van Hove’s All My Sons extends the UK’s special relationship with Arthur MillerRead moreThe old felled tree of the opening scene lies across the stage, looking vaguely Godot-like. A plain house front is the backdrop, with a circular portal that might be a window but also transforms into something more elemental – variously the sun and the moon.The symbolist sparseness of Jan Versweyveld’s set design drives the production further into the realm of the epic and timeless. Then there is the cast; it is a rare thing to see a group of actors quite this brilliant gel so completely. Essiedu is magnetic from the moment he steps on to the stage, his fractious face-offs with his father full of jeopardy. So are Jean-Baptiste and Cranston, along with Squires’ quietly desperate Ann. Tom Glynn-Carney brings intensity as Ann’s angry brother, who is also seduced into collusion with Keller’s lies. Every scene is strong, no actor stealing the show, each raising the power of the ensemble as a whole. There is so much alchemy here – it just dazzles and dazzles.AtWyndham’s theatre, London, until 7 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreIvo van HoveArthur MillerPaapa EssieduHayley SquiresBryan CranstonWest EndreviewsShareReuse this content"

Though it slightly overextends its central idea, Jurassic is a boxing match of a play, drawing the world’s current quality of political debate into a daft, furious comedy of dinosaurs and destruction.Jay (Alastair Michael) loses his university job in the paleontology department because the new dean, whose name is actually Dean (Matt Holt), believesJurassic Parkis real. What use is a man who studies fossils of dinosaurs now they’ve got the real thing? As Jay tries not to pop a blood vessel while arguing against Dean’s obvious lunacy, this caustic play taps into the impossibility of winning an argument with someone who is playing by an entirely different set of rules.View image in fullscreenAbsurdly funny … Holt and Michael.Photograph: Richard SouthgateFrom that daft base of illogic, the play snowballs. Dean uses disinformation to dismember the university in an effort to save costs and suppress freedom of thought, with Eleanor Ferguson’s cage-framed set nodding neatly to this ongoing dismantling. Holt is eye-clawingly infuriating as the humourless head, wilfully ignorant and blindingly literal. “Is this a bit?” Jay asks, when he’s first presented with Dean’s wild reasoning. “A bit of what?” Dean asks innocently. Events escalate when Jay stops clinging to reason and starts to play dirty, Michael playing him winningly as a desperate man with nothing left to lose.Foley’s absurdly funny premise would work just as well with another cultural launchpad to display Dean’s ignorance; this type of conspiracy theorist, who makes up statements and calls them facts, is not limited by subject matter. But then we wouldn’t get director Piers Black’s delicious between-scene moments where the two men screech and claw at each other, necks taut and elbows outstretched. Two dinosaurs ready to rumble.Reality bends as the story is hauled through to its logical extreme, where the drama stretches a little thin. There are only so many ways for the men to shout each other down and menacingly circle a desk. But the show never loses its dark comic bite or sharpened claws. Foley’s writing is a dotty delight and a searing indictment of the way our world is going.AtSoho theatre, London, until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Jurassic ParkSoho theatreDinosaursPalaeontologyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Then, I hear the birdsong and the rustling of the palm trees. The harsh sun dims and there’s water and the smell of damp earth. It’s easy to understand why desert travellers yearned to reach these havens and why they have become synonymous with peace. I’m an explorer who’s walked through many oases with loaded camels, crossing Morocco and the Sahara on foot, but Skoura, a four-hour drive from Marrakech, is a place I visit to decompress.View image in fullscreenIllustration: GraphicsYou may be imagining some kind of cartoon mirage oasis – a sole date palm shimmering above the endless sands. In fact, Skoura has a population of around 3,000 people living in a small town on the edge of the palms with 10 sq miles (25 sq km) of agricultural land. Many visitors to Morocco start in Fez or Marrakech and stop off in Aït Benhaddou, then go down to the Sahara towns of Zagora or Merzouga. Skoura, less than an hour from Ouarzazate, is an ideal stop-off point for a couple of days, or you could combine it with aMarrakech city break. The bus from Marrakech (CTM or Supratours) takes six hours, or you can hire a car (or car with driver) from Marrakech or Fez.Founded in the 12th century by Sultan Yaqub al-Mansur and developed as an important stop for the trans-Sahara trade, Skoura is in the Dadès valley, nicknamed the Valley of a Thousand Kasbahs, along the old trade routes from the Sahara to Europe and the Middle East. Caravans carrying everything from gold to ostrich feathers used to come up from southern Africa. Over the next three centuries it thrived, until the trade started to break up and it lost its importance. Now, it is mainly an agricultural hub – and one of Morocco’s biggest date producers.View image in fullscreenA palm grove near Skoura.Photograph: Andrew Wilson/AlamyA visit is not a high-octane, sight-filled adventure. It’s a chance to connect with a world that is so unchanged it is almost otherworldly. The houses are built from clay, people eat what they grow and water runs down from the mountains. It is a study in how humans can live with nature and in tranquillity.There’s still a magnificent collection of kasbahs scattered through the trees, but the town is worth a visit for a glimpse of everyday life in rural Morocco. I love the chicken and chips sold in the roadside cafes of the main street. The skin has a perfect crispiness, and it is served with fresh bread, spicy harissa sauce and salted tomatoes. However, I come to Skoura for the peace and to immerse myself in the unique surroundings.Skoura is a great place to sample traditional local, affordable food. The tagine is an everyday stapleA bicycle, I find, offers the best way of doing this. Many of the lodges have them or rent them, or you can go on a tour with a guide fromSkoura VTT Aventures. There is nothing like whizzing down the dirt paths that wind through the date palms. Being on a bike means you can really look around and investigate. It was how I found out there are male and female palm trees. A farmer saw me taking pictures and came over to explain: males are needed for pollination but don’t bear any fruit, so there is only one planted for every 20-50 females. In spring, they have big, heavy clusters of pollen-filled flowers. He also showed me how he climbs the palms in his bare feet for harvesting, using a sharp curved scythe and a rope to ratchet himself up the trunk. I decided to have a go, egged on by my new friend, and abjectly failed. October/November is harvest time (Skoura specialises in the fat, soft medjool dates), which brings a bustle of activity and excitement, so it is a particularly good time to visit.Palms need water, and the oasis is fed by an intricate series of irrigation canals calledkhettara. I am not an engineering nerd, but thesedate back more than 2,500 years, so you can’t help but be impressed. They bring water all the way down from the Atlas mountains, which you can see in the distance, just using gravity. They look like a series of round tunnels.Like the canals, the houses are made of the natural materials to hand and are among the best remaining examples of rammed-earth architecture in north Africa. They are naturally cool in the summer and warm in the winter because of their thick walls made of mud and palms or wood. Roofs are flat and there are grass or palm fronds poking out above the gutters to direct the water away. When it rains your house “melts”, so constant repair is necessary; many people are now rebuilding with concrete as it is cheaper.View image in fullscreenA tomb of an Islamic saint in Skoura.Photograph: Hemis/AlamySkoura is a great place to sample traditional local, affordable food. The tagine is an everyday staple. Lamb tagine with vegetables, chicken tagine with olives and preserved lemon and meatballs cooked in tomato sauce are on the menu in all the restaurants. As I live in Morocco, I’m always looking for something a bit different andL’ma Lodgeis my special treat. It was created over a period of six years by French/Belgian couple Vanessa and Xavier on the site of an old football pitch. They slowly won over the community by building in a traditional way and planting hundreds of trees in their organic garden. Lunch and an afternoon at the pool is just €25, and all the fruit and vegetables are their own. I often start with a salad with pomegranate and end happily with a pudding fragranced with orange blossom water. Then I float in the pool, full belly up.A couple of days in the oasis is like decompression therapy. It is a world away from the crowded markets of MarrakechMorocco’s happy valley – the wilderness that lies just beyond the souks of MarrakechRead moreKasbah Amridil is another must-visit, a kind of living museum. The Nassiri family, who founded it more than 300 years ago, are still there and it has all the features of the traditional kasbah construction: a courtyard for the merchants and animals, with rooms and stables round the sides and storeys above where the family and guests eat, sleep and pray, with turrets on each corner of the building once used for defence. The small museum has artefacts from an everyday rural life that is only just beginning to die out. There are some rooms here too, if you want tostay.For a small town, Skoura has a reasonably wide range of accommodation for every budget. It is not a highly developed spot, which is its great charm, but there is still plenty of choice from about €25 for a double room in family-runAuberge Famille Ben Moro, to €89 for a double atSawadi Ecolodge, or more for something really luxurious.View image in fullscreenTraditional old pottery in Kasbah Amridil.Photograph: Luisa Puccini/AlamyIf you want to leave the calm, Ouarzazate, just 45 minutes away, is a bustling desert city. You can visit the film studios (huge productions from Gladiator to Game of Thrones have been made here), ride a quad bike out into the desert or have dinner at one of the many great restaurants. Another interesting option is Aït Benhaddou, an hour away. This red clay town emerges out of a dry river bed, and you can walk up steep winding stairs to get a view of the desert beyond.But once in Skoura, I always want to stay put. A couple of days in the oasis is like decompression therapy. It is a world away from the crowded markets of Marrakech, the clubs of Casablanca or the surfing vibes of Taghazoute. In times past, Skoura was part of the lifeline of trade for Morocco, now it is a tranquil reminder of how to live in a simpler way.Alice Morrison is an explorer, presenter and author, whoiscurrently crossing Saudi Arabia on foot.

I love to kickstart December with Advent calendars for all the family, so it seemed only fair to taste test this lot with them in tow. And, despite an age range spanning 60-plus years, we were all pretty much on the same page with our expectations: we were looking for a bit of variety behind the doors, some Christmas sparkle and a hint of nostalgia. Packaging that looked the part when displayed on our mantelpiece was also an important consideration.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Despite the obvious biases (the kids being attracted to the calendars aimed at them v the adults preferring the slightly more elegant offerings), the results were pretty consistent. We all loved the calendars where there was something extra: a picture behind a door or a foil barrier to break through, a variation in the chocolates and so forth. Ultimately, that just goes to show that we’re all big kids at heart – and that every day should start with a miniature chocolate treat.The best chocolate Advent calendarsBest overall:Hotel Chocolat milk chocolate Advent calendarView image in fullscreen£13.95 for 125g at Hotel Chocolat (£11.16/100g)£13.95 for 125g at Amazon★★★★★I love everything about this: it’s compact, stylish and the only one we tested with a message behind each door, which the nostalgist in me loved. There’s also a foil layer to break through, and different Christmas-themed chocolates. A well-thought-out Advent calendar: delicious, classy and festive.Bestbargain:Baci chocolate Christmas Advent calendarView image in fullscreen£15 for 278g at Ocado (£5.40/100g)★★★★★I love the look of this one: it’s festive and opulent, and it isn’t heavily branded, either, which I appreciate. Most importantly, there is a full-size and different-flavouredBacichocolate behind each door. And while the overall price may seem more hefty than some, it works out as much better value for money per 100g of chocolate. A calendar you could give as a gift.And the rest …Butlers chocolate Advent calendarView image in fullscreen£19.99 for 350g at Selfridges (£5.71/100g)★★★★★The heaviest, most generous chocolate offering by far, this opens out to reveal a calm and attractive calendar that isn’t screaming with branding. Behind each door is a different chocolate, with flavours including Himalayan sea salt, and date and almond. Essentially, a full chocolate box in a calendar. A great grown-up option.Tony’s Chocolonely Advent calendarView image in fullscreen£12.50 for 216g at Tesco (£5.79/100g)£12.50 for 216g at Amazon★★★★☆Fairtrade, so a great eco-conscious option. The little doors are cracker-shaped and satisfying to open, and the chocolates are a good size. The design isn’t my favourite – the branding isloud– but the chocolate is worth it.Ferrero Rocher Advent calendarView image in fullscreen£15 for 258g at Ocado (£5.81/100g)★★★★☆One of the most expensive of the bunch, but it stands out with its huge, Christmassy gold box. A nice mixture of chocolate that anyone who dreamed of a festive Ferrero Rocher pyramid will be thrilled with.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

On the plus side, it’s one of the only calendars tested with a different, larger chocolate for Christmas Eve, which feels special, and, with its large gold box, it’s attractive to look at.Divine dark chocolate Advent calendarView image in fullscreen£5.56 for 85g at Natural Collection (£6.54/10og)£5.60 for 85g at Ocado (£6.59/100g)★★★☆☆I love that you can feel good about buying Divine chocolate – they give back to the farmers directly, there’s no palm oil, and it’s vegan. I also appreciate the artwork behind the doors, and the foil layer that adds to the anticipation. But the design isn’t the best and doesn’t look particularly festive.Montezuma’s organic dark chocolate Advent calendarView image in fullscreen£15.75 for 150g at Abel & Cole (£10.50/100g)£18 for 150g at Ocado (£12/100g)★★☆☆☆If you like dark chocolate, you’ll appreciate the quality of this offering, but it’s not the most stylish of calendars. The chocolates themselves lack variation, too, in flavour and design – no pictures or element of surprise. A tad overpriced.Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate mixed chunk Advent calendarView image in fullscreen£6.50 for 258g at Ocado (£2.52/100g)£7.50 for 258g at Morrisons (£2.91/100g)★★☆☆☆A classic Cadbury’s calendar with three types of dairy milk chocolate: plain, caramel and wholenut. A lot of bang for your buck, with the most chocolate for the least cost. But it isn’t particularly Christmassy or attractive. They’ve gone for branding over festivity, which is a bit boring and sad.Kinder 24 minis Advent calendarView image in fullscreen£5.50 for 144g at Ocado (£3.82/100g)£5.30 for 144g at Amazon (£3.68/100g)★☆☆☆☆I’m going to hold up my hands and confess to being a Kinder obsessive – Ilovethe stuff – so the low score isn’t a comment on the chocolate itself. There are a few Kinder calendars on the market, many not much more expensive than this one, that offer far more chocolate options behind the doors. This just feels very basic, with the same chocolate every day.For more inspiration, read thebest beauty Advent calendarsand thebest dark chocolateExplore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkThe FilterFoodChocolateChristmasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Unlike with most foods, however, it doesn’t do to rationalise this love for ragu, because it is a mash of things chopped up so small that they all lose their texture. This might sound a bit woo-woo, but the joy of ragu comes from feeling your way through it, from the chopping and standing with your thoughts, to stirring a bubbling pot and the smell creeping under the door. A ragu isn’t just a ragu, it’s a coming-together of good things: thoughts, feelings, ingredients, time and effort.Gochujang and tofu ragu with gnocchi and pickled cucumberThe greens of the spring onions will need a proper wash. Slice the whole spring onions from top to bottom, then put them in a sieve resting in a bowl of cold water, swoosh with your hand to dislodge any dirt, then lift out to drain when you need them. You’ll need a food processor to blitz the tofu.Prep20 minCook40 minServes2-3For the pickled cucumber200g cucumber, very thinly sliced½ tsp fine sea salt2 tbsp rice vinegar1 tbsp toasted blackor white sesame seedsFor the gnocchiFine sea salt500g gnocchi2 tbsp rapeseed oil200g spring onions, whites and greens, finely sliced and rinsed2 garlic cloves, peeled and grated2cm x 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated280g firm tofu, drained and blitzed to a fine mince1½ tbsp chilli bean sauce– I likeLee Kum Kee1 tbsp gochujang paste2 tbsp tomato puree1 tbsp light soy sauce2 tsp toasted sesame oil2 tsp light agave syrupBring a saucepan of water to a boil, and add a teaspoon of salt per litre of water. Boil the gnocchi according to the packet instructions, then drain.To make the pickle, put the cucumber slices in a bowl, sprinkle over a half-teaspoon of salt and mix. Tip into a sieve set over a bowl and leave to drain.Put two tablespoons of oil in a wide frying pan on a medium heat and, once it’s hot, add two-thirds of the drained spring onions (whites and greens) and all the garlic and ginger. Cook for about five minutes, until the garlic no longer smells raw and the spring onions have wilted nicely.Add the tofu mince, turn up the heat to high and fry, stirring, for about eight minutes, until golden and browned in places. Stir in the chilli bean sauce, gochujang, tomato puree, soy sauce, sesame oil and agave syrup, then add the cooked gnocchi and 200ml cold water, and bring to a boil. Take off the heat and toss through the remaining spring onions.Drain the salted cucumber, put it in a small bowl and stir in the rice vinegar and sesame seeds.Transfer the gnocchi to a platter, arrange the cucumber pickle on top and serve at once.Join Meera Sodha at aspecial eventcelebrating the best of Guardian culture on Wednesday 26 November, hosted byNish Kumarand alongside writersStuart HeritageandTim Dowling, withGeorgina LawtonhostingYou Be The Judgelive.
