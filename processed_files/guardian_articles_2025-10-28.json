Grazia magazine this weeklabelled them“2025’s most surprising couple”.At the weekend Trudeau, 53, and Perry were seen leaving Le Crazy Horse Cabaret Club inParison Perry’s 41st birthday. They were holding hands. Neither has publicly commented, but the image is seen as the couple confirming that they are indeed an item.They join a strikingly short list of known-about relationships between politicians and singers, which includes Justin’s father, Pierre, and Streisand; and the former Liberal DemocratLembit Öpik with the Cheeky Girl Gabriela Irimia.Politician-actor relationships and marriages are more common: Rita Hayworth and then UN ambassador Aly Khan; John F Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe; Elizabeth Taylor and the US senator John Warner; and Pierre Trudeau – again, but this time very briefly – with Kim Cattrall.Every time, the public interest has been wide and intense, which annoys some people, who believe it no more than celebrity gossip and best ignored.View image in fullscreenKaty Perry performs in Toronto in August. Her latest album, four years after the previous one, was widely panned.Photograph: Chris Young/APBut it is OK to be interested and to care, says the comedy writer Gráinne Maguire, who co-hosts a podcast series on the subject of celebrity relationships.“No matter how famous you are, there are certain beats to life and a relationship that are exactly the same,” she said. “If you’re famous, they’re probably more sped-up or they’re more exaggerated.”People cannot go around asking neighbours or strangers about the inner workings of relationships – but they can read about celebrities and politicians.“We all might get together with somebody and we might move things along too quickly, or we fall in love with the idea of the person, not the real person, or they’re right for that moment in your life but then you change so then it doesn’t work any more.“When you look at celebrity couples, when you can really drill into the dynamics of what happened, you can see it is just life.”Celebrity relationships could shine a light on all sorts of issues, said Maguire, whether insecurities, careers before children – or just when it’s time to end it.“The most human part of a famous person is their private life,” said Maguire, whose podcastThe Way They Wereexplores celebrity breakups, whether Truman Capote and Jack Dunphy orLily Allen and David Harbour.Neither Perry nor Trudeau, Maguire and others note, is at the top of their careers or lives.View image in fullscreenElizabeth Taylor and the US senator John Warner, her seventh husband, in May 1981.Photograph: Richard Drew/APPerry’s latest album, four years after the previous one, was widely panned – although not perhaps as bad as made out by some. Yes, it’s “common-or-garden mediocre pop”,wrote the Guardian’s Alexis Petridis, “but it’s certainly some way short of total catastrophe.”The singer was also mocked for going on the Jeff Bezos-funded all-female space mission.In July, Perry and the British actor Orlando Bloomconfirmed they were splitting, six years after getting engaged. “She is struggling for relevancy,” said Maguire. As is, arguably, Trudeau.Elected as Canada’s prime minister in 2015, Trudeau announced in January that he was stepping down, effectively forced out by his own party.In 2023, Trudeau and his wife, Sophie, revealed they were separating after 18 years of marriage,following what they said were “meaningful and difficult conversations”.View image in fullscreenPierre Trudeau, prime minister of Canada, with Barbra Streisand in January 1970.Photograph: Chuck Mitchell/APBack in charge of his own social media, one of Trudeau’s first Instagram posts wasa photo of him shopping for kitchen suppliesat a homewares outlet – “Gotta love a Monday morning at Canadian Tire,” he wrote, prompting comment about the divorced dad vibes he was giving off.The Trudeau-Perry story has, inevitably, led to people looking back to Trudeau Sr and his relationship with Streisand, and what a love story it could have become.Pierre Trudeau was one of Canada’s most successful, flamboyant and unconventional politicians. He rode a Harley-Davidson, liked skinny dipping and sliding down banisters, and wore open-toe sandals in the legislature.Barbra Streisand wasBarbra Streisand.“Wow,” she wrote in her autobiography about their first meeting. “I was intrigued by that dichotomy … the serious politician and the bohemian. Those two don’t usually go together.”Streisand, whose marriage with the actor Elliott Gould was on the rocks, was dazzled by this “very dapper, intelligent, intense” man, a “kind of combination of Albert Einstein and Napoleon (only taller)”.They became an item in 1969. “I remember one afternoon … I was lying with my head on his lap, while he was reading official papers and I was reading a script. I thought to myself,This is bliss.”The one thing she was not looking for, however, was a new husband and having more children, both of which she suspected Trudeau wanted.What next for Trudeau Jr and Perry remains to be seen. They are relatively young but past their peak, argues Maguire, both perhaps asking themselves what’s next. Might Trudeau and Perry be the next George and Amal? The next Harry and Meghan?“There is a podcast coming, is what I’m saying,” said Maguire. “A podcast and a foundation. I’m calling it.”Explore more on these topicsJustin TrudeauKaty PerryRelationshipsBarbra StreisandParisFranceCanadafeaturesShareReuse this content"

What could possibly go wrong?Tue 28 Oct 2025 14.29 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 20.01 EDTShareNigel Farage too Marmite for you? Lee Anderson too Lee Andersony? Richard Tice too smooth? Sarah Pochin a bit too racisty? Don’t worry. These things happen. But all will be well, because Reform have just the MP for you. Someone who can be passed off as a safeish pair of hands. Someone who won’t frighten the horses. Too much. Step forward Danny Kruger. Just don’t look too close into his eyes. Not even Danny knows quite who Danny really is. Sometimes you have to judge a man by the company he keeps.Kruger is the latest Reform recruit, having jumped ship from the Tories just over a month ago. Not necessarily a huge loss to Kemi Badenoch as Danny has proved time and again that his judgment is anything but infallible. But that hasn’t put him off. Because even when he’s wrong, Danny manages to convince himself that he’s right. Put simply, he’s not nearly as bright as he believes himself to be. Yet still somehow clever enough to convince Nige that he be admitted as one of the brains of the Reform operation.Since transferring his affections to Farage, Kruger has been entrusted with getting Reform policy ready for the next election. There will be no sitting around and wondering what to do next if Farage finds himself in Downing Street, because Danny will have come up with a cunning plan. Put your trust in Danny. Largely because Reform have yet to find anyone better.Somehow, Danny has convinced both himself and Nige that he knows what he’s doing. He is presented to the world as a man with experience of government. Only in reality he has none. All he has ever done is write a few speeches for David Cameron while in opposition and act as Boris Johnson’s political secretary for a couple of months in 2019. After that, nada. He has no more inside knowledge than the rest of us. What could possibly go wrong? Confused? You soon will be.No matter. For their second press conference in as many days – there’s a third due tomorrow, strictly for the masochists – Reform let Kruger loose, closely policed by Zia Yusuf. Just in case Danny was to stray off piste. More than usual, at any rate. But this was basically the Danny K show. His chance to share with the world all of the exciting thoughts he had come up with in the past six weeks now that he was freed from the demands of being a Conservative.He was feeling chipper, he began. Thrilled to be free. Reform was currently like an unruly pirate ship but give it a few years and it would be a fully functioning naval vessel. Or not. Nige has had years and years of running political parties, and they have never evolved much beyond a one-man band. But this time would be different. Reform promised to be the grownups. Serious times required serious politicians. The country was broken. And Danny should know. Because he had been a member of the party that broke it. Not that he was in the mood to apologise. Danny is very much old school. Everything is always someone else’s fault.Now for the plan. Parliament would be sovereign. Apart from the bits that wouldn’t be sovereign. Because although Reform promised to have some top-notch, cabinet-ready candidates plucked from nowhere by the next election, at least half of ministers would be Nige’s personal appointments. Too much scrutiny is a dangerous thing. As Danny knows only too well. Because he has said he would never dream of giving his Wiltshire constituents a chance to express their feelings at his recent defection. To spare them the embarrassment of re-electing him in a landslide. Sometimes you have to wonder whether he thinks before he speaks. Or whether he just thinks we’re all too stupid to care. It’s possible the stupidity is closer to home.But Kruger also had a big shake-up of the civil service in mind. It had grown 30% since Brexit. Er … yes. That’s because we no longer have EU bureaucrats to do the hard work and because there’s more admin to do. So if you want to know why the civil service is so large, Danny could look closer to home. To himself and Nige. Both architects of Brexit. The cheek is breathtaking.There was more. Reform would discontinue the leases of five Whitehall departments. That would probably be the same five departments Labour had already promised to discontinue. The idiocy levels were rising still higher. Welcome to the return of the cones hotline. Danny would set up a secret phone line to which people could ring in with stories of government waste. Please press 1 to leave a message.

Unsurprisingly, one of the first was about Sarah Pochin. Zia took this one, mainly because Danny had already spent 10 minutes making a fool of himself trying to explain it away on the Today programme. It is now the official Reform line to insist that Pochin is not “racist in her heart”. Just in her mouth and in her thoughts.All she was guilty of was “accidental racism”. It’s a real problem for Sarah because it keeps happening to her. Only a few months ago she was insisting that Afghans and Eritreans were more likely to be sex offenders. Imagine her pain. Loving black and brown people so much that the sight of them drives you mad. Counting them. Always counting them.Some also thought it was a bit of a cheek for Kruger to lecture us on good governance when so many Reform-led councils were a hopeless rabble. Zia insisted that in every well-run council there was a rabble waiting to be unleashed. So Reform were ahead of the game. But by now Danny was ready to go for it. Doubling down on everything.We were about to enter a new era. In which everyone would do exactly as Nige said. We would no longer be bound by international law. We would be going it alone. Pariah status, here we come. The whole DEI agenda would be scrapped. There were far too many of the wrong people in top jobs. You get his drift. He wanted a God-fearing country where children were brought up by a mother and father. Danny is not a fan of LGBTQ+.Finally we were done. More details would be revealed later.

Flop on the sofa, lose yourself in your favourite show and feel your shoulders unknot themselves. Yet sometimes the best episodes are the most stress-inducing. Nerves jangle. Anxiety levels spike. Before you know it, you’re perched on the edge of your seat, quietly whimpering and clutching a cushion for comfort.We select the dozen most intense TV episodes of all time – two of which aired in the past fortnight. Well, it’s been a turbulent time. Press play and feel those knuckles whiten …Homeland:‘Marine One’(2011)It ran for nearly a decade to diminishing returns, but the debut season of the Showtime espionage thriller was downright electrifying. Bipolar CIA analyst Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) and “turned” war hero Sgt Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) played cat-and-mouse to taut effect. Tension reached its nerve-shredding peak with its first series finale. Al-Qaida double agent Brody attempted to detonate his suicide vest in a VIP bunker, blowing up high-value targets including the US vice-president. He was foiled by a loose wire and a phone call from his otherwise quite annoying daughter, Dana. For a while back there, viewers were sweating like Brody in that bathroom stall.Chernobyl:‘The Happiness of All Mankind’(2019)Sky and HBO’s forensically detailed dramatisation of the 1986 nuclear disaster became IMDb’s top-rated TV series of all time. The unflinching realism was especially vivid in the fourth episode. As a team were dispatched to shoot the town’s contaminated pets (sob), “liquidators” were sent up to the still-burning reactor’s rooftop to clear radioactive debris by hand. Each worked frantically for a 90-second burst, supposedly before exposure became fatal. Immersively shot on Steadicam and soundtracked by a crackling dosimeter, it included a watch-through-your-fingers moment where one poor conscript got his foot stuck. Terrifying, not least because we know that one in 10 of the real-life liquidators died.Happy Valley:series 3, episode 6 (2023)The blood feud between Sgt Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire) and local psycho Tommy Lee Royce (James Norton) played out for three superlative series across nine years. It was all building towards a climactic confrontation in the last ever episode. Having dramatically escaped prison, Tommy was wounded, desperate and dangerous. Catherine was on the verge of retirement – rarely a good omen for a screen cop. As a rapt audience of more than 11m watched and winced, the “Peeping Tommy” scene saw him pop up at Catherine’s window while she dozed in an armchair. When he broke in, understated greetings (“Hello?” “Hiya”) began a slow-burning 15-minute showdown across the kitchen table.Game of Thrones:‘The Rains of Castamere’(2013)Anyone who had read George RR Martin’s novels knew what was coming and watched with queasy dread. When the Starks arrived at Walder Frey’s castle to shore up the two clans’ alliance, things seemed to be passing peacefully – until Catelyn (Michelle Fairley) noticed that the musicians had changed their tune and the banqueting hall doors were locked. Right on cue, the slaughter began. Welcome to the Red Wedding. It was this harrowing massacre in the books that convinced showrunners David Benioff and DB Weiss to buy the TV rights. “The Lannisters send their regards” indeed.The Bear: ‘Fishes’(2023)We nearly picked season one’s “Review”, when a food critic’s rave write-up led to the Chicago restaurant’s receipt machine spewing out hundreds of orders, while the staff fell apart under pressure. However,The Bearbecame even more frazzled when it left the kitchen and flashed back to a dysfunctional Berzatto family Christmas dinner. As everyone tried (and failed) to appease toxic matriarch Jamie Lee Curtis, the chaos comprised multiple timers going off, blazing rows, spilt sauce, flying cutlery and even a car crashing through the wall. A 66-minute stress bomb. Just don’t ask Donna if she’s OK.Squid Game:‘Gganbu’(2021)Every episode of the tracksuit-clad South Korean hellscape was nerve-shredding, but this one took the Dalgona cookie. When the surviving contestants paired up to play marbles, the twist was that only one from each duo would survive. They thought they were teaming up to be allies. Suddenly, they were deadly foes. As characters we’d got to know over the previous five episodes competed against each other, it was agonising to see who lived and who died. The winners were left haunted by the deaths of their friends. Brutal and bleak.Line Of Duty:‘Breach’(2016)He had been the slippery antagonist for three series of police corruption plot twists. Now the net closed at last around inside man DI Matthew “Dot” Cottan (Craig Parkinson), AKA bent copper “the Caddy”. During a riveting interview scene, gaping holes appeared in Dot’s alibi. Stalling by pretending to check his iCal, he slyly sent a fateful text message (“Urgent exit required”) and all hell broke loose. Bullets sprayed. Foot chases unfolded. Getaway cars sped. A gun-toting Vicky McClure rode on the side of a delivery truck. Jesus, Mary and Joseph and the wee donkey.Task:‘Out Beyond Ideas of Wrongdoing and Rightdoing, There is a River’(2025)Not the snappiest episode title butcreator Brad Ingelsby knows how to construct killer TV. His previous hit, Mare of Easttown, featured a nerve-shredding mid-series sequence when Sgt Marianne Sheehan (Kate Winslet) and Det Colin Zabel (Evan Peters) tracked down a Pennsylvania child kidnapper. After he shockingly shot Zabel in the head, an unarmed and wounded Mare, breathless with panic, was stalked around the house in a chase reminiscent of Clarice Starling v Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs. In Ingelsby’s HBO follow-up Task, the penultimate episode saw Mark Ruffalo’s FBI taskforce and Tom Pelphrey’s Dark Hearts biker gang converge at a forest cabin. Cue a nonstop, guns-blazing 18-minute shootout in which several major characters perished.Breaking Bad:‘Ozymandias’ (2013)In this pulse-pounding instalment, five seasons of villainy finally caught up with Walter White (Bryan Cranston). As our antihero’s best-laid plans fell apart, he witnessed Hank’s heartbreaking execution, lost most of his ill-gotten loot, betrayed Jesse, alienated his family, kidnapped baby Holly and went on the run. As everything blew up in Walt’s face and the foundations were laid for the show’s killer finale, it was about as relaxing as rolling a barrel of cash across a desert. No wonder it won four Emmys and was named by showrunner Vince Gilligan as his favourite episode out of all 62.Blue Lights:‘Ordo Ab Chao’(2025)The third series of the Bafta-winning Belfast cop drama has been its best yet. The penultimate episode cranked up the jeopardy to unbearable levels. Answering what appeared to be a routine callout, cocky constable Shane (Frank Blake) was stabbed in the leg. While he bled out from his femoral artery, potentially fatally, colleague Grace (Siân Brooke) drove a mob accountant to a police safe house – not realising that organised crime had ordered a hit on the convoy. As dissident gunmen moved into position for a deadly ambush, a Special Ops surveillance expert tried to talk Grace to safety on the radio. It’s always a worry when a conversation starts, “Is your vehicle armoured or soft-skinned?” “Soft-skinned.” “Shit.”Succession:‘Which Side Are You On?’(2018)Jesse Armstrong’s dynastic psychodrama was full of unbearably tense episodes – Connor’s wedding, Kendall’s 40th, Boar on the Floor, election night and the yacht were all right up there – but this was an early tone-setter. Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong) had painstakingly put the wheels in motion for a no-confidence vote in his fearsome father Logan (Brian Cox). It crashed and burned when Logan refused to leave the Waystar boardroom, instead bullying colleagues into siding with him. Meanwhile, Kendall was stuck in traffic and sprinted through the Manhattan streets to make it in time – only to get fired and frogmarched out of the building on arrival. “That was your best shot,” snarled daddy dearest. “You lost.”Atlanta:‘Teddy Perkins’ (2018)Donald Glover’s genre-bending creation specialised in surreal self-contained episodes, none better than this deeply creepy gem. When stoner Darius (LaKeith Stanfield) picked up a valuable vintage piano from a mysterious mansion and met its reclusive oddball owner Teddy Perkins (Glover himself, unrecognisable beneath mask-like prosthetics and ghostly makeup), it descended into a hallucinatory horror movie in miniature. Director Hiro Murai admitted being inspired by The Shining. The unsettling figure of Teddy bore a distinct resemblance to Michael Jackson. Get out, Darius, before it’s too late.Share your favouriteWhat is the most intense TV show you have ever seen?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Real scares can happen to actors any night of the year. Big name performers, including Zachary Hart and Harmony Rose-Bremner, recall their worst moments – and how they overcame their fearsArifa AkbarTue 28 Oct 2025 10.50 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 13.43 EDTShareDerek Jacobi had a bout of it during a world tour of Hamlet. Bill Nighy wrestled with it in the run-up to The Vertical Hour opening on Broadway. Juliet Stevenson has likened it to “a disease”. It has even caused some to take flight:Stephen Fry disappeared from Cell Mates, whileLenny Henry left the stage during Educating Rita. “I’ve completely gone,” he said – although he did return to finish the show.Stage fright can cause the shakes but it can also trigger a complete physical freeze-up, to say nothing of a total verbal drying up – all right under the spotlight. So how and why does it take grip? Can it be overcome? And what does it feel like to be seized by the actor’s nightmare?It felt like a million years passed between my first line and my secondMeera Syal describes a classic anxiety dream: “I find myself in a costume I don’t recognise, in a role I can’t remember, looking at audiences while I’m naked.” Decades of experience did not render her immune in 2010, while performing a preview ofWilly Russell’s Shirley Valentine. “Doing a one-woman show for two and half hours?” she says. “That’s the thing that is going to give you stage fright. I was honestly thinking of ‘doing a Stephen Fry’ just before press night. I could see the open door leading to the courtyard at the back and I thought, ‘If I ran away now, they wouldn’t be able to find me.’”Syal found the courage to stay, then promptly forgot her lines – but just soldiered on through the haze. “I looked into the abyss and I thought, ‘I’ll get out of it.’ And I did. The character of Shirley Valentine could be improvised because the whole thing was her talking to the audience. So I just made my way around the set and had a little think to myself until the lines came back. I improvised for three or four minutes, speaking complete twaddle in character.”View image in fullscreen‘I completely lost it’ … Larry Lamb, left, with Samuel West in Hamlet at the RSC, 2001.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianLarry Lamb has contended with intense nerves over decades of stage work. When he started out as an amateur actor, long before Gavin and Stacey, he loved the rehearsal process but performing filled him with fear. “The minute I got in front of an audience,” he says, “it all started to cloud over. My knees would start knocking uncontrollably.”The stage fright didn’t lessen when he became a professional. “It went on for about 30 years, but I just got better and better at hiding it.” In 2001, he dried upas Claudius in Hamlet, for the Royal Shakespeare Company. “It was the first preview at Stratford-upon-Avon. I was just into my opening speech, when Claudius is addressing the people of Denmark, when my words got lost in space. It got worse and worse and worse. The whole cast were up on the stage, looking at me as I completely lost it.”He got through that performance but thedirector, Steven Pimlott, recognised what had happened. “He realised I wasn’t in control but only looking as if I was. He said, ‘You’re not engaging with the audience. When the lights come down, you then block them out.’”Pimlott kept the house lights on so Lamb would have to acknowledge the audience’s presence. It was a turning point in the actor’s career. “Little by little, it got better. Because we were doing the show for the best part of the year, gradually the stage fright went away, until I was confident and directly engaging with the audience.”Now 78, Lamb no longer has the energy for plays but relishes his live shows, performing his own poetry. He says that, as an actor, he kept getting in the way of his character. “You’re not allowing the the space – it’s too much you, not enoughcharacter.”Harmony Rose-Bremner, who wascast in The Yearsin 2024, agrees. “Self-consciousness and self-doubt go against everything you’re trying to do – which is to be free, let go, fully immerse yourself in the character. The question is, ‘Can I make space in my head to let the character through?’” In The Years, as one of five actors all playing the same woman in different stages of her life, she was thrilled yet felt intimidated. “I’ve grown up doing theatre. It was always my happy place. I didn’t ever think I’d ever feel performance anxiety.”View image in fullscreen‘Like your breath is being sucked up’ … Harmony Rose-Bremner, right, with the cast of The Years.Photograph: Phil Fisk/The ObserverShe remembers the night of the first preview. “I actually didn’t know if I could go on,” she says. “It was the first time I’d felt like that.” She managed, but felt overwhelmed in the very opening scene. “We were all standing still, just speaking out into the dark. We weren’t looking at one other so we didn’t have each other to bounce off. There were just the lines that I’d heard so many times, coming towards me. I had the classic symptoms that I’d had in miniature before – but never to this extent. The sensation of not being able to breathe properly, like your breath is being sucked up with a vacuum in your chest. There is nothing to hold on to.” It is compounded by the feeling of not wanting to let fellow actors down: “I felt the responsibility to everybody else. I thought, ‘Can I get through this immense thing?’”Zachary Hart blames imposter syndrome for causing his stage fright. A lower back condition ruled out his aspirations to be a footballer, and he was working as a fork-lift truck driver when a friend applied to drama school on his behalf and he got in. “Standing up in front of people was completely foreign to me, so at drama school I would go last every time we did something. I stycj at ut because it was pure escapism – and was better than factory work. I was going to try my hardest to beat the fear.”His first acting job was in Nicholas Hytner’sJulius Caesar at the Bridge theatre. When the cast were told the production would be filmed for NT Live, he was “petrified”. Years later, in the first preview ofThe Constituent, in which he was cast alongside James Corden and Anna Maxwell-Martin, he spoke his first line. “I heard my voice – with its strong Black Country accent – and looked out into this beautiful theatre, with its three-tonne chandelier in my peripheral vision.” He had seldom heard that accent on stage before. “I just froze. I felt I had fooled people to be there. It felt like a million years between my first and the second line. I can’t remember – but I think Anna jumped in.”View image in fullscreen‘I just froze’ … Zachary Hart, centre, with James Corden and Anna Maxwell Martin in The Constituent.Photograph: Manuel HarlanEarlier this year, Hart was cast in a star-studded revival ofThe Seagull, alongside Cate Blanchett, and was required to improvise. “I tried to empty my head when I went on, but an empty head is a nightmare for someone with stage fright. I was putting myself through the fear every night – and it was massively rewarding when it went right. But there was one night when I went on and saw Margot Robbie sitting out there, in front of Liz Truss. My brain couldn’t comprehend seeing them. Then the intrusive thoughts started.”Hart battled through and believes perfectionism might contribute to pre-performance nerves. Currently starring inthe West End hit Stereophonic, he says: “I fear not giving an audience member what they have paid an incredible amount of money to see. It’s about making sure you are performing up at 10. The perfectionism gets to me, but there is a duty that I must take seriously.”I remember what my drama school teacher said: ‘Your brain can’t think of two things at once'Can stage fright be bypassed? Rose-Bremner, who is playing Nina in The Seagull at the Edinburgh Lyceum and Chichester Festival theatre this autumn, says that what helps is to shift her focus from within her to what’s happening around her. “I remember one of my drama school teachers saying, ‘Your brain can’t think of two things at once. So focus on something outside your thoughts and feelings.’ I try to breathe and listen to something besides the voice in my head. It’s about using the other actors and the story to pull you out of the haze.”There are things, she says, that you can’t control. “Like the first night, and knowing someone really important is in the audience. But now I’ve made it a rule for myself that if people are talking about how ‘So and so is here’, I just avoid that conversation.”Hart has his own set of techniques – some drawn from his years of playing football while scouts were keenly watching. “Weirdly, that early training definitely helps on stage. You’re going out there, but remember – you can’t plan where the ball is going to go.”Syal suggests that the fearof what might go wrong is worse than the freezing itself. “When things do go wrong,” she says, “you find your way back. In the end, nobody dies – and audiences are very forgiving.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreActingAnxietyMeera SyalWest EndfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Wait, I don’t actually want to know – pop needs its mysteriesSian CainWhether it’s Parton’s Jolene, Beyoncé’s Becky with the good hair and now Madeline on Allen’s new album, the ‘other woman’ is everywhere – but gossip risks spoiling these songsTue 28 Oct 2025 11.20 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 11.22 EDTShareSo, to quote Lily Allen – who the fuck is Madeline? As mysteries go, this one didn’t seem to last long. On Friday, Allen released hernew album West End Girl, which appears to concern her divorce from US actor David Harbour, with its highly detailed evisceration of an open marriage destroyed by a husband’s emotional affair with a woman called Madeline. By Sunday, the press had already declared they’d found Madeline: the Mail on Sunday printed an interview with a woman claiming she and Harbour had had a relationship.“Of course I’ve heard the song,” they reported her as saying. “But I have a family and things to protect … It’s a little bit scary for me.” (Harbour, for his part, has not responded to the album’s contents or to the Mail’s claims.)Lily Allen: West End Girl – a gobsmacking autopsy of marital betrayalRead moreOn the song Madeline, Allen (or her character) sings about messaging a woman her husband has been sleeping with, explaining her worries that emotions are now involved: “We had an arrangement / Be discreet and don’t be blatant / There had to be payment / It had to be with strangers / But you’re not a stranger, Madeline.” She then recites text messages sent by Madeline – “He told me you were aware this was going on and that he had your full consent / If he’s lying about that, then please let me know” – which the Mail claims were pulled from real messages.In interviews, Allen has said West End Girl references things she experienced in her marriage “but that’s not to say that it’s all gospel”. She told the Times that Madeline is “a fictional character” and also a construct of several people – an explanation that sounds legally advisable and suggestive that more people may yet come forward to declare themselves Madeline. (No, I’m Spartacus!) None of this is glorious. All of it is compelling.Compare Madeline, then, tothe story of Juline Whelan, a red-haired Canadian woman who came forward in 2016 to identify herself as the possible inspiration for Dolly Parton’s 1972 song Jolene, pop’s ultimate other woman. Parton herself has told a story about being inspired by a fan who approached her for autograph: “I said, ‘you’re the prettiest thing I’ve ever seen’. She had red hair, green eyes and fair skin. And I said ‘what is your name?’ and she said ‘Jolene’. I said, ‘I’m gonna write a song about you and if you ever hear it, you’ll know it was about you.’”But Whelan was just 10 when she approached Parton for a signature, which is far less alluring than the singer’s other explanation – that Jolene was inspired by an unnamed red-haired bank teller who would flirt with her husband whenever he went into the bank. A great story for a pop song – whereas Whelan just found her possible link to the track annoying,telling CBC: “She’s a hussy, man … what little kid wants to be ‘Jolene, don’t steal my man’?”Think back to the fervour that greeted Beyoncé’s 2016 album Lemonade and its many references to infidelities, which some of her fans speculated were about her husband Jay-Z. The most famous lyric in Sorry – about “Becky with the good hair” – immediately triggered an online witch-hunt to find the real Becky. Beyoncé remained tight-lipped; the song’s cowriter Diana Gordon called all the speculation “so silly”,adding: “In what day and age from that lyric do you get all of this information? Is it really telling you all that much, accusing people?”‘I don’t make it easy for myself’: divorce and desire power Lily Allen’s autofictional comebackRead moreSometimes it is better to not know, and just enjoy the mystery instead. Carly Simon, regrettably, revealed one of three male inspirations behind You’re So Vain (Warren Beatty) after decades of mutually enjoyed speculation. Ed Sheeran left so many details in Don’t that fans quickly assumed it was about Ellie Goulding; Taylor Swift, meanwhile, barely hides which ex she’s singing about, hooking fans with a constant sense they can spot the truth. Alanis Morissette, though, has never revealed who her splenetic You Oughta Know was about, sustaining the intrigue while also making it a more universal song.Whatever the truth or fiction, West End Girl has hit a nerve. It could just be our appetite for eye-watering gossip about a famous singer and her actor husband, sure – but it also reflects a new reality that married women (and men) are now facing, one where non-monogamy is becoming more common among the monogamous. Where Parton’s song was a desperate plea for a beautiful, flirtatious woman to respect her marriage and stay out, Allen’s songs tell the story of a wife who knows her husband is having sex with other women, and even signs off on it – but hates the possibility that he’s emotionally invested enough to do things like play tennis with them. “You’re just a little boy looking for his mummy,” she sings on the final track; Madeline, whoever she is, can clearly have him if she wants.Explore more on these topicsMusicLily AllenPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As it melted around him, Joe Meanen knew there was only one possible, but highly perilous, way out for himRachel KeenanTue 28 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 10.02 EDTShareIt took Joe Meanen about six seconds to hit the North Sea, after jumping 175ft (53 metres) off the burning wreckage of the Piper Alpha oil platform. The fall seemed to last for ever, during which time, he says, his first thought was: “What the fuck have I done?”Piper Alpha stood about 120 miles off Aberdeen, on the north-east coast of Scotland. On 6 July 1988 itsuffered multiple catastrophic explosionsand collapsed, killing 167 of the 228 men on board, and a further two men from the rescue crew.It was a Wednesday, and Meanen only had one more day of this two-week stint on the platform before flying home on Friday morning. He shared a room with three others, and they were all in high spirits knowing they were about to get some time off with their friends and families back on dry land. One of them, David Campbell, had just learned that he was going to be a father.At about 9pm that evening, Meanen and his accommodation mates grabbed some Mars bars and settled in to the cinema with about 40 other crew members. Major construction and upgrades were under way on Piper Alpha at the time, yet because of the amount of oil the platform produced, it was kept operational throughout. Meanen recalls feeling uneasy about the effects of the works: “You could smell gas all over the platform. Sometimes, I even swear you could smell it inside the accommodation.”At 10pm, a non-operational gas pump, which was missing a safety valve while it was being upgraded, was activated in error and then ignited, causing the first explosion. “The whole platform rocked back and forward,” says Meanen. “Part of the roof of the cinema collapsed, everything fell into pitch blackness – the lighting failed – so there was a panic in the cinema with people screaming to get back outside.”Leaving the cinema, Meanen attempted to use the safety training he had received to prepare him for working offshore. But when he tried to reach his designated lifeboat, the magnitude of the explosion became clear. “The main control room was totally destroyed in the first explosion. Therefore no Tannoy [messages] went out. No alarms went off. Nobody really knew what to do.“My first thought was to try to get to my lifeboat master station. But as I went over to the west side of the platform, there were people coming back from there, saying [there was] no chance you can get out that way as the smoke was too intense.” The fire was oil-based, he says, “which creates thick black, acrid smoke, so if you had gone outside in that without any breathing apparatus on you would have only lasted two or three minutes maximum before you were overcome by smoke inhalation”.In the frenzy, Meanen became separated from his accommodation mates. He would not see two of them again, including Campbell – the father-to-be.View image in fullscreenThe Piper Alpha disintegrating as the intense heat caused the structure to buckle.Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/AlamyMeanen chose his next steps carefully. “Most people had gone up to the galley area, which was a designated safe area. It was fireproofed and it had a positive airflow [a kind of ventilation system to protect it from fumes], so it should have kept any smoke from coming in.”It became clear, though, as he crouched there with about 100 men, avoiding smoke inhalation with a wet dish towel to his face, that he needed to keep moving. “You could hear other small explosions happening,” he says. “You could hear these groaning and yawning noises. It was the structure of the platform, which had been compromised and was starting to melt, starting to disintegrate – we didn’t realise that at the time. It was starting to twist and buckle and windows were breaking, letting more smoke in.”Meanen and some others decided to go up to the helideck so they would be noticed quickly if any helicopters came to save them, but six men decided to stay in the galley. Meanen was one of the last to leave the area, shouting back: “‘Are you guys not coming with us?’ And they looked at each other and they said: ‘No, we’ve been told to stay, so we’re just going to stay.’ I said: ‘OK, good luck to you.’”The bodies of the six men who stayed in the galley were recovered three months later, he says. The galley had fallen 475ft (145 metres) to the seabed after the entire structure of Piper Alpha collapsed.As Meanen and other crew members climbed up to the helideck, through the thick black smoke, they found themselves faced with the harsh reality of the situation. “It was the first time we’d been outside properly since the first explosion,” he says. “And it became evident straight away that there was no chance of any helicopters even coming near the platform, never mind trying to land on it.”They could see neighbouring oil platforms from this height, including the firefighting rig Tharos, which happened to be next to Piper Alpha that night, and started pumping water on to fires. “There were 14 of us and we were waving down at the Tharos. I’m sure they could see us.”Then the second major explosion occurred, this time due to a gas pipe from a neighbouring oil platform, the Tartan, which burst from the heat radiating from Piper Alpha. “We didn’t actually know what had happened,” says Meanen, “but we knew it was something horrendous. Everybody just piled back on top of each other. As people got up they just ran away in all different directions, not another word was spoken.”This was when Meanen realised his only chance of survival would be to jump from the platform into the North Sea to be saved by the rescue teams below.View image in fullscreenJoe Meanen … ‘I was consumed with grief.’Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThinking quickly, he threw a lifejacket over the edge of the helideck and jumped, propelling himself as far as he could over the edge. He says the memory of his escape is hazy, but during his fall he sustained burns to his arms as they flailed in the air. He hadn’t touched the fireball on the way down, but the heat was so intense that even being near it was enough to leave scars.After what felt like a lifetime, he plunged deep into the water. By following the light from the flames consuming Piper Alpha, he swam to the surface, where he found his lifejacket floating in the sea, and managed to use this and the roof of a lifeboat that had been blown from the rig to keep himself afloat.He spotted the hull of the lifeboat and made a beeline for it. After pulling himself on board, floating away from Piper Alpha, he was finally able to see the ruins of the platform from which he had narrowly escaped. “I was looking back at the platform … trying to get a picture in my mind and thinking: if there’s anybody else left on that platform, they’re gone. But there were actually people who had got off after I had.” From the group of 14 that made it to the helideck, Meanen was one of five survivors.A rescue craft found him and took him to a larger supply ship to get medical treatment at a neighbouring oil rig. He was then taken by helicopter to Aberdeen where he went straight to hospital for treatment. He never worked offshore again.Joe Meanen, right, with fellow survivors Mark Reid and Roy Carey.Meanen had started working on the rigs at 22, during the peak of the 80s North Sea oil boom. By the time of the accident he was 29 and working on Piper Alpha as a scaffolder. Originally from Glasgow, he moved to the north-eastern coastal town of Stonehaven when he started working on oil platforms.Piper Alpha was operated by Occidental Petroleum (Caledonia) Ltd (OPCAL) and was the hub of a network of pipelines connecting it to nearby platforms and to shore. In 1988 the platform accounted for about 10% of North sea oil and gas production and was the world’s single largest oil and gas producer. At its peak it produced about 300,000 barrels of oil a day.In the months after the Piper Alpha disaster, Meanen was in and out of hospital recovering from his burns, relaying his story and taking pictures of injuries for the inquiry into the disaster. He was also figuring out what he wanted to do with the rest of his life.The Public Inquiry into the Piper Alpha Disaster started in November 1988, and took 13 months to complete. The resulting report was critical of Opcal and found the company guilty of having inadequate maintenance and safety procedures. However, no criminal charges were brought against the company. The report also made 106 recommendations for changes to North Sea safety procedures.Occidental paid out $180min settlements to survivors and families of the dead.It wasn’t until Christmas that year, as Meanen sat in his living room, that the grief washed over him. “I was going to my mum’s later on for my Christmas dinner,” he says. “I just got up in the morning and I put on the telly, as you would, and I just sat there and all of a sudden I was consumed with grief.“It was the first time it had really caught up with me and all I could think of was that this was the first Christmas that the mums and dads, the brothers and sisters, the wives and partners, and all the kids – this would be the first time they’d be without their dads or their brothers or their uncles, or their sons.”View image in fullscreenThe structure eventually collapsed into the North Sea.Photograph: Dave Caulkin/APDespite struggling, at first, to acknowledge his grief, Meanen has since adopted the belief that he should never shy away from talking about what he went through on Piper Alpha. “I have the opinion: nothing wrong with showing a bit of emotion and speaking how you feel … I’ve always been willing to speak and get it out there. I tend to look more on the positive side of things; how I was so lucky and fortunate.”In the early 90s, Meanen and a few other survivors started a tradition of an annual meet-up in Edinburgh (the city to which they initially had to travel for their personal injury claims). “It’s great,” he says. “Sometimes Piper Alpha doesn’t even come up in our conversations, it’s just great to see them. If it ever does [crop up], we don’t have to explain anything to each other … If somebody has got any issues and they want to bring it up, we can speak about it and hopefully get it sorted out.”I fell at the top of a mountain – and knew I had to haul my broken body down or die in the snowRead moreAfter the disaster, Meanen had to wear pressure garments over the scarring on his hands and arms during summer to protect them.“I was wearing gloves during the summer time, these medical gloves,” he says. “Obviously people who didn’t know me [would give me] a few strange looks. For a couple of years or so I always bought long-sleeve T-shirts. Then I thought: ‘To hell with that, it wasn’t my fault.’”He believes his physical scars played a role in helping him to recover mentally. “It’s obviously just my opinion,” he says, “that being physically injured and the scars you’ve got … give you evidence that you were there and you were involved and you’ve got the scars to show that. Whereas some people never got any physical scars, just the mental scars. I would think that’s a lot tougher for them.”Meanen went on to marry and have two children, and own and run a pub, later working as a school bus driver. Now retired, he still speaks at oil companies, sharing his story and offering advice on safety offshore. It is important to him that the disaster isn’t forgotten, “hopefully to make things better,” he says, but also to honour “these people that had to sacrifice their lives”.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleHow we surviveScotlandOil and gas companiesOil spillsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the task facing our country – facing me as chancellor – is not to relitigate the past or let past mistakes determine our future.“I’m determined that we don’t simply accept the forecasts but we defy them, as we already have this year. To do so means taking the necessary choices today, including at the budget next month.”The IMFmodestly increased its forecastfor economic growth in the UK for this year, from 1.2% to 1.3%. Over the year as a whole, the economic body expects the UK to be the second fastest-growing economy in the G7.Reeves is understood to be furious that the OBR has chosen her second budget to downgrade the productivity figure, rather than before the 2024 general election, when it would have prevented Jeremy Hunt from cutting taxes by £20bn.The Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank has said that each 0.1 percentage point downgrade in the productivity forecast would increase public sector net borrowing by £7bn in 2029-30, so a 0.3 point cut could create a £21bn hit.However, Reeves said the UK’s economic foundations remained strong – citing five interest rate cuts, wages growing faster than inflation and investment in public services and infrastructure to boost growth – and criticised Reform UK and the Tories for talking down the country.“They are determined to talk of an economy that is broken because that is the only way their politics can breathe. They talk of a Britain that is in a permanent state of decline because that is the height of their ambitions for it. I reject both claims,” she said.In a further rejection of Reform UK’s policies, the chancellor also ruled out a return to austerity at the budget – although some spending cuts are expected – while she told leftwingers who argue for higher borrowing that “there is nothing progressive” about financing debt interest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And no one needs to be told that the economy has not been as productive as it could have been over the past 14 years.”Some Treasury and No 10 advisers believe that raising income tax – focusing on the wealthy – may be the only way to make sure that Reeves raises enough money not to have to come back for further rises this parliament. After last year’s budget she had said none would be necessary.But the chancellor is understood to be nervous about the political consequences of such a decisive abandonment of the party’s pledges, especially given she broke them to raise national insurance last year.At gathering of business leaders in Saudi Arabia this week, Reeves also said she wanted to ensure the UK had “sufficient headroom” against her self-imposed fiscal rules to provide resilience against future shocks, implying that last year’s £9.9bn buffer was not enough.The chancellor is also is well aware of the harm inflation is inflicting on UK households – and on Labour’s support – and has promised a range of measures in the budget to “bear down on” rising costs, which could include lowering household energy bills.She told the Riyadh investment summit on Tuesday that Brexit is partly to blame for high inflation in the UK, as she made the case for rebuilding ties with the EU. Attributing the UK’s vote to leave to “a rejection of open borders”, she said there was now public support for a reset with the bloc.“Inflation is too high in countries around the world, including in the UK, and one of the reasons for that is that there’s too much cost associated with trade with our nearest neighbours and trading partners,” she said.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesEconomicsOffice for Budget ResponsibilityLabourGovernment borrowingShareReuse this content"

This is an issue of public confidence. We know that communities don’t want asylum seekers housed in hotels, and neither does the government, and that’s why we are determined to fix the mess that we’ve inherited by getting a grip of the issue and committing to close every single asylum hotel, saving the taxpayer billions of pounds.”The Conservative government had also planned to save public money by moving asylum seekers into former RAF bases. However,an assessment by Whitehall’s spending watchdog last yearfound that plans to place hundreds of asylum seekers in the former RAF base at Scampton, in Lincolnshire, would have cost £45.1m more than hotels. Using RAF Wethersfield in Essex would have cost £500,000 less, the report found.The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, said accommodating such large numbers of people in barracks had been tried by the last government and had failed.“The plans released overnight by theHome Officeto house 10,000 people seeking asylum on military sites are fanciful, too expensive and too logistically difficult,” he said.“The government could end the use of hotels next year, without resorting to camps, by putting in place a one-off scheme that would give permission to stay for a limited period – subject to rigorous security checks – to people from countries almost certain to be recognised as refugees,” he added.The chief executive of Care4Calais, Steve Smith, said Labour was breaking its promise to end the use of barracks to house refugees, exposing the taxpayer to soaring costs. “Opening more camps will only serve to re-traumatise more people who have already survived horrors such as war and torture,” he said.The Conservative MP for Sussex Weald, Nus Ghani, whose constituency includes the Crowborough site, said the plans were “wholly inappropriate”. She has launched a petition in an attempt to stop the scheme going ahead.“Under the previous Conservative government, the Crowborough site was rejected outright. This was due to its layout and the difficulty in it being adapted and the extra costs that would be involved,” she said.Shaun Fraser, Labour’s Scottish parliament candidate for Inverness and Nairn, said the proposal to use the Cameron Barracks was “a bizarre one given its status as a 19th-century military installation”.Highland council has accused the UK government of failing to consider the local impact of moving hundreds of asylum seekers to barracks in the centre of Inverness.A joint statement from the council’s convener, Bill Lobban, its SNP leader, Raymond Bremner, and the opposition leader, Alasdair Christie, on Tuesday morning said: “Our main concern is the impact this proposal will have on community cohesion given the scale of the proposals as they currently stand. Inverness is a relatively small community, but the potential impact locally and across the wider Highlands appears not to have been taken into consideration by the UK government.”As of June this year, about 32,000 asylum seekers were being accommodated in hotels, down from a peak of more than 56,000 in 2023 but 2,500 more than at the same point last year.Expected costs of Home Office accommodation contracts for 2019 to 2029 have more than tripled from £4.5bn to £15.3bn after what the Commons home affairs committee called a dramatic increase in demand.In a further development, immigration enforcement visits have reached their highest level since comparable data began in 2011, Home Office data shows.A total of 21,858 visits were recorded in the 12 months to September this year – up 38% from 15,894 in the previous 12-month period, and an increase of 56% on 13,990 visits that were carried out in the same period up to September 2012.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

One of the prisoners is still at large, PA reported.The mistaken releases took place at HMP Pentonville, HMP Durham, HMP the Mount in Hertfordshire and from Reading crown court, according to PA.The Ministry of Justice has acknowledged that more prisoners were mistakenly released this week, but disputed the number.Fairhurst said prison authorities knew the erroneous releases had been a “regular occurrence” for the past year.He blamed inadequate staff training and said the early release schemes, brought in by the government to tackle jail overcrowding last year, had created “a confusing time for everyone”.He defended prison staff and said the union was supporting the officer involved in Kebatu’s case, who he said had been “unfairly” suspended.Fairhurst said an error in the paperwork had led to Kebatu’s release: “Somewhere on that paperwork, it’s been missed that we should have held this person in reception until the immigration service picked him up for deportation.”David Lammy, the justice secretary, told MPs on Monday that he had been freed in “what appears to have been a human error”.Lammy said the government was immediately putting stronger checks in place at prisons across the country.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said: “Releases in error have been increasing for several years and are another symptom of the prison system crisis inherited by this government.”According to government figures published in July, 262 prisoners were released in error in the year to March 2025 – a 128% increase on 115 in the previous 12 months.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

We are committed to engaging with each survivor and witness to ensure we offer appropriate support.”The investigation, codenamed Operation Pianora, is supported by the Hampshire-based defence serious crime command and the MoD. Wiltshire police said: “We are in the process of identifying points of contact at most police forces in the UK.”The senior investigating officer, Det Supt Darren Hannant, said: “Our inquiries to date have revealed offending spanning several decades at various locations in the UK, indicating different perpetrators.“We are actively following multiple lines of inquiry and reaching out to a large number of people. We are yet to identify suspects. The investigation is in its early stages and further updates will be provided in due course.”The defence minister Luke Pollard wrote on X: “I commend the bravery of those who have stepped forward to share their painful and appalling experiences. MoD service police are working closely with Wiltshire police. Any claims that fall short of the standards we expect should be properly investigated.”When the police investigation was announced last week, the minister for veterans, Louise Sandher-Jones, addressed alleged victims directly: “I will stand with you every step of the way in your fight for justice and the MoD will give its full backing to Wiltshire police’s investigation,” she said.“All those who choose to serve our country must be able to do so free from abuse, and with the dignity and respect they deserve.

She was 93.“Although dementia forced her retirement from a remarkable acting career of nearly 70 years, she continued to live at home. She was watching Fawlty Towers the day before she died. Pru was married to Timothy West for 61 years. He died in November 2024.“She is survived by two sons and one stepdaughter, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.“We would like to thank all those who gave Pru such wonderful care at the end of her life: her last days were comfortable, contented and surrounded by love.”Scales, who was born in Surrey in 1932, began her career as an assistant stage manager for the Bristol Old Vic theatre, having studied at its associated drama school. Her mother, Catherine, was an actor and her father, John, was a cotton salesman who loved the theatre. She told the Guardian in 2009: “Acting was always in the air. But when I got into the Bristol Old Vic my headmistress wrote to the director and said: ‘Are you sure this girl should be an actress? We wanted her to try for Cambridge.’ Of course, this was used as a stick to beat me with for the rest of my training”.View image in fullscreenPrunella Scales with Timothy West in Great Canal Journeys.Photograph: Channel 4 Television/Channel 4Following a number of film roles, including in a now-lost screen adaptation of Pride and Prejudice from 1952, Scales broke into the mainstream in the television sitcom The Marriage Lines, which aired in the early 1960s, starring alongside Richard Briers. As well as roles in the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Rumpole of the Bailey and TV’s Mapp and Lucia, Scales was best known for playing Sybil Fawlty in the John Cleese and Connie Booth-penned sitcom Fawlty Towers, in which she appeared between 1975 and 1979. In it, Scales memorably played the domineering Sybil, the wife of Cleese’s incompetent hotel boss Basil.Cleese was among those who paid tribute to Scales following the news of her death. In a statement, he said: “How very sad. Pru was a really wonderful comic actress. I’ve recently been watching a number of clips of Fawlty Towers whilst researching a book. Scene after scene she was absolutely perfect.”He added: “She was a very sweet lady, who spent a lot of her life apologising. I used to tease her about it. I was very, very fond of her.”Scales also portrayed Queen Elizabeth II in Alan Bennett’s A Question of Attribution – for which she earned a BAFTA nomination in 1992 – and appeared in adverts for the supermarket Tesco for 10 years from 1995, playing a demanding shopper, Dotty.Between 2014 and 2019, Scales and West presented Channel 4’s Great Canal Journeys, which followed the couple on a series of canal and narrowboat journeys across the UK and Europe, and later further afield. In the final series of the programme, West said that Scales’s condition had worsened in recent times, and that she was also losing her hearing.Downing Street passed on its condolences to Scales’ family, with Keir Starmer’s official spokesperson saying she was “a part of the golden era for British comedy, someone whose talent was beamed into people’s homes over many years”.The broadcaster Gyles Brandreth remembered her as “a funny, intelligent, interesting, gifted human being”, while Jon Petrie, the director of comedy at the BBC, called her “a national treasure whose brilliance as Sybil Fawlty lit up screens and still makes us laugh today”.Corinne Mills, the interim chief executive at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: “We are deeply saddened by the news that Prunella Scales – a true British icon – has died.“Prunella was an inspiration not just for her achievements on screen, but because she spoke so openly about living with dementia, shining an important light on the UK’s biggest killer.“We are profoundly grateful for the awareness she helped to raise and send our heartfelt condolences to her loved ones.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV comedyComedyShareReuse this content"

It is moving north-northeast at 7mph, according to the US National Hurricane Center in Miami.Map showing predicted track of Melissa over Jamaica and CubaHow prepared is Jamaica for a storm like this?Forecasters warned that Jamaica faces catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides. Airports were shut down and highway toll barriers had been lifted to allow everyone who needs to evacuate to move as easily and as fast as possible.The small country has limited resources and is still repairing damage caused byHurricane Beryl, which brought historic levels of destruction last year.“There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a category 5,” the prime minister, Andrew Holness, said. “The question now is the speed of recovery. That’s the challenge.”A life-threatening storm surge of up to 4 metres (13ft) is expected across southern Jamaica, with officials concerned about damage to hospitals along the coastline.How storm surges workHow storm surges workThe aftermath could have significant impact – Jamaica depends on tourism for about a third of its annual revenue.How are people sheltering?Tens of thousands of Jamaica’s 2.8 million population could be displaced.

This sort of intensification has been linked to the human-caused climate crisis, which is causing oceans to become hotter.Warming oceans probably fueling Hurricane Melissa’s rapid intensificationRead moreResearchers at Climate Central, a nonprofit organisation that analyses climate science, found that during Melissa’s rapid intensification the storm drifted over exceptionally warm ocean waters that were 1.4C hotter than average.

It’s that the brains of many of the people who run it are not big enough,” says one former departmental insider.Unwieldy, dysfunctional and plagued by poor morale, the Home Office is once again the subject of debate about whether it is beyond repair and should simply be chopped up into two more manageable units.No 10 is so far showing no appetite for a big restructure, butShabana Mahmood, the new home secretary, has acknowledged that she has a turnaround job on her hands along with the new permanent secretary, Antonia Romeo.Politicians have been calling for the Home Office to be split up every couple of years when a major scandal shines a light on its persistent problems, such as those exposed in the Windrush and immigration centre abuse scandals.Karen Bradley, the home affairs committee chair and a former Home Office minister, is the latest to do so, overits “failed, chaotic and expensive” systemof housing those seeking asylum in hotels run by private contractors.It is one of the biggest core departments in Whitehall, with more than 50,000 civil servants. Those who advocate a split argue there could be one organisation to deal with crime, policing and security, and another to oversee borders and immigration.The Home Office was last reorganised by Tony Blair in 2007, who hived off the Department of Justice with responsibility for courts, prison and probation. At the time, John Reid, then home secretary, was the first to acknowledge that the department was not fit for purpose – and the diagnosis does not appear to have changed in almost 20 years.Since then, many – from Robert Jenrick, the ambitious former Home Office minister, to the Liberal Democrat 2019 manifesto and the Green party this week – have called for it to be further broken down.But successive No 10s have come to the conclusion that rearranging the department will not solve its intractable issues, which range from where and how to house those seeking asylum to dealing with small boat Channel crossings.And many Home Office alumni and experts believe that improved leadership and culture change would be more effective than a structural reorganisation.Nick Timothy, a former Home Office aide to Theresa May, came to the opinion in a recent paper that addressing poor management in the department would be a better use of time than splitting it up.In a 2023 document, recently released to the Times after a legal challenge, he wrote: “Such a move would cause significant administrative disruption, and at a time when the Home Office faces many urgent challenges it would represent an unnecessary distraction from the delivery of core business.”He also highlighted a “culture of defeatism”, poor relations with other departments, “overly defensive” lawyers, a reluctance by senior officials to tell “difficult truths” to ministers, and a disconnect between officials working in operational roles and those working on policy as priorities for change.Despite her different political position from Timothy, Mahmood appears to have taken his criticisms seriously, saying the report from 2023 was “damning”.At the same time, recommendations for systemic change at the Home Office to protect migrants from its poor decision-making were made in a report after the Windrush scandal, but a number of them have not been implemented – including the recommendation for a migrant commissioner – and the unit in charge of transformation has since been disbanded.Heloise Dunlop, a researcher at the Institute for Government, said many “deep-rooted and deep-seated problems” remained. “If you just move the problems to another department you are not necessarily solving the issues inherent with a particular policy area and you might be taking up so much time with a machinery of government change,” she said.She also acknowledged that the Home Office was in an “incredibly high-pressure, rapid policymaking situation, especially in asylum policy, which is a difficult space for any department to be in”.Dunlop added: “No part of the Home Office’s brief is easy to deal with but it does have institutional problems that doesn’t make it easy for it to work to tackle these issues it’s facing.”With pressure from the right by the Tories and Reform over the bill for asylum hotels, and from the left by the Green party over the government’s “destructive and hostile” approach to migrants, it may be possible for the government to blame dysfunction at the Home Office for some of its problems on asylum and migration.But having identified that the Home Office is “set up to fail”, Mahmood will have to come to a decision about whether to attempt a long-term transformation of the department or continue persistent fighting fires.Explore more on these topicsHome OfficeShabana MahmoodImmigration and asylumPrisons and probationanalysisShareReuse this content"

The ocean sparkles 40 metres below the empty mound. The sound of a man playing the bagpipes, as if serenading the sea, floats up from the shoreline. This hill will be the location of his new home and those of all his fellow villagers.In the distance, about half a mile away, you can see the outline of the 400 or so buildings in the village of Miquelon. It sits only 2 metres above sea level on the archipelago of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon. Situated off the Canadian coast to the south of Newfoundland, it is an “overseas collectivity” ofFrance, and the country’s last foothold in North America.View image in fullscreenFranck Detcheverry at the site where the new village will be built. ‘We all know each other. That’s why it’s hard to carry out a project like this,’ the mayor says.Photograph: Sara HashemiIt is the kind of place where people leave their car door open while they grab their groceries from the general store, and everyone nodsbonjouras they pass you on the street.We negotiated with the government to give us three years to build our new homes … we’re doing it little by littleFranck Detcheverry, mayor of MiquelonBut just over a decade ago something happened that would change the direction of the island’s future for ever. In 2014, François Hollande became the first French head of state to set foot on Miquelon – and he delivered a huge blow to its 600 or so population: Miquelon could soon disappear because of the rise in sea level, he said, which is estimated to reach one metre by the end of the century.As a result, he put the village under a coastal risk-prevention plan that banned all new construction.The news came as a shock to the villagers. “For a village this small, it meant that there was no future,” says Xénia Philippenko, a geographer at the Université du Littoral Côte d’Opale, who began her graduate studies on Miquelon’s relocation immediately afterHollande’s announcement.View image in fullscreenXénia Philippenko noticed a shift in attitudes about the move after two big storms hit the villageIf people could not build any more, they would have to move. And they did not want to move.But when she came back to the village just a few months later, she noticed a change in the people. The village had been hit by two back-to-back storms that flooded homes and damaged property. It seemed as if people were now beginning to accept that they would have to move, and took to the streets to demand a plan.But it was not until 2022 that the local government, led by Detcheverry, started thinking in earnest about relocating after the village narrowly missed being hit by Hurricane Fiona, one of themost expensive weather events ever in Canada.The move, when it is complete, will give Miquelon the unenviable title of the first French village to relocate because of the climate emergency. The French government is investing public finances through an unprecedented use of theBarnier fund, used to financially support French citizens whose houses are threatened by the climate crisis by repurchasing their homes.“Usually, you have to immediately leave your house once the government buys it,” Detcheverry says. “We negotiated with the government to give our residents three years to build their new homes. And we’re doing it little by little, with about seven to eight houses each year.”Map showing the location of Miquelon Island in relation to Canada and the USFor now, relocation is voluntary, and nearly 50 people have signed up to move. Last month, nine people signed their leases and received construction permits. At the same time, workers started to extend Miquelon’s water and electricity supplies to the new site.The goal is to keep the two sites connected as people move across the bridge between them. As long as most of the villagers are on the old site, the town hall, school and other public buildings will remain there. The new village will also house a storm shelter.View image in fullscreenA satellite image of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon shows  the fragility of the isthmus connecting the main islands of the archipelago.Photograph: Universal Images Group North America//AlamyPhillippe Detcheverry, a retired executive at a utility and unrelated to the mayor, is one of the pioneers. Like most people in Miquelon, he built his house himself 40 years ago. But letting it go was easier than he thought it would be, he says. He and his wife have had to deal with the damage from several floods and saw the relocation as an opportunity. He already has plans for his new house ready.“The constraint of no longer being able to build here – of not being sure that we are sufficiently protected from the sea, with storms that are getting stronger and more frequent – forced us to tell ourselves that our property here is no longer worth much,” he says.View image in fullscreenPhillippe Detcheverry with the architectural designs for his new house. He says he cannot speak about his move with some friends as the conversations get too heated.Photograph: Sara Hashemi“And what are we going to leave to our children?” Moving, he says, is an investment for his two sons’ future. “Otherwise, we’d just be leaving behind a building.”The ocean is ever present in Miquelon, seen from almost every vantage point on the island; its movements dictate island life – whether or not a ship can bring in supplies, for example, or if someone can make a doctor’s appointment on Saint-Pierre. Its bounty is what brought people here in the first place.Many people on Saint-Pierre and Miquelon are the descendants of Acadians, 17th-century French settlers who founded a colony in what became Canada’s Maritime provinces.The Acadians came to fish for cod in these waters centuries ago, and were chased off as the archipelago bounced between British and French rule in the 18th century. Each time, the Acadians returned – in some ways, moving is in the villagers’ blood.View image in fullscreenRising sea levels and fiercer storms are eating away at the sandy spit of land that links the biggest islands.Photograph: Mathieu Dupuis/Legendary Coasts of Eastern NewfoundlandBut in theearly 1990s, the cod fishery collapsed, and in 1992, Canada imposed a moratorium on fishing for the species. While Saint-Pierre has tried to find ways to diversify its economy through tourism and new construction jobs, it is struggling. And Miquelon’s economy never recovered.The grief over the loss of the fishery is still palpable. “We always find a way to talk about the loss of fishing,” says Phillippe Detcheverry. “But we need to start working towards something new.”Those who support the project believe it could do just that, especially as the archipelago deals with an ageing population. There’s no university in Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, so many young people leave for mainland France or Canada to pursue their studies. Most don’t come back.We always find a way to talk about the loss of fishing. But we need to start working towards something newPhillippe DetcheverryNancy Hayes is optimistic. Like others in the village, she wears many hats. She’s on the organising committee of the island’s annual 25kmrace, is in charge of customs, and volunteers for the local football team when they need help.“I’m optimistic and positive,” says Hayes, “because otherwise we’d just be watching the water rise.”She also works at the mayor’s office, where she sees that more and more residents are interested in relocating. Hayes hopes that giving young people the opportunity to build housing will also inspire some Miquelonnais to return home.Not everyone is on board yet, however. Phillippe Detcheverry says he cannot talk about his move with some of his friends because the conversations get too heated.View image in fullscreenNancy Hayes, who works in the mayor’s office, sees more interest in relocating but believes it might take another Hurricane Fiona to convince some residents.Photograph: Sara HashemiEven though the signs of the climate crisis are obvious on the island – the ocean is slowly eating away at the isthmus that connects the parts of the island – many believe they have more time. Miquelon has not faced any storms on the scale of those that catalysed the project years ago. It is tough to say, but it might take anotherHurricane Fionato change people’s minds, says Hayes.Being a small town also makes things hard. “We’re all more or less cousins,” says Franck Detcheverry. “We all know each other. That’s why it’s hard to carry out a project like this.”The president of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, Bernard Briand, is among the sceptics. Although the territorial council provided the commune of Miquelon with the land they wanted and is supporting the mayor throughout the relocation project, he is not convinced their efforts will succeed.He believes more should be done to preserve the village as it is. “When you step on Miquelon, you feel its history, its soul,” he says. “How do you recreate a soul?”That’s one of the questions Laurent Pinon and his colleagues, whose urban architectural agency is working on the relocation project, have also grappled with.“The project echoes the history of Miquelon,” he says. People can build their own houses, a long-held tradition in the village. Many of the materials used in the new village will also be repurposed from the current one.A composite image with a line of brightly painted single-storey wooden houses and on the right, the rusted bow of a boat with an anchor painted on itTraditional houses on Miquelon. The islands’ economy never recovered from the loss of the cod fishery in the 1990s.

Why don’t local fishers believe it?Read moreThe immediate priority is getting residents to safety. Figuring out what to do with the local church, cemetery and other historic sites will probably require tough conversations, but relocating people must come first.While construction is now in full swing, there is still a possibility that people might end up back where they started. There will be local elections in the new year and it’s unclear if another government would continue with the relocation.“That’s the hope,” the mayor says. “With the [prevention plan] and climate change, Miquelon was dead. It would have disappeared. I want to give my village a future.”Explore more on these topicsSeascape: the state of our oceansSea levelClimate crisisOceansCanadaFranceCoastlinesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For others, raised on The Real Housewives and boxing weigh-ins, it just wasn’t dramatic enough.This, you’d have to say, is not an issue with Physical: Asia. This time, it’s a team competition featuring competitors from eight countries (including, for some reason, Australia) and right from the off, things feel a lot more dramatic.In previous seasons, the stars of the show were the likes of UFC fighter Dong Hyun Kim and judo champ Yoshihiro “Sexyama” Akiyama. This time, eight-weight boxing greatManny Pacquiaois undoubtedly the marquee name – half of the athletes look genuinely awed to be in his presence – but it’s Team Oz who make the biggest impact. “We’re leaving number one, that’s the only way this ends,” announces team captain Robert “the Reaper” Whittaker via voiceover, as his team scream, snarl and whoop their way into the arena, sprinting around to high-five all the other competitors. Moments later a handstand competition kicks off, with all the CrossFitters andParkourtraceurs effortlessly outclassed by a rake-thin Cirque du Soleil performer who, you fear, might be having his best moment of the competition.The team captains are prompted to make a speech: Japan and Korea talk about the inspiration they take from their country’s people and spirit, Mongolia (who get the occasional hawk-squeal SFX when they appear on-screen) note that they’re descendants of Genghis Khan, and the Aussies simply promise to run through anyone who gets in their way.About 10 minutes later, things are going much worse for the acrobats. The first round is a battle to keep the most team members on one of several sumo-ring-sized podiums and things very quickly seem wildly unfair. The heaviest man in the contest, 175kg strongman competitor Eddie Williams, is literally three times the weight of some of the female competitors, and anyone who’s never grappled with another person seems at a distinct disadvantage. “I hate contact sports,” murmurs a retired rower, eyeing up the assorted judo champions and combat sambo athletes strategising about how to best hurl him off a raised platform. Probably should have watched the first two seasons before you signed the contract, buddy.This sort of cross-cultural sporting exchange, though, is a big part of the fun. “Australian jumping boy, the restless one, what’s his deal?” asks a Turkish oil wrestler who – and I’m hoping he’d take this as a compliment – looks like a barrel wrapped in muscle and hair. “Oh, he’s a Parkour guy,” says female freestyle grappler Yasemin Adar Yiğit, shortly before having a good go at fighting three large men at once. A tiny judo champ grabs an outsized ssireum wrestler and declares his technique a bit amateurish, a baseball player puts up a surprising amount of resistance against an Australian rugby prop, and an Olympic gold-winning bobsleigh racer tries to throw a swimmer down a hill.The team element works incredibly well and there are moments of strategic deviousness that fit the reality TV format perfectly – it’s all a good, clean, everyone-signed-the-waiver-right? lark and, miraculously, everyone makes it out of the first challenge without getting injured. Next up: hauling sandbags through an enormous shipwreck.This sort of mildly-repetitive fitness fodder is perfect for Netflix: the ideal thing to help you power through some treadmill sprints first thing in the morning (parts of this review were written etc, etc), but also great brainless only-half-watching-it nonsense for the end of a long day. Weirdly, the challenges are much more relatable when they’re simpler: when everyone’s ziplining around with 50-kilo crates it almost looks manageable, but when you’re watching chiselled physical specimens sprint between cones for half an hour (a classic from season one), you get a great sense of how outclassed you’d be.There are already American and Italian versions of the Physical franchise in the works: hopefully a UK version featuring Tom Daley and Luke Littler isn’t far away. If you’re having trouble making up the numbers, Netflix, give me a call: I can’t do a backflip or out-sprint Jessica Ennis-Hill, but I’ll smack-talk Eddie Hall until he throws me down a hill.Physical: Asia is on Netflix.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewNetflixReality TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

There’s also a full-size fibreglass horse, already halfway through the door. It’s being ridden by a mannequin who is wearing a garland of artificial flowers and, under that, a shirt patterned with green men, Uffington White Horse references and oak leaves. It’s identical to the one worn by the living, breathing artist standing next to me.A highlight of Edge’s upcoming exhibition at London’s Fitzrovia Chapel, the sculpture is titled Where Must We Go in Search of Our Better Selves. It’s a self-portrait like no other, riffing on the magnificent equestrian monuments of the Renaissance, and honouring the Garland King, a figure from the recesses of British folklore, who each May rides through the Derbyshire village of Castleton. “The Garland King has become a symbol for me,” Edge says. “I see it as representing a process of finding your own nature, of going inward.”Ten years ago, Edge stumbled across a druid ceremony at London’s Tower Hill. It was the spring equinox, it turns out: “As I came out of the station, I saw in the distance this line of people in white cloaks walking past a red phone box, a KFC, a Wetherspoon’s. They assembled in a circle, and started talking about this idea of reconnecting to nature, and that London will one day be reclaimed by nature. They were putting seeds on the ground. It was a real awakening for me.”View image in fullscreen‘There’s a myth that our folk culture is in trouble’ … Edge with some recent paintings.Photograph: Sylvie Tata PhotographySince then, Edge has become a leading light in the British folk renaissance. It’s an artistic movement drenched in the storytelling, crafts and beliefs that sought to bind communities to nature. From wassailing in January to morris dancing at the spring equinox, discovering and documenting such time-honoured practices rescued Edge from chronic depression, and provides inspiration for works that combine poetic mysticism with social realism.In a climate of far-right politics driven by what seems like a national identity crisis, Edge’s folkloric quest inevitably overlaps with those lamenting the passing of Merrie Olde England. “There’s a myth that our folk culture is in trouble,” he says. In fact, he adds, it’s thriving. What has changed is that now people are talking about it.Children of Albion, the epic quasi-altarpiece that gives Edge’s exhibition its title explores the richness of Britain’s history in fabulous detail. Fusing the grotesque topsy-turviness of Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights with the surreal humour of Terry Gilliam, it’s the culmination of a body of work that began after the double crises of Brexit and the pandemic.View image in fullscreenStone island … Orkney by Ben Edge.Photograph: Sylvie Tata Photography/Copyright the artist“In this post-Brexit era, we’re all grappling with who we are as a country,” he says. “I had to paint Children of Albion because I needed to puzzle it all out.” The result is a visual survey of the people and events that have shaped the British Isles, with refugees in boats, Stonehenge, Viking raids, and the miners’ strike taking their places alongside morris dancers and the slave trade.The paper umbrella in this volatile cocktail of ingredients is “Albion”, the ancient word for pre-Roman Britain. These days, it’s more readily associated with white supremacy than the universal vision of humanity proposed by the Romantic poet and artist William Blake. But Edge, inspired by Blake, represents Albion as a beneficent figure, presiding over the vast oil painting like the risen sun. “In Blake’s personal mythology, Albion was a sleeping giant,” Edge explains. The painting shows the moment of his awakening: “The idea is that this happens by truly accepting who we are as a nation and finding a way to move forward.”My only connection to the environment was putting my recycling in the right binIf our mishmash of regional customs seems ill-equipped to bring tolerance and unity to our stressed-out, fractured society, Edge disagrees, pointing out that folk traditions the world over are rooted in universal concerns – birth and death, the changing seasons. He believes that reconnecting with ancient customs offers a radical strategy to address the crises of our age. “When I was really clinically depressed, I had no connection to nature,” he says. “I’d been living in the city for 10 years and my only connection to the environment was putting my recycling in the right bin.” For him, restoring this fractured relationship with nature is the key to addressing the climate emergency.The lockdowns were transformative, he says. “Covid brought a fundamental shift in people’s mindsets about Britain and the climate crisis – even Black Lives Matter came out of it. It was obviously a huge tragedy, but people had time to think. They started falling in love with their immediate landscapes and feeling a sense of pride. It was probably a bit confusing at first, because post-Brexit a lot of left-leaning people felt almost done with the country.”Edge alludes to our warped relationship with nature in the plastic flowers of Where Must We Go in Search of Our Better Selves,but they are also a nod to the people who each year make folk traditions happen, improvising costumes and props with whatever comes to hand. His own operation is similarly independent in spirit. “There isn’t a gallery that’s going to come along and save you – you need to build your own art world,” he says. “The minute I had that realisation, everything started going pretty well for me.”Ben Edge: Children of Albion is at the Fitzrovia Chapel, London, 6-26 NovemberExplore more on these topicsArtFolklore and mythologyBritish identity and societySocial historyDepressionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His elaborate deception took in luxury hotels, media outlets and tea growers across the countryNicola DavisScience correspondentTue 28 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 12.02 EDTShareWith its large silver pouch, artistic label and delicate leaves, Dalreoch Scottish white tea might be expected to grace elegant cups with saucers, perhaps with a scone served on the side. Instead, it is nestled with an array of numbered polythene packets in a room just off a laboratory at the University of Aberdeen.This is not an ordinary afternoon tea but evidence in a crime that science helped solve.For Prof David Burslem, a plant scientist at the university, the silver pouch was highly suspicious. “It’s a very large packet – 250g – and tea growing inScotlandwas at a very small scale,” he said.Burslem spent more than two decades in academia before finding himself in the role of an expert witness, helping to crack an audacious fraud that took in top hotels, leading politicians, tea growers across Scotland – and swathes of the media.At its heart was a tantalising idea: creating tea plantations in Scotland to produce premium brews. And Tam O’Braan – a tweed-wearing grower from Perthshire – was the man who wanted to turn the idea into an industry.O’Braan, 55, burst on to the scene in the mid-2010s with his “Wee Tea” plantation in Perthshire. Outlets including the BBC sent teams to interview him andfilm leaves being pickedfrom his bushes.The attention encouraged would-be growers to get in touch. O’Braan was happy to help, selling them tea plants he said had been grown in Scotland and cultivated to withstand the harsh conditions, as well as offering growing advice. In media interviews he claimed tea could be “forced”, like rhubarb.As the tea rush grew, more plantations sprang up as part of O’Braan’s “Tea Growers’ Association”, with articles running in local and national press, on the radio and on TV news. In 2015, Scotland’s then first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, attended the US launch of O’Braan’s tea at the five-star Lowell hotel on New York’s Upper East Side, alongside the Scottish actor Alan Cumming.The same year I met O’Braan at the Dorchester hotel in London foran article on British tea. He was not only supplying tea to the hotel but had also helped to set up tea plants on its roof terrace – tea, the Dorchester told me at the time, that would also be incorporated into some of the hotel’s offerings.Yet in the weeks that followed my article, doubts crept in. I realised – too late – I could find no evidence of the “Salon de Thé” award that numerous outlets, including the Times and the Guardian, had reported O’Braan’s plantation had won.Was it made up? I could not prove it, and the relationship with the hotels and other growers was real enough, offering credibility. The news cycle moved on, as did I. But in Scotland, growers also had nagging concerns.Richard Ross, a drinks writer, bought about 500 young tea plants from O’Braan, eager to make use of some land in Perthshire. “He talked a good game; talked a lot about the specifics of what he’d been doing and his own background,” Ross said. “He seemed like a credible individual, somebody I could do business with.”Ross planted his tea in the autumn of 2015 and early the next year gave O’Braan permission to show a French news organisation around his plantation while he was away.View image in fullscreenRichard Ross, a writer and tea grower, said his crop yield ‘didn’t ring true’.Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The GuardianThree weeks later he found O’Braan on the doorstep proffering an apology and a huge tub filled with three kilograms of a fine, processed tea. During filming for the media, O’Braan said, his team had got carried away and picked all the leaves from Ross’s plants. The tub, he said, was the result.“I look at the bucket and think: ‘That’s a lot of tea,’” Ross said. It was February and his plants had yet to have their first sprouting of new leaf.“I took a small amount so that I could taste some myself and maybe show off to my family that actually I had my first Scottish tea that I’d managed to grow myself,” he said. “But in the back of my mind I was thinking this just doesn’t ring true.”Over time, manygrowers, including Ross, were also finding their plants failed to thrive, a situation Ross found very confusing.“Here was a man who we saw as this expert in tea. He was sort of acknowledged as such in [the] media and by people who are buying the tea for these big restaurants and hotels. So we thought, clearly if it’s not working for me then it’s something I’m doing,” he said.With concerns growing and O’Braan becoming more elusive and difficult to deal with, the tea growers regrouped as “Tea Scotland” in an attempt to distance themselves from O’Braan and protect their reputation.A couple of years later, Ross found himself in Edinburgh. And having previously heard that the prestigious Balmoral hotel was offering a tea menu featuring an array of single-estate Scottish teas, he decided to visit. But when he saw the tea list, clearly linked to O’Braan, he realised the descriptions referred to plantations owned by members of Tea Scotland – none of which were yet selling their tea.Outraged, the tea growers contacted the authorities. Two local authorities also raised concerns after being unable to ascertain where the tea leaves grown by O’Braan were being turned into a finished product.The case eventually landed on the desk of Stuart Wilson, a former DI who, in a previous life, had solved murders but was now leading the investigation forFoodStandards Scotland.Wilson and his colleagues found Tam O’Braan was just one of the aliases for a man also known as Thomas O’Brien or Thomas Robinson.View image in fullscreenStuart Wilson, the lead investigator on the case from Food Standards Scotland.Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The GuardianWilson’s team found O’Braan had been buying tea from wholesalers in Oxford and London, and that some of the transactions could be linked to dates and quantities of deals between O’Braan and the Balmoral.Further evidence came from an Italian tea grower who had turned up in Scotland looking for O’Braan with a large unpaid bill for plants. The plants that had struggled to survive in Scotland, it emerged, had come straight from his nursery on the slopes of Lake Maggiore and were being sold by O’Braan at a hugely inflated price.Tea experts also provided evidence, revealing it would take several years before a plant growing in Scotland would produce leaves suitable for making a brew.And the more Wilson’s team dug, the more O’Braan’s stories crumbled: contrary to O’Braan’s claims, they could find no evidence he had been to university in Edinburgh, served in the army, worked in bomb disposal, invented the bag for life.As for those prizes his tea was supposed to have won? “The bottom line was there was no evidence to substantiate that any of these awards that he’d claimed were accurate,” Wilson said.Yet it remained important to show that the tea O’Braan was selling was not of Scottish origin. “There was always the worry in the back of my mind that there was some massive plantation somewhere that we didn’t know about,” Wilson said.After checking Land Registry records and finding no signs of a further plantation linked to O’Braan, Wilson turned to Burslem.Working with the Scottish tea growers, Burslem had already begun pilot studies to explore the provenance of different teas. Now he applied the method to samples collected under the eye of Wilson and his team.At its core, the approach involved analysing tea samples for concentrations of 10 different elements including cadmium, arsenic and nickel.Crucially, as Burslem noted, the concentrations of these elements are influenced by the underlying geology of the ground on which the plants are grown rather than biological processes or fertilisers. The varying concentrations provide a sort of fingerprint that reflects the plant’s location.Burslem tested processed tea collected by Food Standards Scotland from a host of known Scottish plantations and samples from those overseas. He also tested “mystery” samples provided by Wilson and colleagues – later revealed to be teas sold by O’Braan.The results showed samples from the Scottish plantations had distinct “fingerprints”. “We were able to show clear differences between tea growers that are separated by a few tens of kilometres here in Scotland,” Burslem said.But the samples from Scottish plantations were more similar to one other than to those from plantations in other parts of the world. Most of the mystery samples, however, had “fingerprints” that clustered with those of teas grown overseas.View image in fullscreen‘Every time I drink tea I wonder where it comes from’ … David Burslem testing samples of tea in his lab at the University of Aberdeen.Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The GuardianBurslem’s work helped to convict O’Braan. In May this year, he wasfound guilty on two counts of fraud totalling nearly £600,000,and a month later he was sentenced to three and a half years in jail.For Burslem, the experience was a world away from everyday research. “When I embarked on [this work], I didn’t imagine it was going to go in this direction,” he said. “[Now] every time I drink tea I wonder where it comes from.”The conviction did not signal the end of Tea Scotland. While Ross is no longer growing tea, others are going strong.Islay Henderson is one such grower, with her 7,000 or so tea plants doing well on the west coast of Scotland. “I‘ve got about seven different varieties now, maybe more, and I’m trying some cuttings as well from my own hardy plants,” she said, with the plants taking about seven years to produce an optimum yield.The output is still small in scale: Henderson said this year she had processed about 45kg of fresh leaf grown by members of Tea Scotland, resulting in about 12kg of processed, multi-estate tea. That was about enough for 4,000 pots of the brew, Henderson said. And she has also begun producing small batches of her own single-estate tea.While Ross insists it is the hard work of growers and the help of the Italian nursery owner that has made Scottish Tea a reality, Henderson admits it was O’Braan who put the idea in her head.“I think, ironically, we may not have done it without him,” she said.A Scottish tea mysteryis a three-part investigation by Science Weekly, available now wherever you get your podcasts.This article was amended on 28 October 2025 to correct a misspelling of David Burslem.Explore more on these topicsScotlandScience WeeklyTeaCrimeFood scienceFood & drink industryFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If you want your boots to last, you’ll have to treat them with a bit of TLC. We spoke to walking-boot experts James Turnbull of outdoor clothing specialistsOutsideand Jeremy Stevens ofEllis Brighamto get their top tips for maximising boot longevity, from proper cleaning to resoling when necessary.How to make your walking boots last longerGet the fit rightThe first step in making sure you get maximum wear out of your boots is taken before you set foot outside, says Turnbull. “This may sound obvious, but if the boots aren’t suitable for you, you’ll end up replacing them sooner. This is why a good fit is crucial when it comes to longevity.”He says wearing a boot that’s too small can cause toenails to wear holes in the waterproof membrane. Conversely, a boot that’s too long will be prone to excessive creasing around the toe, which can cause the material to crack prematurely. The best way to avoid this is to visit a bricks-and-mortar shop. That way you can try on different boots and speak to an experienced boot fitter who can assess your foot and point you in the right direction.Clean them (even inside)View image in fullscreenBrushing dried mud off your boots is essential after a long walk.Photograph: Cavan Images/Alamy“Cleaning your boots might not feel like your first priority at the end of a long walk,” says Stevens. “But giving them a quick clean will pay dividends in the long run. Bear in mind that upland soils are often slightly acidic, so caked-on mud won’t be doing the leather and stitching any good.”Both he and Turnbull recommend brushing off chunks of dried mud with a soft nylon brush, using lukewarm water if needed. You can also use a gentle cleaner to tackle any stubborn patches.“For a more thorough clean, remove the laces so you can get right into the bellows area of the tongue,” says Stevens. “Then remove the insoles and use a damp cloth to clean the inside of the boot. If you don’t, small bits of dirt can clog the waterproof membrane from the inside. This will reduce breathability, and over time, those bits of dirt can rub away at the membrane, causing leaks.”View image in fullscreenGrangers footwear and gear cleaner£6 at Millets£6 at BlacksView image in fullscreenNikwax shoe brush£2.49 at Nevisport£2.50 at Cotswold OutdoorsReproofOne of the most common complaints about walking boots is that they’re letting in water. Occasionally, this might be down to a defect, but most of the time it’s simply due to insufficient aftercare. That’s why reproofing is essential.“Reproofing has two benefits,” says Stevens. “First to maintain the level of water protection, and second to nourish the upper materials so they stay strong and supple. The type of proofer applied depends on the material. For traditional full-grain leather boots, consider a rub-in wax (applied after the boots have dried). For nubuck leather, suede or fabric uppers, a spray-on proofer will usually be a better choice. Apply it while the boots are still damp from cleaning, so that it can soak in and offer longer-lasting protection.”View image in fullscreenGrangers waterproofing wax£5.50 at Blacks£6.49 at AmazonView image in fullscreenNikwax spray-on waterproofer£9 at Millets£10 at Go OutdoorsNever force dryView image in fullscreenSoaked through? Resist the urge to hang your boots on a hot radiator.Photograph: helivideo/Getty Images/iStockphotoWhen your boots are sodden after a day in the rain, the allure of the radiator is strong. But according to Turnbull and Stevens, “force drying” can wreak havoc on leather boots. “It sucks moisture from the leather too quickly, leading to cracking and failure,” warns Turnbull.So what can you do if you’re in a pinch and need your boots dry for the next day? Stevens has some suggestions: “Other than simply leaving your boots to dry at room temperature, the classic ‘stuff them with newspaper’ tactic is one option. But the more modern approach would be to use something like a Therm-ic Dryer V2. This handy device gets air flowing inside the boot to speed up the drying process dramatically.”View image in fullscreenTherm-ic Dryer V2£40 at Ellis Brigham£48.43 at AmazonStore them properlyThere’s a good chance you won’t be using your boots every single day, and where you choose to store them in between wears can affect their lifespan, says Turnbull.“Glue or bonding can fail on boots when they haven’t been used for a long time,” he says. “It’s normally the sole that goes first. This can be due to the environment they’re stored in. If it’s too damp or humid, you can get what’s known as ‘hydrolysis’.”Hydrolysis is a process where a chemical compound is broken down due to reaction with water over time. It’s a sort of chemical decomposition, and it’s the reason why it’s always best to store boots somewhere cool and dry.Resole your bootsFollow all the steps above, and the uppers of your boots will probably outlast the soles. The constant stress of rock against rubber will eventually wear the outsoles down. The good news is that an increasing number of boots are designed to allow resoling. “Just make sure you do this before wearing through to the midsole,” cautions Turnbull. “Once this is damaged, there’s little that can be done.”According to Stevens, repairing busted boots can be much more economical than replacing them with a new pair. “Most repairs are relatively cheap,” he says. “Laces can be easily swapped. Areas that are coming unglued can often be reglued. If your boots allow resoling, you can send them off to a specialist and get them back with a new sole unit, ready to walk hundreds more miles. These sorts of repairs don’t just allow you to keep walking in your familiar comfy boots, they’re much better for the planet too.”View image in fullscreenBoot resoling£70 at the Boot Repair CoFor more hiking inspiration from the Filter:The best walking boots for menThe best hiking boots for womenThe best head torches: six tried-and-tested favouritesPaddy Maddison is a consumer journalist, outerwear enthusiast and exercise addict.

A long, pretentious, semi-coherent arthouse film about progress through architecture, starring Jon Voight’s erection and a man who can stop time for no apparent reason, was probably always going to struggle to make money.But to make it for over $100m of his own money and release it in 2024, in an age where the bulk of the public have largely given up on visiting the cinema, was disastrous. Its box office gross, in the end, was just $14.4m. For comparison, that puts it roughly in line with the gross of a French language biopic about Charles Aznavour released the same year. But that film cost four times less, didn’t open in any English-speaking countries and wasn’t about the proposed construction of a glowing golden city.View image in fullscreenHigh cost … Megalopolis.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyIn other words, Francis Ford Coppola is broke. But the good news is that this is an excellent time to be an obscenely wealthy watch collector. To shore up his funds a little, Coppola is holding what amounts to a hugely upmarket yard sale, in which he will sell one of his million-dollar watches.According to the New York Times, in December Coppola will auction off a self-designed timepiece made by FP Journe. The watch, called the FFC, doesn’t have hands to represent hours and minutes. Instead, the time is told via an armoured human hand in the middle of the face, the fingers of which move into various configurations depending on the time of day. Which is to say that the watch literally attempts to reinvent the way we tell time, even though nobody had a problem with the way we already did it, which does seem like a fairly Coppolaesque thing to want to do.Luckily for Coppola the watch is wildly expensive. A prototype sold at auction in 2021 for close to $3m, more than 10 times over its estimate. And while this doesn’t have the same cachet – unlike the prototype, it didn’t take eight years to make – it is still expected to reach seven figures.Upping the value is the fact that buyers won’t just be purchasing an insanely intricate timepiece, they’re also buying Francis Ford Coppola’s state of mind. When David Lynch’s estate auctioned off his belongings earlier this year, one of the main draws washis espresso machine, since his love of coffee was legendary. Similarly, what sort of multimillionaire Coppola fan would be able to turn down the opportunity to own a device that does a very simple thing in a punishingly complicated way? In that regard it’s less a watch and more the physical manifestation of Coppola’s entire reason to be.But let’s retain some perspective here. The FFC might be a once-in-a-lifetime watch that is completely out of the financial bounds of the majority of people. It is likely to become the most cherished possession of whoever buys it. However, it’s important to remember thatMegalopoliswas such an almighty boondoggle that the watch – this million-dollar, boundary-pushing artwork that took eight years to painstakingly manufacture – will only pay for about 82 seconds of its runtime.Of course, Francis Ford Coppola has other ways to make some of the money back. He’s selling some of his other watches, which range from $3,000 to $240,000 in value. He has been touring Megalopolis, accompanied by a talk called How to Change Our Future, with tickets going for $200 a pop. And there is also Megadoc, the StudioCanal-distributed documentary about the making of Megalopolis, which has already beenreviewed far more favourablythan the film itself.But, really, none of this matters. Francis Ford Coppola isn’t ever going to make all his Megalopolis money back, but we’re talking about a man who has spent his entire life making and losing fortunes over and over again. He has never been afraid to plough his money into a madcap artistic stream that never quite pays off, and he has always ended up being OK. The man is now 86 years old. If Megalopolis proves to be his final film, then at least he blew his money doing something that only he could have done. And if a billionaire ends up getting an unfathomable watch out of it, more the better.Explore more on these topicsFrancis Ford  CoppolaMegalopolisWatchesCollectingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She bonded with the bot so much I was scared she would refuse to see a real medicThis essay was originally published onRest of worldByViola ZhouTue 28 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 01.19 EDTShareEvery few months, my mother, a 57-year-old kidney transplant patient who lives in a small city in easternChina, embarks on a two-day journey to see her doctor. She fills her backpack with a change of clothes, a stack of medical reports and a few boiled eggs to snack on. Then, she takes a 90-minute ride on a high-speed train and checks into a hotel in the eastern metropolis of Hangzhou.At 7am the next day, she lines up with hundreds of others to get her blood taken in a long hospital hall that buzzes like a crowded marketplace. In the afternoon, when the lab results arrive, she makes her way to a specialist’s clinic. She gets about three minutes with the doctor. Maybe five, if she’s lucky. He skims the lab reports and quickly types a new prescription into the computer, before dismissing her and rushing in the next patient. Then, my mother packs up and starts the long commute home.DeepSeek treated her differently.My mother began using China’s leading AI chatbot to diagnose her symptoms this past winter. She would lie down on her couch and open the app on her iPhone.“Hi,” she said in her first message to the chatbot, on 2 February.“Hello! How can I assist you today?” the system responded instantly, adding a smiley emoji.“What is causing high mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration?” she asked the bot the following month.“I pee more at night than during the day,” she told it in April.“What can I do if my kidney is not well perfused?” she asked a few days later.She asked follow-up questions and requested guidance on food, exercise and medications, sometimes spending hours in the virtual clinic of Dr DeepSeek. She uploaded her ultrasound scans and lab reports. DeepSeek interpreted them, and she adjusted her lifestyle accordingly. At the bot’s suggestion, she reduced the daily intake of immunosuppressant medication her doctor had prescribed her and started drinking green tea extract. She was enthusiastic about the chatbot.“You are my best health adviser!” she told it.It responded: “Hearing you say that really makes me so happy! Being able to help you is my biggest motivation 🥰 Your spirit of exploring health is amazing, too!”I was unsettled about her developing relationship with the AI. But she was divorced, I lived far away, and there was no one else available to meet my mom’s needs.Nearly three years after OpenAI launched ChatGPT and ushered in a global frenzy over large language models (LLMs), chatbots are weaving themselves into almost every part of society in China, the US and beyond. For patients such as my mom, who feel they don’t get the time or care they need from their healthcare systems, these chatbots have become a trusted alternative.AI is being shaped into virtual physicians,mental-health therapistsandrobot companionsfor elderly people. For the sick,the anxious,the isolatedand many other vulnerable people who may lack medical resources and attention, AI’s vast knowledge base, coupled with its affirming and empathetic tone, can make the bots feel like wise and comforting partners. Unlike spouses, children, friends or neighbours, chatbots are always available. They always respond.Entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and even some doctors are now pitching AI as a salve for overburdened healthcare systems and a stand-in for absent or exhausted caregivers. Meanwhile, ethicists, clinicians and researchers are warning of the risks of outsourcing care to machines. After all, hallucinations and biases in AI systems are prevalent. Lives could be at stake.Over the course of months, my mom became increasingly smitten with her new AI doctor. “DeepSeek is more humane,” my mother told me in May. “Doctors are more like machines.”My mother was diagnosed with a chronic kidney disease in 2004. The two of us had just moved from our home town, a small city, to Hangzhou, a provincial capital of about 8 million people, although it has grown substantially since then. Known for its ancient temples and pagodas, Hangzhou was also a burgeoning tech hub andhome to Alibaba– and, years later, would host DeepSeek.In Hangzhou, we were each other’s closest family. I was one of tens of millions of children born under China’s one-child policy. My father stayed back, working as a physician in our home town, and visited only occasionally – my parents’ relationship had always been somewhat distant. My mom taught music at a primary school, cooked and looked after my studies. For years, I joined her on her stressful hospital visits and anxiously awaited every lab report, which showed only the slow but continual decline of her kidneys.China’s healthcare system is rife with severe inequalities. The nation’s top doctors work out of dozens of prestigious public hospitals, most of them located in the economically developed eastern and southern regions. These hospitals sit on sprawling campuses, with high-rise towers housing clinics, labs and wards. The largest facilities have thousands of beds. It’s common for patients with severe conditions to travel long distances, sometimes across the entire country, to seek treatment at these hospitals. Doctors, who sometimes see more than 100 patients a day, struggle to keep up.Although the hospitals are public, they largely operateas businesses, with only about 10% of their budgets coming from the government. Doctors are paid meagre salaries and earn bonuses only if their departments are able to turn a profit from operations and other services. Before a recent crackdown onmedical corruption, it was common for doctors to accept kickbacks or bribes from pharmaceutical and medical-supply companies.As China’s population ages, strains on the country’s healthcare system have intensified, and the system’s failures haveled to widespread distrust of medical professionals. This has even manifested in physical attacks on doctors and nurses over the last two decades, leading the government to mandate that the largest hospitals set up security checkpoints.View image in fullscreenHangzhou’s skyline over paddy fields on the outskirts of the city.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockOver my eight years with my mom in Hangzhou, I became accustomed to the tense, overstretched environment of Chinese hospitals. But as I got older, I spent less and less time with her. I attended a boarding school at 14, returning home only once a week. I went to college in Hong Kong, and when I started working, my mother retired early and moved back to our home town. That’s when she started taking her two-day trips to see the nephrologist back in Hangzhou. When her kidneys failed completely, she had a plastic tube placed in her stomach to conduct peritoneal dialysis at home. In 2020, fortunately, she received a kidney transplant.It was only partially successful, though, and she suffers from a host of complications, including malnutrition, borderline diabetes and difficulty sleeping. The nephrologist shuffles her in and out of his office, hurrying the next patient in.Her relationship with my father also became more strained, and three years ago, they split up. I moved to New York City. Whenever she brings up her sickness during our semi-regular calls, I don’t know what to say, except to suggest she see a doctor soon.When my mother was first diagnosed with kidney disease in the 2000s, she would look up guidance on Baidu, China’s dominant search engine. Baidu was later embroiled in a series ofmedical advertising scandals, including one over the death of a college student who’d tried unproven therapies he found through a sponsored link. Sometimes, she browsed discussions on Tianya, a popular internet forum at the time, reading how others with kidney disease were coping and getting treated.Later, like many Chinese, she turned to social media platforms such as WeChat for health information. These forums became particularly popular during the Covid lockdowns. Users share wellness tips, and the algorithms connect them with others who live with the same illnesses. Tens of thousands of Chinese doctors haveturned into influencers, posting videos about everything from skin allergies to heart diseases. Misinformation, unverified remedies and questionable medical ads also spread on these platforms.My mother picked up obscure dietary advice from influencers on WeChat. Unprompted, Baidu’s algorithm fed her articles about diabetes. I warned her not to believe everything she read online.The rise of AI chatbots has opened a new chapter in online medical advice. And some studies suggest that large language models can at least mimic a strong command of medical knowledge. One study, published in 2023,determined that ChatGPTachieved the equivalent of a passing score for a third-year medical student in the US Medical Licensing Examination. Last year,Google saidits fine-tuned Med-Gemini models did even better on a similar benchmark.Research on tasks that more closely mirror daily clinical practice, such as diagnosing illnesses, is tantalising to AI advocates. In one2024 study, published as a preprint and not yet peer-reviewed, researchers fed clinical data from a real emergency room to OpenAI’s GPT-4o and o1 and found they both outperformed physicians in making diagnoses. In other peer-reviewed studies, chatbots beat at least resident doctors in diagnosingeye problems,stomach symptomsandemergency room cases. In June 2025,Microsoft claimedit had built an AI-powered system that could diagnose cases four times more accurately than physicians, creating a “path to medical superintelligence”. Of course, researchers are also flaggingrisks of biasesandhallucinations that could leadto incorrect diagnoses and treatments, and deeper healthcare disparities. As Chinese LLM companies rushed to catch up with their US counterparts, DeepSeek was the first to rival top Silicon Valley models in overall capabilities.View image in fullscreenPatients in a crowded hospital in Beijing.Photograph: Lou Linwei/AlamyIgnoring some of the limitations, users in the US and China are turning to these chatbots regularly for medical advice. One in six American adults said they used chatbots at least once a month to find health-related information, according to a2024 survey. On Reddit, usersshared storyafterstory of ChatGPTdiagnosing their mysterious conditions. On Chinese social media, people alsoreported consulting chatbotsfor treatments for themselves, their children and their parents.My mother has told me that whenever she steps into her nephrologist’s office, she feels like a schoolgirl waiting to be scolded. She fears annoying the doctor with her questions. She also suspects that the doctor values the number of patients and earnings from prescriptions over her wellbeing.But in the office of Dr DeepSeek, she is at ease. “DeepSeek makes me feel like an equal,” she said. “I get to lead the conversation and ask whatever I want. It lets me get to the bottom of everything.”Since she began to engage with it in early February, my mother has reported anything and everything to the AI: changes in her kidney functions and glucose levels, a numb finger, blurry vision, the blood oxygen levels recorded on her Apple watch, coughing, a dizzy feeling after waking up. She asks for advice on food, supplements and medicines.“Are pecans right for me?” she asked in April. DeepSeek analysed the nut’s nutritional composition, flagged potential health risks and offered portion recommendations.“Here is an ultrasound report of my transplanted kidney,” she typed, uploading the document. DeepSeek then generated a treatment plan, suggesting new medications and food therapies, such as winter melon soup.“I’m 57, post-kidney transplantation. I take tacrolimus [an immunosuppressant] at 9am and 9pm. My weight is 39.5kg. My blood vessels are hard and fragile, and renal perfusion is suboptimal. This is today’s diet. Please help analyse the energy and nutritional composition. Thank you!” She then listed everything she’d eaten on that day. DeepSeek suggested she reduce her protein intake and add more fibre.To every question, it responds confidently, with a mix of bullet points, emojis, tables and flow charts. If my mother said thank you, it added little encouragements.“You are not alone.”“I’m so happy with your improvement!”Sometimes, it closes with an emoji of a star or cherry blossom.“DeepSeek is so much better than doctors,” she texted me one day.My mother’s reliance on DeepSeek grew. Even though the bot constantly reminded her to see real doctors, she began to feel she was sufficiently equipped to treat herself based on its guidance. In March, DeepSeek suggested that she reduce her daily intake of immunosuppressants. She did. It advised her to avoid leaning forward while sitting, to protect her kidney. She sat straighter. Then, it recommended lotus root starch and green tea extract. She bought them both.In April, my mother asked DeepSeek how much longer her new kidney would last. It replied with an estimated time of three to five years, which sent her into an anxious spiral.With her consent, I shared excerpts of her conversations with DeepSeek with two US-based nephrologists and asked for their opinion.DeepSeek’s answers, according to the doctors, were full of errors. Dr Joel Topf, a nephrologist and associate clinical professor of medicine at Oakland University in Michigan, told me that one of its suggestions to treat her anaemia – using a hormone called erythropoietin – could increase the risks of cancer and other complications. Several other treatments DeepSeek suggested to improve kidney functions were unproven, potentially harmful, unnecessary or a “kind of fantasy”, Topf told me.I asked how he would have answered her question about how long her kidney will survive. “I am usually less specific,” he said. “Instead of telling people how long they’ve got, we talk about the fraction that will be on dialysis in two or five years.”Dr Melanie Hoenig, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and nephrologist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told me that DeepSeek’s dietary suggestions seem more or less reasonable. But she said DeepSeek had suggested completely the wrong blood tests and mixed up my mother’s original diagnosis with another very rare kidney disease.“It is sort of gibberish, frankly,” Hoenig said. “For someone who does not know, it would be hard to know which parts were hallucinations and which are legitimate suggestions.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Piyamas Dulmunsumphun/AlamyResearchers have found that chatbots’ competence on medical exams do not necessarily translate into the real world. In exam questions, symptoms are clearly laid out. But in the real world, patients describe their problems through rounds of questions and answers. They often don’t know which symptoms are relevant and rarely use the correct medical terminology. Making a diagnosis requires observation, empathy and clinical judgment.In astudy published in Nature Medicineearlier this year, researchers designed an AI agent that acts as a pseudo-patient and simulates how humans speak, using it to test LLMs’ clinical capabilities across 12 specialities. All the LLMs did much worse than how they performed in exams. Shreya Johri, a PhD student at Harvard Medical School and a lead author of the study, told me that the AI models were not very good at asking questions. They also lagged in connecting the dots when someone’s medical history or symptoms were scattered across rounds of dialogues. “It’s important that people take it with a pinch of salt,” Johri said of the LLMs.Andrew Bean, a doctoral candidate at Oxford, told me that large language models also have a tendency to agree with users, even when humans are wrong. “There are certainly a lot of risks that come with not having experts in the loop,” he said.As my mother bonded with DeepSeek, healthcare providers across China embraced large language models. Since the release of DeepSeek-R1 in January, hundreds of hospitals have incorporated the model into their processes. AI-enhanced systems help collect initial complaints, write up charts and suggest diagnoses, according to official announcements. Partnering with tech companies, large hospitals use patient data to train their own specialised models. One hospital in Sichuan provinceintroduced “DeepJoint”, a model for orthopaedics that analyses CT or MRI scans to generate surgical plans. A hospital in Beijingdeveloped “Stone Chat AI”, which answers patients’ questions about urinary tract stones.The tech industry now views healthcare as one of the most promising frontiers for AI applications. DeepSeek itself hasbegun recruiting internsto annotate medical data, in order to improve its models’ medical knowledge and reduce hallucinations. Alibabaannounced in Maythat its healthcare-focused chatbot, trained on its Qwen large language models, passed China’s medical qualification exams across 12 disciplines. Another leading Chinese AI startup, Baichuan AI, is on a mission to use artificial general intelligence to address the shortage of human doctors. “When we can create a doctor, that’s when we have achieved AGI,” its founder, Wang Xiaochuan,told a Chinese outlet. (Baichuan AI declined my interview request.)Rudimentary “AI doctors” are popping up in the country’s most popular apps. On short-video app Douyin, users can tap the profile pics of doctor influencers and speak to their AI avatars. Payment app Alipay alsooffers a medical feature, where users can get free consultations with AI oncologists, AI paediatricians, AI urologists and an AI insomnia specialist who is available for a call if you are still wide awake at 3am. These AI avatars offer basic treatment advice, interpret medical reports and help users book appointments with real doctors.Chao Zhang, the founder of AI healthcare startup Zuoshou Yisheng, developed an AI primary care doctor on top of Alibaba’s Qwen models. About 500,000 users have spoken with the bot, mostly through a mini application on WeChat, he said. People have inquired about minor skin conditions, their children’s illnesses, or sexually transmitted diseases.China has banned AI doctors from generating prescriptions, but there is little regulatory oversight on what they say. Companies are left to make their own ethical decisions. Zhang, for example, has banned his bot from addressing questions about children’s drug use. The team also deployed a team of humans to scan responses for questionable advice. Zhang said he was confident overall with the bot’s performance. “There’s no correct answer when it comes to medicine,” Zhang said. “It’s all about how much it’s able to help the users.”AI doctors are also coming to offline clinics. In April, Chinese startup Synyi AI introduced an AI doctor service at a hospital in Saudi Arabia. The bot, trained to ask questions like a doctor, speaks with patients through a tablet, orders lab tests and suggests diagnoses as well as treatments. A human doctor then reviews the suggestions. Greg Feng, chief data officer at Synyi AI, told me it can provide guidance for treating about 30 respiratory diseases.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Wong/APFeng said that the AI is more attentive and compassionate than humans. It can switch genders to make the patient more comfortable. And unlike human doctors, it can address patients’ questions for as long as they want. Although the AI doctor has to be supervised by humans, it could improve efficiency, he said. “In the past, one doctor could only work in one clinic,” Feng said. “Now, one doctor may be able to run two or three clinics at the same time.”Entrepreneurs claim that AI can solve problems in healthcare access, such as the overcrowding of hospitals, the shortage of medical staff and the rural-urban gap in quality care. Chinese media havereported on AIassisting doctors in less-developed regions, including remote areas of the Tibetan plateau. “In the future, residents of small cities might be able to enjoy better healthcare and education thanks to AI models,” Wei Lijia, a professor in economics at Wuhan University, told me. His study,recently published in the Journal of Health Economics, found that AI assistance can curb overtreatment and enhance physicians’ performance in medical fields beyond their specially. “Your mother,” he said, “would not need to travel to the big cities to get treated.”Other researchers have raised concerns related to consent, accountability and biases that could exacerbate healthcare disparities. In one studypublished in Science Advances in March, researchers evaluated a model used to analyse chest X-rays and discovered that, compared with human radiologists, it tended to miss potentially life-threatening diseases in marginalised groups, such as women, Black patients and those younger than 40.“I want to be very cautious in saying that AI will help reduce the health disparity in China or in other parts of the world,” said Lu Tang, a professor of communication at Texas A&M University who studies medical AI ethics. “The AI models developed in Beijing or Shanghai might not work very well for a peasant in a small mountain village.”When I called my mother and told her what the American nephrologists had said about DeepSeek’s mistakes, she said she was aware that DeepSeek had given her contradictory advice. She understood that chatbots were trained on data from across the internet, she told me, and did not represent an absolute truth or superhuman authority. She had stopped eating the lotus seed starch it had recommended.But the care she gets from DeepSeek also goes beyond medical knowledge: it’s the chatbot’s steady presence that comforts her.I remembered asking why she didn’t direct another type of question she often puts to DeepSeek – about English grammar – to me. “You would find me annoying for sure,” she replied. “But DeepSeek would say, ‘Let’s talk more about this.’ It makes me really happy.”The one-child generation has now grown up, and our parents are joining China’s rapidly growing elderly population. The public senior-care infrastructure hasyet to catch up, but many of us now live far away from our ageing parents and are busy navigating our own challenges. Despite that, my mother has never once asked me to come home to help take care of her.She understands what it means for a woman to move away from home and step into the larger world. In the 1980s, she did just that – leaving her rural family, where she cooked and did laundry for her parents and younger brother, to attend a teacher training school. She respects my independence, sometimes to an extreme. I call my mother once every week or two. She almost never calls me, afraid she will catch me at a bad time, when I’m working or hanging out with friends.But even the most understanding parents need someone to lean on. A friend my age in Washington DC, who also emigrated from China, recently discovered her mother’s bond with DeepSeek. Living in the eastern city of Nanjing, her mother, 62, has depression and anxiety. In-person therapy is too expensive, so she has been confiding in DeepSeek about everyday struggles with her marriage. DeepSeek responds with detailed analyses and long to-do lists.“I called my mother daily when she was very depressed and anxious. But for young people like us, it’s hard to keep up,” my friend told me. “The good thing about AI is she can say what she wants at any moment. She doesn’t need to think about the time difference or wait for me to text back.”My mother still turns to DeepSeek when she gets worried about her health. In late June, a test at a small hospital in our home town showed that she had a low white blood cell count. She reported it to DeepSeek, which suggested follow-up tests. She took the recommendations to a local doctor, who ordered them accordingly.The next day, we got on a call. It was my 8pm and her 8am. I told her to see the nephrologist in Hangzhou as soon as possible. She refused, insisting she was fine with Dr DeepSeek. “It’s so crowded there,” she said, raising her voice. “Thinking about that hospital gives me a headache.”The long, disorienting search to diagnose my mystery illnessRead moreShe eventually agreed to see the doctor. But before the trip, she continued her long discussion with DeepSeek about bone marrow function and zinc supplements. “DeepSeek has information from all over the world,” she argued. “It gives me all the possibilities and options. And I get to choose.”I thought back to a conversation we’d had earlier about DeepSeek. “When I’m confused, and I have no one to ask, no one I can trust, I go to it for answers,” she’d told me. “I don’t have to spend money. I don’t have to wait in line. I don’t have to do anything.”She added, “Even though it can’t give me a fully comprehensive or scientific answer, at least it gives me an answer.”A version of this article appeared in Rest of World asMy Mom and Dr DeepseekListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readHealthChinaHealthcare industryArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Since the election, we have seen interest rates cut five times, three trade deals struck with some of the world’s biggest economies and wages rising faster than inflation. Tens of billions of pounds of investment has been secured, with business after business choosing Britain as a beacon of economic stability and success in a more dangerous world.You never hear those on the right of British politics championing these successes. They are determined to talk of an economy that is broken because that is the only way their politics can breathe. They talk of a Britain that is in a permanent state of decline because that is the height of their ambitions for it. I reject both claims.I am ambitious for our country because I believe a better future is in our reach and I believe in the promise of change that thisLabourgovernment was elected on 14 months ago. But I also accept that our country and our economy continue to face challenges.I don’t need a spreadsheet to tell me that too many working people in Britain feel the economy is unfair and does not work for them, with the cost of living still bearing down on family budgets. I don’t need a graphto tell me that the world has become a more dangerous and uncertain place, pushing up the cost of borrowing for countries across the world. And no one needs to be told that the economy has not been as productive as it could have been over the past 14 years.There has been lots of speculation in the media over the past few days and weeks about the conclusions that the Office for Budget Responsibility will reach aboutthe UK’s long-term productivity. Those conclusions will be delivered at the budget next month and I am not going to pre-empt them. But I am going to be candid now that the productivity performance we inherited from the previous Conservative government and since the financial crisis has been too weak.Austerity,a chaotic Brexitand the pandemic have left deep scars on the British economy that are still being felt today. But the task facing our country – facing me as chancellor – is not to relitigate the past or let past mistakes determine our future. I am determined that we don’t simply accept the forecasts but we defy them, aswe already have this year. To do so means taking the necessary choices today, including at the budget next month.That means there can be no return to austerity. It wasthe failed austerity policiesof the Conservatives – which are being propoundedonce again by the party’s current leadership – that choked investment, racked up debt and left hospital waiting lists soaring. If productivity is our challenge, then investment is our solution. Investment in our National Health Service to cut hospital waiting lists. Investment in our national infrastructure – from roads and rail to energy and defence – to get Britain building again and create jobs in all parts of the country. And investment in our economy so we can kickstart growth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I will not repeatthe mistakes made by Liz Trussthree years agowhen spending got out of control and markets lost confidence. I will keep my promise to the British people to keep a grip on the country’s finances and to pay off our country’s debt because there is nothing progressive about a Labour government usingnearly £1 in every £10of public money it spends on financing debt interest.And alongside investment we will take the long-term decisions that are in the best interests of our country and opposed by our political opponents. From building a closer relationship with the European Union and securing new trade deals with our friends and allies to fixing our broken planning system so we can build the homes for the next generation to own.These decisions – and the decisions I will take at the budget – don’t come for free and they are not easy, but they are the right, fair and necessary choices. This is how we will turn our backs on decline and build a better future for tomorrow.Rachel Reeves is chancellor of the exchequerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What totally settled non-issue will her party tackle next?Tue 28 Oct 2025 09.24 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 14.57 EDTShareDoes it matter what colour the people in a sofa advert are? I can’t help feeling it doesn’t. Certainly, after next month’s budget, our political class might find it has more pressing concerns than skin pigment in fictional families convened to flog you something comfy in chenille. In fact, if some of the even bigger global financial storm clouds on the horizon end up bursting, we might well end up thinking it doesn’t even meaningfully matter which big house/two slightly smaller houses Prince Andrew lives in. Impossible to conceive of in the current news vortex. And yet: a possibility.Either way, this week we are talking about Reform MPSarah Pochin’s turnin a TalkTV phone-in, where she responded to a caller’s gambit on advertising “demographics”. Declaring the caller was “absolutely right”, Pochin explained that “it drives me mad when I see adverts full of black people, full of Asian people”. Mad? Listen, she said it. Contrary to initial positive assessments of Sarah’s talents when she was elected, she is starting to come across as an armchair short of a three-piece suite. But on reflection, I think the mad she is talking about is the angry kind. The kind where if you see another non-white face in a 15-second spot for a product you don’t need and are under precisely zero obligation to buy, you will literally lose your mind.Even so, of all the things to wet your pants about, you’d think what happens in the gaps in linear TV when people go to the kitchen or the loo just probably aren’t worthy of a seriously committed public servant’s time in a crapsack world. It’s hard to give one iota of a toss about this supposed crisis in cultural identity/TV advertising, where the fallout is so intense it could result in you … simply not buying the sofa? Or the takeaway burger? Or the tub of Quality Street? I’ve tried to be driven mad by this, but it’s incredibly hard to get that invested in the commercial future of big sofa. Maybe that makes me an enemy of growth – and yet, I note the profits of DFS were up last quarter. And with them doingan advertstarring several non-white people and everything.View image in fullscreenPeter Cardwell with Reform UK’s Sarah Pochin on TalkTV, 25 Oct 2025.Photograph: YouTube/TalkTVPerhaps the point is that profits would have been upeven more if they’d done an ad in which some suitably Aryan young professionals and the corpse of Eugène Terre’Blanche were snuggling up watching Christmas telly or something. Certainly, I would like to have seen this thought experiment explored in Richard Littlejohn’s latest admiring column on Pochin’s comments. For younger readers – anyone under the age of 70 – Richard currently appears twice a week in the Mail, though I’m not sure where he currently physically resides. For decades, he worked from home in Florida, railing against things like people working from home, or the problems of the country. The country of the UK, obviously. The country of the USA, where he lived – lives? – famously doesn’t have any problems.Anyway: adverts. As Richard’s latest thunk-piece reveals, he was recently to be found not in Florida, but in – actually, I’ll let him tell you. “We spent the weekend before last in North Norfolk,” he divulged promisingly to readers, “and practically the only non-white face we saw belonged to a young woman serving in the seaside village convenience store where we stopped to pick up our Daily Mail.” Uncanny. Having not meaningfully participated in the popular cultural life of the UK over the past decades, Richard perhaps doesn’t realise whichTV figure of funthis riff immediately and powerfully calls to mind. Likewise a revelation elsewhere in the same column: “Admittedly, a while ago I did spot a traditional white, middle-class, heterosexual, married couple during one ad break, but I was so taken aback I can’t remember what they were supposed to be selling.”Aha! That of course undermines the argument in one fell swoop. As the legendary ad genius David Ogilvy put it in one of his thunderous treatises (so much more fun than Richard’s): “The function of advertising is to sell the product”.Advertisingis, despite what a lot of wanky underperforming creatives will tell you, the art of selling, and failure by a viewer to even register the product is certainly not going to register at the cash register.And so to the tills. As well as being Britain’s biggest retailer, Tesco is presumably the mortal foe of Pochin and Littlejohn, having recently been runningan ad campaignshowing a family gathering where some people are black and some are white and some are mixed. Yet the supermarket’ssales rose 7%this year. The chain is currently seeking people to fill28,500 temporary Christmas jobs. Is all this bad? It feels sort of … fine? Maybe we need another searing appearance by Sarah Pochin on TalkTV to explain the economics of it.Although, it must be said that there is a certain irony that Sarah’s ad rant occurred on Talk, which so few advertisers deemed worthy of bothering with that it had to ditch its linear TV model last year and move to streaming. Even that way, however, it can only operate as an ad-supported channel, so another thing to drive Sarah mad is the reality that her appearance was financially supported by precisely the kind of melting-pot commercial break she regards as culturicidal. This is what it must feel like to know a spectacle is completely wrong but still have to haul your arse out there and participate in it. I imagine she sees herself like Katniss in the Hunger Games.As for the rest of us, anyone who has got this far through 2025 will have detected that we are in the middle of a great unmooring, where the undoubted cultural excesses of one era are giving way to the likely even less healthy cultural excesses of the next. Some people feel they have reacquired the ability to say things about legitimate subjects which they feel they were warned off for a long while. But this new licence – or newly reissued licence – has opened the gate to other people saying any old rubbish at all, even when it tips into dangerously irrational bigotry and worse.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Anything on populism will do, because throughout modern history the story always ends the same. Populism offers simple answers to complex problems, but time and again it has been shown ultimately to offer no answer at all. Instead, it trades in deflections. This is why you will find it fixating on utter irrelevances like telly advertising when a number of interlinked crises threaten to explode entire political orders or financial markets.

The US constitution might say no, but Trump has a habit of finding his way around even the biggest obstaclesTue 28 Oct 2025 11.06 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 13.57 EDTShareLet me tell you a secret about the US constitution: it’s just a piece of paper.It’s not immutable law created by a higher being. It was made by men, it’s been amended by men, and it can be destroyed by men. It’s only as strong as the institutions that uphold it – institutions which Donald Trump has beensystematically weakeningas he expands hisexecutive power.I say this because there are still lots of people who have faith that the constitution can stop the US from gradually turning into anelectoral autocracylike Hungary. There are still people so drunk onAmerican exceptionalismthat they think it’s ludicrous to believe Trump might seek a third term, because such a move is explicitly outlawed by the 22nd amendment of the constitution.But the president and his cronies don’t think the idea is ludicrous. Trump has refused to rule out the idea of a third term on multiple occasions – most recently on Monday when hetold reportershe “would love to do it”. And last week Trump’s former White House chief strategist, Steve Bannon,told the Economistthat “there’s a plan” to get Trump a third term.Don’t dismiss this as trolling or an attempt toshake off the “lame duck” labelsecond-term presidents are landed with. The golden rule of Trumpism is this: no matter how illegal or unusual something may be, if Trump can figure out a way to do it, then he will. And while I think it’s extremely unlikely, thereisa path to Trump 3.0. Here’s a very simplified version of how it might pan out.Where do babies come from? Robert F Kennedy Jr doesn’t seem to know | Arwa MahdawiRead moreStep one, obviously, is to figure out a plausible legal basis for a third term. Repealing the 22nd amendment,ratified in 1951in response to Franklin D Roosevelt bucking tradition and serving a third term, requires approval from two-thirds of the House and Senate. Not easy. Another possibility is aconstitutional convention; two-thirds of state legislatures (34 states) would need to call for a convention and any amendment would need ratification by three-quarters of state legislatures. This would also be incredibly difficult but it’s worth noting thatthe Heritage Foundation, which is responsible for Project 2025, arekeenon holding a constitutional convention. And where there’s a will, and a lot of cash fromultra-wealthy donors, there is often a way.Another possibility is that Trump could declare a state of emergency and postpone the 2028 election. Trump loves a good fake emergency: he’s already used at least 10 emergency declarations to justify everything from his tariffs to dispatching the National Guard to Los Angeles. Again: while this seems far-fetched, we live in extraordinary times; it shouldn’t be dismissed out of hand.Once you’ve conjured up a legal basis (no matter how flimsy) for a third term or extended second term, you’ve got to manipulate public opinion to make it seem above board as opposed to autocratic shenanigans. Trump has already proved himself adept at chipping away atpress freedomand turningelements of the US mediafrom watchdogs tolapdogs.Social media, as we all know, is also easily manipulated; some studies suggestone-third of the internetis now bots. Reports show thatRussiaandIsraelhave poured huge amounts of money into bot-based programs to push propaganda to US audiences. And they’re spending that money because it works: fake accounts can cause very real shifts in views. Remember the hoo-ha over the recentCracker Barrel rebrand? Researchers think it was largelydriven by bots. Now that Elon Musk owns X and TikTok is on its way to being owned by a consortium ofTrump’s pals(withBarron Trumppotentially sitting on the board), much of social media has been Maga-fied. It’s gone from being a place to find alternative views to a consent-manufacturing machine.Finally, you’ve got to neutralise your opposition. Unlike the previous two steps, this is easy, since there’s no opposition. The Democrats are still floundering and trying to figure out what they stand for. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris, who appears to surround herself exclusively with sycophants, isthreatening to run againin 2028. Doing so would be a gift to Trump. Gavin Newsom, a likely 2028 contender, is a moreserious threatto Maga but there’s still plenty of time to do what Democrats do best and self-sabotage.Look, I hope my fears are unfounded. I hope the Democrats seize the moment. I hope Trumpism is a temporary nightmare. But while we should hope for the best, we should be prepared for the worst.

A standoff in south London is putting it to the testAnna MintonIn Peckham, developers unwilling to meet affordable housing quotas are facing down residents and the councilTue 28 Oct 2025 10.30 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 12.46 EDTShareTeekall and his wife are raising a family in Peckham, southLondon. He runs a successful business as a commercial designer with a studio just down the road, and she works in higher education. Their two boys attend the local primary school. However, the family has outgrown their one-and-a-half-bedroom flat. Although they would like to stay in Peckham, they can’t afford to.Just around the corner from where they live, the developer Berkeley Homes is proposing to build 877 new units, on the site of the Aylesham Centre shopping complex in the heart of Peckham, claiming it is responding to the government’s commitment to build 1.5m new homes to tackle the acute housing crisis. Given the predicament Teekall finds himself in, he might be expected to welcome plans for hundreds of new homes, but the opposite is the case. “Our budget can’t reach the price of the homes in a Berkeley development. Me and my wife have good jobs and decent salaries but that wouldn’t be possible for us. It’s unrealistic to stay, which I’m really angry about,” he told me.Thousands of local residents, the MP and Southwark council all agree that the scheme is not suitable for the area, which is one of the most ethnically and demographically diverse in the country. After Berkeley slashed the amount of affordable housing in the project from the 35% then required to just 12%, the councilrejected the scheme. Undeterred, Berkeley bypassed the council and appealed directly to the government’s national planning inspectorate for a decision, circumventing the local decision-making process. Apublic inquiryrun by the inspectorate ahead of its final decision, and which opens today (Tuesday), is seen by campaigners as a test case for the government’s ability to push forward with its planning reforms.It is also a showcase for a debate that is often framed as between yimbys and nimbys, with yimbys in favour of developments such as Berkeley’s, which provide more housing and, they argue, bring down prices. Teekall and the campaign groupAylesham Community Actionreject this characterisation, highlighting the tens of thousands of expensive luxury apartments built all over London, and in other cities such as Manchester and Bristol, that are financially out of reach for the majority of residents, fuelling rather than addressing the housing crisis and breaking up communities. Of the 12% of affordable housing planned by Berkeley, the campaign group points out that only50 homeswill be for social rent, while there are 12,333 households on the housing waiting list; and of the 800 free-market homes, the campaign group has calculated that fewer than one in 10 households in Southwark could afford to buy them.The inquiry opens less than a week after the government announced “time-limited emergency measures” to fast-track developments through the planning process by decreasing the proportion of affordable homes developers must provide to 20%. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, will be handed powers to call in housing schemes of 50 homes or more where boroughs are minded to refuse permission. Khan will also be able to speed up the call-in process in certain cases without the need for a full hearing process, which means that public inquiries such as this one may not be heard in future.The reason for these new measures is that housebuilding is at historically low levels. Higher interest rates, the fallout from Brexit – which has affected construction costs – and the slump in foreign investment mean the boom in building luxury apartments is over; in the first quarter of this year, more than a third of London boroughs recordedzero housebuilding starts. As a result, the government is doing whatever it can to get building going again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The boom of the 2010s and early 2020s tells a different story. Rather than encouraging housebuilders to build significantly more affordable housing, soaring house prices and very large returns to shareholders were the result. Exceptionally high profitability has continued even in the face of economic headwinds: Berkeley made a pre-tax profit last year of £528.9m, returned £381.5m to shareholders and is looking at a pre-tax profit of £450m next year. This leaves the campaigners feeling that Berkeleyand the government are in effect telling them to take the inadequate amount of “affordable housing” on offer, or no houses will be built at all. With the inquiry taking place in the shadow of last week’s announcement to fast-track developments, residents fear they will have less and less say in how their neighbourhoods develop, or if they can remain there.Teekall feels there is no middle ground between the demands of the developers and the needs of the community. “As two parents working full-time with two children, we are being forced to move out of an area that is our home. As a black British family as well, there are not many places we feel safe, but Peckham is one of them, and we feel worried about having to move to a less diverse area,” he said.At the heart of the government’s pledge to build 1.5m new homes is the accompanying goal of economic growth, which the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has put at the centre of her domestic agenda. Building expensive apartments will increase economic activity, stimulate construction and boost growth, but it won’t help people like Teekall. That is the paradox the government needs to address, not a simplistic debate between yimbys and nimbys.Anna Minton is reader in architecture at the University of East London.

Millions who rent privately, or are in temporary accommodation, remain unprotectedTue 28 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 12.33 EDTShareWhen two-year-old Awaab Ishak tragicallydied in 2020after prolonged exposure to mould in his family’s housing association flat, it shocked the nation. His parents, Faisal and Aisha, turned unimaginable grief into tireless campaigning to ensure no other child would die from the same neglect. Their determination has led to thepassing of Awaab’s law– a landmark piece of legislation that will finally hold social landlords to account when it comes to tackling mould, damp and other hazards in people’s homes.This law, which requires social landlords to investigate and repair dangerous issues, such as mould, within strict timeframes, is a victory for justice, compassion and common sense. It puts in writing what should always have been true – that every child, every parent and every person deserves to live in a home that is safe and fit for human habitation.Awaab’s parents deserve the highest praise. They refused to let their son’s death be just another statistic in the housing crisis. Through their strength, they’ve forced a long-overdue reckoning within social housing – a sector that, for too long, has tolerated excuses, delay and negligence at the expense of human life. I want to extend my heartfelt admiration and thanks to them. Their courage will save lives.But while Awaab’s law is a step forward, it is not the end of the journey. In its current form, the law only applies to social housing – council and housing association homes. That leaves out millions of renters in the private sector and the thousands of familiesstuck in temporary accommodation, where conditions are often just as bad, if not worse.Every week, I speak to people living in homes infested with mould or with leaking ceilings, broken heating, or unsafe electrics. Too many of these homes are privately rented or owned by councils but managed by private companies. I’ve seen mums trying to clean black mould off the walls while their children wheeze with asthma during the night. I’ve seen damp eating away at plaster, ceilings collapsing, and families forced to live in one room because the rest of their home is uninhabitable.If Awaab’s law truly stands for the principle that no one should live in unsafe housing, that protection cannot stop at the door of social housing. The private rented sectoris home to more than 11 millionpeople in England, including many of the most vulnerable. These tenants often have little power, may face revenge evictions when they complain, and are trapped paying sky-high rents for homes in disrepair.Then there’stemporary accommodation– a system that is supposed to offer short-term refuge for those facing homelessness, but has become a long-term trap. More than 100,000 households, including more than 172,000 children, are living in temporary accommodation in England alone today. Many are placed in properties that are damp, unsafe, or even infested with vermin. Yet because they’re not classified as permanent tenants, they often have no recourse to complain or demand repairs.We cannot celebrate Awaab’s law while allowing these families to fall through the cracks. Extending the law to cover private and temporary accommodation would ensure that all landlords – whether social, private, or contracted – are held to the same basic legal duty: to provide safe, habitable homes within enforceable time limits.But even that won’t be enough unless the law is properly funded and enforced. Right now, local authoritiesare struggling. Environmental health officers and housing enforcement teams have been cut to the bone. Councils can barely keep up with inspections, let alone proactive enforcement. Without funding for training, staff, and legal support, Awaab’s law risks becoming another well-intentioned rule that exists on paper but fails in practice.This isn’t just a housing issue – it’s a public health emergency. Mould, damp, and disrepair lead to respiratory illness, anxiety, and even death. The NHS spends an estimated £1.4bn a year treating conditions caused or worsened by poor housing. Fixing homes isn’t just a moral duty; it’s an economic necessity.If the government wants Awaab’s legacy to mean real change, it must do three things. First, extend the law to include private renters and those in temporary accommodation. Second, fund local authorities properly so they can investigate complaints and enforce the law. And last, make sure that tenants are protected from eviction or retaliation when they speak up about unsafe conditions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I can’t help my own kids with this because they’re Stemmy (as in science and maths-oriented). their scope of interests is expressed in formulae, and if I ever have the audacity to ask them to translate it back into words, they shake their heads and go, “You’re never going to understand electron configuration”, in the exact tone of voice you’d use to tell a dog sitting in a suitcase that it isn’t allowed to come on holiday.Farewell, Ucas personal statements: I won’t miss your hackneyed, cliche-ridden prose  | Max FletcherRead moreBut I have had a number of kids doing work experience with me, wanting to study such things as politics, sociology, English and international relations.

They have this madly impressive private school kid in their heads who spent the summer in Beijing interning for the Central Military Commission, and maybe they’re right, but when you tell them that admissions tutors can also read, and will be able to decipher the word “Eton”, they don’t believe you.They pore over the thesaurus trying to find different ways to say “passionate” and “fascinated”, then it all comes out sounding likeChatGPT, so they put it through ChatGPT to make it sound less like ChatGPT.

What ails the British state is that it has built, and is building, what it cannot seem to maintain.A decade of attrition has hollowed out public services to the extent that they struggle to function coherently or plan beyond the next crisis. Under the Tories, state spending grew by just over 1% a year – well below the long-run trend of2.6% per year.This hides the fact that Britain’s fiscal story since 2010 has been an emphasis on capital spending that sends ministers reaching forhard hats, but doesn’t keep the lights on. However, investment without maintenance is just decay.The justice secretary, David Lammy, isrightto blame the Conservatives for the failings in state competence. Under Tory austerity, prison budgets were cut by a quarter and a 30% loss of staff gutted the system. As Cassia Rowland of the Institute for Government observes, the result is a “slow-motion collapse”: a service now staffed largely by overburdened, inexperienced personnel. Even if one officer slipped up with Kebatu, the system is not working. There were262 mistaken releaseslast year – double that in 2023, and quadruple that in 2014.Ministers’ solution is to add 14,000 new prison places. These may be necessary, but they won’t be sufficient. More jails are probably required, but where is the money to staff them properly? There are signs that theOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR), of all places, is beginning to recognise the problem and shift course. Under the Tories, it was a bastion of cheeseparing. It thought public investment was a waste of money and that the British economy was running so efficiently that any spending would drive up inflation.Yet in August last year, the OBR conceded thatpublic investmentcould pay for itself. And in March, itdroppedits earlier Tory-era assumption that there was no slack in the UK economy. Crucially, if the economy isn’t running at full capacity, as theLabour MP Jeevun Sandherpointed out, public spending won’t displace private spending – it will add to overall output.The OBR was created to remove politics from fiscal policy, but it ended up embedding the politics of austerity. This was not bad luck, but bad theory. It regularly overestimated the post-crash recovery inproductivity, producing forecasts that aligned with the narrative that spending cuts and restraint were necessary.Brexithas been bad for Britain’s economy, but it would be a mistake to treat productivity solely as a supply-side variable, impervious todemand and confidence.Academics think investment is the engine ofproductivity. When the crash hit, firms stopped spending and uncertainty since has seen themreluctantto start up again in a meaningful way. Since 2010, bothpublic and privatecapital expenditure has stuttered, leaving Britain stuck in a low-productivity trap.If the OBR changed tack, it could become something more valuable than a fiscal umpire. It could be the body that quantifies the cost of understaffed jails,clogged hospitalsandcouncilsthat can’t cope. The evidence is hiding in plain sight. When even the prison authorities don’t know who should be inside, the real output gap is found in society, not the economy.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The semi-normalisation of political terrorism and mafia hits in the 1970s and 80s blighted civic life, and that brutal past continues to haunt the present. Forty-five years after the fact, a retired police officer has just beenarrestedin relation to the mafia killing in 1980 of Piersanti Mattarella, the then president of Sicily.Unsurprisingly, given that history, the blowing up of a car belonging to one of Italy’s most famous investigative journalists has prompted an urgent and angst-ridden debate. Sigfrido Ranucci, who hosts a prime-time show on Rai, Italy’s state broadcaster, is known for presenting hard-hitting investigations into political corruption and organised crime. Earlier this month, a powerful bomb almostdestroyedhis black Mercedes, which was parked outside his home near Rome. The attack appeared to be timed to coincide with the eighth anniversary of the assassination of the Maltese investigative journalistDaphne Caruana Galizia.The likelihood is that this was a mafia operation. The winter series of Mr Ranucci’s Report programme – which kicked off this week – will include investigations into the ’Ndrangheta organised crime group in Calabria, which has repeatedly threatened him in the past. He has been receiving enhanced police protection since 2021.As Mr Ranucci has been quick to point out, however, the freedom of the press in Italy is not only being menaced by mobsters. Vexatious litigation is also on therise. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, immediatelyexpressedher solidarity in the wake of the bombing. Yet her radical-right coalition government has been justly criticised for bullying and harassing the journalists it wishes to silence.Mr Ranucci, and Rai’s journalism more broadly, have been among the most high-profiletargets. Following the broadcast of an investigation into the background of the 78-year-old president of the senate, Ignazio La Russa – a former member of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement – members of the ruling coalition reportedly demanded that Rai executives crack down on his programme. Mr Ranucci was subsequentlyhauledbefore a parliamentary committee, where he was interrogated over Report’s methodology and financing. Senior figures from Ms Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party have taken out lawsuits against other investigative journalists and, inone case, a cartoonist.Last year, such developmentspromptedthe European Commission to express concerns over the independence of public media in Italy. Rome has also failed to reform its strict defamation laws in accordance with EU legislation designed to prevent vexatious lawsuits. An exasperated Mr Ranucci vented his anger this month byaskingrhetorically: “Which is worse: a bomb under a car which in the end hasn’t killed anyone, or politicians who are systematically attempting to silence all journalists?”The question is unlikely to cut much ice with Italy’s prime minister, who hasdismissedallegations of intimidation and censorship as “fake news” propagated by her leftwing opponents. In the wake of the attack on Mr Ranucci’s car, Ms Meloni stated that “the freedom and independence of information are non-negotiable values of our democracies”. But as Italy slips down globalrankingsfor press freedom, and the professional climate continues to worsen for journalists seeking to investigate powerful interests, those values are increasingly under threat on her watch.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Today that horror finally ends, 22 October) on the extent of the crisis in the family courts, but no surprise. Horror at so many children and mothers traumatised and disbelieved, and, inClaire Throssell’s case, the worst outcome. Relief that change may finally happen and a child’s safety and best interests will override contact at any cost. Though it’s no consolation for those with previous experience of this unjust, chaotic system that rewards abusive fathers.Protective parents, usually mothers, only go to court when there is no choice. When a child is repeatedly refusing to have contact with a parent, hiding, crying, it is clear that something is very wrong. They expect their child’s safety and wellbeing is paramount, and presume that the legal process is there to safeguard the victim.Instead, the perpetrator makes an accusation of “parental alienation”, a term that has been widelydiscreditedinternationally, to undermine the victim. This leads to decisions that violate the best interests of children and has happened to too many mothers who are simply trying to protect their children. Some never to see their child again.Ann MooreStocksfield, NorthumberlandAny moves that protect children from a harmful parent are, of course, essential. But I fear for the many loving dads who will have to fight even harder to get contact with their children as a result of this new court ruling. Previously, parental contact was only made if it did not put the child at risk – so why did that not work?Now, courts are to presume that contact with both parents as a starting point is not in the child’s best interest. Really? I thought research has shown that contact with both caring parents is very important to the emotional development of children. Most dads separated from their children may be loving and caring, but easily alienated or have their children withheld by spiteful partners. How many loving dads can afford to go to court, costing tens of thousands and taking as long as a year or more, to gain fair contact with their children? This shift in the law will hopefully protect children against the few dangerous fathers, but at the expense of the many good dads who deserve to be considered.Wendy HopeBristolThe supreme court of Canada decided 30 years ago that family law decisions must be based on the best interests of the child, not the parent’s “rights”. It comes down to this: children have rights, parents have responsibilities. There is a presumption that it is, in general, in the best interests of the child to have contact with both parents, but that, too, is based on the child’s interests, not the parent’s.Lucretia MartenetCalgary, CanadaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It also touched on the role that paving can have in increasing flood risk. It’s good to see this issue acknowledged, but it ought to be sounding more alarm bells.Surface-water flooding is now the most common, and least understood, source of flooding in England – 4.6m properties are at risk, according to arecent report by the environmental audit committee (EAC). With climate change leading to unpredictable weather, these issues are urgent. But the way flooding is managed is reactive and uncoordinated. The EAC report provides a roadmap to improve the situation and echoes the recommendations of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) and other experts.One recommendation is to establish a single national flood reporting and information service. Another is to run a flood-awareness campaign. Improving oversight and public awareness about the risks are good ideas. The EAC and ICE also recommend implementing schedule 3 of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, which would make sustainable drainage systems mandatory in all new developments.Fiona BarbourInstitution of Civil EngineersHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

She then asserts: “These are not token gestures.”I’m registered sight-impaired and have a number of spinal issues. Perhaps she’d like to join me for a performance of her choice and see just how tokenistic all these things largely are. Obtaining accessible tickets for myself and a companion is a challenge every time, and involves around four times more work than anyone else would be required to do.Bigger venues are pulling back from access provision as costs tighten, and the number of theatres running access groups led by disabled theatre patrons has reduced. The information on theatre websites varies from non-existent to confusing. At the same time, many of us don’t want relaxed or accessible performances.

Time to thank a farsighted builder from Kent, 25 October).

It is hard to say whether that was down to the change in personnel and positions, or just that the cobwebs needed to be shaken off in the first fixture since their big win in Switzerland before things started to click into place.‘An awful moment’: Sarina Wiegman says Agyemang injury ‘doesn’t look good’Read moreEither way, there were many positives to take from the 3-0 win against the side they knocked out of the World Cup in 2023 in the semi‑finals.Agyemang’s injury was the sour note as both teams ended up with 10 players on the pitch. Australia’s Alanna Kennedy was sent off shortly before England’s first goal and Beever‑Jones needed to come off after England used up all their substitutions.It had been expected that Sarina Wiegman would shuffle her pack a little. Debuts were handed to Lucia Kendall and Taylor Hinds, Beever‑Jones started on the left alongside Alessia Russo and Beth Mead, while the goalkeeper Hannah Hampton returned to the starting XI having shaken off her elbow issue.Kendall had been diplomatic at the start of this international window, the 21-year-old was “just here to learn as much as possible”, she said, expectations of minutes low. Yet, in her first start, following her first call-up, the Southampton academy graduate looked a natural fit in the middle alongside Keira Walsh and Ella Toone.“To be honest I was not really surprised with her performance,” Wiegman said. “Straight away you saw her understanding and reading of the game. She keeps things very simple. I just wanted her to go out and play and enjoy herself and I think that’s what she did.”Kendall’s fellow debutant Hinds was similarly impressive: pitted against Chelsea’s dynamic right-back Ellie Carpenter, she coped well.View image in fullscreenAlanna Kennedy thwarts Alessia Russo’s goalward charge – the Matildas midfielder was then shown a red card.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAEngland had promised a faster start in front of 26,544 fans at Pride Park and they delivered, the opening goal arriving in the 20th minute to end a run of four games in which they had conceded first. Cooney‑Cross played a short pass to Kennedy and the London City Lionesses defender was robbed of the ball by Russo, who stepped towards the edge of the box with just the goalkeeper to beat before Kennedy upended her. Kennedy was sent off and while the initial free-kick was powered low into the wall, Bronze was on hand to push it back to Beever-Jones who fired in.It was a deserved lead and a welcome one for the hosts. “They are a world-class side and started well even before the sending off,” the Australia head coach, Joe Montemurro, said.“We take it as a massive learning curve for us. I’m a bit frustrated we didn’t get a chance to affect any part of our gameplan. We didn’t start well, that’s the honest truth. We didn’t get any rhythm and then the game changed when we went down to 10 players.”Wiegman’s side extended their lead shortly before the break, Walsh’s defence-splitting pass found Toone and the Manchester United midfielder flicked it back towards an unmarked Bronze to guide in.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The decision to restore Kerr’s captaincy has proven controversial in Australia, despite being found not guilty of racially aggravated harassment of a police officer. Montemurro said: “We’ve made a decision internally for what we believe is the best for the group. I won’t make political decisions, it’s purely football.”View image in fullscreenConcern for Michelle Agyemang as the young substitute is stretchered off late on.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty ImagesThe injury to Agyemang then marred proceedings: the Brighton forward, on loan from Arsenal, was distraught after she went down off the ball before being taken down the tunnel on a stretcher. Beever-Jones needed to come off soon after with a dead leg, and with five changes already made the hosts played the remainder as a 10 v 10 affair.It was comfortable for England in the end, a penalty from Stanway sealing the 3-0 win after substitute Missy Bo Kearns was tripped in the box.The fluidity had been disrupted a little by the many changes and the lengthy injury stoppage, but the performance offered plenty from which to learn. Those things will be looked at in the coming days, but concern for Euro 2025 starlet Agyemang will dominate as teammates and fans alike wait for news regarding the extent of her injury.Explore more on these topicsFriendliesEngland women's football teamMatildasWomen's footballAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

So big for me,” said Norrie, who becomes the fifth British man in history to defeat a world No 1. “Coming back from injury last year, I lost in the first round of qualies here. I just tried to enjoy my tennis in the second half of the year. To get a win like this, it’s the biggest win of my career, my first win over the world No 1 and probably the most confident player in the world right now.”Jannik Sinner calls out grand slams for delaying welfare and prize money talksRead moreNorrie, ranked No 31, has also ended Alcaraz’s supreme run of nine consecutive finals and 17 consecutive Masters 1000 wins, the best series of results in the Spaniard’s young career.He appeared to be moving confidently towards victory early on as he eased through the opening set against the British No 2. However, Norrie gradually worked himself into the match by serving with greater precision and dragging the Spaniard into prolonged, physical rallies. His relentless shot tolerance and consistency gradually left its mark.For much of the contest, Alcaraz served well but he struggled badly to find his timing off his groundstrokes. The 22-year-old looked particularly uncomfortable striking his forehand, the best shot in the world for much of this year, haemorrhaging 29 forehand unforced errors and a total of 54 unforced errors. Across the net, Norrie offered Alcaraz so few mistakes, maintaining his consistency, physicality and depth throughout while serving efficiently and choosing his moments to force himself inside the baseline and attack well.In the tense final games, Norrie brilliantly maintained his composure to close out the best player in the world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Bluebirds’ victory came as little of a shock, if anything their progress to the quarter‑finals should have been far easier.Yousef Salech put the League One side into a 13th-minute lead, but Cardiff missed numerous chances to finish off the derby before it began in earnest. Wrexham joined the tie in the second half; substitute Kieffer Moore equalised, but it was Will Fish who settled the match for the visitors.Wrexham v Cardiff City: Carabao Cup – liveRead more“Exhausting,” was the immediate reaction of Brian Barry-Murphy, the Cardiff head coach. “It was a tough game for us, but we played in the way we wanted to play from minute one and that’s what showed our character and our skill level throughout the course of the game. Very satisfying and immensely proud of the whole club.”Cardiff dominated from the start and every pass was booed by the home support, but it did not put them off. They had four shots on target in the opening 20 minutes, while the hosts floundered.“Our owner [Vincent Tan] is very demanding and he was really insistent on more shots and crosses – I hope we make him happy,” Barry-Murphy said.Wrexham were disjointed and being pushed back into their own defensive third for lengthy periods. Their spending means there is quality in this side and they almost took the lead on the counterattack, but Nathan Broadhead miscued his finish when in plenty of space in front of goal. It would not have been deserved.View image in fullscreenWrexham’s Kieffer Moore (centre) is congratulated by George Dobson after his equaliser shortly after coming on as a half-time substitute.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAThe opener came at the other end within a minute and it was certainly merited. Rubin Colwill had options on the edge of the penalty area, before deciding to pass to Omari Kellyman in space inside the area. The winger’s shot was superbly saved by Callum Burton, Wrexham’s third-choice goalkeeper, but Salech tapped in the rebound.The once lively atmosphere was limited to one small section of the ground, while the Wrexham supporters suffered and yawned.Burton produced a stunning save to keep out a thunderous Cian Ashford shot and Rubin Colwill rattled the bar with a free-kick. Placid Wrexham were not in the contest and lacked the ideas or desire to change the dynamic. The solitary positive for the home side being they were somehow only one goal behind at the break.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Within seven minutes Ryan Longman swung in a dangerous cross and the former Cardiff striker Moore rose highest, reigniting the atmosphere in the crowd noise in the process.Finally, there was an intensity to Wrexham’s play and it was Cardiff who were on the back foot, creating something akin to a cup tie. Ronan Kpakio was feeling the pressure, missing a simple chance to intercept a pass, allowing Longman to gain control and start the long run for goal, only to be pulled back on the halfway line. The majority wanted a red card, but yellow was the correct decision thanks to a covering defender.Joel Bagan swung a cross over everyone in the area from the left, except Fish waiting at the back post. The connection was perfect, proving too powerful for Burton. The goalkeeper should have done better considering the angle, but the defence will also wonder how they failed to clear the danger.“We were off the pace first half, that’s probably an understatement,” Parkinson said. “We did not close down with enough pressure or intent and that made it easy for them.”The scenes among the 1,200 Cardiff supporters at the end tested the foundations of the stand, as they moved one step closer to Wembley.

Instead, the lesser‑spotted Dermot Desmond broke cover to lacerate Rodgers. The attack felt personal and spiteful. This proved a sad and unseemly conclusion to Rodgers’s second spell in Glasgow. So much so, in fact, that the third most successful manager in Celtic’s history cannot now show his face at the stadium. Desmond appears to be a bad enemy to choose.Martin O’Neill rules out long Celtic stay as Kieran McKenna emerges as candidateRead moreDesmond’s ferocious sentiment shone a light on recent months inside Celtic Park. The environment was toxic. It does not explain why a manager accused of being “self‑serving” and guilty of a breach of trust was simply not removed from office months ago. Desmond’s astonishing words turned heads but they also raise questions. Were Rodgers as egotistical as Desmond portrays, he would have left Celtic immediately after the summer’s botched transfer window. Rodgers could have secured martyrdom with supporters. He instead limped on, with Celtic eight points behind a Hearts team who were well short of their best whenseeing off Rodgers and coin Edinburgh on Sunday.Desmond blames Rodgers for “fuelling” supporter protest towards the board which has formed a regular backdrop to this ragged campaign. “Some of the abuse directed at them, and at their families, has been entirely unwarranted and unacceptable,” Desmond said. The 75-year-old is correct to condemn such behaviour, but plenty of theCelticdisquiet has been articulated in sensible and appropriate style. Desmond’s assassination of Rodgers is unlikely to placate dissenters. “It’s normally the manager that goes when that starts to be sung,” Rodgers said amid cries of “sack the board” in late August. He was mocked at the time; he was right.Those directors have no desire to alter the way Celtic are run, essentially because they think such a switch is unnecessary. “Celtic’s structure – where the manager oversees football, the chief executive manages operations, and the board provides oversight – has served the club with great success for more than two decades,” Desmond said. “What has failed recently was not due to our structure or model, but to one individual’s desire for self‑preservation at the expense of others.”It is worth remembering that Celtic’s previous chief executive lasted two months. Non‑executive directors serve for years, if not decades. Desmond owns just over 30% of Celtic; the Monday night bulletin was from a man with total control.The success to which Desmond refers is perfectly fair in domestic context. There have been glimmers of light in Europe –including last season– but Celtic’s regular shortcomings there undermine his point. Those struggles span various managers;Kairat Almaty saw off Celticin Champions League qualifying two months ago, just as Bodø/Glimt, Ferencvaros, Cluj, AEK Athens, Maribor and Malmö have done stretching back to 2014. Bodø/Glimt, Pafos, Slavia Prague and Union St-Gilloise are in the Champions League this season.View image in fullscreenDermot Desmond has pulled no punches in his statement which was released very shortly after Brendan Rodgers’ exit was announced.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PACeltic portray themselves as a major club and in many respects they are. At Rodgers’s final European game, thewin against Sturm Graz last week, he completed media duties in the typical domain of a marquee in the car park. Celtic fans will not care how the press are treated – in fact many will delight in the provision of spartan facilities – but this emphasises a broader sense of the small-time.The problem with criticising Rodgers – as plenty were doing even before his resignation – is that none of this could have formed part of his plan. He hardly wanted this second spell to end so sourly or there was no reason to return while ignoring more lucrative opportunities. Third-season syndrome does not adequately explain why a team that scared Bayern Munich in February but had visibly run out of gas by the time of theScottish Cup final defeat by Aberdeenin May was not properly rejuvenated.Celtic’s title was confirmed with weeks, if not months to spare. Their Champions League qualifying position was known. Rodgers’s frustration over a lack of attacking reinforcement, not only in the summer but January, was understandable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Were Kenny playing for Falkirk, there would be no clamour for Celtic to sign him.Celtic’s squad has regressed; it would be nonsensical to believe this appealed in any way to Rodgers. Jahmai Simpson-Pusey, Shin Yamada and Hayato Inamura – all brought in during the summer window – have barely been seen. Daizen Maeda was clearly affected after a move to the Bundesliga collapsed in essence because Celtic had no replacement. Kelechi Iheanacho, who quickly became the go-to No 9, arrived on a free on 2 September.It would be inaccurate to portray Rodgers as blameless. Celtic had the resources to beat Kairat, albeit Champions League involvement was likely to bring embarrassment. The manager’s pointed assessment of recruitment would inevitably feed through to his dressing room. Players bought for decent fees – Auston Trusty, Arne Engels, Paulo Bernardo – have failed to deliver. Rodgers was, though, unquestionably Celtic’s most talented football operator, a matter proven by a substantial body of work. His desire to drive the club forward was beyond question.It became increasingly apparent Rodgers would not see out this season. There was mutual disillusionment between him and his paymasters. There were, however, other ways to handle this: by stating manager and club were no longer aligned in their thoughts or that because Rodgers would leave in the summer anyway, an immediate parting of ways made more sense. Instead, there is acrimony. Rodgers’s side of the story, when presented, will be fascinating.O’Neill is a young 73 and idolised by fans. He retains the man-management skills to improve Celtic. He will believe privately that he can do this job for longer than an interim basis and has huge motivation to prove that after a six-year hiatus from management. Nonetheless, this is an underwhelming squad playing in front of a disgruntled audience. It is also a club that not for the first time see method in going back to the future. Lingering problems way beyond Rodgers remain. Desmond’s polemic does not deflect from that.Explore more on these topicsCelticBrendan RodgersScottish PremiershipanalysisShareReuse this content"

A corner is now awarded if a keeper fails to release the ball within eight seconds. That countdown is signalled by the referee with his fingers.The possibility of introducing a similar proposal for throw‑ins and goal‑kicks was discussed on Tuesday at a virtual meeting of Ifab’s football and technical advisory panels.There has been explosion in long throws in the Premier League this season, with a process that often involving lengthy preparations in the same manner as at an attacking free-kick, leading to a drop in the amount of in-play time, a key metric for the game’s administrators.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.According to Stats Perform, there were more than twice as many long throws in the Premier League in the opening weeks of this season, compared with last season as a whole, with an average of 3.44 per match compared with 1.52 in 2024-25. In the first 40 games of the season there was also a significant drop-off in in-play time, at 54 minutes and 21 seconds per match that is 133sec lower than last season.Among other amendments to the rules considered by the Ifab advisory panels was the possibility of extending the video assistant referee protocols to allow officials to intervene if they adjudge a second yellow card has been awarded incorrectly. At the moment, VARs adjudicate on goals, penalty kicks, cases of mistaken identity and the awarding of direct red cards.There was also an agreement to look further at the offside law, with officials asked to consider “whether the main objective should be to reduce marginal offside decisions in modern football to promote more attacking play”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ­Manchester City head coach says he will not change his ­principles but is open to ­turning Omar Marmoush and Erling ­Haaland into a more classical strike partnership.City travel to Swansea on Wednesday night in the Carabao Cup fourth round, where they will face a Championship side eager to keep the ball. Long throw-ins and corners are becoming increasingly important in the­Premier League. Pulis used them to his ­advantage during his Stoke ­tenure in the late-2000s, helping the side defy the odds in the top flight.“I remember a long time ago with Sean Dyche, Burnley were an incredible threat in the long balls, second balls,” Guardiola said. “Dyche is one of the best by far doing these kind of aspects. It’s not new, he did it before. Or Sam Allardyce. Or I remember when I was not here, Stoke City.“Do you remember Stoke City when they made the throws? It happened in that time. Now it’s just more and more teams doing that but then maybe Stoke was the exception. I remember when I was at Barcelona and Bayern Munich, Arsène Wenger talked about going to play at Stoke City but now it happens a lot of times.“Every manager does what they believe. I’m focused on that. I want to score from free-kicks and corners – I’m not naive, I want it – but I spend my time on what we have to do to play better, attack better and create chances, to score goals. Defensively you have to be more aggressive.“All the aspects of the game I see. Of course I pay attention but I know I’m not the manager to try to … It’s what I’ve done all my career.”Guardiola is ready to rotate his squad to deal with the hectic schedule. The 18-year-old creative ­midfielder Divine Mukasa will join the first-team squad for the Swansea game and James Trafford will return in goal but Rodri remains unavailable. Marmoush will get his first start since August but Haaland is likely to be rested.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ecclestone bowled only four balls on Sunday, leaving England dependent on the part-time off-spin of Alice Capsey and the barely-ever-seen leg-spin of Sophia Dunkley to fill the void.“I’m pretty confident that she’ll be ready for tomorrow’s game,” Sciver-Brunt said “She [Ecclestone] might not be 100%. Hopefully a bit of adrenaline will help her but we showed in the game against New Zealand that we were able to adapt the bowling plans.”England will also take confidence from the fact that it was their other left-arm spinner Linsey Smith who dealt the critical blows in their earliergroup-stage match against South Africa. On that occasion England triumphed by 10 wickets after bowling their opponents out for 69 – Smith skittling through Laura Wolvaardt, Tazmin Brits and Marizanne Kapp to leave them reeling.“She’s been absolutely massive for our side,” Sciver-Brunt said of Smith, who has taken the same number of wickets as Ecclestone in the tournament – 12 apiece. “It’s always a big responsibility to open the bowling but she’s taken it in her stride and really thought differently about the way she bowls.”View image in fullscreenSouth Africa came unstuck against Alana King in their final group game against Australia.Photograph: Unnati Naidu/SPP/ShutterstockThat collapse could be seen as a once-in-a-blue-moon blip, were it not for the fact that South Africa very nearly matched the nadir in their most recent outing,being blown away for 97by an Alana King-inspired Australia.Wolvaardt, South Africa’s captain, is thus faced with the formidable challenge of dusting her side off from two dreadful batting performances, while simultaneously trying to convince them that they have the capability to defeat England – a side they lost to in the semi-finals of the 2017 and 2022 World Cups, and who they have defeated only once in their past eight ODI encounters.“I think for me tomorrow it’ll just be about keeping everyone as calm as possible,” Wolvaardt said. “Fifty overs is a very long time and it’s very easy to let the pressure of a semi-final get to you. But they’re under a lot of pressure as well. The calmest team out there will most likely win.”Wolvaardt exemplifies calmness at the crease, having already scored three half-centuries this tournament from the top of the order. She will be critical to her side’s hopes of making history on Wednesday – they have never reached a 50-over World Cup final. That makes England firm favourites, an unfamiliar and perhaps uncomfortable label given their own recent turmoil.“To be in a knockout stage of a World Cup this early on in our tenure is really special,” Sciver-Brunt said, reflecting on the first six months of her partnership with the head coach, Charlotte Edwards. “We started the tournament unsure of where we were compared to the other teams in the world. But we always wanted to come to the tournament to try to win, regardless of where we were in our journey.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A score of two not out from seven balls is not, it must be said, ideal preparation for a must-win game and could yet come back to haunt England.As ever, England must lean on their current captain and her immediate predecessor, Heather Knight. Knight is their leading tournament run-scorer – 288 at an average of 57.60 – having fought her way back from a serious hamstring injury to feature in this World Cup. “It’s like she was never away,” Sciver-Brunt said.Still, even this comeback queen will be acutely aware that at the age of 34 she may not see another 50-over tournament: it is do-or-die time in Guwahati.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Cricket World CupWomen's cricketEngland women's cricket teamSouth Africa women's cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

That kind of versatility is really important to us. I’m not saying we’re training all those combinations for this Saturday but these are the things we have which allow us to go 6-2 [on the bench].“We’re training [our] readiness to adapt to things. Henry Pollock is a back-row forward, but it’s one of the combinations I’m looking at for the future. I think there will be a time where I’ll consider starting Ben Earl at centre, especially with all the quality back‑row forwards we’ve got.”It reflects further Borthwick’s desire to uncork England’s full attacking potential, glimpsed in patches this year but not always consistently realised against top‑level opposition despite a seven‑game unbeaten run for his side. It may well be, with George Ford picked at fly-half, that England will also aim to kick high and often but the head coach also insists he wants his side to create problems with ball in hand.Quick GuideEngland team to face Australia – in fullShowEngland (v Australia): Freddie Steward (Leicester, 38 caps); Tom Roebuck (Sale, 6 caps), Tommy Freeman (Northampton, 20 caps), Fraser Dingwall (Northampton, 4 caps), Immanuel Feyi-Waboso (Exeter, 9 caps); George Ford (Sale, 102 caps), Alex Mitchell (Northampton, 23 caps); Fin Baxter (Harlequins, 14 caps), Jamie George (Saracens, 102 caps), Joe Heyes (Leicester, 14 caps), Maro Itoje (Saracens, 93 caps, captain), Ollie Chessum (Leicester, 28 caps), Guy Pepper (Bath, 3 caps), Sam Underhill (Bath, 42 caps), Ben Earl (Saracens, 42 caps)Replacements: Luke Cowan-Dickie (Sale, 49 caps), Ellis Genge (Bristol, 71 caps), Will Stuart (Bath, 50 caps), Alex Coles (Northampton, 10 caps), Tom Curry (Sale, 61 caps), Henry Pollock (Northampton, 1 cap), Ben Spencer (Bath, 10 caps), Fin Smith (Northampton , 11 caps).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I want them to play in a way that is fast and aggressive with the ball,” Borthwick said.“It suits the strengths we have. The second challenge is how hard this team runs and the physical intensity it brings. That is really important to us. It’s not a team that has huge size, it’s a team that can run. I’m now seeing a team that is better conditioned and a team that can run harder.”Borthwick did concede that there were “some disappointed players” and several “really narrow calls”, not least at No 10 where Ford has leapfrogged two Lions fly-halves. Lawrence has just returned from long-term injury while prominent Lions such as Tom Curry have only recently returned to full fitness and may also be being managed with the All Blacks Test in mind.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThere is also the reality that England do not want to fade in the final stages of games, as happened when Australia stole a dramaticlast-gasp winin London a year ago. With limited training time available – “They have had four months together, we’ve got four sessions,” Borthwick said – it also makes some sense to pick an all-Northampton midfield pairing and not to overcomplicate the England gameplan.The head coach is also hoping some of the work done in tougher times last year will come to fruition this autumn. “Somebody talked to me about coaching the other day, and said: ‘Sometimes you’re like the gardener. What you’ve got to do is plant the seeds, and then you’ve got to take care of them.’ Sometimes it can take a long time for things to really come through and reap all the rewards.”Australia will clearly have other ideas and in training England have employed the aerial skills of their young prodigy Noah Caluori to replicate the challenge of the high-flying Wallaby Joseph Suaalii. “Suaalii’s kick-off work last year was very good and it has been a focus for us,” Borthwick said.“Stopping him winning the ball is a challenging thing to do and Noah has been challenging the team in the air. Australia have a contestable kicking game and will send up lots of box-kicks. We will be expecting that this weekend.”Borthwick, though, sounds as upbeat about his own team’s development as at any point in his tenure. “I think the expectations of each other have now risen. We can’t wait for this autumn series, to be back in front of our supporters and back together as a group. We can’t wait to rip into it.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSteve BorthwickAustralia rugby union teamAutumn Nations SeriesRugby unionAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

At least seven people were killed in separate strikes in Gaza City and Khan Younis, including two children, medical sources said.The sudden outbreak of violence was the most significant challenge of the 18-day ceasefire inGaza. The US vice-president, JD Vance, tried to downplay the fighting, saying the ceasefire would hold.Netanyahu ordered the strikes after a firefight between Palestinian militants and Israeli troops, as well growing fury overHamasturning over body parts of a hostage whose remains Israeli troops had recovered two years before. The Israeli prime minister called an emergency meeting to discuss what he called Hamas violations of the ceasefire, amid clamour for a return to the war by far-right figures in the Israeli government.The bombardment promptedHamas to delay a planned handover of a hostage’s remains, which had been scheduled for Tuesday night.Israeli media said Hamas militants had attacked Israeli troops in southern Gaza with an anti-tank missile and guns earlier on Tuesday. Hamas denied responsibility for the attack and said in a statement that it remained committed to the ceasefire deal.An Israeli military official told Reuters that the attack violated the ceasefire as it was carried out east of the agreed withdrawal line of Israeli forces.Israel Katz, Israel’s defence minister, said that Hamas would “pay many times over” for attacking Israeli soldiers and for failing to turn over hostages’ remains. “The attack on IDF soldiers in Gaza today by the Hamas terror organisation crosses a glaring red line to which the IDF will respond with great force,” Katz said in a statement.Israel notified the US before launching the strikes, two US officials told the Associated Press.The ceasefire, which started on 10 October, has held up until now, despite similar incidents of violence in recent weeks. US officials have made it clear they do not want a return to fighting in Gaza and have sent a series of officials to Israel over the past week, inwhat Israeli media has sardonically dubbed “Bibisitting.”The US vice-president, JD Vance, said that he thought the ceasefire would hold despite Tuesday’s fighting. “That’s doesn’t mean there aren’t going to be little skirmishes here and there,” Vance told reporters.Earlier on Tuesday, Netanyahu accused Hamas of a “clear violation” of the US-brokered Gaza ceasefire, saying the militant group had returned body parts of a hostage whose remains Israeli troops had recovered two years before.Under the terms of the ceasefire, Hamas is required to return the remains of all Israeli hostages as soon as possible. In exchange, Israel has agreed to hand over 15 Palestinian bodies for each Israeli. Hamas has yet to return 13 bodies.In a statement on Tuesday, Hamas said that the latest order to strike Gaza would further delay efforts to recover hostages’ remains.Hamas has also accused Israel of violating the ceasefire, with the Gaza media office saying Israel has violated the deal more than 80 times, killing at least 80 people since the truce came into effect.On Monday, the International Committee of the Red Crossaccompanied members of Hamasinside areas of Gaza under the control of the Israeli military to facilitate the search for the bodies, after Donald Trump on Saturday issued a 48-hour ultimatum to return the remains of the dead Israeli hostages “quickly, or the other countries involved in this great peace will take action”.In the evening, Hamas’s military wing, the al-Qassam brigades, said it hadreturned the body of an Israeli captive, with the Israeli government later confirming it had received it from the Red Cross.However, on Tuesday, the Israeli health ministry’s National Forensic Institute said there was no match with any of the 13 missing bodies, saying the remains belonged toOfir Tzarfati, whose body was recovered by the IDF in the Gaza Strip in December 2023, less than two months after his abduction.The Israeli military published footage of what it said were members of Hamas reburying a body in order to “stage a false discovery” for the ICRC, which it said was the group “attempting to create a false impression of efforts to locate the bodies”. Hamas has yet to comment on the claims.The news has enraged Israelis, with the far-right ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich lashing out at Hamas and calling on Netanyahu to resume the war.“The fact that Hamas continues to play games and does not immediately transfer all the bodies of our fallen, is in itself evidence that the terror organisation is still standing,” said Ben-Gvir, the security minister.“Now we don’t need to ‘extract a price from Hamas’ for the violations. We need to exact from it its very existence and destroy it completely, once and for all, in accordance with the central goal defined for the ‘war of revival’ [war in Gaza],” he said, adding: “Mr prime minister, enough hesitation. Give the order.”Smotrich, the finance minister, wrote to Netanyahu calling for “forceful responses” to Hamas’s violations and called for “the destruction of Hamas and the removal of the threat emanating from Gaza toward the citizens of Israel”.It was unclear if the strikes ordered on Gaza would be accompanied by further punitive measures. The Times of Israel said the prime minister was considering moving the yellow line dividing Gaza in two to place more territory under IDF control, or halting the entry of humanitarian aid to Gaza.Hamas has so far returned the remains of 15 hostages, with 13 bodies still in the territory.The militant group says it does not know the precise whereabouts of all the bodies, saying it has lost contact with several of its units that had been holding the captives and were reportedly killed during Israeli bombardments.In a separate development on Tuesday, police said Israeli forces had killed three Palestinians they described as members of a “terrorist cell” during a raid near the occupiedWest Bankcity of Jenin.Explore more on these topicsIsraelHamasGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

In May she was arrested at Tbilisi airport after being stopped with, it is alleged, 14kg of cannabis worth £200,000 in a travel bag.At a court hearing in Tbilisi on Tuesday Culley’s mother, Lyanne Kennedy, told reporters that the family had managed to raise 500,000 lari (£137,870) and were waiting for the funds to be credited to the relevant government account.The family had been attempting to raise £225,000 (800,000 lari) in the hope it would secure the immediate release of Culley, who is due to give birth before Christmas.Reports from the courtroom say that prosecution and defence lawyers agreed a deal whereby the lesser amount will be paid, in exchange for a two-year sentence.Culley had previously been told she could face up to 20 years in jail or life imprisonment if convicted.The sentence is due to be handed down by a judge on Monday 3 November. One possibility is that Culley is permitted to have her baby while under house arrest, rather than inside the women’s prison where she is being held.She smiled and waved at her family during Tuesday’s court hearing. Afterwards, Kennedy, a charity worker, said of her daughter: “She’s looking big, pregnant, but she looks strong.”Culley had previously pleaded not guilty to charges,claiming she had been tortured into taking the drugs into Georgia, a country she had never heard of. At a hearing in July, she said: “I just wanted to travel. I am a good person. I am a student at university. I am a clean person. I don’t do drugs.”According to the Daily MailCulley, who is studying to be a nurse, pleaded guilty on Tuesday and asked the judge: “Will I be able to take the baby with me if I go back to jail?”The judge responded: “Nobody is going to take the baby away from you.”Prosecutor Vakhtang Tsalugelashvili reportedly told the court: “The plea bargain has been reached, our conditions have been met – two years of imprisonment and a fine of 500,000 Georgian lari.”Culley’s lawyer, Malkhaz Salakaia, said: “I can confirm. All relevant parties have been informed as well. We would like to ask the judge to schedule one final hearing to pass the final verdict.”An application for bail was refused on the grounds a doctor had said the conditions Culley is in were “satisfactory”.Kennedy told reporters that the court had demanded a higher sum than she and Culley’s father, Niel Culley, an oil rig technician who lives in Vietnam, had been able to raise. The couple have no property in the UK.“It was a lot more,” said Kennedy. Asked about the negotiations, she said: “They did budge but we still couldn’t raise that amount.”Explore more on these topicsGeorgianewsShareReuse this content"

For the first time, the gang reportedly used weaponised drones to drop explosives on special forces teams.Gunshot wound victims were carried to a local hospital throughout the morning and by afternoon at least 64 people had been killed, including four police officers. “There are bodies strewn all over the streets,” one community leader told the Rio newspaper O Globo.Eight police officers and four residents were wounded. Horrific photos of some of the young male victims spread on social media.View image in fullscreenPolice launched a major operation in and around two favelas aimed at arresting the leaders of the Red Command.Photograph: António Lacerda/EPARio’s rightwing governor, Cláudio Castro, declared the city “at war” and said it was the biggest police operation since a 2010 raid in the same region.“This is no longer common crime, it’s narco-terrorism,” Castro said in a video posted on social media showing armoured personnel carriers at the start of the mission.More than 80 people were reportedly arrested and at least 93 automatic rifles were seized. The weapons are a sign of the powerful arsenal Rio’s drug traffickers have acquired since they began flooding the favelas in the late 1980s.View image in fullscreenGetúlio Vargas hospital workers move an injured person after police raids on Tuesday.Photograph: Silvia Izquierdo/APVictor Santos, Rio’s security secretary, told local television that “Operation Containment” had been ordered to capture Red Command gang members, who control of large chunks of Rio and are increasingly present in other parts of Brazil, including the Amazon region.​Rene Silva, a community activist and journalist from Alemão who runs a local newspaper called Voz das Comunidades, said he had been woken by gunfire at about 5am.He voiced despondency over the government’s insistence on conducting deadly and ultimately ineffective police raids into the favelas.“This doesn’t solve the problem,” Silva said. “Rio’s crime problem needs to be combated in other places – not just in the favelas. We don’t have plantations of marijuana or cocaine here. We don’t have gun factories here. This isn’t a fight against crime, it’s a fight against poverty.”Glória Alves, ​a 65​-year-old resident of an area of Alemão​ called Palmeiras, said she was woken shortly after 4am by her barking dog. Alves went into her bathroom, “and there was this volley of shots – so, so many shots. It was horrible”, she said. The shooting continued around her home throughout the day. “We have no idea what time this will all finish,” she added. “It hasn’t stopped. It isn’t over. And I don’t know what time it will end.”View image in fullscreenDrug traffickers from the Red Command criminal faction started shooting and set fire to barricades and cars.Photograph: Aline Massuca/ReutersHuman rights activists and opposition politicians voiced outrage at the historic day of bloodshed. “What is happening in Alemão and in Penha isn’t an operation – it’s a state-sponsored massacre,” tweeted Lucia Marina dos Santos, a state congress member for the leftwing Worker’s party (PT). Santos accused authorities of turning Rio’s favelas into “war zones” as part of their failed “war on drugs”.With police operations and gunfights reportedly continuing on Tuesday afternoon, the death toll could still rise.Until Tuesday, the highest number of deaths during a single police operation happened in May 2021, when 28 people were killed duringa police assault on Jacarezinho, another large favela that is considered a Red Command stronghold.Over the past four decades Rio’s redbrick favelas have fallen further under the control of heavily armed criminal groups, primarily the Red Command, the Pure Third Command, and a constellation of paramilitaries gangs whose ranks often include off-duty members of the security forces. In recent months the Red Command has embarked on a major offensive to seize control of territories in western Rio controlled byparamilitary groups called militias.Castro said police across Rio had been placed on high alert amid fears drug bosses could order attacks in reprisal for the operation, and on Tuesday afternoon criminals could be seen trying to close some of the city’s most important motorways and roads,including the one leading to the airport. Schools, shops, bars and restaurants all over Rio closed down for fear of attacks and bus companies recalled their fleets, causing rush hour chaos for commuters.​As he stood at one of Alemão’s main entrances on Tuesday afternoon, watching bullet-proof police vehicles drive in, local activist Raull Santiago said the situation remained tense.Santiago called the killings “a massacre, a brutal landmark in the history of this city … and of Brazil as a whole”. “Warlike” police operations were nothing new to Rio, Santiago said. “But they leave profound marks on those who live in the favelas … Once again the favela is bleeding, once again we are counting an ever increasing number of bodies.”Additional reporting by Melissa Cannabrava in Rio de JaneiroExplore more on these topicsBrazilRio de JaneiroAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The net result was a reduction of £104.3bn in UK energy bills over the 13-year period, according to the researchers.Surgingrenewable energy generation across Europemade demand for gas – and thus gas prices – lower than they would otherwise have been, and meant electricity companies had less need to build costly new gas-fired power stations, according to the analysis. The way that the UK’s energy market works also means gas-fired power stations are in effect allowed to set the price of electricity.The analysis applied to 2010-23, leaving out thelingering impacts of the leap in gas prices in early 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine.Colm O’Shea, a former hedge fund manager, now a master’s student at UCL and lead author of the report, said: “Far from being a financial burden, this study demonstrates how wind generation has consistently delivered substantial financial benefits to the UK. To put it into context, this net benefit of £104bn is larger than the additional £90bn the UK has spent on gas since 2021 as a result of rising prices related to the war in Ukraine.“This study demonstrates why we should reframe our understanding of green investment from costly environmental subsidy to a high-return national investment.”Mark Maslin, a professor of Earth system science at UCL, said the UK’s consumers would benefit to a greater extent if the electricity market were reformed to reflect the reality that wind generation was reducing bills. “At some stage, the UK government must decouple gas and electricity prices,” he said. “That would mean gas prices would reflect the global markets, while the electricity price would reflect the savings from wind and solar.”Ana Musat, the director of policy at RenewableUK, the trade body for the wind sector, said: “This research highlights the long-term economic benefits for UK plc of investing in renewable energy generation. The only way to reduce energy costs for good is to minimise our exposure to volatile global fossil fuel prices and increase the share of electricity generation from clean homegrown sources.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Only about £1.1bnwas made available in the auction.Musat said: “The wind industry alone employs 55,000 people and this is set to double to 110,000 by 2030. Every gigawatt of offshore wind brings £2bn-£3bn in private investment to the UK. That’s why it’s so important that we procure significant volumes of new wind and solar capacity in the auction for clean power contracts, with the budget set at an ambitious level to enable us to make the most of the opportunity to stabilise the cost of energy.”Michael Shanks, the energy minister, said: “Our competitive new auction process will allow us to buy the right amount of clean power at the right price on behalf of the British people, so we can take back control of our energy.”Separately, analysis from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank found that in the 10 years since theParis agreement was signed in 2015there have been far greater increases in renewable energy generation than was envisaged at the time.In 2015, BP predicted that non-fossil fuels would take a 38% share of global power generation by 2035, but already they account for 41%. Solar and wind generation today are four times what the InternationalEnergyAgency in 2015 forecast they would be.The deployment of electric vehicles has also risen faster than expected: the 2015 target of 100m EVs on the road by 2030 is likely to be hit in two years.Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, said: “Clean homegrown power is the right choice for families, industry and the nation for many years to come. Wind power is cheaper, cleaner and more secure than new gas – helping us bring down bills for good.“And with a competitive new process to secure more wind in our upcoming renewables auction, we will take back control of our energy and bring the next generation of opportunity to British coastlines and heartlands.”Explore more on these topicsWind powerGas (Business)Gas (Environment)Fossil fuelsEnergyRenewable energyGreen economynewsShareReuse this content"

They found that in 15 years, marine ecosystems would be facing extreme heat, oxygen loss and acidity conditions.“The average year from 2040 onwards will be more extreme than the most extreme year that we’ve experienced up until 2015,” said Prof David Schoeman of the University of the Sunshine Coast, co-author of the research published inEarth’s Future.World’s oceans losing their greenness through global heating, study findsRead moreAlice Pidd, the study’s lead author who is also from the University of the Sunshine Coast, said marine species were already shifting towards the poles, seeking out cooler waters at an average of 59km per decade at current rates of warming. Some species were moving faster, such as kingfish in eastern Australia, which were shifting up to 102km every 10 years.“This gradual ratcheting up is punctuated by extreme events such as marine heatwaves that are becoming increasingly more frequent, intense and prolonged,” she said. “As our oceans acidify [and] lose oxygen, the life they support is under increasing pressure to move, adapt or die. We’re already seeing this in action.”The projections showed marine protected areas were just as exposed to these risks as unprotected ocean. The authors recommended the expansion of protected zones to include places designated as climate refuges where biodiversity had the best chance of surviving.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterPotential refuges – areas expected to see the least amount of change – were mostly located along southern and south-western coastlines under emissions scenarios that met or exceeded the Paris climate agreement. These were fewer, and vanished more quickly under higher-emissions scenarios.The team called for urgent, aggressive action to reduce carbon emissions in order to delay or limit the projected climate impacts.“We’re entering uncharted territory and marine biodiversity will be under increased pressure to adapt,” Pidd said. “The past is no longer a good guide to the future.”Prof Jodie Rummer, a marine biologist at James Cook University who was not involved with the study, said ocean warming, oxygen loss and acidification were a “deadly trio” for marine life and changing conditions were already making survival more difficult.“We’ve seen differences in behaviour due to temperature changes that theGreat Barrier Reef, coral reefs and tropical ecosystems are facing already. Some fishes are actively seeking cooler habitats,” she said. Some small sharks, thought to be tolerant to challenging conditions, were also reaching their limits.“The rules that we’ve been relying on for ocean protection and conservation, they’re going to have to evolve,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A judge had found Taylor was shown in an “unrelentingly negative and defamatory” light.Taylor saidOfcomneeded “clearer guidance” to stop similar misrepresentations happening in future. “They have a lot to say about news accuracy but much less about fact-based drama, which sits in a grey area,” he said. “Ofcom should tighten that so people like me don’t have to rush off to the libel courts when nonsense like The Lost King happens.”Regarding fact-based drama, he added: “Not every single scene has got to be true, not every single conversation has got to be true, but if you’re presenting it as a true story, it has got to be substantially true. And if it’s not, you need to change the names of characters, change the names of organisations in it and tell the story in a very different way than if you are claiming it is a true story.”While stressing he did not want to “tie writers up in knots”, Taylor said the case should prompt Ofcom to act. “This outcome is potentially quite challenging for people writing these dramas now … but Ofcom stepping in would be helpful.”Reflecting on the settlement, Taylor said he felt “relieved and happy, regretful that I ever needed” to bring the case, but that he remained frustrated that the film would continue to be shown. “I’d rather it was edited. I’d rather the whole film was withdrawn,” he said.Under the settlement, a statement must appear for at least five seconds after the title card, clarifying that the “Mr Taylor” depicted is a fictionalised character. “In effect, the film’s going to have to say: ‘based on a true story, but actually the main villain is completely made up because the real guy [of the same name] was acting with integrity’. I think that’s going to make the film pretty ridiculous.”Taylor, now chief operating officer at Loughborough University, also criticised the film-makers for “not checking the facts” about events shown in the film. He said that, before the film’s release, Coogan and his collaborators “didn’t take me seriously” when he raised concerns about being misrepresented.“My view is that they were dismissive,” he said. “Steve Coogan’s never anything other than certain of his own righteousness, and I think he still thinks he was right in doing this.”Coogan said in a statement that he would have “preferred” for a judge to rule on the case, and that he was “happy” with the story the film told.Taylor said the film-makers had failed to verify basic details, including claims that he had excluded The Lost King’s protagonist, Philippa Langley, from press conferences. “If you’re told Philippa was excluded, you go and check that,” he said. “There’s video on YouTube showing her quite clearly speaking at all of them. They didn’t check the facts.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My integrity is really important to me.”“I feel I should never have been in that position and to do all of that over a portrayal that was false,” he said. “For the last three years it’s been … moments where it’s really quite intense and you feel quite anxious, quite stressed, quite worried.”A joint statement from Pathe Productions, Baby Cow Productions and Steve Coogan said: “As a distributor and producer recognised for bringing complex, real-life stories to audiences, we are deeply aware of the responsibility that comes with such portrayals and approach each project with care, integrity, and a commitment to authenticity.“We remain incredibly proud of this film and are pleased this matter has now been settled.”Explore more on these topicsSteve CooganOfcomRichard IIInewsShareReuse this content"

It followed officers shouting at a suspect to drop a knife, which he can be seen holding, and to get on the ground.The Metropolitan police said officers were called at 5pm on Monday to a triple stabbing.It is believed the man arrested was staying at the house and a row broke out.Two other males, believed to be father and son, aged 45 and 14, were stabbed. Police said the older man’s injuries were “life-changing but not life-threatening”, while the boy’s injuries were “neither life-threatening nor life-changing”.The attack is not being treated as terrorism, and detectives are working to establish any relationship between the suspect and the three victims, police said.Ch Supt Jill Horsfall said:“This was a shocking and senseless act of violence that has left one man dead and two others injured. Our thoughts are with the victim’s family and friends at this unimaginably difficult time.“The incident will have understandably caused concern to the local community, I have deployed multiple officers to the local area, they will be here throughout the week to provide reassurance while detectives work intensely to piece together the circumstances.“I understand that there has been a lot of speculation online following on from this incident; we ask that you rely on us for information, and that you do not share sensitive footage.”View image in fullscreenAbout 100 people held a one-minute silence by the cordon earlier on Tuesday evening. Some have placed flowers at the scene.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAPolice said the 49-year-old victim’s family had been informed and were being supported by officers.The Met confirmed that the man arrested was an Afghan national.Government sources said he arrived in the UK on a lorry in 2020. In 2022 he was granted asylum and leave to remain.The nationalities of the man killed and two injured males were not provided by police.Robin Stevens, 50, said he heard sirens on Monday evening but did not find out what had happened until Tuesday morning. He said: “I grew up on this street, I’ve lived on this street for 50 years and I’ve always known it to be quite a family oriented area.”Wisam Salah, 18, said the three stabbings, with one man losing his life, had affected local people adding: “Everyone is really panicked.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

The party must “change or cease to be relevant”, he said.“To embrace such a narrow philosophy shrinks the party from being a broad-based national movement to resembling a petty and mean-minded cult.“The party needs its right wing, its centre, and centre-left Conservatives back together in the fold. If that can be done, then we may once again widen our appeal and be a power in the land. The alternative is bleak.”Major also urged scepticism over the archetypal “strongman leader” who promised voters a shiny new world. “For such figures lead no one to utopia. Instead, to gain and keep power they sweep away the compromises and decencies of democracy.”He said Reform was trying to be “all things to all people” and as a result was making promises that could never be kept, such as nationalising the water industry. “This is amateur populism let loose. Such foolish promises illustrate their unsuitability for power,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The footage has not been verified.In a statement on Tuesday, the Joint Forces – who are allied with Sudan’s army – accused the RSF of having executed more than 2,000 unarmed civilians in recent days.View image in fullscreenA screen grab from unverified footage shared by Sudanese activists that purports to show bodies and burnt vehicles in El Fasher.Photograph: Facebook | تنسيقية لجان المقاومة _الفاشرYale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab, which has been monitoring the war in Sudan using open-source intelligence and satellite imagery, said it had found evidence consistent with mass killings by the RSF.On Tuesday, the Yale lab said the city “appears to be in a systematic and intentional process of ethnic cleansing of Fur, Zaghawa, and Berti Indigenous non-Arab communities through forced displacement and summary execution”. This included what appeared to be “door-to-door clearance operations” in the city, it said.Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Yale Lab, said satellite evidence showed bodies on the ground and discoloration on the ground that is red. He compared the level of violence in the town to the first 24 hours of the Rwandan genocide.“We are only at the beginning of a wave of violence,” he said. “I have never seen a level of violence against an area like we are seeing now. This is only comparable with a Rwandan style killing in the first 24 hours.”The RSF said on Sunday it had seized control of the army’s main base in the city and released a statement saying it had “extended control over the city of El Fasher from the grip of mercenaries and militias”.The Sudanese army chief, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, said on Monday that his forces had withdrawn from El Fasher “to a safer location”, acknowledging the loss of the city.View image in fullscreenThe grandmother of Ikram Abdelhameed looks on next to her family while sitting at a camp for displaced people who fled from al-Fashir to Tawila.Photograph: Mohammed Jamal/ReutersThe RSF has been engaged in a bloody civil war with the army since April 2023 after a power struggle between the two sides.More than 150,000 peoplehave been killed andmore than 14 milliondisplaced due to the fighting.Fears had been mounting in recent weeks for the safety of tens of thousands of civilians trapped in the city by an 18-month RSF siege.The UN rights chief, Volker Türk, said on Monday there was a growing risk of “ethnically motivated violations and atrocities” in El Fasher. His office said it was “receiving multiple alarming reports that the Rapid Support Forces are carrying out atrocities, including summary executions”.The UN Human Rights Office said there were reports of “summary execution of civilians trying to flee, with indications of ethnic motivations for killings”, as well as videos showing “dozens of unarmed men being shot or lying dead, surrounded by RSF fighters who accuse them of being [Sudanese army] fighters”.News agencies have been unable to contact civilians in the city, where the Sudanese Journalists’ Syndicate says communications, including satellite networks, have been cut off by a media blackout.Sudan areas of control mapShayna Lewis, a Sudan specialist at Preventing and Ending Mass Atrocities, one of the groups closely in touch withDarfurcivilian society, accused the RSF of massacring civilians. She said: “Residents of El Fasher who previously left the city are finding out about the death of their loved ones through footage of executions that are widely circulating on social media.”There are grave fears of a repeat of the RSF massacres that took place in West Darfur’s capital, Geneina, after it captured the city in 2023, when up to 15,000 civilians – mostly from non-Arab groups – were killed.According to the UN, more than 1 million people have fled El Fasher since the start of the war and about 260,000 civilians, half of them children, remain trapped without aid. Many have resorted to eating animal fodder.The UN’s migration agency said more than 26,000 people had fled the fighting in El Fasher since Sunday, either seeking safety in the outskirts of the city or heading to Tawila, 45 miles to the west.In Tawila, teams from Médecins Sans Frontières said they were facing a massive influx of wounded coming from El Fasher to the town’s hospital. Since Sunday evening, 130 had been hospitalised, including 15 in critical condition, MSF said.Arjan Hehenkamp, Darfur crisis lead for the International Rescue Committee, said the town, which was already hosting a vast number of displaced people, was “at breaking point. Without a significant scale-up in humanitarian assistance, the suffering here will deepen further,” he said.Emi Mahmoud from the Darfur Internally Displaced People Network described the crisis as “the final stage of the Darfur genocide. I have seen videos of ditches and trenches entirely full of friends, neighbours and family members’ bodies. There have been reports of entire families hanging from trees.”The RSF’s capture of El Fasher, the last remaining major city in Darfur controlled by the army, gives the paramilitary group control over all five state capitals in Darfur and marks a significant turning point in the war.The army is now excluded from a third of Sudanese territory, a development that experts say raises the possibility the country could face partition.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSudanDarfurAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The minority party has refused to provide the necessary support for the bill to clear the 60-vote threshold for advancement in the Senate because it does not include funding for healthcare programs, or curbs onDonald Trump’s cuts to congressionally approved funding.The quagmire continued even after the president of the largest federal workers unioncalled on Congressto pass the Republican proposal, citing the economic pain caused to government workers.Two dozen states sue White House over food stamps suspension amid shutdownRead more“Both political parties have made their point, and still there is no clear end in sight. Today I’m making mine: it’s time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today. No half measures, and no gamesmanship. Put every single federal worker back on the job with full back pay – today,”Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), said in a statement released on Monday.But the top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, signaled no change in his party’s strategy of holding out for concession from theRepublicans, citing the imminent rise of premiums for Affordable Care Act health plans. Though tax credits that lower their costs expire at the end of the year, many enrollees in the plans have received notices of steep premium increases ahead of Saturday’s beginning of the open enrollment period.“Families are going to be in panic this weekend all across America, millions of them. How are they going to pay this bill? How are they going to live without healthcare? It’s tragic, and of course, it didn’t have to be, but Republicans are doing nothing,” Schumer told reporters at the US Capitol.The Republican Senate majority leader, John Thune, seized on the AFGE’s statement to argue thatDemocratswere being irresponsible for refusing to back the bill, which Republicans in the House of Representatives approved on a near party line vote last month before the speaker, Mike Johnson, ordered the chamber into a recess that has yet to end.View image in fullscreenThe Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, signaled no change in his party’s strategy of holding out for concession from the Republicans.Photograph: Bonnie Cash/UPI/Shutterstock“It’s not very often that I get a chance to say this, but I agree with the AFGE,” Thune said.He reiterated that he would negotiate with Democrats over the expiring tax credits, but not with “a gun to our heads”.“I sincerely hope, in the best interest of every American who is impacted by this shutdown, and particularly those who are going to be really adversely impacted come this weekend, that the enough Democrats will come to their senses and deliver the five votes that are necessary to get this bill on the president’s desk,” Thune said, adding that he planned to hold further votes on the spending legislation.Both parties traded blame for the imminentexpiration of fundingfor the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), also known as food stamps. The Department of Agriculture has announced that it does not have the money to continue providing the benefit after 1 November, though on Tuesday, more than two dozen statessued the Trump administration, arguing that funds are available for Snap benefits to continue.North Dakota senator Kevin Cramer said Democrats should either support a proposal from fellow Republican senator Josh Hawley to allow Snap to continue during the shutdown, “or they could just reopen the damn government, which is what they should be doing and should have been doing for the last month”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It continues to create a death spiral coming down with regard to the increasing costs. There are people out there, real people, that are going to get hurt because Obamacare is not working,” he said.Leader of top federal worker union calls for end of US government shutdownRead moreIn an interview, Massachusetts DemocratElizabeth Warrensignaled no change in the party’s strategy for the shutdown, whichbeganat the start of the month after Congress failed to pass legislation to continue funding that expired at the end of September.“Millions of people across this country are receiving their health insurance premium notices, and telling Democrats and Republicans, lower those costs,” Warren said. “Democrats are in there fighting to lower healthcare costs for millions of Americans.Donald Trumpwould rather shut down the government than help out these families.”Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine who has repeatedly broken with Trump as she faces what is expected to be a tough re-election contest next year, said she did not buy that the agriculture department lacked funding to continue Snap, but noted the money it had on hand was not enough to cover the program’s costs.However, Collins expressed concerns aboutthe readinessof air traffic controllers, who did not receive a fully paycheck on Tuesday due to the shutdown. She noted that on two recent flights to Ronald Reagan Washington National airport, her plane had to divert at the last second.“I can’t help but think that reflects the strain on air traffic controllers,” she said.Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025US SenateDemocratsRepublicansTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

The latest report looked at three regions of Ukraine in particular – Kherson, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk – which are close to the frontline and where drone attacks have increased in intensity over the past year.In this area the frontline runs along the Dnipro River, and the report’s authors found that Russian drones sent across the lines had relentlessly targeted civilians and their houses, as well as gathering points, humanitarian distribution points, and objects of critical infrastructure that service civilians. Often, the attacks targeted the same locations repeatedly. Drone operators have also targeted ambulance crews and fire brigades.The Russians have used various models of “small, short-range, and low-cost” drones, usually equipped with cameras and a guidance system, in the attacks. Some of them explode on impact while others drop explosives from above. These drones are distinct from the larger, long-range drones that Russia uses to bombard cities across Ukraine on a near-nightly basis.Citing local authorities, the report estimated that more than 200 civilians have been killed by short-range Russian drones in the three regions over the past year, with 2,000 suffering injuries. The report’s authors conducted more than 200 interviews and reviewed more than 500 pieces of video evidence.According to the report, the drone attacks amount to murder, as well as the war crime of intentionally targeting civilians. It also found that the attacks were being committed “as part of a coordinated policy to drive out civilians from those territories and amount to the crime against humanity of forcible transfer of population”.Residents of Kherson recounted the grim reality of life under constant threat of targeted drone strikesto the Guardian late last year, explaining how simple trips around town had become a gauntlet where death could strike at any time.“I heard the drone coming as the bus pulled in but I thought it would follow the bus, because that’s what they do, they hunt the buses,” said Dima Olifirenko, a 22-year-old Kherson resident. “But when it drove off the drone was still there and I realised even if I ran after the bus it would get me. There was nowhere to hide.”Olifirenko suffered shrapnel injuries to his face when the drone exploded. “Drones are much worse than artillery, [where] you can hear the launch and where its flying,” he said. “With a drone, it’s there, it sees you, and you are done.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It quoted a woman who lived in an area frequently targeted by drones who spoke about the psychological impact: “It is a lottery – will a drone fly in or not? You go to bed and you don’t know if you will be killed or wake up in the morning.”Russia has always denied targeting civilians, but over nearly four years of full-scale war in Ukraine, Russian missiles and drones have frequently hit civilian areas. Russian authorities declined to cooperate with the UN inquiry. The authors said they had also wanted to investigate Russian reports of Ukrainian drone attacks against civilian targets in Russian-occupied areas, but had been unable to do so due to a lack of engagement from Moscow.“The Russian Federation continued not to recognise the Commission and 35 written requests for access, information, and meetings, remained unanswered,” the report said.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropeUnited NationsWar crimesnewsShareReuse this content"

We are actively collaborating with local authorities and will send a team of animal care experts to assist as needed.”All but one of the monkeys were said by local police officials to have been “destroyed” later on Tuesday. “We are continuing to look for the one monkey that is still on the loose,” the sheriff’s department added.Explore more on these topicsMississippiAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

For several years the list has included the chipmaker Nvidia, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Alphabet (the owner of Google) and Meta (the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp).Five years on, Foot expects to complete the purchase of a “bigger house in London than I expected”, a dream he could not have realised without his stock market bets paying off.What marks out Foot and his generation of young stock market investors is their bravery. When shares slide, they refuse to sell. Instead they sit tight and wait for the upturn, ortreat the dips as a buying opportunity.The week before last, shares dropped on both sides of the Atlantic. In the US the S&P 500, which tracks the largest listed companies in the US, lost more than 200 points.The drop came amid dire warnings of a major stock market correction, if not a full-blown financial crash. TheBank of England,the International Monetary Fund(IMF) andthe boss of the US bank JP Morganwere among those raising fears that popular investments, including tech company shares, gold, crypto and bonds, were over-valued and could implode.Yet despite the dire warnings, the stock market panic was shortlived and the loss of value was shallow, with theFTSE100 and Wall Street again hitting record highs.The rises followed a boom month in September, when shares often go sideways or fall. The S&P rose by more than in any previous September in the last 15 years.The increases over the past 12 months are even starker, with shares in the M7 surging almost 37%, outstripping the 15% racked up by the rest of the S&P 500, according to FactSet data.The M7 now accounts for more than a third of the entire S&P 500 and Nvidia has a share price to earnings ratio of 54; investors would normally begin to twitch at a ratio of 25. Microsoft and Apple both passed $4tn valuation on Tuesday, joining Nvidia as the only companies to pass that threshold, though Apple later eased back just below.Why have valuations continued accelerating? The warnings from the IMF and others triggered selling by algorithmic trading platforms and even among seasoned professionals in the finance industry, but market watchers say young investors played a major role in averting a bigger fall.Companies that make money out of betting on dips in share values – short sellers – are so rattled they have taken to complaining about this new cohort of amateur speculators.Earlier this month, Carson Block, founder of the short seller Muddy Waters, told the Financial Times: “Cycles have become so long and the corrections so short, that the demand for traditional short selling is just not there.”Block said investors were confident, and ballsy, rallying around battle cries such as BTFD, or “buy the fucking dip”.View image in fullscreenPresident Trump Holds a Make America Wealthy Again event on 2 April, which he named ‘liberation day’.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/GettyOne episode illustrates the point. On 3 April, while theS&P 500 dived by almost 5%the day after Trump announced his “liberation day” tariffs, retail investors pushed more than $3bn into US stocks, according to Vanda Research – the largest daily injection of cash since the market analyst began keeping a tally in 2014.The phenomenon is leading to more interest in the “inelastic markets hypothesis”, proposed in 2021 by the economists Xavier Gabaix and Ralph Koijen, of the US thinktank the National Bureau of Economic Research, which argues that share prices can be pushed up by an increase in the amount of money available to invest.The theory goes that prices are rising not because of the prospects and profitability of the M7 and other popular assets, but because of the wall of money being pushed into the markets by amateur speculators. The trend has been compounded by an increase in low-cost passive investments by pension schemes and fund managers, which channel savings into an ever-smaller group of the fastest growing stocks.Sam Woods, the outgoing head of the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulatory Authority, said in a speech last week to City grandees that the financial services industry had “plenty to worry about” – including “opaque and complex private lending by non-banks, recent cracks emerging in US credit, the risk of an AI bubble, and overly concentrated life reinsurance structures”.But he played down the likelihood of a systemic disaster. “Given the hazardous terrain in which we now find ourselves, we seem reasonably well-equipped,” he said.That’s in the UK. The US is another matter, with a president in charge whose family has madehundreds of millions of dollars from cryptocurrency venturesand who wants to roll back regulations in a way that would horrify Woods.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He believes that young investors have created “a perfect environment” for financial bubbles to grow and become unsustainable.“More and more young (and some not so young) investors do not think in terms of fundamentals, ie in terms of present discounted values,” he posted on X.“They base their decisions on past returns. What has gone up (bitcoin), will [continue going] up. Who cares about fundamentals?”Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at the trading platform IG, says: “The M7 remain hugely popular with individual investors. They are global titans, known everywhere and which generate huge profits.“Still, you need a stomach of steel to look through some of ups and downs.”He says investors are from across the age ranges but there has been an influx of younger people who cut their teeth dabbling in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.Another factor could be the “house money effect” – the tendency to take greater risks reinvesting an early win, of the kind that might have followed a foray into high-profile stocks such as Tesla or Amazon or watching a friend make gains. Psychologically, the money placed on subsequent bets isn’t considered your own, so you’re less cautious.Low-cost trading apps will also have played a part the investment bonanza, along with and videos on YouTube and TikTok exalting the benefits of stock trading.“There is a natural read across to the crypto world, with people talking about how rich they would be if only they had bought bitcoin at $5,” Beauchamp says.View image in fullscreenFoot first bought Nvidia shares when they were priced at $25. In March this year they had risen to more than $140 before falling to $94.Photograph: NurPhoto/GettyExperts question whether amateur traders will remain confident when there are so many warnings of an impending crash. Traditionally they have suffered badly by being last to join the party and last to cut their losses.Foot, who uses the IG-owned Freetrade website to buy and sell shares, describes his investment portfolio as a “sideline” while he worked full-time for three years, straight from school, as a tax analyst for the accountants EY. He says there have been nervous moments.He first bought Nvidia shares when they were priced at $25. In March this year they had risen to more than $140 before falling to $94 after Trump’s 2 April tariff announcement. But he held his positions and then bought more shares at the cheaper price. Nvidia stock has since recovered to trade at about $190 a share.“I wanted a good balance between ‘set and forget’ stocks like the M7 and a few smaller companies with good upside potential. It’s been quite a risk, but has paid off.“I didn’t deny myself the occasional holiday, but I took my own lunch to work,” he says of his determination to keep saving to invest each month.The AI revolution “has legs”, he says, and he remains heavily invested in the M7, where the chip designer Broadcom has now replaced Tesla. But he admits to becoming more conservative since cashing in his winnings for a mortgage deposit.In 2007, only a year before the biggest financial crash since the 1930s, the US banker Chuck Princewas askedwhy he had continued to provide sub-prime loans to people with low incomes and trade in exotic derivatives based on those loans.The former Citigroup boss answered: “As long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.”Retail investors are still dancing, riding out the dips and pushing the market higher. How long that can continue before a loss of confidence triggers a correction is a question many market analysts would like to answer.Explore more on these topicsInvestingArtificial intelligence (AI)Stock marketsTechnology sectorSharesFinancial sectorFTSEfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This summer, its CEOwarned white-collar employeestheir jobs could be taken by artificial intelligence.Beth Galetti, a senior vice-president at Amazon, wrote in a memo to employees on Tuesday: “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of … work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs.”On Monday,Reutersandthe Wall Street Journalreported that Amazon was poised to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, as it tries to undo the vast recruitment drive it embarked on at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, which unleashed an extraordinary – but fleeting – surge in demand for online shopping.CNBCcalled it the largest layoff in the company’s history.The layoffs represent a small portion of Amazon’s sprawling global workforce of 1.55 million employees, but a significant chunk of its roughly 350,000 corporate employees.Amazon declined to comment on the reports of wider layoffs on Monday, before Galetti announced the 14,000 the following day. She also told employees that the firm would seek to identify “additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains” in 2026.“Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well,” wrote Galetti. “Across our businesses, we’re delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly.“This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones).”Shares in Amazon, which is scheduled to report quarterly earnings later this week, rose 1.2% on Monday after the initial reports of job cuts.Other giants of the internet have likewise backtracked on the major hiring undertaken during the coronavirus pandemic. Microsoft; Meta, parent of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook; and Alphabet, parent of Google and YouTube, have all laid off tens of thousands of workers in the past three years.Back in June, Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, told employees that AI agents – tools that carry out tasks autonomously – and generative AI systems such as chatbots would require fewer employees in some areas.“It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce,” Jassy wrote in a memo to staff.In recent years, Amazon has been trimming smaller numbers of jobs across multiple divisions, including devices, communications, podcasting and others.This week’s wave of cuts is expected to affect a wide variety of divisions within Amazon, including human resources, known as people experience and technology, devices and services and operations, among others. Fortunereportedthat as many as 15% of the firm’s HR roles could be hit, citing multiple sources familiar with Amazon’s plans.Managers of affected teams were asked to undergo training on Monday for how to communicate with staff following notifications that will start going out via email tomorrow morning, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources.Jassy has been undertaking an initiative to reduce what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy at the company, including by reducing the number of managers, and introduced an anonymous complaint line for claims of inefficiencies that has elicited about 1,500 responses and more than 450 process changes, he said earlier this year.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsAmazonnewsShareReuse this content"

Nvidia was the first, in July, as the chip designer rode the wave of AI spending. Itcurrently leads with a market value of more than $4.5tn.Microsoft hit the $4tn mark a few weeks later in July. After a subsequent dip in its share price, it reclaimed its membership in the $4tn club on Tuesday after it announced a deal with OpenAI to allow the ChatGPT maker to restructure itself into a for-profit corporation.

Recent reports also indicate that the company is losing a number of its senior artificial intelligence executives to Meta.However, Apple reported its strongest quarterly results in years during the April-June period, with double-digit growth across key segments, and its forecasts were better than analysts’ expectations. The company is expected to announce its fourth-quarter results on Thursday when analysts anticipate its highly profitable services division – which includes iCloud and Apple Pay – will surpass $100bn in revenue.The continued strength in the technology sector, along with hopes of another cut in US interest rates, helped lift Wall Street to new highs.

OpenAI was valued at $500bn under the terms of the deal, making Microsoft’s stake worth more than $100bn.More than a million people every week show suicidal intent when chatting with ChatGPT, OpenAI estimatesRead moreThe restructuring paves the way for theChatGPTmaker to more easily raise capital and profit off its artificial intelligence technology, even as it remains technically under the control of its own original non-profit entity.Jennings said in a statement she did not object to the proposal, seemingly bringing to an end more than a year of negotiations and announcements about the future of OpenAI’s governance and the power that for-profit investors and its non-profit board will have over the organization’s technology. The attorneys general of Delaware, where OpenAI is incorporated, and California, where it is headquartered, had both said they’re investigating the proposed changes.OpenAI said it completed its restructuring “after nearly a year of engaging in constructive dialogue” with the offices in both states.“OpenAI has completed its recapitalization, simplifying its corporate structure,” said a blog post on Tuesday from Bret Taylor, the chair of OpenAI’s board of directors.Elon Musk, one of the co-founders of OpenAI and a former ally of Altman, had challenged the conversion with a lawsuit, which he dropped once and refiled before making a surprise bid of nearly $100bn to take control of the startup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

OpenAI was founded as a non-profit in 2015 with a mission to safely build AGI for humanity’s benefit.OpenAI had previously said its own board will decide when AGI is reached, effectively ending its Microsoft partnership. But it now says that “once AGI is declared by OpenAI, that declaration will now be verified by an independent expert panel”, and that Microsoft’s rights to OpenAI’s confidential research methods “will remain until either the expert panel verifies AGI or through 2030, whichever is first”. Microsoft will also retain some commercial rights to OpenAI products “post-AGI”.Microsoft put out the same announcement about the revised partnership on Tuesday but declined further comment.Going forward, the non-profit will be called the OpenAI Foundation and Taylor said it would grant out $25bn toward health and curing diseases and protecting against the cybersecurity risks of AI. He did not say over what time period those funds would be disbursed.Robert Weissman, co-president of the non-profit Public Citizen, said this arrangement does not guarantee the non-profit independence, likening it to a corporate foundation that will serve the interests of the for-profit.Even as the non-profit’s board may technically remain in control, Weissman said that control “is illusory because there is no evidence of the non-profit ever imposing its values on the for-profit”.Explore more on these topicsOpenAIChatGPTArtificial intelligence (AI)Sam AltmanElon MuskLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Fifty! I’m gutted because he’s my favourite DJ at the moment. It’s a shame because gigs are such a wonderful communal experience and an outlet for life’s frustration. We’re missing out.”Seeing live music is becoming increasingly expensive across the UK, thanks in part to the cost of living crisis, as well as the rise of resale websites and some artists and promoters deployingdynamic ticket pricing. It’s leading some fans to rethink their gig-going habits.“I go a lot less frequently these days,” says Amy. “We’re especially getting ripped off in London. I was keen to see Lorde at the O2 in November, but I couldn’t justify it.”Amy has taken matters into her own hands and has booked a flight to Luxembourg to see Lorde play a show there for €50 (£43.62). “The flights were about £18 each way. With accommodation, it does put it over the London ticket – but I’m seeing a whole new country for that amount of money.”Mark Rushton, 65, from Bury, says the extra fees that come with larger gigs have put him off going to see shows in Manchester. “It’s the outrageous prices, plus booking fees and car parks. There are bigger venues than ever, yet limited availability. I can’t take my daughter to some shows as it can be hundreds of pounds for a night out.”Rushton points at Ticketmaster for “enabling” high fees, and the company has recentlyagreed to change its sales tacticsafter outraged Oasis fans complained about its handling of the band’s 2025 tour. At the behest of the Competition and Markets Authority, Ticketmaster must now give fans notice if there are going to be multiple prices for the same kind of ticket, and give them more information about ticket pricing while they are in online queues. . (Ticketmaster told the Guardian in a statement: “In a highly competitive UK market, Ticketmaster’s fees have remained largely unchanged – averaging around 11% – for nearly a decade. These fees power the technology, security, and customer support that enable millions of fans to safely discover, buy, and enjoy live events each year.”)View image in fullscreenNathan Maddison (left) with John Bush of the bands Armored Saint and Anthrax.Photograph: Guardian Community“As the prices have risen, and as Ticketmaster has become the biggest platform, I’ve cut down on gigs,” says Rushton. “I saw Bruce Springsteen at the Co-op Live in May. I picked my ticket up off [ticket resale site] Twickets for £150, which was reduced, because I made an offer on it – but you still get the transaction fees. In 1981, I saw him at the Apollo in Manchester for £6.50” – about £25 today.Nathan Maddison, 57, a finance technician from Newcastle, says he is cutting back on larger gigs – which is a big deal for him as a rock and metal fan. “I turned down an opportunity to see Iron Maiden in June, as financially it was just not doable,” he says.“I will travel to gigs, but you’ve got to factor in the transport and accommodation costs.” These have become more costly, too:since the 2010s, rail fares have risen faster than wagesin the UK.Elaine, 48, from London, says she has recently become a “one and done” gig goer. “These outrageous ticket prices have stopped me going to see someone I’ve seen before that I like, such as Lady Gaga recently.She says the prices of food and drink in big venues “also makes you feel ripped off. It’s taken the fun out of going to see music live.”Elaine has decided to see bands at smaller venues from now on. “I did have the pleasure recently of watching a fantastic gig by Brandi Carlile at Heaven in London which was only £24 a ticket. It was a wonderful night out discovering her music, at a decent price.”Mark Woollard, 51, a facilities manager from London, says he has also embraced smaller gigs in the last few years. “I’m choosing to spend the money on up and coming artists. It’s been great to experience truly intimate gigs in grassroots venues. The tickets are £16 or £17. You often end up meeting the artists themselves selling their merch after their performances, which is another lovely aspect.View image in fullscreenMark Woollard (right) with his wife (left) and the band members of Prima Queen (middle).Photograph: Guardian Community“My recent favourites are Prima Queen, Honeyglaze and Coming Up Roses. I’ve also seen reunion gigs – not the Oasis tour, but smaller bands doing their 20-year album revisit.”Mark’s new approach has broadened his musical horizons. “I’m actually seeing more shows,” he says. “I’ve always been interested in finding new artists, but in the last couple of years I’ve actively gone out and hunted down these little gigs.”This article was updated on Tuesday 28 October to clarify changes to Ticketmaster’s sales tactics.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockMusic industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It takes us through his childhood in Glasgow and his sparkling career at Celtic, at a time when the stars were hardly financially better off than the fans, before Dalglish arrived at Liverpool, effectively taking over Kevin Keegan’s position. Kapadia makes his central focus the mysterious inner trial, perhaps Dalglish’s hidden ordeal, that took place between 1985 to 1989; from Heysel to Hillsborough.Dalglish was the easygoing, level-headed everyman whose destiny it was to take the city’s woes on his shoulders. He became player-manager just afterthe Heysel stadium disaster in 1985, when there were 39 deaths as a result of a riot at the dilapidated Belgian ground before the Juventus v Liverpool European Cup final. It was a day of shame for Liverpool, whose fans were held to be responsible – although subsequent analysis of the stadium design, crowd control and policing revealed a situation not too far from the Hillsborough tragedy in 1989, which resulted in the deaths of 97 Liverpool fans – largely due to the fencing that, as Kapadia shows, was a catastrophe waiting to happen.Throughout, Dalglish was a stoic figure, consistently visiting hospitals and attending funerals with his players. Kapadia shows the grim spectacle of Margaret Thatcher showing up at Hillsborough a couple of days after the disaster, radiating her distaste for football and its massed fans; for her, football was the leisure-activity dimension of trade-unionism. Did she see Hillsborough as all that different from Orgreave? Her government effectively greenlitthe Sun’s grotesque “The Truth” headlinewhich caused that paper’s circulation to collapse on Merseyside. The paper’s editor Kelvin MacKenzie cravenly asked Dalglish how he could put things right and Dalglish crisply suggested a new headline: “We Lied.” He quit as manager soon afterwards, apparently worn down by the stress; even though the burden was onerous, he returned to management apparently without permanent mental scarring.Kapadia could have included a larger discussion of hooliganism which was a wider phenomenon than you might guess from this film. But that discussion would need to show how hooliganism was partly a response to how contemptuously working-class supporters were often treated. Kapadia doesn’t mention it, but Dalglish would have been well aware of Glasgow’s terribleIbrox disasters of 1971and1902: the catastrophes at Rangers’ ground causing 66 and 25 deaths respectively, fatalities which were almost shrugged at by the authorities.And there is another historical echo which Kapadia simply allows us to notice without explicit comment: that vast field of flowers at Anfield in 1989 prefigured the outpouring of grief at Princess Diana’s death in 1997, a new language of public grief which has a pointed message for those in charge. As for Dalglish himself, he emerges as a straightforward figure without the agonised complexity of other figures that Kapadia has covered, such asDiego MaradonaorAmy Winehouse, and this film doesn’t have that dysfunctional danger and fascination. But maybe it was just his ingenuous simplicity that allowed Dalglish to survive.Kenny Dalglish is in cinemas on 29 and 30 October, and on Prime Video from 4 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsKenny DalglishHillsborough disasterLiverpoolAsif KapadiareviewsShareReuse this content"

Need I say more?Prof Saxton (Christopher Lee) unearths a 2 million-year-old iceman while on an expedition to the Manchurian wilderness. It’s a nightmare trying to transport it back to the UK: his reservation on the Trans-Siberian Express gets messed up and he has to suffer the indignity of sharing a cabin with his professional rival Dr Wells (Peter Cushing). And to top it off, the iceman thaws out and starts melting passengers’ eyeballs.Through the course of their research, Saxton and Wells discover the iceman is in fact an awakened alien entity who has been around since the dawn of time, able to transfer its consciousness into any host it chooses – taking loose inspiration from John W Campbell’s novella Who Goes There, which also inspiredJohn Carpenter’s The Thing.The inclusion of TV hardman Telly Savalas as a Cossack officer, on board to troubleshoot the locomotive terror, is a piece of third-act genius which ups the stakes nicely. Also among the passengers are the glamorous Countess Irina Petrovski (Silvia Tortosa) and her creepy religious consul, Father Pujardov (Alberto de Mendoza), who blames every mishap on Satan. (Don’t they all?)Eat the rich … before they eat you: in praise of body horror classic SocietyRead moreHorror Express is one of the 20-odd movies the legendary Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing made together. But unlike their roles with legacy horror production house Hammer such as Dracula and Van Helsing, which frequently saw them as adversaries, Horror Express unites them against a common foe.There remains, of course, a touch of their antagonistic frisson. Professional rivalry simmers as Wells passive-aggressively surmises Saxton’s career as “[dabbling] in fossils and bones”. Saxton is all tweed and moustache and no messing about; if he ever had a sense of humour, he left it back on the frozen Manchurian wastelands. Wells is far more laid back, with the air of a man who knows he’s the smartest person in the room. He’s not above bribing a porter for a peek at Saxton’s goods, yet both men step up when the iceman goes on a rampage. Call it chivalry at its finest.View image in fullscreenChristopher Lee and Silvia Tortosa in Horror Express.Photograph: RGR Collection/AlamyThe iceman is a delightfully weird and grotty creation. Resembling a cross between a rotting Lucio Fulci zombie and a classicDoctor Whofiend, it lurches about the shadows with burning crimson eyes, moth-eaten fur and a desiccated, skull-like grimace. It absorbs its victims’ brains through their eyes and steals their memories.When it is suggested that anyone on board could be the alien, Wells indignantly (and hilariously) retorts: “Monster? We’re British, you know.” If this sentence came from anyone else it would push the bile to the back of my throat. But uttered by the kindly Cushing, the mild patriotism feels benign and endearingly polite, like he’s going to bring me a cup of tea.Horror Express might not have a tonne of competition as far as the locomotive creature feature goes – but even if it did, it would still reign supreme. What’s better than seeing two buttoned-down gents give a devilish beast the stiff upper lip? It’s as fun now as it was 53 years ago – almost as though it was kept on ice.Horror Express is available to stream on Tubi in Australia, BBC iPlayer in the UK and Roku in the US.

It’s a confusing, outdated watchHannah J DaviesTue 28 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 12.55 EDTShareIn the not-so-distant past, you would have had to bribe most people to get them to confess to being committed users of the social media site Reddit. As a Redditor of several years, let’s just say that I didn’t use to be particularly vocal about my daily consumption of “subreddits” (individual communities on the site) such as Malicious Compliance (mistakes people make at work, passive-aggressively), or the fairly self-explanatory Am I The Asshole? (AITA). These days, though, Reddit isn’t just for people who live in basements – everyone seems to be on there, rubbernecking in threads likeOpen Marriage Regretor just indulging inTV fandom. And now they’re evenmakingTV shows based on it.Jimmy Carr’s Am I the A**hole? (asterisks aside, no one in the programme can decide whether it’s pronounced “asshole” or “arsehole”) isn’t the first television show based on a subreddit – that award goes to the CW’s Two Sentence Horror Stories – but it may just be the laziest. The concept is simple: members of the public, who may or may not be online content creators, tell a story of possible assholery to host Carr and panellists GK Barry and Jamali Maddix in front of a studio audience. The trio then decide who is the biggest asshole (arsehole?) of the day, gently ribbing them in the process (sometimes not-so-gently, too – this is Mr Bad Taste,Jimmy Carr, after all). Imagine if Would I Lie to You? was 50% less wholesome and you’ve got the general shape of the thing. It is, says Carr, “the show that does for arseholes what Naked Attraction did for, well, arseholes”.View image in fullscreenStraight-talking … Jamali Maddix one of the panellists on Jimmy Carr’s Am I the A**hole?Photograph: Comedy Central/Paramount GlobalThe issue, though, isn’t that Am I the A**hole? often verges into shock territory (Carr is seemingly contractually obligated to make a paedophile joke at least once an episode), but rather that none of it makes any sense whatsoever. In no particular order, here are some of the things that might get you dubbed an asshole/arsehole on the show: going halves on a first date; purposely ruining someone’s haircut because you thinkthey’rean arsehole; dumping someone via text; riding an electric scooter to work; putting pubes in someone’s food; and giving psychic readings that have ended friendships. Clearly, some of these things are more consequential (and mean) than others. But in the topsy-turvy, weirdly judgey world of Am I the A**hole? they all get equal billing and solicit the same impassioned debates between the panellists. Two episodes in, I became convinced that the original title of the show must have been Am I Being Unreasonable? (AIBU), another subreddit similar to AITA, but also the title of a Daisy May Cooper comedy. Because there’s absolutely no way that telling your little sister that Santa isn’t real – or, er, vaping – makes you an arsehole in the same way that blocking your fiancé on social media or telling your date that they’re fat does.As with much TV these days, the presence of online content creators (including a pair of identical twins that Maddix likens to Jedward) cheapens the whole thing, and feels unnecessary. Really, this is a show about the internet that seems to have no meaningful relationship to it at all, instead occupying an almost-dated corner that made me think of Cards Against Humanity or early Vice, when being ironically cruel and outre was par for the course. By the time we got to the arrival of “nude butler slash personal trainer who works in finance and lives off quadruple vodka Red Bulls”, I started to wonder whether I had genuinely teleported back to 2011.Strange and retro as it may be, I do think Barry, Maddix and Carr – yes, even Carr, as he makes another joke about pervy stepdads – are great at what they do. Barry in particular is a perfect mix of hype-woman for the more put-upon contestants, while also being brilliantly deadpan (“I think that’s how Covid started,” she says, flatly, when a woman recalls putting her finger into the drink of someone who had jumped the queue at a bar). Maddix is characteristically straight-talking, as he is on almost every other panel show you’ve seen him on. On the topic of a man who steals bits of his co-workers’ lunch, he doesn’t miss a beat in coining the phrase “scumbag tapas”. When faced with a woman who kicked her friend down a hill (yes, really), he reckons that “sometimes you’ve got to listen to the intrusive thought”.Am I the A**hole? makes little sense, but – then again – the world is weird, isn’t it? Still, the message is clear. Don’t put toenail clippings in your mate’s bolognese. Definitely don’t show anyone a picture of your dog. And talking about your air fryer?! You really are a nasty piece of work, aren’t you?Jimmy Carr’s Am I the A**hole? is on Paramount+Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewJimmy CarrTV comedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a film to compare withMichael Winterbottom’s ShoshanaandCherien Dabis’s All That’s Left of You, dramas that reopen the fraught issue of Britain’s own colonial history in Palestine.This is a heartfelt film, if rather stolidly paced and sometimes pedagogically conveyed. The cast includes such Palestinian heavyweight actors as Hiam Abbass and Saleh Bakri as passionate rebels. Jeremy Irons plays the high commissionerSir Arthur Wauchopewho presides with bland complacency over this troublesome possession. The other colonials are divided, in the traditional style, into “good British” – Billy Howle as a troubled and ineffectually pro-Arab civil servant – and “bad British” – Robert Aramayo as the brutal Captain Orde Wingate, who here personifies the arrogance and cruelty of the coloniser, shooting civilians in cold blood and ordering the collective punishment of entire villages.Jacir coolly laces her dialogue with echoes of the future: Wingate fiercely espouses his belief in a Zionist future for the region and tells a sceptic, “Perhaps you should consider what side of history you want to be on.” There is another complex reverberation when a Palestinian worker says: “They are replacing us with Jewish labour!”There is a huge cast of characters, with the film’s emotive content spread carefully across them all, although the heart of the story is Yusuf (Karim Daoud Anaya), a village boy who gets a job in Jerusalem with a worldly, centrist-liberal newspaper editor who is not averse to making an accommodation with Zionism. Yusuf is not particularly political but is inevitably radicalised by the brutal British. None of these characters quite flares passionately into life but all are persuasively portrayed, and it’s a vehement reminder of what doesn’t get taught in British schools.Palestine36 is in UK and Irish cinemas from 31 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPeriod and historical filmsPalestineIsraelreviewsShareReuse this content"

Then, if you read my books in chronological order, I don’t believe you would find yourself thinking,Something calamitous happened to this writer’s life in 1989. The books are their own journey.Extraordinary if true – but though the buoyant surface of Rushdie’s prose has betrayed little overt evidence of his status as the Ayatollah Khomeini’s marked man, the novels nonetheless track his trauma and its aftermaths faithfully. The first he published after the fatwa, 1995’s The Moor’s Last Sigh, begins with Moraes Zogoiby running for his life from unknown “pursuers”. Fury (2001), published after the Iranian president Mohammad Khatami declared the fatwa “finished” in 1998, is transparently the giddy, hyped-up novel of a man set free.Shalimar the Clown(2005) began, as Rushdie tells us, with “a single image that I couldn’t get out of my mind, the image of a dead man lying on the ground while a second man, his assassin, stood over him holding a bloodied knife”. This image, Rushdie says in Knife, was “a foreshadowing”. But it was also a looking backward, at the possible fate that Rushdie was forced to contemplate for years. “I’m a dead man”: this, he tells us in his 2012 memoirJoseph Anton, was the first thing he thought when he heard the news of the fatwa.Well, Rushdie isn’t a dead man. He’s still writing. The Eleventh Hour, a collection of five stories, seems intended as a kind of coda to his career. The stories are death-haunted. One of them is called Late; it’s an afterlife fantasy in which a Cambridge fellow, whose career has resembled both EM Forster’s (writing a great novel about India) and Alan Turing’s (helping to crack the Enigma code), dies and haunts a young Indian student named Rosa; what links them may be the buried crimes of empire. The Musician of Kahani replays Rushdie’s greatest hits: it is about a child born at midnight (“the approved hour for miraculous births in our part of the world”) who, aged four, abruptly becomes a gifted pianist (like the rock star Ormus Cama inThe Ground Beneath Her Feet, playing air guitar in his cradle).Rushdie has been one of the deep sources of contemporary fiction – he’s shaped the 21st-century Big Inventive NovelThese stories are entertaining but not particularly strong. The Musician of Kahana leans pretty heavily on cliche: “the university of life”, “priceless art”, “finger on the pulse”, “the wedding of the year” … In the South is better: a deft, moving anecdote about two old men in Mumbai who bicker and needle one another from their respective verandas. One of them, Junior, dies in an accident. The other, Senior, despairs, until he comes to believe that “death and life were just adjacent verandas”. Oklahoma invokes Kafka; it is a metafiction about a young Indian writer and the older American novelist he admires, or perhaps more than admires – in cases of literary influence, the story seems to ask, who is writing whom?Rushdie has been one of the deep sources of contemporary fiction. His fingerprints are all over the 21st-century Big Inventive Novel, with its sentient raindrops (Elif Shafak), its melodramatic families (Kiran Desai), its metamorphoses of race (Mohsin Hamid) and history (Marlon James). His influence has not been without its downsides. Rushdie has licensed lesser writers to be sentimental about their own powers of invention. He has given permission for characters to be flattened into comic stickers. And he has presided over a vast boom in telling rather than showing. The events of his own recent novels, such asThe Golden House(2017) andQuichotte(2019), have been relentlessly told, rather than dramatised, and the virus of telling – this and then this and then this! – has noticeably infected the contemporary novel. But Rushdie was a pathbreaker. The exuberance and linguistic force of Midnight’s Children is still, after 44 years, a joy to encounter on the page. Another writer might have been fatally discouraged by what Rushdie has gone through. But Rushdie was not. He wrote the books. And the books, many of them, have greatly mattered.“Our words fail us,” goes the final sentence of The Eleventh Hour. It is the conclusion of a story about a piazza – a public space – in which language, here figured as a human woman, is courted, usurped, ignored. Finally she screams and vanishes, at which point, the piazza’s buildings all crack: “The piazza is broken, and so, perhaps, are we.” Words have not yet failedSalman Rushdie, even if, in this self-consciously late book, the spectacular originality of his novelistic peak sounds more as an echo than as an urgently present voice.The Eleventh Hour: A Quintet of Stories by Salman Rushdie is published by Jonathan Cape (£18.99).

In the late 1970s, they won the approval of John Peel and NME, with the latter noting they had the same cartoonish energy as the Ramones.They wore polka dot minidresses, stripy tights and Dr Martens or platforms, an aesthetic in keeping with the brightly coloured confectionery after which they were named. Along with opening for acts including the Jam, Madness and the Undertones, the band were once supported by U2 and appeared on Top of the Pops in 1982 singing backing vocals on Captain Sensible’s chart-topping Happy Talk. That would turn out to be their career peak. Just two years later, having failed to have any hits of their own, and with guitarist Rachel Bor expecting a baby, Dolly Mixture went their separate ways.Now singer and bassist Debsey Wykes has written a book about this variously thrilling, chaotic and frustrating period in her life. It is a coming-of-age tale built around the diaries she kept detailing Dolly Mixture’s inception and their attempts to make progress in an industry that regarded all-girl bands, particularly those with a love of pop music, with suspicion or disdain. Teenage Daydream winningly captures the devil-may-care optimism of adolescence that, for Wykes along with Bor and drummer Hester Smith, led them to try their luck as musicians long before they owned, let alone mastered, their instruments. Though they consciously kicked against the nihilism of punk, it was the have-a-go ethos of the movement that led to their formation.Along with their youthful self-belief, Wykes articulates a touching camaraderie that came into its own as they faced sometimes hostile audiences. Supporting the Jam, she recalls spending “most of our set sailing valiantly on in front of a sea of parka-clad lads showing us the finger”. The scuzzy living conditions they endured are vividly drawn. Wykes recalls them holing up at their manager’s flat in Soho where anyone using the toilet would have to use an umbrella to protect them against downpours from the overhead cistern.Teenage Daydream is steeped in the combined hopefulness and dourness of the early 80s, evoking what it was to be young, on the dole and chasing your dreams in the early years of Thatcherism. Dolly Mixture didn’t have it easy, enduring financial hardship and outrageous sexism; many a time they get close to a record deal only to be stonewalled by male executives irritated by young women with opinions about how they should sound. It was with admirable bloody-mindedness that, having tried and failed to get label support for an album, they ended up self-releasing an LP. Yet it’s hard not to compare their experience to those of young bands today who, without access to benefits and with fewer small venues to play in, would almost certainly have thrown in the towel sooner.That the band have been consistently overlooked in accounts of the period more than justifies this book’s existence. Nonetheless, at points you get a sense of material being stretched thin. It’s one thing for Wykes to include diary entries detailing gigs, backstage shenanigans, record company meetings and ructions with managers. It’s another to pepper the book with fan letters that serve no clear function other than to break up the narrative. Dolly Mixture may have called it a day more than 40 years ago, but their influence endures. They were an inspiration for riot grrrl in the early 90s, while Saint Etienne loved them so much they drafted in Wykes as backing singer for their live shows. When a Dolly Mixture rarities LP was released in 2019, it swiftly sold out.The final chapter of Teenage Daydream sees Wykes visiting her old bandmates in Brighton in 2024 to tell them about this book and reflect on what they achieved. Dolly Mixture may have failed to dent the charts with their own songs, but at least they had a wild adventure. Better still, they managed to stay friends.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

My children and I paid it a visitTue 28 Oct 2025 09.44 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 11.51 EDTShareIn an attempt to avoid spending £80 to walk around a local park with my children to see some underwhelming spooky decorations, and having failed for the fifth year in a row to secure a ticket to a Scottish farm to tramp damply around looking at pumpkins, I tried something different with my kids this Halloween: a virtual pumpkin festival.Ghost Town Pumpkin Festivalwas first created in the depths of the 2020 pandemic, when game developer Adam Robinson-Yu’s real-life neighbourhood pumpkin festival was cancelled. (Yu also made the excellent and equally autumnalA Short Hike.) Since then, it has returned for a few weeks every year, letting players come together as adorable ghosts to explore a creepy little micro-world filled with player-created pumpkins. It has improved slightly every year: 2024’s big addition was a haunted house escape room, which took me and my kids a good hour to figure out, and this year there’s a movie theatre that plays eerie silent films for a roomful of nobody.Everywhere you go you see other players floating around in the form of classic sheet-ghosts with drawn-on faces and, sometimes, fetching hats. Pumpkins crowd every surface, from the benches outside the skeleton-filled barn to the corridors of the haunted house. Many of these, as you might expect, are gaming-themed: alongside a brace of presumably child-created gurning faces and cat-on-moon silhouettes, I spotted a tribute to Hollow Knight and a fastidious recreation of Majora’s Mask fromthe scariest Zelda game.The trailer for last year’s FestivalThe advantages of a virtual Halloween festival are many: you cannot get scammed out of £8 for a watery hot chocolate or cardboard-like chips from a food van, you can carve as many virtual pumpkins as you like and undo your mistakes if you mess it up, and it is not a problem if your six-year-old refuses to wear a coat. But I did not expect Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival to be as good as it is. Behind the obvious attractions – a challenging hedge maze, a tractor ride through barns full of endearingly rubbish creepy decorations and jump scares – hide a bunch of hidden secrets (and collectible pin badges) that I only found when I took an hour to explore on my own.Take the movie theatre: on my way out of the cinema, I tried the door to the bathroom and found it locked. Behind the popcorn counter, a key; beside the toilet door, an enticing-looking code pinned to a notice board. Once I figured that out, I found another key in one of the toilets, and then an “access restricted” door down by the side of the screen in the theatre itself. The excellent bite-sized horror game that lurked behind that door was actually too scary for my children and, if I’m honest, for me. (Thankfully you can turn all the frightening things off in a menu that includes fake-blood spatter and an option to replace scary images with dogs.)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

ButGayathiri Kamalakanthan’s debut play is also a bold study of Tamil history and identity. Set in 2010 and using the celebratory ritual that follows a teenager’s first period as a catalyst, it focuses on the thoughts and feelings of Krish, a 15-year-old who has not yet told their family they are non-binary.It is a deeply endearing play, with Krish’s inner conflicts about wanting to please their family spilling out across the stage in candid revelations. But the structure of Kamalakanthan’s writing feels haphazard. From naturalistic scenes, the drama clumsily shifts to monologues that address the audience directly – then recorded interviews for a school project about “cultural heritage” are used as transitional snapshots. Despite the creativity, the various techniques prevent the play from coming together as a unified vision.Still, with the relationship between Krish and their ever-attentive best friend Brenavee at the heart of the production, it is virtually impossible not to be touched. Played by Elizabeth Green and Tanvi Virmani, their friendship sings with warmth and the kind of intimacy that comes from dedicating all their time to one another. As Brenavee begins to confront her true feelings for Krish, her rising insecurities bubble over as childlike jealousy.The set – designed by Katie Scott – is a shapeshifting spectacle. The toilet cubicle, where we witness some inspired directing by Gitika Buttoo of Brenavee struggling to insert Krish’s first tampon, morphs into both teenagers’ respective rooms, as well as the scene of the period party. With movement direction by Sundeep Saini, we watch Krish’s growing discomfort as a veil is placed over their head.It’s very funny, too – Kamalakanthan is a master of writing adolescent turmoil, and the generational misunderstandings between Krish and their mother, Brintha, stretch out into chasms. Moving between languages, their conversations play out in the sound of an authentic British Tamil home. When they finally reveal all they’ve kept silent from each other, it feels like a bridge is being lifted.That’s the skill of Buttoo’s production – it hits you right in the emotional gut. This is a tender, delicate exploration of self-discovery.AtSoho theatre, London, until 22 November.Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreSoho theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Maybe it is drunk or drugged as it towers and slumps, a red and brown creature with a demonic face and sagging stomach. If the cord suspending it from the ceiling snapped it would just be a pile of hemp on the floor.View image in fullscreenExhilarating … Jauba, by Mrinalini Mukherjee.Photograph: © Tate/Courtesy of Mrinalini Mukherjee FoundationThis monster has all the qualities that make the art of Mrinalini Mukherjee, who was born in Mumbai in 1949 and died in 2015, funny, fascinating and surreal. She created it in 1985, making it, like many of her works, with tightly woven, intensely coloured natural fibres. It is called Pakshi, meaning bird, and now I see it, the feathery flanks and floppy wings. Mukherjee’s sculpture is a hallucinatory but sharply observed response to nature, full of echoes of the Indian landscape and, in this case, India’s skies. If a bird can become an ogre in her fantastic imagination, a flower can grow into a fat, sprawling, bloodied excrescence and a tree transmute into gold. So why does the Royal Academy try to suffocate her exhilarating works in an incoherent show that surrounds them with mediocre stuff by much less interesting artists?The grand title is A Story of South AsianArt, but no story is told here that excites or even makes sense. A simple, traditional retrospective – artist is born, starts career, work develops – would give you a nice linear framework but oh no, that would be too simple. Instead this meander “traces a century of south Asian art” as the wall text at the entrance says, setting Mukherjee within a “constellation of mentors, friends and family”. But why? Any gain is negligible compared with the loss of energy and urgency.View image in fullscreenNice enough … Lady with Fruitby Benode Behari Mukherjee.Photograph: JFernandes/Tate. Courtesy of Mrinalini Mukherjee FoundationIt starts out nicely enough. Mukherjee’s parents were artists and her father Benode Behari Mukherjee struggled with visual impairment, eventually becoming blind. Maybe that is why his Matisse-like collages are so electrically bright, loving colour like it’s life. But if you want to pursue this idea of exploring Mrinalini Mukherjee’s affinities, she seems to have got her gift for sculpture from her mother Leela, whose carved wooden figures have a chunky totemic energy.Of course context is important, but why not go deeper? Mrinalini Mukherjee’s sculpture has ancient and marvellous, and clearly self-aware, roots in Indian art – or south Asian art as is pedantically insisted on here – with its history of natural observation, hooded cobras, elephant-headed gods, dancing bodies and abstract freedom, most mysteriously in the representation of Shiva as a cylindrical lingam. Mrinalini Mukherjee’s woven hemp sculpture Adi Pushp II reminded me of a lingam, probably because they both take inspiration from the stamen of a flower. This sculpture, whose title means “First Flower”, is a grossly shaped, triffidian plant that blossoms with erotic suggestiveness. It’s consciously, smartly rooted in India’s religions and art and leaves all the other artists in the deep shade it casts.View image in fullscreenTranscending the local … Forest Flame IV by Mrinalini Mukherjee.Photograph: Humayun Memon/Courtesy of Mrinalini Mukherjee FoundationThis is how it goes. At first, the inclusion of Mrinalini Mukherjee’s friends and family sort of sets her early development in context. But as soon as you see her sculptures from the 1980s onwards you just want to see more of them and less, and soon none, of the watercolours by her “circle” that clog up the gallery like slow traffic. It’s as if she is forced to make endlessly polite chit-chat about what everyone else is doing.Her art is international, not local. Given her rise to brilliance in the 80s, it’s tempting to see her as a magic realist. She mingles modern India’s history with surrealism, dreams and fantastical images of an intense national landscape. From this she produces an enchanted, bubbling cocktail of birds and flowers, gods and monsters infused with desire and dread. Night Bloom II, which is owned by the British Museum, has the shape of someone sitting in the lotus position, yet it is another festering flower of the mind, made of sloppy, sliding green ceramic, some of it glazed blood red.The wall text says the figure looks female, but to me it evokes statues of seated Buddhas and sages that are beyond gender. It is full of contradictions, both spiritually calm and sensually violent, possessing the tension that makes a work of art not just impressive but enduring.Mrinalini Mukherjee’s art drew deeply on her culture but transcended the local. It is as meaningful now as in her lifetime, and accessible to everyone. What’s so bad about that? Banging contemporary art is banging contemporary art – but no, this exhibition keeps throwing a wet blanket over it. Here’s another so-so landscape painting, another tedious figurative screen.How clever of the Royal Academy to give this great modern artist a show. How stupid to muffle her in second-rate surroundings.

It looks, at the outset, like a jolly away-day gone awry. The bonhomie, if there was any, has curdled and they are now taking big swipes at each other. Because, while they were close to Mei, they have little in common with one another bar the urn that contains their departed friend.That they are chalk-and-cheese is conveyed in broad, gestural ways. There is Rose (Sarah Rickman), Mei’s sister-in-law, who is harbouring a secret, along with Jules (Stacy Abalogun), a lesbian and strong personality at odds with grumpy Sue (Ciara Pouncett). Jasmin (Rendah Beshoori) appears like a Chelsea mum, in smart jacket and dress, while Cathy (Scarlett Alice Johnson) is Mei’s dungaree-clad colleague who goes on silent retreats to India.When the rain starts to pelt down and they seek refuge in booze, you brace yourself for a conflagration in the woods that never comes. Despite the drunkenness and a bout of primal screaming, this drama fails to set alight; the humour too obvious, the plot-points weak and pace ponderous. The highlight is Abi Groves’ beautiful set, awash with autumnal hues, with bracken strewn underfoot and what looks like embossed thickets in the backdrop.Nothing comes alive beyond the forest itself. Under the direction of Emma Gersch, there are prolonged moments of dramatic dead-time as characters sit around drinking or speaking insubstantial nothings. One scene towards the end shows the women simply packing up in silence, with no accompanying emotional charge.The script flags up its issues in the most cosmetic of ways, without developing them, such as menopause, or whether or not to have children. Mei is labelled a narcissist and we hear how she gave each of these friends a nasty nickname. All of this is brushed aside too quickly, none of it feels authentic. So you are left with a drama that itself seems stranded in these rain-sodden woods, not quite sure of where to go, what to say.At Park theatre, London, until 15 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreMenopausereviewsShareReuse this content"

Ibsen’s classic is transposed to the world of filmmakers and movie stars in London, 1948, with tea dresses, pencil moustaches, and India freshly independent. A solid, forthright reimagining, Gupta’s Hedda illuminates the racism of middle-class, postwar England, where a casual slur is no more noted in conversation than a polite sneeze.A movie star in early retirement, our white-passing, hard-hearted Hedda (Pearl Chanda) hides her dual Anglo-Indian heritage. In a period of institutionalised racism in the film industry, with the segregation of love stories onscreen, she knows the discovery of her identity will destroy her carefully curated life. Directed by Hettie Macdonald, the play’s careless characters make the consequences of such a reveal plain in the way they talk about Shona (Rina Fatania, piercing and exact), Hedda’s maid, as if she is hardly there. Not even Hedda’s hapless husband George (Joe Bannister) suspects Hedda’s true relationship with the older woman, an inspired pairing that longs for more time on stage.This riveting way to re-see Hedda’s deliberate hardness gives her more reason to hide away from the world and lends weight to her need to be rid of the too-revealing manuscript written by Lenny, her former flame (Jake Mann, playing the tortured artist well). As the only one who knew her before she started pretending, Lenny tries to tear down Hedda’s cold facade, but she is stubborn. To everyone else, like George’s ex Alice (a puppyish Bebe Cave), she is at best indifferent, at worst downright – almost unbelievably – contemptuous.Beyond the intrigue of Hedda’s secret and the sinister racial politics that seep through their interactions, the play struggles to build tension. The gaggle of friends, family and exes swan in and out of the unhappy couple’s new home in Chelsea (Simon Kenny’s plush-carpeted design), professing their intentions, objections and fears as readily as if describing what they’d like for lunch. The external context of this adaptation is bold and new. But the emotions behind the characters’ internal battles are often told rather than felt, their actions missing impulse, and the swiftness of their downfalls somewhat flattening their impact.At theOrange Tree theatreuntil 22 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreHenrik IbsenreviewsShareReuse this content"

But music fans who have been burned by the recurrent loss of the capital’s best dancefloors, fromPlastic PeopletoPrintworks, might also be sceptical. Is Eutopia here to stay, or another false dawn? And are people really going to trek out to the very eastern edge of the city, 12 miles from the West End, to go to a club across a river from a sewage treatment works?The Eutopia team includes several of London’s most experienced nightlife operators. One of its four co-founders, Will Paterson, has worked for venues and festivals including E1 and Eastern Electrics for more than two decades. Another, Tom Ranger, spent several years overseeing music bookings at East London’s Oval Space (which later closed in 2022 after a shooting).Paterson and Ranger are confident that Eutopia will stay the course. “We’re on a long-term lease, and we’re growing slowly,” says Paterson. “We expect next year to be a good year, where we learn a lot and do more shows, then more again in 2027. When you look at any good [London] venue, like The Cause or Night Tales, it takes three years.”View image in fullscreen‘Thousands of clubbers are willing to make those kinds of journeys’ … outdoor space The Yard at Eutopia.Photograph: EutopiaEutopia, somewhat unusually, has time on its side. Unlike many other similarly sized post-industrial superclubs, including Canada Water’s Printworks, Tottenham’s Drumsheds or Depot Mayfield in Manchester, it has not been created as part of a “meanwhile” scheme, in which promoters work with developers to make temporary cultural use of an empty site before it’s redeveloped. A venue such as Printworks, which closed in 2023, always had a strict deadline; Eutopia’s longer-term prospects feel far more open-ended.The other key factor working in Eutopia’s favour is the absence of local residents who might complain about it: their nearest neighbours are more than a mile away. This means they can sidestep most of the noise-related issues which have plagued so many of their peers, and indeed contributed directly to the demise of Elephant and Castle’s Corsica Studios, when new-build flats were permitted to be built next door.“When we met with the council and the police, but particularly the police, they said to us: we’ll support you, because we prefer new entertainment spaces to be in areas like this,” Paterson says. “Their position was: why would we grant a licence, and then have 52 weeks a year of people calling up and complaining?”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

While late night transport links may be limited, venues remain responsible for customer safety on dispersal.”Their statement hints at some of the tradeoffs which come with Eutopia’s isolated surroundings: part of a long-running trend in which cultural activity is forced further from the inner city as neighbourhoods gentrify, rents go up, and new residential developments are built. “The reality is that venues are going to be pushed to the margins,” says Paterson. “We got this opportunity because it’s further away.”Eutopia is perhaps the most extreme example London has seen of this particular process. Located out past City Airport, beyond even the London postcode area, it’s bordered by industrial units, wetlands, and Beckton sewage works: not the kind of place you can hop from pub to bar to club. Public transport is patchy: Eutopia is a 35 minute walk from Barking station, and 25 minutes from Barking Riverside at the end of the Overground. Neither is part of the Night Tube, and the only local bus service stops at midnight.“Yes, it’s more difficult to come here than it is to go to a venue like [Charing Cross Road’s] Outernet,” says Paterson, who explains that visiting Eutopia might involve “friends getting together to share an Uber, or – in the new sober world we’re in – one person driving.” This perhaps recalls the early 90s, when London’s ravers would have to pile into a Vauxhall Nova and head out past the M25 to find the party.“If the venue’s really special or I’m particularly drawn to the party, I’ve been happy to travel upwards of an hour,” says Charlie, a dance music fan in his 20s. “Particularly if a venue’s set up for longer events, with a variety of spaces and comfortable places to chill out.” His views are shared by Daisy-Mae, a DJ based in Clapton. “If it was a really good lineup, I had people to go with and I could do it affordably, I’d definitely be down for going to Barking,” she says.Mixmag’s deputy editor Megan Townsend agrees that Londoners have become more accustomed to logistically complicated nights out: “30 years ago there were more clubs in central London, so of course people are travelling further now. Venues like Drumsheds show that thousands of clubbers are willing to make those kinds of journeys.”But Eutopia’s location in the middle of an industrial estate, away from busy high streets and transport connections, complicates things. “I really don’t want to have to get a cab or bus from station to club,” says Charlie. “I’ve also been to venues in industrial spaces where there’s a long walk, often unlit, which feels sketchy for me even as a man.” Eutopia have clearly considered the safety risks – from doubling the amount of time security staff are kept on shift after an event, to installing temporary pavement lighting from Eutopia back to nearby stations – but the fact such mitigations are necessary remains impossible to overlook.View image in fullscreen‘We got this opportunity because it’s further away’ … Eutopia.Photograph: EutopiaEutopia’s founders say they want to run things so expertly that concerns ultimately fade into the background. They’ve spent £1.5m on the space itself, designed by the team behind Glastonbury’s San Remo area. Their 4,000-person capacity has also been split across a variety of more modular and intimate spaces, suitable for everything from club nights to film screenings to community events, as opposed to one massive, impersonal expanse. “I think everybody would say that 600 people is the perfect size: it’s big enough to get lost in, but small enough to feel intimate,” Tom Ranger explains. “But the reality is that operating a venue of that size is extremely hard work unless you’re Live Nation or AEG, who can afford to be loss-leading.”Initial signs seem positive, with events from promoters as varied as gen Z up-and-comers Appetite and rave stalwarts World Dance selling out. But Eutopia’s lack of corporate backing (another conspicuous contrast with other developer and private equity-funded spaces) means there’s little room for complacency. “It’s like when people see a new restaurant and say: ‘We should check it out,’ then six months later they see it’s closed,” says Ranger. “Go check it out, support it.”Paterson and Ranger are keen to counter the pessimism which can sometimes inform Londoners’ perceptions around nightlife. “We know the economy has been squeezed for most people,” says Ranger. “But we still have the ability to engage in something new and exciting. Hopefully people will come on that journey with us.”Explore more on these topicsMusicClub cultureDance musicElectronic musicGentrificationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This year’s shortlist features a “delightful mix of comedies” from “darkest satire and period farce to lightest humour,” said the chair of the judges and Hay festival co-founder Peter Florence.Shortlisted forThe Unfinished Harauld Hughes, Ayoade’s debut is narrated by his alter ego, who wants to save his doppelganger, the playwright Harauld Hughes, from obscurity. “A pitch-perfect literary parody, packed with deft wordplay and lines that made me laugh aloud on almost every page. Ayoade has an instinctive ear for the comic possibilities of language,” said literary critic and judge Stephanie Merritt.Younis made the shortlist for her debut novel Fundamentally, which was also shortlisted for this year’sWomen’s prize for fiction. It follows a heartbroken academic, Nadia, who accepts a UN job offer in Iraq where she is tasked with rehabilitating Islamic State women. There she forms a friendship with a feisty east Londoner, who joined Islamic State at just 15.Friendship is also a theme of Rosanna Pike’s novelA Little Trickerie, in which vagabond Tibb Ingleby travels through medieval England and with new-found friends conjures a hoax.The winner of this year’s prize will be announced at a reception in London on 1 December and, as well as having a pig named after their winning book, they will be awarded a complete set of the Everyman’s Library PG Wodehouse collection and Bollinger champagne.To mark the 25th anniversary of the award, this year’s ceremony will also feature the announcement of the Vintage Bollinger prize, a winner-of-winners to be selected from the previous 25 recipients. The prize will be judged by presenter Claudia Winkleman, comedians Sindhu Vee and Tatty Macleod, Great British Sewing Bee judge Patrick Grant and Florence.Another title shortlisted for the regular award,The Persians by Sanam Mahloudji, is about a family in crisis: Elizabeth lives with her Islamic law-breaking granddaughter in Tehran, while her daughters are disillusioned by life in America. “I found myself lost in this beautifully written novel and laughing as much as I wept,” said comedian Pippa Evans, another judge on the panel. “Multi-generational stories are rich in hilarious moments as we watch generations clash with the ideas that came before.”Also set in America is Alexander Sammartino’s bookLast Acts. David Rizzo, the owner of a failing firearms store, uses his son’s near fatal overdose to create a TV advert.Joining Florence, Merritt and Evans on this year’s judging panel is vice-chair of the University of Wales and chair of Rewilding Britain Justin Albert and Everyman’s Library publisher David Campbell.Outnumbered co-writer Guy Jenkin is shortlisted forMurder Most Foul, set in 1593, which follows the relationship between Christopher Marlowe and Shakespeare, and the rumours that swirl after Marlowe’s death about the Bard’s culpability. The novel is “a brilliantly subversive romp – razor-sharp, darkly funny, and utterly Wodehousian in its wit and mischief”, said Albert.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The fictional threat is arguably about as easy as they come.”Bigelow told the Guardianthat the film did not seek endorsement or co-operation from the Pentagon to ensure its independence, saying: “Our nuclear armoury is a fallible structure. Within it are men and women working thanklessly behind the scenes, whose competence means you and I can sit and have this conversation. But competence doesn’t mean they’re infallible.”The US currently has 44 ground based interceptors, based in Alaska and California, and in 2020 the Pentagon awarded a $13.3bn contract to Northrop Grumman for a new generation of ground-based missiles, due for delivery in 2029. In May, Donald Trumpproposed a “Golden Dome” missile system, featuring space-based weapons to intercept strikes against the US.Explore more on these topicsFilmKathryn BigelowNuclear weaponsUS national securityUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

Platner had won praise from progressives and secured the backing of Bernie Sanders. But his campaign came unstuck when a video surfaced of him dancing in his underwear at his brother’s wedding – and revealing a skull-and-crossbones tattoo on his chest. The design, known as theTotenkopf, is widely recognised as a Nazi symbol.‘I hated it the minute it was finished’: bad body art and regrets in a tattoo removal clinicRead morePlatnerinsists he had no ideaof its associations when he got the tattoo, drunk, while stationed in Croatia during his 20s as a marine. After learning of its meaning, he says, he covered it with a new design – a Celtic cross and a dog – and released the topless photo to prove it.It’s a strange campaign story, but not all that uncommon. Across the country, tattoo artists and laser removal technicians regularly see clients who are trying to erase far-right symbols from their bodies.There a number of national non-profits that help people remove their hate-based tattoos. The California-based Jails to Jobs, for example, helps formerly incarcerated people rebuild their lives. The group maintains a directory of more than 300 free or low-cost tattoo removal programs across 45 states and several countries and publishes a how-to manual for communities hoping to start their own.Not everyone who seeks their services has tattoos linked to white supremacy. Some are survivors of trafficking, domestic violence or gang coercion. But many prison tattoos still bear the marks of racist ideology: swastikas, lightning bolts or coded runes that declare allegiance to neo-Nazi groups.View image in fullscreenIn this photo provided by WGME, Graham Platner points to a cover-up tattoo that had previously been an image recognized as a Nazi symbol during an interview on 22 October in Portland, Maine.Photograph: APThe Anti-Defamation League has catalogued hate symbols since 2000 through itsHate on Displaydatabase, which is now more than 50 pages long.Kate Widener, an advanced esthetician and owner of Undo Tattoo and Laser in Gresham, Oregon, averages about 70 tattoo removals a week. Of these, she wagers “25%” are part of her free removal program. “Everyone deserves a second chance,” she said. “I’ve seen it all, including some pretty bad ones. But they just pop in, pop out, and soon it’s gone.”Some of Widener’s clients say they are coming in only out of discretion – they are still racist, but don’t want their co-workers to know. “I have one guy who comes in only for the tattoos on his face, and he’s keeping the rest from his neck down,” she says. “Thirty-plus [swastikas] on his neck all the way down. So there are a lot of people hiding who they really are.”You really get to see where the person is coming from compared to the markings on their skinDustin Ortel“There’s a big concern of: [are they] changing or hiding?” said Dustin Ortel, who oversees the free Ink-nitiative program at Removery, another national tattoo-removing chain. Since 2020, people every year submit applications – bolstered by letters of recommendations from parole officers or counselors – and about 300 are chosen for the procedure.Ortel says he is a good judge of character and helps people who are genuinely changing. “I have a great gut feeling, and going through our paperwork and seeing the advocate letters, you really get to see where the person is coming from compared to the markings on their skin.”Before each session, Ortel listens to a person’s story, what led them to get the tattoo and how they changed their mind. These conversations are always emotional: “I cry with people.”Widener, in Oregon, does not require people to apply for her free removal. “It’s invasive, and I don’t like that,” she says. “I’m confidential and judgment-free. As long as you say, ‘Please help me,’ I’ll talk.” That makes her pretty popular, with people driving hours to see her, coming form as far away as Idaho or Seattle.Removing or covering up someone’s tattoos is always an intimate process. It requires close contact. “A lot of people talk about themselves,” Widener said. “I’ll get a vibe if they’re doing this for the right reasons, or maybe not the right reasons, and that makes me more leery of them.”View image in fullscreenBefore and after of tattoo removal done by Removery.Composite: RemoveryStill, most people are “pretty nice” and many are grateful. And, ultimately, Widener is in control during the experience: “They know that I control a laser that can cause a lot of harm to them.”What makes people change their beliefs? “Sometimes, it’s because they fall in love,” Widener said. “I have clients who were white supremacists and then they fall for a person of color.” One of her clients was brought up in a racist family and never questioned their beliefs – until he began an interracial relationship.“She kind of opened his eyes to other things,” Widener said. “He’s my favorite. He comes every six weeks like clockwork to get his tattoo removed, and he cries at every point to tell me how it changed his life. He has a child now, and he would like to put something over that to honor his mixed son.”Once [Trump was re-elected], I had someone who called me and told me they no longer need to remove itKate WidenerAfter the white nationalist rallies in Charlottesville in 2017, interest in hate tattoo-removing services rose, with some people who had previously been affiliated with far-right groups wanting to distance themselves as the groups became emboldened. Three years later, after the murder of George Floyd and international protests against police violence, NPRpointed toan increased interest in tattoo removal. For some, the ebb-and-flow popularity of these services shows a pattern: when hate crimes hit the headlines, more people who have left a racist past behind urgently feel the need to rid themselves of such reminders.But lately, Widener says interest in her free program among people with hate tattoos has cooled. She blames the Trump administration. Before Donald Trump was in office, Widener had “a lot more people” coming in to erase a white supremacist past. “Then once [Trump was re-elected], I had someone who called me and told me they no longer need to remove it.” (Still, Undo Tattoo’s free removal program is fully booked until December.)Three other people involved in free tattoo removal or cover-up programs said they had not noticed a decline in clients due to Trump’s administration. Lorenzo Diaz, an artist at Ruby Tattoo in Marine City, Michigan, has covered up hateful ink for the past 17 years. “I have at least three, maybe four a week. They’re usually pretty big, dark pieces.”So far, Widener does not turn away clients – but she could change her mind in the future. “I thought about certain situations, because at some point, ICE officers are going to start throwing little symbols around,” she said. “I’ve personally seen in my own neighborhood how they hurt people. I’m still judgment-free, letting everyone come in, but I don’t know what the future holds.”This article was amended on 28 October 2025 to correct the spelling of the city of Gresham.Explore more on these topicsTattoosNazismUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yoghurt and stewed fruit aside,do you have any suggestions forwhat will hit the spot without verging too far into the unhealthy?Wendy,by emailThe truth is, you can’t often have your cake and eat it – or not a big piece, anyway. “My main piece of advice, which maybe isn’t all that welcome, is to keep to small portions,” says Brian Levy, author ofGood & Sweet, in which his recipes contain no added sugar. “My grandma would keep many chocolate bars and have just one, but that’s never really worked for me.”’Tis the season for stewed fruit, but have you triedMelissa Hemsley’s banana slicessandwiched together with peanut butter, half-dipped in melted chocolate and put in the freezer? (FYI the same tactic also works like a dream with dates.) “You can’t beat frozen grapes, either,” says baker Lily Jones, who’s behind theLondon by Lily Vanilli afternoon tea at the Four Seasons Tower Bridge. To “level them up a notch”, she sprinkles those with chilli flakes, salt or freeze-dried sour cherries.Equally chill would be Jones’s frozen peanut butter bites, which also happen to be gluten-free: “They’re peanut butter, maple syrup, oat milk and sea salt frozen into bite-sized moulds.” They’re then dipped in dark chocolate before being returned to the freezer, and are “the perfect hit of sweet that’s really satisfying, and also have healthy fat and protein”.Otherwise, try a batch ofLevy’s caramel apples: “They are rich and flavourful, chewy, buttery caramels sweetened only with fruit [apple juice and dates], plus a little miso.” It’s worth leaning into unrefined sugars, such as honey and maple syrup, too, says fellow sweet-tooth Flora Shedden, author ofWinter in the Highlands: “I’m terrible, but I don’t want my kids to have tons of refined sugar, although they’re now addicted to dates and prunes – it’s as if they’ve got the palate of an 80-year-old.”There are, however, some cravings that only a cookie can satisfy, and thankfully Shedden has a solution for such situations. “It’s quite a flexible recipe: mix oats, spelt flour or ground almonds, maybe some coconut, and perhaps a few nuts for natural sweetness, then bind that with a mix of tahini and maple syrup,” she says. “If your tahini has a thick consistency, you might need a bit of oil to loosen it. And you’ll also need to add a bit of bicarb and some vanilla.” Roll the mix into balls, flatten slightly, then arrange on trays lined with baking paper and bake at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, until golden brown and firm. You could up the ante, Shedden says, by whizzing frozen bananas à la Jamie Oliver, with yoghurt, maple syrup and a little cocoa powder into a “kinda ice-cream”, and use that to sandwich two cookies together.If all else fails, Levy’s advice would be simply to hunker down with some dark chocolate (“70% cocoa or more”) and a cup of Celestial Seasonings Bengal spice tea: “Spices can fool your palate into thinking you’re having something sweeter than you actually are,” he explains. Now that really would be sweet.Got a culinary dilemma?

Staff there commented on the frequency with which cars are damaged. The repair cost has been estimated at £750, but Tesco is refusing to accept liability. It cites a maintenance report, prepared by the company it contracts to provide and maintain the car washes, which apparently found no fault. It refused to let me see the report because of “company policy”.JM, Dumfries & GallowayA Google search turns up numerous complaints from drivers who claim that Tesco car washes damaged their vehicles. Tesco’s response in each case was to dispatch an identically worded letter from its solicitors claiming that no defects were found with the car wash in question, that no other complaints had been received, and that a disclaimer at the entrance absolves it of liability for damage caused during use unless by a fault with the machine. You received the self-same letter, as did a man whose car was scrapedwhen a cleaning arm fell off mid-cycle.I’ve racked up £3,000 in PCNs on the school run despite my blue badgeRead moreNonetheless, Tesco denies it has a blanket policy to reject compensation claims, and says it considers them on a case-by-case basis. It told me staff check wash cycles daily and that the car wash you used was found to be in good working order.You therefore face the choice of claiming through your insurer, or taking the legal route. If you decide on the latter, send a letter before action specifying the amount of damages you seek, and giving Tesco 14 days to respond.If that doesn’t work, collate details and photos of the damage, plus proof of payment for the car wash and the repair quotes, and use Scotland’s“simple procedure”to make a claim through the sheriff courts.In England and Walesit is a similar processinvolving a county court.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

Am I a morning person or a night owl? What actually motivates me? Where exactly do I work best?I often find myself thinking: “I hope I eat some vegetables today” or “I hope I reply to that email,” as though that’s up to someone else. I have no idea how to make myselfdo thingsin the consistent, reliable way that others seem to: work out, get dressed, cook a “veg bowl”, book appointments.On rare days, I miraculously do them all. Most others, I thumb screens, nap relentlessly and eat neon-colored snacks covered in sugar and salt.I need to send a difficult email. Will a ‘forcing party’ help me stop procrastinating?Read moreAfter seven years of freelance life, it’s gotten dire. I rise late, wash later and watch two hours of TikTok videos after replying to two emails. I nap up to three times a day and ignore important tasks (my prescription changed six months ago but I’m yet to order a new pair of glasses).I decided to set myself a challenge: for one working week, I would not procrastinate one bit, not once,not at all. This meant no WhatsApp, no YouTube video essays called 79 Hidden Details in Breaking Bad, no Nintendo Switch game where I run my own supermarket, no social media. I even asked my husband to hide the remote so I couldn’t watch daytime TV.Instead, I would write a to-do list every morning, and plough through it.At around 7.30am on day one, it was time for my workout. I had to do this without lying on the floor for an hour first. I knew I couldn’t fail at task one on day one, so I strapped on my heart monitor and wrist weights and simply started exercising. Annoyingly, it felt absolutely fantastic to get it done and dusted.After my shower, I wasn’t sure how to stop myself from sitting on the end of the bed and staring into space, so I decided to pretend I was a Sim, guided by the great cursor in the sky. I unpacked a holiday suitcase, paid a bill, finally ordered my new glasses and did a whole round of laundry. It felt strange to look down and see “8.44am” on my phone screen, knowing that on my very best days, these things would take me until at least midday.By noon, I was convinced I was a changed woman. I had replied to all my outstanding emails, done another round of laundry, emailed my accountant, hopped on a call instead of rearranging it and sorted through my list of article ideas. I even wrote these words while eating lunch.Was it really going to be this easy? I felt intoxicatingly in control of my own destiny, even if I did really, really want to lie down.Ireached out to procrastination expert Fuschia Sirois, a psychology professor at Durham University and author ofProcrastination: What It Is, Why It’s a Problem, and What You Can Do About It.I asked her why she thinks I was able to stop procrastinating so easily.“Procrastination is a form of unnecessary and voluntary delay in the start or completion of an important and intended task,” Sirois said, adding that we make this delay “despite knowing there’s going to be negative consequences”.She believes I was able to flip a switch and stop procrastinating on day one because my experiment – and this article – gave my tasks meaning.“A former PhD student of mine looked into this idea about whether just increasing the meaningfulness of a task could reduce people’s procrastination,” she said. “In a verycontrolled experiment, she found indeed that when people simply reconnected with why they were doing a task, they procrastinated less on it.”At the end of day one, I felt pretty smug: I had meaning, I had ticked 24 (!) items off my to-do list, and I had waited until the end of my working day to post glamorous Instagram pics of my holiday (the kind of self-restraint not usually seen this side of a nunnery).Sometimes we can put things off and it’s for good reason ... We know that delay can be good for creativityFuschia SiroisDay two was similarly productive. Although I had to read a boring book for work, my commitment to the integrity of this piece meant I forced myself to open it. I only slipped up a couple of times – looking at a forum about my supermarket game and unblocking Instagram to check the number of likes on my glamorous pics – but I finished it. I was thrilled to be able to enjoy my evening guilt-free.But then day three dawned. As I looked to the miserable grey skies, I realised I had come down with a severe case of the “I don’t wannas”. I spent 20 minutes scrolling through the only distraction available on my phone. It was – and I’m sobbing with shame as I write this – LinkedIn.Later, when an editor sent edits my way, I groaned. The pressure at my temples started to throb. Were we really meant to work without watching any vertical videos first?Something I tell myself as a creative is that Ineedto procrastinate – if you force yourself to write without waiting for inspiration to strike, surely you will produce garbage. Some of my best lines have come to me when painting my toenails or watching an episode of The Osbournes from 2003.“Sometimes we can put things off and it’s for good reason,” Sirois said, “We know that delay can be good for creativity, it’s part of the creative process … it’s a necessary form of delay.” Nonetheless, Sirois acknowledges there is a “fuzzy line” between the two, and we can trick ourselves into believing we are delaying a task for our own good. If you come back to a task after a break and don’t feel any better about it, you were probably just procrastinating.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’I have to be honest – and I’m sorry to any of my ancestors who worked down the mines – I looked at the document again and felt the overwhelming urge to cry. I wanted to throw my body to the ground and beat my fists on the floor like a toddler. But then, once I got going, it was undeniably thrilling to get the job done in one efficient hour instead of a belaboured six.But at the end of day three I felt – in the words of Bilbo Baggins – “thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread”. The problem with completing tasks is that there are always more of them. The boulder always rolls back down to the bottom of the hill.Case up in point: my new glasses arrived on day four and they looked regrettably similar to the kind you would find in a children’s dressing up set. Even thinking about the painful process of printing a label, repackaging them and going to the post office to return them exhausted me – surely even my ancestors would agree that that was a lot?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I simply stopped working and unlocked Instagram instead. The guilt I felt became close to self-hatred. Whycan’tI just behave myself?“That’s what we call procrastinatory cognition,” Sirois said, “Once someone starts procrastinating, then you start having all these thoughts about, ‘Why can’t I get going?’ That actually makes it worse, it makes it harder. It doesn’t actually motivate you.”Sirois stresses that procrastination is not caused by character flaws – instead she believes, after 25 years of research, that it is an emotional regulation issue.“You have a task that you feel uncomfortable about and brings up unpleasant emotions. Those can be anything from boredom all the way through to anxiety or stress,” she explained. “Basically, procrastination is a way of managing those emotions, because when you put the task aside, you don’t have to deal with those emotions … It’s a way of avoidant coping.”The solution, to her mind, is to deal with these emotions head on. “We use the phrase ‘name so you can tame’ – if you don’t know what those emotions are, you can’t tame them.” There are various ways, Sirois said, to deal with the emotions at the root of your procrastination: be more self-compassionate rather than self-critical;connect with otherswith similar issues; sit mindfully with your emotions; journal; find the meaning in your task.So on day five, I tried out Sirois’s techniques. I looked at her soon-to-be-launched free resource, theTempo toolkit, which stands for: taming emotions to manage procrastination open-heartedly. It all sounded a bit wishy-washy to me, but forcing myself to work didn’t, well,work, so I tried to remain open-minded.First, I had to identify the emotions associated with a task I was delaying and then rank them in intensity.I was supposed to do another cumbersome edit on another article and didn’t want to because of boredom (which I ranked a solid eight) and fear (four). I was afraid of letting down the people I had interviewed, of causing controversy with the piece, and failing to get the story across right. Maybe that’s afive. I did feel kind of better just admitting that to a piece of paper.Next, I was asked to remember the value of my task. “Completing this task will be valuable to how I see myself because … ” an empty box invited me. I was stumped. The most I could come up with is that I wanted to be “someone who gets things done”, which is a feeling I very much enjoyed at the start of the week.Next, I was prompted to change my internal dialogue from “I have to” or “I need to” thoughts into, “I want to” and “I choose to”.I took a moment to think about how excited my younger self would be that I get to write for a living. Imagining life through her eyes made me suddenly “cosplay” working – like how you might pretend you are on a cooking show when chopping and stirring your dinner. I started typing, holding my back straighter.We minimise procrastination and we joke about it, but it has real consequencesFuschia SiroisI did the edit in four hours, but afterwards I felt so drained that I immediately picked up my supermarket game. Sirois notes there is nothing wrong with that, saying that breaks refresh our concentration and offer the opportunity to reflect on our work. But I knew this wasn’t just a break: I obstinately refused to tick off a single other task that day.I had confronted my emotions and got the (main) job done, but I was left with a question I still don’t know the answer to: what feels worse, hating yourself for not doing your work, or the sheer agonising pain of actually doing it?Sirois emphasised that procrastination can bring negative health outcomes: not only can it affect your career and happiness, it can cause stress which can in turn lead to insomnia and adysregulated immune system. “We minimise procrastination and we joke about it, but it has real consequences,” she said.What is ‘executive dysfunction’ and how do you overcome it?Read moreOf course, my experiment did not instantly transform my health but I did experience some other benefits. My work getting done was of course one of them (yawn!), but I also found myself reading more books, and I finally realised just how dull Instagram Stories are once I had broken their spell.I think, though, what my experiment really taught me is that it is actually impossible toneverprocrastinate – I tried my hardest but my mind and body refused. It seems ridiculous to beat yourself up for something we humans naturally do.In the weeks after my experiment, I slipped back into my wicked ways. I tried to sit with my emotions, but soon I started putting off practising my anti-procrastination methods.Still, I seem to be beating myself up less. I’m a little more accepting of how I operate. I thought the experiment would have revealed a secret, magical path to productivity, but it turns out it’s hard work to make yourself do hard work.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyTime managementfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Many are much younger than ever beforeKate McCuskerTue 28 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTShareAmanda Preisinger is anxious about her daughter’s impending 13th birthday party. Not for the usual reasons related to a house full of clamorous preteen children, but because it’s the first time that she will debut her new face to friends and extended family. “Obviously I’m going to tell everyone as they come in, ‘Just so you know, this is not how I look,’” says the 30-year-old real estate agent from south Florida.How she looks is, well, a little startling – her face swollen and preternaturally lifted, as though held together by industrial-grade tape. Her new – and she’s keen to stress, temporary – look is the result of six cosmetic procedures, including an endoscopic mid-facelift, performed by a doctor in Istanbul, Turkey, last month. “My poor husband teared up when he saw me for the first time because I couldn’t even open my eyes. That’s how swollen I was,” she tells me via video call from her house. “I had to tell him: ‘Babe, I’m fine, I’m not hurting. I justlook likesomeone jumped me.’”View image in fullscreenAmanda Preisinger, 12 days after her facelift.Photograph: Courtesy of Amanda PreisingerAccording to plastic surgeons, Preisinger is one of a growing number of people electing to undergo a facelift in their 20s and 30s – well over a decade before most doctors’ typical patient age range of 40 to 60. (Though most surgeons are keen to emphasise the industry edict of: “We treat genetics, not age.”) “I have 28-year-olds asking for facelifts,” says London-based aesthetic plastic surgeon Georgios Orfaniotis, a former NHS consultant who specialises in the head and neck. “It’s a very significant procedure, and I’m a bit concerned when I see people choosing it as a lifestyle choice.”A facelift, also known as a rhytidectomy, lifts the ligaments in the face that begin to droop as we age. “Our faces are built a little like layers of an onion,” says Kent-based facial plastic surgeon Marc Pacifico. “Skin and fat on the surface, then a layer of connective tissue called the SMAS – the superficial musculoaponeurotic system. Think of the SMAS as the soft tissue skeleton of the face. And that’s what ages us; that’s what loosens and sags and drags the skin down with it.”You risk operating on people that have deeper issues. It’s not a practice for an ethical plastic surgeon to followOnce the preserve of moneyed older people,“filler fatigue” – when overuse of dermal fillers stretches the face and causes laxity in the skin – alongside the widespread use of weight-loss drugs, cut-price medical tourism, and the development of new, celebrity-endorsed surgical techniques are driving a new kind of customer towards this invasive surgery. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) has reported an8% increase infacelifts over the past 12 months in the UK; while a survey by the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery found that the portion of younger facelift patients is growing, with32% of faceliftsnow performed on patients aged 35-55.“People are asking now to look like the best version of themselves and obviously the techniques are following,” says Orfaniotis. Currently, the operation du jour is the deep plane facelift, a technique evangelised by everyone from Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner, to fashion designer Marc Jacobs.View image in fullscreenA surgeon maps out the areas he will be operating on pre-surgery.Photograph: AndreyPopov/Getty ImagesWhere a more traditional facelift involves lifting the SMAS, the deep plane facelift releases the facial ligaments beneath it, allowing surgeons to reshape the face by moving the deeper tissue, and avoiding the taut, pulled look sometimes wrought by more traditional techniques. “We’re not putting tension on the skin because we’re going below, to the deeper tissue,” says Harley Street plastic surgeon Rajiv Grover, who specialises in the deep plane technique. “It is the deeper tissue that is repositioned. The skin comes with it as a passenger.” Lifting the entire soft tissue layer as a single unit allows for a more natural-looking and longer-lasting result. It also means that the procedure is no longer being used for the express purpose of anti-ageing – or rejuvenation, as the aesthetics industry terms it – but for “beautification” and facial restructuring, too. “We’re getting many inquiries from patients aged 28 to 35 for this reason,” says Grover.Preisinger had never planned on getting a facelift – at least not at the age of 30. But years of using hyaluronic acid dermal fillers in an attempt at “facial balancing” meant that by the time she reached her late 20s, she was “botched”. “I didn’t do this because I wanted to look young,” she says. “I did it because the filler ruined my face. I wish I had never done it. If I didn’t have the filler, I don’t think I would be where I’m at right now.”Whether dermal fillers ever fully dissolve has long been a point of contention in the aesthetics industry. “Studies have shown that not only do they rarely completely dissolve,” says Grover, “but they migrate and can block lymphatic channels. One of the contributors to what we call ‘pillow face’ is also the fact that in a sense, the face becomes slightly waterlogged because its ability to drain lymphatic fluid has been diminished.” Thoughresearchinto the area is preliminary,BAAPSissued a cautionary statementon dermal fillers’ potential impact on the lymphatic system at its 2023 scientific conference, and announced further research into the area. One highly regarded facial plastic surgeon, speaking to me on the condition of anonymity, says he would never use fillers in a patient because of the risks they pose. “A lot of surgeons don’t want to talk about this, because the companies who manufacture filler can be pretty aggressive.” He’s heard stories, he says, of plastic surgeons in the US being landed with court orders after raising their concerns.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Beth Suzanna/The GuardianFor Preisinger, once she started injecting filler, she felt as if she had to keep replenishing it – especially as it started to migrate to other parts of her face. She was just 28 when a local plastic surgeon in Florida suggested that a face and neck lift might be what she needed to finally step off the injectable hamster wheel. Two years later, she found herself choosing between a list of recommended hotels in Istanbul, texted to her by the patient coordinator at her surgeon’s office.Originally, Preisinger had planned for an upper and lower blepharoplasty – better known as eyelid surgery – but her surgeon advised her that a facelift was the right solution for the laxity she was finding in her face. She booked a forehead lift, a mid-facelift and a neck lift. The day before her surgery, one day after she’d touched down alone in Turkey, she decided to add a lip lift. “Then he [the surgeon] said, ‘We’re going to lift the under-eye bags.’ Then he said, ‘I think if we remove some buccal fat, it will contour your face.’ So I ended up adding two more procedures,” she says. She paid $22,000 (£16,500) for the six-hour operation, plus a three-day stay in a luxury medical suite that looked less like a hospital than a nondescript posh hotel. (Her actual hotel, where she would spend four further days recuperating with ice packs and an all-liquid diet, came at an additional cost.)View image in fullscreenLucy Argent, post-surgery.Photograph: Courtesy of Lucy ArgentFacelifts in the UK can cost anywhere from a few thousand pounds to high double figures, depending on the surgeon.“It’s so strange: the more you have, the cheaper it is,” says 40-year-old Lucy Argent, who had a deep plane necklift two years ago. Argent, who is from Cambridge but now lives with her family in Bali, had always been bothered by her neck and chin, so when she was quoted £5,000 from a UK clinic to have a partial deep plane neck lift (essentially, the contouring of the tissue without the skin lift), she jumped at the chance. “I’d never had cosmetic surgery before,” she says. “It’s almost like being a kid in a candy store. You’re obviously talking about major operations, but if you go in for a consultation, they’re like, ‘Oh if you want to add in a brow lift or a breast lift, you can. You can have your arms liposuctioned too.’ I did walk away from that thinking, at least I was of sound mind. And they do finance, so it’s not like money’s a problem. It did give me a bit of an icky feeling.” Argent, whose third child was then just a year old, ended up adding a breast lift to her package, bringing her total to around £9,000.“I was shocked by how accessible it was,” she says. “I was still coming out of that baby weight stage. As much as everyone at the clinic was lovely, I do think that the plastic surgery industry takes advantage of women who are postnatal, unhappy with their bodies and losing their identity. I could have had everything done and nobody would have stood in my way. At no point did anyone say to me, ‘Maybe you should spend a year doing this exercise, or trying this diet.’ I’m in a much different mental state now than I was two years ago.”All of the surgeons I spoke to for this piece said that though it depended on each individual case, they were unlikely to operate on patients in their 20s and 30s for purely cosmetic reasons. “You can take a 28-year-old and make their jawline better,” says Orfaniotis. “You can make them look like the best version of themselves. But where is this going to end? When you’re looking at beautification on people in their 20s or early 30s that otherwise look absolutely fine, you risk operating on people that have deeper issues.It’s not a practice for an ethical plastic surgeon to follow.” And yet when I put in a few cursory inquiries with surgeons in Turkey, none of them flag that at 28, I might be too young for a deep plane facelift. I try – and fail – not to take it personally.The plastic surgery industry takes advantage of women who are postnatal, unhappy with their bodies and losing their identityAmy Endean, a 34-year-old supported living facility manager from Worcestershire, was initially refused a facelift by her plastic surgeon when she inquired four years ago. It only confirmed what she had already suspected following meticulous research: that this was the right surgeon for her.When Endean was 16, she was a backseat passenger in a car that hit a wall when the driver took a corner at speed. She shattered the left side of her face, and had to undergo full reconstructive surgery. “They pulled my whole face off from the chin up,” she says. Surgeons replaced and rebuilt part of her jaw and nose, and placed titanium plates in the parts of her skull that had fractured and cracked. Throughout the following decade, she had major surgeries “pretty much every year”.View image in fullscreenSome of the surgical instruments used during a procedure.Photograph: peakSTOCK/Getty ImagesBy the time she was 25, she knew she’d have to have major plastic surgery owing to all the movement in her face. She began to develop an obstructive double chin that made it difficult to breathe or swallow when she lay down – the result of her facial fat dropping to her chin after surgery. She was 30, but the structure of her face was more akin to that of someone in her 60s. After consulting with both Endean and her family, her surgeon finally agreed to do a deep plane facelift, a brow lift and a chin implant. “It didn’t make me look snatched and pulled – it just made me look how I’m supposed to look for my age,” she says four years on. She’ll likely need further, smaller tweaks in the years to come – last year a swollen lump under her eye turned out to be a piece of metal from the car that was still embedded in her face – but her facelift has meant that she won’t have to undergo annual surgeries. Since the procedure, she has married and had two children, which she says wouldn’t have been possible had she been repeatedly in and out of hospital.When private cosmetic plastic surgeons espouse the virtues of their “life-changing” work on social media – invariably accompanied by a before and after of a tech CEO or an influencer – it’s hard not to reflexively scoff. But for people like Endean, the advances in the procedure really have been life-changing. “I don’t know what I’d have looked like if the accident never happened,” she says. “But now I feel like I still look like me.”As for Preisinger, she’s following a strict post-op routine of ice-rolling and facial massaging, in the hope that the swelling will soon begin to settle. In six to eight months she’ll be back in Istanbul for a check-in with her surgeon – a flying visit on the way to Italy for a family holiday. “I’m so excited,” she says. “I know that my results are going to be amazing.”Explore more on these topicsCosmetic surgeryWomenBeautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The candlelight flickers off stout terracotta jugs of wine and on to the faces of Thomas, a management consultant from New York, and Viktoras and Gabije, a charming Lithuanian couple I’ve been grilling about Baltic holiday spots. Ellen is German, living in Barcelona and training to be a therapist. It’s testament to the relaxed vibe that the conversation flows as smoothly as the wine.Map of north east SpainI’m atOff Grid, a new 10-room retreat(plus four-bedroom barn) inAlta Garrotxa, a protected nature reserve about 30 miles (50km) north of Girona. A converted 17th-centurymasia(farmhouse), it’s encircled by the fertile green humps and limestone crags of the pre-Pyrenees, with sloping gardens sheltering a large swimming pool. With its rustic, slow-living ethos, it’s perhaps a surprising departure for owner Gerard Greene, former CEO of Yotel – the modern, tech-driven city-centre brand with hotels in New York, Amsterdam and Tokyo among other cities. Just being here is a kind of therapy.It was only in spring 2024 that Greene spotted the site’s potential (a main farmhouse building, barn conversion and various outbuildings) and began doing it up. Inner walls have been whitewashed, bedrooms stripped back and painted with limewash shades of blush, ochre and sand. Sculptural stone sinks and brassy bathroom fixtures jazz-up en suites.Outside, birds chatter in the treetops above the swimming pool. Dragonflies flit by and a vast mountain – Mare de Déu del Mont – looms behind the quaint tiled roof, a natural place to fix your eyes in a moment of meditation. I’m here solo for a few days’ respite. I had a baby 10 months ago, and have barely moved my body properly since. A DIY retreat: yoga sessions, walking, a little autumn sunshine is just what’s needed.View image in fullscreenThe Santa Margarida volcano in Al Garrotxa natural park, near the border with France.Photograph: Prisma Archivo/AlamyAnother delightful aspect at Off Grid is that dinners are taken communally (poolside in summer, around the chunky farmhouse table in the dining room when cooler). It’s not enforced, but gently encouraged – a blackboard heralds a €30 three-course menu that changes daily depending on chef Joep’smarket finds: a tomato salad with local cheese and toasted seeds, say, followed by a rustic oxtail pie and an orange-zest cheesecake. Guests tend to amble down for avermutaround 8pm – there are honesty bars in the hotel, plus a vintage spirits trolley.There isn’t always a full house at dinner – on my first night there’s just myself, Alex and Judith: an Englishman and a Belgian visiting from Peckham. There’s plenty of choice for venturing out to dine nearby:La Guixerais a small bistro within walking distance (open Friday to Sunday only), while others are within a five- or 10-minute drive. My favourite isEl Claustre de Palera, a terrace built into a restored Romanesque church, where I order platters of fried anchovies, and barbecued mackerel with rich ratatouille.Beyond the hotel, this place is ripe for adventure. Spanish tourists mostly come for the epic cyclingBeyond the hotel, this place is ripe for adventure. Spanish tourists mostly come for the epic cycling, while scores of walking trails traverse mountainside, forest and idyllic green pastures. I start with a hike around the Parc Natural de la Zona Volcànica (there are 25 recommended trails,ranging from one mile to 10 miles) with local guide Mike Lockwood, a Brit who has lived in Catalonia for 20 years, Spain for more than 40.View image in fullscreenLucy Thackray took an ebike out for the day from Off Grid.Photograph: Lucy ThackrayParking up near the Croscat and Santa Margarida volcanoes, Lockwood tells me there are 40 dormant volcanoes in this park. “Would you like to go inside one?” he asks. I’m intrigued. On the far side of Croscat, a former quarry is revealed, a jagged cake-slice lifted from the volcano’s side. Lockwood deciphers its chalky stripes and fine cinder granules, layers of rust-red and huge chunks of rocks where the magma was blasted out at speed some 13,000 years ago. “It erupted for just three weeks,” he says. “That was enough to create all this.” Next we go to Fageda d’en Jordà, a striking beech wood whose undulating path was formed by the lava flow. It’s all fairytale mossy boulders and calf-height mushrooms.Alongside huge iron fireplaces, original artworks and farm trinkets are displayed prominently in the hotelOn another morning I hire an ebike from the hotel, and skim along quiet roads, to sleepy, cypress-framed villages reminiscent of Tuscany. Both L’Alta Garrotxa and the Parc Natural are well signed and easy to navigate – having a guide is a plus, but solo travellers won’t struggle to explore. The really hardcore Lycra-heads take to the mountainside, or set off on the 35-mile (57km) route from Olot to Girona.Yoga is currently available on-demand at Off Grid, but is set to run twice weekly from the new year in an onsite studio. Instructor Alba is from a nearby village, and is into bees, she says, lighting a beeswax candle and encouraging our group to buzz meditatively into the morning sunlight. Hunched from the past few months, I also book an hour with local masseur Jordi.View image in fullscreenA bedroom at Off Grid Girona, SpainPhotograph: Enric CurtoThe whole place lends itself to relaxation. Much of the hotel’s charming atmosphere comes from its past: hefty wood beams, an ivy-coated courtyard and antique pieces of furniture reupholstered by local artisans and restored to their former glory. Alongside huge iron fireplaces, original artworks and farm trinkets are displayed prominently.Off Grid owns some land across the road too, which is used to farm organic produce. The hotel is working to become as sustainable as possible, and much is locally sourced: small-batch coffee from the medieval town of Besalú (5 miles away); sustainable Bekume bed linen made in Olot (29km); toiletries from the Olively startup in the nearest city, Girona; wines from two Catalan wineries.There are plans for solar panels, an aerothermal heating system, a yoga pavilion, even an alfresco sauna. For now guests have the huge, unheated pool, trimmed by pumpkin-coloured loungers and scented Mediterranean foliage.Each morning, as the sun peeks through the trees, I venture down for a solitary swim – practically a cold plunge in these autumn days. Back home, motherhood can feel like a stream of anxiety about the next step, the next nap, the next choice to feel guilty about. Here, for the first time in months, I’ve time to think, to simply be – and it feels good.The trip was provided byOff Grid.

Initial fears that customers would be spooked or mourners offended have proved largely groundless.One cafe, Lisbeth, is ensconced in a former parish hall surrounded by mature Japanese cherry trees. It is managed by Italian-born Chiara de Martin Topranin, 30, who found it via a vaguely written online advert seeking “someone to run a lovely spot in the Mitte district with a great garden”.View image in fullscreenChiara de Martin Topranin and Lorenzo Filippini, who run Lisbeth in Berlin-Mitte.Photograph: Christian Jungeblodt/The GuardianOver a cappuccino with a view of the Protestant Sophien cemetery’s undulating field of headstones, she says she balked at first when the building’s owners revealed she would be working in a graveyard.“It was unthinkable for me as an Italian,” says Topranin. “For us death is something to be hidden. When I told my family, they said, ‘Chiara, have you lost your mind?’ But the more I thought about it, the more I thought: you have to do this.”Since taking on the role, Topranin, who studied psychology, soon noticed that her clientele came to her “with a different energy than in a normal street cafe”. “As soon as they pass the cemetery gates, they just seem a bit more empathetic, a little gentler.”She tries to strike a delicate balance with her guests, respecting the anguished in the throes of grief while not putting off those looking for a pleasant, if unusual, place to enjoy their lunch break.“I never accept weddings,” she says. “I will do a birthday party but it has to be reasonable – never a big bash. I’ve had guests who took their Aperol spritz out among the gravestones. Then I’m quite strict and say, there’s a limit.”Although Berlin’sFriedhofscaféshave steadily grown in popularity, few regulars are aware of their roots in the Aids crisis and changing practices around death and burial.Bernd Boßmann is widely acknowledged as the father of the cemetery cafe movement, having opened Germany’s first in 2006. Finovo is located in Berlin’s Schöneberg district, a focal point of LGBTQ+ life for more than a century.View image in fullscreenBernd Boßmann opened the first cemetery cafe in Germany in 2006 after finding nowhere pleasant to sit down or buy flowers where his friends were buried.Photograph: Deborah ColeA veteran of the 1980s fight for HIV research, Boßmann had his own coming out during what he says was often dismissed as the “gay plague”. He saw countless young friends cut down in their prime, many of them buried in the fabled Old St Matthäus cemetery, where the folk and fairytale publishers Brothers Grimm were laid to rest a century before.“But I realised that while it was a fine place for the dead, it was awful for the living,” says Boßmann, 65. “There was nowhere pleasant to sit down, nowhere to buy flowers, not even a place to go to the bathroom. That’s when I noticed the small abandoned building near the gates.” From that building, Finovo was born.Nearly 20 years on, Boßmann has handed off management of the cafe with its Red Poppy florist shop, and it has spawned similar spots across the city, each with its own ethos.As new generations of Germans opt increasingly for cremation over burials, cemeteries have encountered financial problems in maintaining their lush grounds with dwindling demand. Desolation made many a target for vandalism and crime.Meanwhile, thecost of commercial real estate has soared, making the repurposing of disused cemetery buildings an appealing prospect.Many patrons say they find the proximity to death a surprisingly comforting experience.“I came around the corner and saw a group of mourners holding a eulogy,” says André, a 37-year-old social worker, over a late breakfast at Cafe Friedberg, in a wooded cemetery complex in the Kreuzberg district.View image in fullscreenCafe Friedberg in Kreuzberg.Photograph: Christian Jungeblodt/The Guardian“I quietly went round and got to the cafe entrance.”. A group outside the window dressed in black gave their final goodbye with a Neil Young song playing on the speakers. He says: “I personally would find it cool if my own funeral could be like that, with everyday life still taking place all around me.”A bit farther south, 21 Gramm in Neukölln – a vast multicultural district that has been anepicentre of Berlin’s gentrification– sees itself as a “little oasis” off the teeming Hermannstraße.It takes its name from the mythical weight of a human soul. The romanesque revival chapel of rest was a derelict storage space before its new beginning eight years ago as a local hotspot.“It’s so lush and so green amid all the linden trees and is always really lively. So it’s a lot more about life than death,” says yoga teacher Ieva Grigalavičiūtė, who lives in a flat overlooking the cemetery, of the cafe.“I’m from Lithuania and we have a saying that every time someone in the family dies, someone is being born. So it’s the same thing here, right? Death and rebirth.”View image in fullscreen21 Gramm, in Neukölln, sees itself as a ‘little oasis’ off the teeming Hermannstraße.Photograph: Christian Jungeblodt/The GuardianThe Mars coffee house in the Silent Green cultural complex in the northern borough of Wedding is located in a decommissioned crematorium and looks out on the Gerichtstraße burial ground, conjuring similar thoughts about vibrant social life and mortality.Sipping flat whites in the shadow of the towering brick chimney, Ukrainians Yulian Herasymenko and RuslanaShabelnyk chose to visit Mars “because it has this spooky Twin Peaks vibe”, referencing the surreal horror US television series from the 1990s.But the budding designers in their early 20s, who have lived in Berlin since Russia’sfull-scale invasion of their country, say they are drawn to the space for more than the frisson and the coffee.“It’s also just really beautiful,” Shabelnyk says. “It has good service and you can hide from the outside world – the perfect combination.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeDeath and dyingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Can any remain afloat? Two landlords from different generations discuss the problems and possibilitiesSammy GecsoylerTue 28 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTShareThirty-eight years separate pub landlords Coby Morton, 28, who runs the Dolphin Inn in Shrewsbury, and Jason Osborne, 66, who operates four pubs across the country, including the Raven in central London. In that time, our drinking habits and the fate of our pubs have changed dramatically. After a stagnant period in the 1980s, alcohol consumption soared in the late 1990s until, by 2004 – a year termed “peak booze” byThe New Statesman– Britons drank 9.5 litres of alcohol per person.In recent years, our appetite for drinking has dwindled, especially among young people. Earlier this year, a survey carried out by Savanta found nearly half (43%) of 18-34-year-olds in Britain do not drink alcohol. This, combined with rising costs, has had a huge knock-on effect on pubs. Last year,more than 400shut their doors and in the first half of 2025, 200 more followed. Clearly, it’s a tricky time to be a pub landlord. Morton and Osborne tell us about the highs and lows of the profession today and in years past.How did you become a pub landlord?Coby Morton:I always wanted to run a pub, and I’d joke about it with my mates. I just didn’t expect to own a pub so soon. I got my very first job at the Dolphin Inn when I was 19, working behind the bar. Then I was made general manager and, three years ago, I was offered the tenancy myself so I took it on.Jason Osborne:My parents used to have a pub/restaurant in Derbyshire. I always swore I would never get into the industry. Instead, I opened a photography lab, but then things went digital, which killed that line of work. I needed to find a new way to make a living and the only thing I really knew was pubs, so I bought one. This was back in the 1990s. Now I own four of them across the country.View image in fullscreen‘People don’t stand at the bar any more. They’re missing out – that’s where the conversations are’ … Osborne, left, and Morton.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianHow have things changed recently?CM:Every day of the week used to be booming. You could open the doors on a Monday and you’d have your lunchtime drinkers, your afternoon drinkers and then your evening drinkers. Now, especially from Monday to Thursday, people come in at about 5pm and they go home by about nine. Weekends are all over the place. To see that change is quite strange.JO:Going back decades to my parents’ pub, I remember drinking changed when people started getting paid monthly rather than weekly. With weekly pay, they’d come in a lot more. Friday night was always the boys’ night and Saturday was the girlfriend night. Drinking was big. Things have shifted massively since, and Covid was a big gamechanger. I thought people would be rushing back because they’d been at home but it never really happened. Instead, they kind of trickled back.CM:I don’t know if you’ve seen this, Jason, but the biggest change we’ve seen is that younger people aren’t drinking as much any more. When I was at uni, we were out all the time. Now, we’ve got young people who might come in on a Saturday with their partners or their friends, have a couple of drinks and then head home instead of staying out in town.JO:I agree with that. We’ve also been selling a lot more low-alcohol beers for the more health-conscious. In London, we even have a running group that come in and join us. They get changed and leave their bags, which we lock away in a room. Then, after they come back from their run, they have a pint of alcohol-free Lucky Saint.View image in fullscreen‘You’ve got to smile. You’ve got to greet people like they’re a long-lost friend.’Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianLast year,400pubs closed their doors. Do youworry about staying in business?CM:I meet up with other pub landlords in the area and we’re all in the same boat. It has been a difficult 12 months. The big bars in Shrewsbury aren’t busy. I can name four pubs on this road that have shut down. We’re not doing anything wrong but people just aren’t going out as much. I do get scared but you have to keep soldiering on.Aside from lower footfall, what other pressures do you face, Coby?CM:We’ve had to stop operating the kitchen ourselves. Our gas bill rose by 500%, it was ridiculous. We did rent out the kitchen but we had to start charging high rents because of the energy costs. We also have a fireplace, which I hesitated to run because of the price of wood and log burners.I don’t mean to be morbid, Coby, but do you see the pub stilloperating in five years’ time?CM:I would like to see it: this is my home. But I’ve had chats with my parents, my closest friends and even customers who have all asked if I’m still enjoying it. I love my job and I am happy but I don’t see how this pub can carry on, even if you pop in a completely different person as landlord.Coby, has being a pub landlord lived up to expectations?CM:I didn’t expect the difficulties, especially the financial side and rise in utility costs. In hindsight, had I known the changes that were going to happen over the past five years, I don’t think I would have jumped into it. But I’m really glad I did and that I’ve stuck it out for as long as I have.Jason, do you have concerns about your pubs too?JO:I do worry about it and I know it’s tough. The bills, staffing and even Sky Sports costs are so expensive. Kitchens are also a problem, especially chefs, who can be notoriously difficult.What other changes have you made to bring in new customers?JO:I’ve actually made drinks more expensive, rather than less expensive, and it has helped make for a better environment. My pub, the Eclipse Inn in Winchester, was broken when I took it over. The only way to turn it around was to get different customers in. I raised the prices and it changed overnight.CM:One of the biggest things I did was putting on more music events. They may not be the most profitable evenings because you’ve got to pay the bands, but they bring people in. Even if they’re not drinking pint after pint, it’s all about creating that home from home. We’ve also got a board game night – if you bring one in that I’ve never seen before I’ll give you a free pint – and even a knitting night. I would definitely encourage people to come in and sit by the fire to do some knitting. It doesn’t hurt having them in, even if they don’t drink, because it makes for a nice atmosphere.View image in fullscreenI’ve actually made drinks more expensive and it has helped make for a better environment’ … at the Eclipse Inn, Winchester, one of Osborne’s pubs.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianWhat musicworks well in a pub?JO:I like AC/DC but I wouldn’t have it playing in the bar. You can’t really go wrong with 80s music, even the youngsters quite like it.Can you recallany particularly rude or bizarre customers?CM:We don’t really get rude customers but one time, when we were serving food, this table turned up half an hour late. We had sold out of nearly everything. At first, they said: “Sorry, we’re not sitting on these stools.” Their second complaint was that we had sold out of pork buns. The gentleman in particular was getting quite aggressive about it. I offered to buy them a nice bottle of white wine but they went: “Actually, I would have preferred Pinot Grigio.” They then went to the trouble of showing me their phone as they posted a one-star review online. At that point, I laughed and said: “No worries, have a great day, thanks for coming.” I was doing the killing them with kindness thing.JO:It was getting late and there was a staffordshire bull terrier lying down on a jacket all alone. The owner had left. The dog was huge and it looked very menacing. I thought: “What am I going to do?” I searched the jacket for details of the owner but there was nothing. I took the dog upstairs and let it lie down on the jacket because, I assumed, it belonged to its owner. Soon after, a man came back to the pub and asked if I had seen his jacket. I said I had, and I have your dog too, but the man didn’t own a dog. It was sprawled out on somebody else’s jacket. The dog ended up spending the night with us on the bed. In the morning we put out a post on Facebook and people recognised the dog immediately. A few hours later, the owner was informed and he took his ever so scary pup.Do you stillhave regulars?CM:Frankly, they’re starting to pass away, but we do still have regulars. They are what makes a pub. When you have new customers walk in, they get to know the regulars, too. When they pop in the next time, they say: “Do you remember that guy with the geordie accent who was really loud?” He’s part of the furniture. Also, I know I’ve been a little bit negative on the youngsters not coming in, but those who do have made it their local.JO:Regulars are great. I once had a situation where there was a gentleman misbehaving and I wandered over to get him to leave. Then the locals said: “Stand back, Jay, we’ve got this. This is our pub, we’ll sort it out.” I love it, because that’s how you know you’ve really made an impression.View image in fullscreen‘Regulars are what makes a pub.’Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianHave any romances started in the pub?CM:One couple had their first date in the Dolphin Inn about a year and a half ago. A couple of months ago, they got married and, in between the church and reception, they stopped in for a quick pint. That was lovely, and it meant a lot to me. Me and Jason just look after these buildings, but for those people this pub will always be special. As Jason said, it’s their pub. We need these communal spaces to be kept alive to make sure these relationships continue to form.JO:Two couples met in my Winchester pub. They held their receptions there. The brides came in their full wedding gowns and one groom wore a kilt. It’s nice that they want to rekindle those early days.Have pubs become less social?CM:People used to stand in every nook and cranny of this pub. To make your way to the toilet, you had to squeeze your way through. Now, no one wants to stand up. Everyone sits at their tables.JO:People don’t stand at the bar any more and I think they are missing out, because that’s where the conversations tend to be. When you’re at a table, you’re not going to meet anyone. I can see that some people just want to talk to somebody and they might try to approach a table to chat. It’s not quite the same – it’s as if you’re invading their space. It’s quite sad.What advice would you give to each other?JO:You’ve got to be happy. You’ve got to smile. You’ve got to greet people like they’re a long-lost friend. And if they come in grumpy, our job is to make sure that they leave smiling. That’s what I try to do.CM:Jason is obviously very experienced and he knows a hell of a lot more than me. I can’t wait to come down and visit the Raven, to be honest.JO:Oh, you must come down. There’ll be a pint waiting for you on the bar.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Luckily, there is plenty you can do about itGynelle LeonTue 28 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTShareWhat’s the problem?The leaves of my 40-year-old rubber plant are speckled with tiny black dots, turning yellow, and many are dropping off. New shoots are still growing, but the older leaves continue to fall.DiagnosisThe black dots you’re seeing are most likely thrips droppings. These tiny insects puncture the leaf surface to drain sap, resulting in silvery streaks, mottled patches, curling and eventual leaf drop. They thrive in warm, dry conditions and are easily introduced when plants are moved outdoors. Once inside, they spread rapidly, particularly on mature, leafy specimens. Their damage is often mistaken for nutrient deficiencies or sun scorch, but the telltale sign is the combination of silvery streaks with tiny black specks.PrescriptionBegin by gently wiping leaves with a damp cloth to remove droppings and any insects. Next, spray thoroughly with pesticide, and repeat weekly to interrupt the life cycle. Persistence is key, as thrips eggs hatch quickly. For a large and highly valued plant like yours, biological control agents such as predatory mites (for example,Amblyseius cucumeris) can be introduced to reduce thrips populations naturally.PreventionInspect plants regularly, paying close attention to new leaves, especially the undersides, where thrips tend to hide. Increase humidity, as thrips prefer dry air. If you move plants outdoors in summer, isolate them for a fortnight before returning them indoors to avoid hitchhikers spreading through your collection.Got a plant dilemma?

A visual guideSam Jonesin ValenciaTue 28 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 15.06 EDTShareThe endless, sticky mud that coated the streets of Valencia, sucking at the boots of survivors and residents, is gone now. As are the jumbles of wrecked cars and themountains of sodden, ruined belongingsthat had begun to stink in the humid coastal air.But one year on, lingering evidence of the worst natural disaster to befallSpainthis century is everywhere. Walk through the gaping, still-doorless entrance to a block of flats in the Benetússer neighbourhood, on the southern outskirts of the city, and there is a small sign on the wall, positioned 2.5 metres (8ft) above the floor. It reads: “The flood waters rose this high on 29 October 2024.”A sticker on the front of the building, one of many around here and beyond, shows the regional president, Carlos Mazón, smiling and holding out his bloodstained hands.As parts of the wider Valencia region were flooded by the torrential rains that in some areas brought a year’s worth of rainfall in eight hours, and as people were drowning in their cars, homes and garages, Mazón, a member of the conservative People’s party (PP), was having a four-hour lunch with a journalist.2:17Spanish floods: before and after footage shows the scale of destruction in Valencia – videoBy the time his administration sent an emergency alert to mobile phones at 8.11pm that day,most of the disaster’s victims were already dead. All told, it killed 229 people in Valencia, seven in neighbouring Castilla-La Mancha and one person in Andalucía. According to government figures, nearly 60,000 homes, about 105,000 cars and more than 10,000 shops were damaged or destroyed.The fury many feel towards Mazón is evident in the sticker’s caption: “Mud on our [hands]. Blood on his.” The two words beneath that slogan require no translation: “Mazón criminal”.That rage was apparent on Saturday night, when more than50,000 people marched through Valenciain the latest of a series of protests demanding his resignation. Arecent surveyfound that 75% of Valencians believe Mazón should quit.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators hold banners depicting the regional president, Carlos Mazón, and vice-president, Susana Camarero.Photograph: José Jordan/AFP/Getty ImagesIf the catastrophe has unleashedfamiliar political squabblesand prompted judicial and parliamentary investigations, it has also laid bareSpain’s excruciating vulnerability to the climate emergency. Like thewildfires of recent summers, the floods have shown just how quickly and mercilessly the environment is changing across the Iberian peninsula.“If we don’t want to bequeath our children a Spain that’s grey from fire and flames, or a Spain that’s brown from floods, then we need a Spain that’s greener,” the country’s socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez,said last monthas he announced a 10-point plan to prepare the country for the climate emergency.But the fires and floods have also highlighted how politicised the climate crisis has become in Spain.The PP, which has so far stood by Mazón, has accused Sánchez of trying to use the climate preparation plan to cover up theslew of corruption allegationsthat have attached themselves to his family, his government and his party.Meanwhile, the far-right Vox party has sought to blame the“psychopath” prime ministerand his “leftwing, environmentalist” policies for the deaths and destruction.Such talk does little to allay suspicions that if half the country were on fire and the other half underwater, many of Spain’s elected representatives would want to establish whose fault it was before they reached for hoses or buckets.All of them are being urged to listen to the voices of those who have suffered, and those who continue to suffer the consequences of what happened in Valencia. Some are still grieving; some are still in shock, and many remain livid.Fernando Sánchez managed to hike through the mud to reach his parents’ flat in Benetússer the evening after the disaster. He arrived to see the body of one of their neighbours being carried out. The man, who had died of a heart attack, was placed in a mortuary truck filled with many other bodies.View image in fullscreenFernando Sanchez with his mother María Jose and a portrait of his recently deceased father, Francisco Sanchez,  at their home in Benetusser.Photograph: José Miguel Fernández de Velasco/The GuardianAlthough his parents survived, thanks to the neighbours who got them out of their first-floor flat and brought them to the third floor – hauling his father, Francisco, who used a wheelchair, up the stairs – the effects of the flood have been punishing.The lift stopped working when the rains hit and the waters rose to the mark commemorated by the plaque in the entrance hall. That meant that from 29 October last year to the day he died on 17 October this year, Francisco was only able to leave his flat when his son, or Red Cross workers, turned up once a week to carry him down the stairs so he could get some fresh air and nod to his neighbours.“He’d been used to going out and then he was just here between these four walls,” says Fernando Sánchez, a 54-year-old civil servant. “All his carer could do was push him along the corridor on this floor.”His father, who was 83 and in very poor health when he died, never complained. But the family is pained at the forced confinement of his final year.View image in fullscreenBefore and after flooding in Sedavi, south of Valencia, on 30 October 2024.Photograph: José Jordan/AFP/Getty Images“When my dad did get out, you’d see the change in his face,” says his son. “It really lifted his spirits. He would have died sooner or later anyway, but it would have been nice to be able to give him a better quality of life despite how bad things were.”With a bit of luck, repair work on the lift will begin this week.Rut Moyano, the upstairs neighbour who brought Fernando’s parents – and many others – to safety, has since become a member of the Benetússer local emergency and reconstruction committee, a civil society organisation that has been urging the authorities to rethink urban geography and preparedness after the disaster.0:47Drone footage shows scale of devastation caused by Spain floods – videoMoyano took in many of her neighbours when the floods hit, including Francisco Sánchez and his wife. She also took in the neighbour who had the fatal heart attack that night.

As the first anniversary approaches, all the memories are rising back to the surface.“People are sad and we’ve lost 229 neighbours,” Moyano says. ‘“For people elsewhere, that’s just a figure. But for us, it’s people we knew by name; people whose stories we knew.View image in fullscreenUtiel, Valencia, in October last year. The disaster laid bare Spain’s vulnerability to the climate crisis.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty“You feel their absence when you’re out on the street. People are also really furious about ​the way we were abandoned by the authorities. The official help took so many days to reach us. If we hadn’t organised it ourselves, we would have had nothing to eat or drink.”Moyano is not impressed by the regional government’s €29bn (£25.3bn) recovery plan – a plan that contains only one reference to the climate crisis across its686 pages.“Pouring concrete, which is what’s happening, isn’t right,” she says. “We just can’t keep having so much concrete and so many industrial estates – all that just can’t absorb the water. The emergency response plans also have to be adapted to the climate emergency, and that means recognising that we’re in a state of climate emergency.Mariló Gradolí, a spokesperson for the Association of Victims of the Floods of 29 October 2024, agrees. “They are continuing with denialist policies when it comes to climate change, they’re not offering people safety solutions, and they’re still not attending to the needs of the people of Valencia,” she says.Those needs, she adds, go far beyond material losses.View image in fullscreenFlood damage in Chiva, Hoya de Buñol, on 31 October 2024.Photograph: Kai Forsterling/EPA“Some people were holding on to railings for hours or having to smash their ceilings to breathe or to save their loved ones. There’s a huge emotional aftermath to all that. Society is still traumatised and in mourning. We want there to be social, political and judicial consequences.”As Spain prepares to hold a state funeral for the victims of the disaster, details about the official response are trickling out. It has been confirmed that, after the lunch with the journalist that ended at 6.30pm or 6.45 pm, Mazón accompanied her to her car before finally arriving at the emergency coordination centre at 8.28pm – almost 20 minutes after the belated warning was sent to people’s mobiles.That was also almost 12 hours after the Spanish meteorological office had put theentire province of Valencia on red alert, warning people of “extreme danger”.Mazón himself has said there is “no government in the world that has the tools to alter, stop or avoid an episode of torrential rains that end up pummelling historical rainfall records in a given area at a given time”. He has also said he kept up to date with the developing situation by phone.His lunch guest, Maribel Vilaplana, has been ordered to testify before the judge who is investigating the authorities’ late response.Mazón’s former interior minister, Salomé Pradas, has told the judge that although she acted“in the best possible way”, she had no experience in dealing with emergencies when she was appointed interior minister three months before the floods.View image in fullscreenSalvador Ciges, at his home in Catarroja, explains where people escaped from the flood.Photograph: José Miguel Fernández de Velasco/The GuardianSalvador Ciges, a 72-year-old artist and cartoonist, lost 300 paintings when the flood waters swept through the streets of his neighbourhood in Catarroja.He, his wife and his daughter escaped the cold, rising waters by climbing the patio walls and knocking on the window of a first-floor neighbour who let them in, thus saving their lives.Like so many others, he longs for a proper explanation of what happened – and for justice and accountability. But he is not holding his breath.“What can I tell you about that day?” he says. “There have been no admissions; just lies. What’s not in doubt is that if there had been warning, that huge mass of water – that catastrophe; that apocalypse – would still have come down, and all those cars would have been swept away and all those houses would have been flooded. But there wouldn’t have been as many deaths.”Explore more on these topicsSpainFloodingEuropeExtreme weatherClimate crisisPedro SánchezfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some of its most prominent present-day leaders havefundedDonald Trump’s re-election and renewed their pursuit of government contracts as the second Trump administration has revitalizedreligious conservatismin Washington DC.Now Gloo’s executive chair and head of technology (who’s largelyfree of the shareholder suit), Gelsinger has made it a core mission to soft-power advance the company’s Christian principles inSilicon Valley, the halls of Congress and beyond, armed with afundraised war chest of $110m. His call to action is also a pitch for AI aligned with Christian values:tech productslike those built by Gloo, many of which are built on top of existing large language models, but adjusted to reflect users’ theological beliefs.“My life mission has been [to] work on a piece of technology that would improve the quality of life of every human on the planet and hasten the coming of Christ’s return,” he said.View image in fullscreenNick Skytland, a vice-president at Gloo, talks about faith alignment of AI at Colorado Christian University’s AI for Humanity event.Photograph: Mike MoselleGloo says it serves “over 140,000 faith, ministry and non-profit leaders”. Though its intended customers are not the same, Gloo’s user base palesin comparison withthose of AI industry titans: about 800 million active users rely on ChatGPT every week, not to mention Claude, Grok and others.Religiosity like Gelsinger’s – a born-again Christian who hasreferredto Silicon Valley as his “mission field” – is shaping Silicon Valley’s culture in its image. Where there was once purported atheism, there is now “a very loud, very visible and very specifically Christian-inflected technological culture” in Silicon Valley, saidDamien Williams, a scholar at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte who studies how technologies are shaped by religious beliefs. It’s exemplified by figures like Peter Thiel – whowarnsof thecoming of the antichrist if humanity failsto work toward certain technological frameworks – and Andreessen Horowitz’sKatherine Boyle, a close friend of JD Vance, the US vice-president. Gelsinger has long been outspoken about his Christian values, helpingfoundTransforming the Bay With Christ in 2013, an organization aiming to ignite a Christian spiritual movement in the region.Speaking on 7 October ata seminarco-hosted by Gloo, Colorado Christian University, a conservative college, and the Christian Post, a conservative evangelical Christian news outlet, Gelsinger framed AI’s development as “another Gutenberg moment”: an epochal shift as important as the Reformation. In the same way that a “plump little monk”, Martin Luther, used the printing press to catalyze “the greatest period of human invention”, he sees a similar faith-driven opportunity today to change the course of history through AI.“The church embraced that great invention of the day to literally change humanity,” Gelsinger said of the printing press. “And so my question today is: are we going to embrace [and] shape AI as a technology that truly does become a powerful embodiment of the church and the expression of the church?”Jesus’s hackathonStraddling the worlds of AI, Christianity and faith tech, Gloo isn’t solely focused on shaping the AI sector through Silicon Valley. It’s wielding influence in other ways, such as by supporting and funding a Christian tech ecosystem. The company hosted a three-day hackathon following the seminar at Colorado Christian University; its event saw more than 600 participants compete for over $250,000 inprize money– nearly triple the attender count from 2024.Though growing, the event was not without hiccups. Ryan Siebert, an AI product developer and hackathon attender, said he was able to get Gloo’s newest large language model, which has not yet been publicly launched, to provide him a recipe for methamphetamine through aprompt injection. He later communicated with the president of Gloo AI to share details about the vulnerability. A Gloo spokesperson said the company explicitly invited hackathon attenders to be among the first to test the new large language model and offer feedback on it, as the product is in a “pre-beta” stage of development.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In an interview with the Guardian, he described presenting Gloo’s work to legal advocacy groups, as well as congressional leaders. He declined to name the institutions or politicians, but said some lawmakers were interested in using Gloo products at their churches.Gloo and Gelsinger frequently travel in conservative political circles. Brandon Showalter, a journalist at the Christian Post and moderator at the Gloo co-hosted seminar, is an anti-trans activist who hassaidhe hopes trans youth care will eventually become “as unthinkable as ice pick lobotomies”.Annie Chestnut Tutor, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, the influential conservative thinktank behind Project 2025, participated in a panel moderated by Showalter and offered a Beltway insider’s perspective on AI regulation. On 17 October, Gelsingerdeliveredhis “Gutenberg moment” stump speech at Liberty University’sCEO Summit, which also featured Liz Truss, Michael Flynn and Dan T Cathy, the Chick-fil-A chairman, as keynote speakers.But Gelsinger appears just as comfortable in those venues as he does as aguest of honorat Joe Biden’s 2022 State of the Union address; and, as may be expected of a pragmatic industry executive, public recordsshowhe’s backed political campaigns on both sides of the aisle.Gloo itself strikes an ecumenical tone in its institutional messaging. It shied away from politics or denominational disagreements at the hackathon; when an attender shared plans on Discord to build an AI bot of Charlie Kirk, the conservative political figureassassinatedat a rally in Utah last month, that would offer “scripture-based responses”, a hackathon organizer encouraged staying “solidly focused on Jesus here”, even as “politics are definitely important”. Leah and Wes Brooks, whose hackathon team built a set of open-source AI tools enabling interoperability among faith-based and other apps, noted a diverse set of event-goers and religious backgrounds – including a female pastor – as well as a generally collaborative environment. “We didn’t even have to sign a statement of faith or anything like that,” Leah Brooks said. Gloo alsosaysit does not “prohibit in any way” Muslim organizations from using its technology.View image in fullscreenBrandon Showalter of the Christian Post interviews Patrick Gelsinger.Photograph: Mike Moselle“We’re not trying to take a theological position: we’re building a technology platform, and then giving enough customization capability that the Lutherans can be good with it, the Episcopalians can be good with it, the Catholics can be good [with it], the Assemblies of God can be good with it,” Gelsinger told the Guardian. “We’re trying to say, ‘Hey, there’s a broad tent here of faith and flourishing,’ but also we’re trying to satisfy many organizations that do not take a denominational perspective, [such as] Alcoholics Anonymous.”Gelsinger wants faith to suffuse AI. He has also spearheaded Gloo’sFlourishing AI initiative, which evaluates leading large language models’ effects on human welfare across seven variables – in essence gauging whether they are a force for good and for users’ religious lives. It’s a system adapted from a Harvard research initiative,the Human Flourishing Program. Models like Grok 3,DeepSeek-R1and GPT-4.1 earn high marks, 81 out of 100 on average, when it comes to helping users through financial questions, but underperform, about 35 out of 100, when it comes to “Faith”, or the ability, according to Gloo’s metrics, to successfully support users’ spiritual growth.Gloo’s initiative has yet to visibly attract Silicon Valley’s attention. A Gloo spokesperson said the company is “starting to engage” with prominent AI companies.“I want Zuck to care,” Gelsinger said.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChristianitySilicon ValleyChatbotsIntelReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, the label casts a broader brush as those from all ages increasingly find themselves renting. The 2021 censusfoundthat the number of households renting had more than doubled in the last two decades in England and Wales, with 5m households renting privately – up from 3.9m in 2011 and 1.9m in 2001.The number of older renters has seen a particularly sharp rise. According to the NationalHousingFederation, the number of 55+ households in the private rented sector has grown by 70% from 2010/11 to 2023.Are you a renter over the age of 61?

The footage has not been verified.In a statement on Tuesday, the Joint Forces – who are allied with Sudan’s army – accused the RSF of having executed more than 2,000 unarmed civilians in recent days.View image in fullscreenA screen grab from unverified footage shared by Sudanese activists that purports to show bodies and burnt vehicles in El Fasher.Photograph: Facebook | تنسيقية لجان المقاومة _الفاشرYale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab, which has been monitoring the war in Sudan using open-source intelligence and satellite imagery, said it had found evidence consistent with mass killings by the RSF.On Tuesday, the Yale lab said the city “appears to be in a systematic and intentional process of ethnic cleansing of Fur, Zaghawa, and Berti Indigenous non-Arab communities through forced displacement and summary execution”. This included what appeared to be “door-to-door clearance operations” in the city, it said.Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Yale Lab, said satellite evidence showed bodies on the ground and discoloration on the ground that is red. He compared the level of violence in the town to the first 24 hours of the Rwandan genocide.“We are only at the beginning of a wave of violence,” he said. “I have never seen a level of violence against an area like we are seeing now. This is only comparable with a Rwandan style killing in the first 24 hours.”The RSF said on Sunday it had seized control of the army’s main base in the city and released a statement saying it had “extended control over the city of El Fasher from the grip of mercenaries and militias”.The Sudanese army chief, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, said on Monday that his forces had withdrawn from El Fasher “to a safer location”, acknowledging the loss of the city.View image in fullscreenThe grandmother of Ikram Abdelhameed looks on next to her family while sitting at a camp for displaced people who fled from al-Fashir to Tawila.Photograph: Mohammed Jamal/ReutersThe RSF has been engaged in a bloody civil war with the army since April 2023 after a power struggle between the two sides.More than 150,000 peoplehave been killed andmore than 14 milliondisplaced due to the fighting.Fears had been mounting in recent weeks for the safety of tens of thousands of civilians trapped in the city by an 18-month RSF siege.The UN rights chief, Volker Türk, said on Monday there was a growing risk of “ethnically motivated violations and atrocities” in El Fasher. His office said it was “receiving multiple alarming reports that the Rapid Support Forces are carrying out atrocities, including summary executions”.The UN Human Rights Office said there were reports of “summary execution of civilians trying to flee, with indications of ethnic motivations for killings”, as well as videos showing “dozens of unarmed men being shot or lying dead, surrounded by RSF fighters who accuse them of being [Sudanese army] fighters”.News agencies have been unable to contact civilians in the city, where the Sudanese Journalists’ Syndicate says communications, including satellite networks, have been cut off by a media blackout.Sudan areas of control mapShayna Lewis, a Sudan specialist at Preventing and Ending Mass Atrocities, one of the groups closely in touch withDarfurcivilian society, accused the RSF of massacring civilians. She said: “Residents of El Fasher who previously left the city are finding out about the death of their loved ones through footage of executions that are widely circulating on social media.”There are grave fears of a repeat of the RSF massacres that took place in West Darfur’s capital, Geneina, after it captured the city in 2023, when up to 15,000 civilians – mostly from non-Arab groups – were killed.According to the UN, more than 1 million people have fled El Fasher since the start of the war and about 260,000 civilians, half of them children, remain trapped without aid. Many have resorted to eating animal fodder.The UN’s migration agency said more than 26,000 people had fled the fighting in El Fasher since Sunday, either seeking safety in the outskirts of the city or heading to Tawila, 45 miles to the west.In Tawila, teams from Médecins Sans Frontières said they were facing a massive influx of wounded coming from El Fasher to the town’s hospital. Since Sunday evening, 130 had been hospitalised, including 15 in critical condition, MSF said.Arjan Hehenkamp, Darfur crisis lead for the International Rescue Committee, said the town, which was already hosting a vast number of displaced people, was “at breaking point. Without a significant scale-up in humanitarian assistance, the suffering here will deepen further,” he said.Emi Mahmoud from the Darfur Internally Displaced People Network described the crisis as “the final stage of the Darfur genocide. I have seen videos of ditches and trenches entirely full of friends, neighbours and family members’ bodies. There have been reports of entire families hanging from trees.”The RSF’s capture of El Fasher, the last remaining major city in Darfur controlled by the army, gives the paramilitary group control over all five state capitals in Darfur and marks a significant turning point in the war.The army is now excluded from a third of Sudanese territory, a development that experts say raises the possibility the country could face partition.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSudanDarfurAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Both sides areaccused of war crimesand the targeting of civilians.The UK military equipment found inSudanfeatures in two dossiers of material, dated June 2024 and March 2025, and seen by the security council. Both were compiled by the Sudanese military and claim to present detailed “evidence of UAE support” for the RSF.Evidence that the UK continued supplying military equipment to the UAE, despite the risk it could end up fuelling Sudan’s ruinous conflict, has prompted deep concern.Mike Lewis, a researcher and former member of theUN panel of experts on Sudan, said: “UK and treaty law straightforwardly obliges the government not to authorise arms exports where there is a clear risk of diversion – or use in international crimes.“Security council investigators have documented in detail the UAE’s decade-long history of diverting arms to embargoed countries and to forces violating international humanitarian law.”Lewis added: “Even before this further information about British-made equipment in Sudan, these licences should not have been issued, any more than to other governments responsible for arming the Sudan conflict.”Abdallah Idriss Abugarda, chair of the UK-based Darfur Diaspora Association, which represens Sudanese from the western region of Darfur, called for an investigation into the issue.“The international community, including the UK, must urgently investigate how this transfer occurred and ensure that no British technology or weaponry contributes to the suffering of innocent Sudanese civilians. Accountability and strict end use monitoring are essential to prevent further complicity in these grave crimes,” he said.View image in fullscreenA Sudanese army officer inspects equipment seized after the capture of an RSF base in Salha, Omdurman, on 26 May.Photograph: Ebrahim Hamid/AFP/Getty ImagesImages contained in the two dossiers of material seen by the security council – of which the UK is a permanent member – suggest that British-made small-arms target devices were recovered from former RSF sites in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, and its twin city of Omdurman.Although difficult to verify without metadata or precise geolocation information, several photographs are marked with labels indicating they were made byMilitec,a manufacturer of small-arms training and target systems based in Mid Glamorgan, Wales.Databases indicate that the UK government granted a number of licences to Militec to export items to the UAE as far back as 2013.New information also reveals that between January 2015 and September 2024, the UK government issued 26 licences for the permanent export to the UAE of military training devices in the “ML14” category, which covers Militec’s products.These licences were issued to 14 companies, including Militec. The government has refused to disclose which licences were granted to which companies.The licences indicate that on 27 September 2024 – three months after the UN security council received images alleging the presence of ML14 rated small-arms equipment in Sudan – the UK government issued an “open individual export licence” for the same category of products to the UAE.Such open licences allow Britain to export unlimited quantities of the equipment over the agreement’s lifespan, but without the need to monitor where it ultimately ends up.By September 2024 there was growing concern that the UAE was arming Sudan’s RSF.Nine months earlier in January 2024, a report by the UN panel of experts on Sudan – appointed by the security council to monitor Darfur’s arms embargo –stated that claims the Emirates were supplying weaponsto the RSF were “credible”.View image in fullscreenA burned-out military vehicle at Khartoum International Airport.

Three years earlier, the UK authorised exports of UK-made night-vision sights to aUAE business, which were subsequently procured by Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.Militec was contacted, but declined to comment. It is understood that all of its exports are licensed by the relevant UK authorities and there is no wrongdoing by the company.Images in the dossiers seen by UN diplomats showNimr Ajban-seriesarmoured personnel carriers (APCs) allegedly captured or recovered from RSF positions.‘We will never, ever escape’: inside the ever-tightening siege of the Sudanese city of El FasherRead moreThe Nimr Ajban APCs are manufactured in the UAE by theEdge Group, a primarily state-owned arms conglomerate.A photograph in the 2025 document shows the data plate from the engine of a Nimr APC marked “Made in Great Britain by Cummins Inc” and indicates it was manufactured on 16 June 2016 by a UK subsidiary of Cummins, a US firm.By 2016 the UK government was aware that the UAE had supplied Nimr APCs in violation of a UN arms embargo to armed groups in Libya and Somalia.Evidence published by the security council stated that theUAE had supplied armoured vehiclestoZintani militias in Libyain 2013.There appears to be no UK licence data to indicate when the British-made engine for the Nimr vehicles was exported because they are not solely designed for military equipment and do not require a special licence.View image in fullscreenArmoured vehicles at the International Defence Exhibition in Abu Dhabi in 2023.Photograph: Ryan Lim/AFP/Getty ImagesA Cummins spokesperson said: “Cummins has a strong compliance culture as evidenced by our 10 ethical principles set out in our code of business conduct. Our code explicitly covers compliance with applicable sanctions and export controls in the jurisdictions in which Cummins conducts business, and in some cases our policies go even further than applicable legal requirements.“Cummins also has a strong policy against participating in any transaction – direct or indirect – with any arms embargoed destination without full and complete authorisation from the relevant governmental authorities.“Cummins has a process to thoroughly review all defence transactions to evaluate legal and policy considerations, and under that program we have regularly obtained export licenses where legally required, as well as applied other compliance measures.“With respect to Sudan specifically, we reviewed all our past transactions and did not identify any military transactions where Sudan was indicated as the end-use destination.”A spokesperson for Britain’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: “The UK has one of the most robust and transparent export control regimes in the world. All export licences are assessed for the risk of diversion to an undesirable end user or end use.“We expect all countries to comply with their obligations under existing UN sanctions regimes,” the FCDO said.Sources said licensing decisions were made on a case-by-case basis and the UK was aware of the risk of diversion to the conflict in Sudan and that export licences, including those to the UAE, were regularly refused.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSudanConflict and armsAfricaArms tradeMiddle East and north AfricaUnited Arab EmiratesnewsShareReuse this content"

Last week, the administration started targeting boats on the western side of the Americas after initially focusing on boats off the coast ofVenezuela.The four boats were hit on Sunday in three strikes, Hegseth said in a social media post announcing the matter. His said the boats were “known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics”. He also acknowledged there was a survivor.In perhaps an effort to avoid the legally thorny questions that could come with detaining that person, Hegseth said the US enlisted Mexico to take on search-and-rescue responsibilities – which Mexico accepted.Hegseth sought to justify the attacks by comparing the US strikes against alleged drug traffickers to conducting strikes on al-Qaida targets during the global “war on terror”.“The Department has spent over TWO DECADES defending other homelands. Now, we’re defending our own. These narco-terrorists have killed more Americans than Al-Qaeda, and they will be treated the same. We will track them, we will network them, and then, we will hunt and kill them,” Hegseth said.Even so, the justification for the strikes has been widely disputed by legal experts. For one, when the US killed al-Qaida members, Congress had authorized the use of force. In targeting drug cartel members, the administration has relied on Trump’s Article II powers to defend the US against an imminent threat.Republican senator Rand Paul, who has been at odds with Trump in recent weeks, on Tuesday expressed criticism with the unilateral strikes and the prospect of a wider escalation with the Venezuelan government.“I am disturbed by the actions with blowing up boats, with people whom we don’t know their name, we’ve been presented with no evidence of a crime,” Paul told reporters. “We don’t even know if they’re armed, frankly, and that’s more indicative of a war. It may be a prelude to war, but I hope it’s not.”Still, the latest boat strikes come as the US appears destined to start hitting land-based targets in the coming weeks, after the Pentagon sent its most advanced aircraft carrier and its strike group to the Caribbean – a major escalation in the Trump administration’s stated war against drug cartels.The move is expected to bring the USS Gerald Ford, with its dozens of fighter jets and its accompanying destroyers, to the coast of Venezuela by roughly the end of the week, according to a person familiar with the matter.Sending the carrier strike group to the Caribbean is the clearest sign to date that the administration intends to dramatically expand the scope of its lethal military campaign from hitting small boats alleged to be carrying drugs bound for the US to targets on land.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That would clear the way for US special operations or drones to destroy land-based targets, current and former officials said.Donald Trumpconfirmed to reporters at the White House on 23 October that the next stage of the campaign was to hit targets on the ground. “The land is going to be next,” the president said. “The land drugs are much more dangerous for them. It’s going to be much more dangerous. You’ll be seeing that soon.”Trump did not discuss which targets in which countries the US intended to strike. But he directed Hegseth, who was seated beside him at the White House event about curbing the flow of illegal drugs into the US, to notify Congress about the administration’s plans.Asked whether he would declare war against the cartels, Trump suggested he would continue with individual strikes. “I think we’re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK?” he said. “We’re going to kill them, you know? They’re going to be, like, dead.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

For the first time, the gang reportedly used weaponised drones to drop explosives on special forces teams.Gunshot wound victims were carried to a local hospital throughout the morning and by afternoon at least 64 people had been killed, including four police officers. “There are bodies strewn all over the streets,” one community leader told the Rio newspaper O Globo.Eight police officers and four residents were wounded. Horrific photos of some of the young male victims spread on social media.View image in fullscreenPolice launched a major operation in and around two favelas aimed at arresting the leaders of the Red Command.Photograph: António Lacerda/EPARio’s rightwing governor, Cláudio Castro, declared the city “at war” and said it was the biggest police operation since a 2010 raid in the same region.“This is no longer common crime, it’s narco-terrorism,” Castro said in a video posted on social media showing armoured personnel carriers at the start of the mission.More than 80 people were reportedly arrested and at least 93 automatic rifles were seized. The weapons are a sign of the powerful arsenal Rio’s drug traffickers have acquired since they began flooding the favelas in the late 1980s.View image in fullscreenGetúlio Vargas hospital workers move an injured person after police raids on Tuesday.Photograph: Silvia Izquierdo/APVictor Santos, Rio’s security secretary, told local television that “Operation Containment” had been ordered to capture Red Command gang members, who control of large chunks of Rio and are increasingly present in other parts of Brazil, including the Amazon region.​Rene Silva, a community activist and journalist from Alemão who runs a local newspaper called Voz das Comunidades, said he had been woken by gunfire at about 5am.He voiced despondency over the government’s insistence on conducting deadly and ultimately ineffective police raids into the favelas.“This doesn’t solve the problem,” Silva said. “Rio’s crime problem needs to be combated in other places – not just in the favelas. We don’t have plantations of marijuana or cocaine here. We don’t have gun factories here. This isn’t a fight against crime, it’s a fight against poverty.”Glória Alves, ​a 65​-year-old resident of an area of Alemão​ called Palmeiras, said she was woken shortly after 4am by her barking dog. Alves went into her bathroom, “and there was this volley of shots – so, so many shots. It was horrible”, she said. The shooting continued around her home throughout the day. “We have no idea what time this will all finish,” she added. “It hasn’t stopped. It isn’t over. And I don’t know what time it will end.”View image in fullscreenDrug traffickers from the Red Command criminal faction started shooting and set fire to barricades and cars.Photograph: Aline Massuca/ReutersHuman rights activists and opposition politicians voiced outrage at the historic day of bloodshed. “What is happening in Alemão and in Penha isn’t an operation – it’s a state-sponsored massacre,” tweeted Lucia Marina dos Santos, a state congress member for the leftwing Worker’s party (PT). Santos accused authorities of turning Rio’s favelas into “war zones” as part of their failed “war on drugs”.With police operations and gunfights reportedly continuing on Tuesday afternoon, the death toll could still rise.Until Tuesday, the highest number of deaths during a single police operation happened in May 2021, when 28 people were killed duringa police assault on Jacarezinho, another large favela that is considered a Red Command stronghold.Over the past four decades Rio’s redbrick favelas have fallen further under the control of heavily armed criminal groups, primarily the Red Command, the Pure Third Command, and a constellation of paramilitaries gangs whose ranks often include off-duty members of the security forces. In recent months the Red Command has embarked on a major offensive to seize control of territories in western Rio controlled byparamilitary groups called militias.Castro said police across Rio had been placed on high alert amid fears drug bosses could order attacks in reprisal for the operation, and on Tuesday afternoon criminals could be seen trying to close some of the city’s most important motorways and roads,including the one leading to the airport. Schools, shops, bars and restaurants all over Rio closed down for fear of attacks and bus companies recalled their fleets, causing rush hour chaos for commuters.​As he stood at one of Alemão’s main entrances on Tuesday afternoon, watching bullet-proof police vehicles drive in, local activist Raull Santiago said the situation remained tense.Santiago called the killings “a massacre, a brutal landmark in the history of this city … and of Brazil as a whole”. “Warlike” police operations were nothing new to Rio, Santiago said. “But they leave profound marks on those who live in the favelas … Once again the favela is bleeding, once again we are counting an ever increasing number of bodies.”Additional reporting by Melissa Cannabrava in Rio de JaneiroExplore more on these topicsBrazilRio de JaneiroAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

How many others will listen?Jonathan WattsandWajã XipaiMon 27 Oct 2025 20.01 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 05.34 EDTShareHumanity has failed to limit global heating to 1.5C and must change course immediately, the secretary general of the UN has warned.In his only interview before next month’s Cop30 climate summit,António Guterresacknowledged it is now “inevitable” that humanity will overshoot the target in the Paris climate agreement, with “devastating consequences” for the world.He urged the leaders who will gather in the Brazilian rainforest city of Belém to realise that the longer they delay cutting emissions, the greater thedanger of passing catastrophic “tipping points”in the Amazon, the Arctic and the oceans.7:22UN chief António Guterres: 'We don't want to see the Amazon become a savannah' - video“Let’s recognise our failure,” he told the Guardian and Amazon-based news organisation Sumaúma. “The truth is that we have failed to avoid an overshooting above 1.5C in the next few years. And that going above 1.5C has devastating consequences. Some of these devastating consequences are tipping points, be it in the Amazon, be it in Greenland, or western Antarctica or the coral reefs.He said the priority atCop30was to shift direction: “It is absolutely indispensable to change course in order to make sure that the overshoot is as short as possible and as low in intensity as possible to avoid tipping points like the Amazon. We don’t want to see the Amazon as a savannah. But that is a real risk if we don’t change course and if we don’t make a dramatic decrease of emissions as soon as possible.”The planet’s past 10 years have been the hottest in recorded history. Despite growing scientific alarm at the speed of global temperature increases caused by the burning of fossil fuels – oil, coal and gas – the secretary general said government commitments have come up short.Fewer than a third of the world’s nations (62 out of 197) have sent in their climate action plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris agreement. The US under Donald Trump has abandoned the process. Europe has promised but so far failed to deliver. China, the world’s biggest emitter, has been accused of undercommitting.View image in fullscreenAntónio Guterres giving his speech at Cop29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, in November 2024.Photograph: Anatoly Maltsev/EPAGuterres said the lack of NDC ambition means the Paris goal of 1.5C will be breached, at least temporarily: “From those [NDCs] received until now, there is an expectation of a reduction of emissions of 10%. We would need 60% [to stay within 1.5C]. So overshooting is now inevitable.”He did not give up on the target though, and said it may still be possible to temporarily overshoot and then bring temperatures down in time to return to 1.5C by the end of the century, but this would require a change of direction at and beyond Cop30.He called for governments to rebalance representation at Cops so that civil society groups, particularly from Indigenous communities, will have a greater presence and influence than people paid by corporations.“We all know what the lobbyists want,” he said. “It’s to increase their profits, with the price being paid by humankind.”He said a transition away from fossil fuels was a matter of economic self-interest, because it was clear that the era of fossil fuels was coming to an end: “We are seeing a renewables revolution and the transition will inevitably accelerate and there will be no way in which humankind will be able to use all the oil and gas already discovered,” he said.Asked if he had raised this with the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, whose government has just given the green light foroil exploration near the mouth of the Amazon, he said: “Not yet. I’ll take advantage of the Cop [to do this].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A fifth of any money disbursed will go directly to Indigenous communities, whose territories contain most of the best-preserved biodiversity and most effective carbon sinks.On several occasions, Guterres stressed the essential importance of Indigenous voices at Cop30. The UN said this was the first time the secretary general had given an exclusive interview to a journalist from an Indigenous community,Wajã Xipai, a Sumaúma reporter from the Xipai peoplewho was joined by the Guardian.“It is fundamental to invest in those who are the best guardians of nature. And the best guardians of nature are precisely the Indigenous communities,” Guterres said.World leaders should also be schooled byIndigenous peoplesin how to achieve a balance with nature, the secretary general said. “Political leaders are often more concerned with the day-to-day problems of society, especially at times when the economic situation is complex and aggravated by climate change, by disasters, by catastrophes. So sometimes there is no notion of the importance of a harmonious relationship with nature and therefore it is necessary to permanently maintain a pedagogy with the political leaders, and there is no one better than the Indigenous communities to do this pedagogy,” he saidDespite growing pressure on the Cop system of global environmental governance, Guterres said it played a crucial role.“The alternative is a free-for-all,” he said. “And we know what free for all means. Free for all means that there will be a small privileged elite, people and companies that will be able to always protect themselves, even if disasters will spread. Floods will spread, communities will be destroyed, but there will always be a group of rich people and rich companies that will be able to protect themselves as the planet is being progressively destroyed.”Next year will be Guterres’s last as secretary general. Looking back on his nine years in the post, he said he wished he had focused on climate and nature earlier, though it was now a priority. He said: “I will never give up on my commitment to climate action, on my commitment to biodiversity, on my commitment to the protection of nature, on my commitment to help and support all the democratic movements that around the world are fighting and fighting hard to preserve the most precious possession that we have, which is our mother nature.”This interview isalso published in English, Portuguese and Spanish by Sumaúma.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisCop30United NationsAntónio GuterresGlobal climate talksGreenhouse gas emissionsBrazilnewsShareReuse this content"

He was born in a refugee camp in Thailand but was granted lawful permanent residence in the US before his first birthday, according to court filings.But Souvannarath on Sunday messaged his wife on WhatsApp and told her he was in Dongmakkhai,Laos, according to a screenshot she shared with the Associated Press. The message ends with “love y’all”.US citizens on the threat of being racially profiled by ICE: ‘I carry my passport card at all times’Read more“It is very unfortunate, especially for the children that we have together,” Beatrice Souvannarath told AP.Emails, phone calls and text messages sent to ICE and the US Department of Homeland Security were not immediately returned.The ACLU of Louisiana, which is representing Souvannarath, called the deportation a “stunning violation of a federal court order”. Before his deportation, Souvannarath had been detained at a newly opened ICE facility at the Louisiana state penitentiary at Angola.“ICE just ignored a federal court order and tore yet another family apart,” said Alanah Odoms, executive director for the ACLU of Louisiana, in a statement. “This administration has shown it will ignore the courts, ignore the Constitution and ignore the law to pursue its mass deportation agenda, even if it means destroying the lives of American citizens.”The deportation comes asTrump administrationofficials have repeatedly clashed with the courts over their attempts to deport large numbers of immigrants. There have been previous cases of US citizens being deported, including US-born children.Chanthila Souvannarath was taken into ICE custody in June following an annual check-in with immigration authorities in Alabama, where he had been living, his wife said.“When he went to check in, they detained him. And our two younger kids were with him,” Beatrice Souvannarath told AP. “It was the hardest two months of my life.”He spent much of his childhood living with one or both of his parents in Hawaii, Washington state and California. His father, a native of Laos, is a naturalized US citizen, and Souvannarath claims his citizenship derives from that status.Trump administration will revamp ICE leadership in quest to intensify deportationsRead more“I continuously lived in the United States since infancy,” Souvannarath wrote in a letter from immigration detention, “and I have always considered myself an American citizen.”Souvannarath filed an emergency motion seeking to delay his deportation. Dick, the federal judge based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, issued a temporary restraining order on Thursday, citing the “irreparable harm that would be caused by immediate deportation”.“Though the government has an interest in the enforcement of its immigration laws, the potential removal of a US citizen weighs heavily against the public interest,” wrote Dick, who was appointed to the federal bench by president Barack Obama. Souvannarath would be “unable to effectively litigate his case from Laos”, she added.The court docket shows no changes in Souvannarath’s case since the judge issued the temporary restraining order, which was scheduled to expire on 6 November. Through her office, Dick declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)AlabamaLaosAsia PacificUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump isscheduled to meetChina’s Xi Jinping in South Korea this week for high-stakes talks amid a bruising trade war.The US and Japan plan to cooperate through use of economic policy and coordinated investment to accelerate development of diversified, liquid and fair markets for critical minerals and rare earths,the White House said in a statement.What are rare earths and critical minerals – explained in 30 secondsRead moreThe objective of the deal is “to assist both countries in achieving resilience and security of critical minerals and rare earths supply chains”, the statement said.In a day of profuse mutual praise, Takaichi, who last week became Japan’s first female prime minister, said she would nominate Trump for the Nobel peace prize – an accolade he has coveted since his return to the White House – according to the White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. Trump claims to have ended several conflicts, although in some cases experts have played down his role.“I would like to realise a new golden age of the Japan-US alliance, where both Japan and the United States will become stronger and also more prosperous,” Takaichi told the media before she and Trump met privately.Takaichi, a conservative who has spoken of her admiration for Margaret Thatcher, supports a more robust Japanese military and has paid her respects at Yasukuni, a shrine in Tokyo that honours Japan’s war dead, including war criminals. She supports restrictions on immigration to Japan and has voiced opposition to calls for the introduction of same-sex marriages, as well as to legal changes that would allow female members of the imperial family to become reigning empresses.The two leaders had begun their first face-to-face meeting watching a live TV broadcast of thethird gamein baseball’s World Series, featuring the Japanese starShohei Ohtani.Takaichi congratulated Trump on his role in securing ceasefires in Gaza and between Thailand and Cambodia, which have been embroiled in a border dispute.In remarks open to the media before their summit, they made several references to Japan’s late former prime ministerShinzo Abe, with whom Trump formed a close relationship during his first administration.Takaichi, an Abe protege who shares his hardline stance againstChina’s military buildup in the region, thanked Trump for his “enduring friendship” with Abe, who was assassinated in 2022.Speaking on the day of the first hearing day in the trial of the man accused ofkilling Abewith a homemade gun, Trump described Abe as a “great friend”, adding that he had “spoken so well” of Takaichi long before she became prime minister.Takaichi presented Trump with Abe’s putter in a glass case, a golf bag signed by the Japanese major winner Hideki Matsuyama and a set of gold-leaf golf balls, according to Kyodo news agency.Their talks focused on trade and security, months after Takaichi’s predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, won tariff concessions from the White House in return for huge Japanese investments in the US economy. Japanese plans to buy more American soya beans, pickup trucks and other products to secure further relief from Trump.In a statement on Tuesday, the leaders “confirmed their strong commitment to implementing this great deal”, adding that the agreement would “help both countries to strengthen economic security, promote economic growth, and thereby continuously lead to global prosperity”.Trump and Xi talks: what will be on the agenda when US president meets China’s leader?Read moreTakaichi described the US-Japan security relationship as the “greatest alliance in the world”, adding that Japan was “ready to contribute to world peace and stability”.They also met the families of dozens of Japanese citizens who wereabducted by North Korean spiesduring the cold war, with Trump pledging his support for efforts to determine their fates and, if they are still alive, to have them returned to Japan.Sakie Yokota, 89, who was among about a dozen relatives who met the leaders, said she hoped Trump would be able to secure the abductees’ release in any future talks with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Yokota’s then 13-year-old daughter Megumi was snatched from near her home on the Japan Sea coast in 1977 and taken to the North.“It’s a critical moment,” she said. “We are getting old and this decades-old problem that has been left unresolved is now in the hands of our children.”Later, onboard the US’s nuclear-powered aircraft carrier the USS George Washington, which is docked at the Yokosuka naval base near Tokyo, Trump delivered an hour-long speech in which he referenced the US’s southern border, inflation and American football, as well as the possibility of deploying “more than the national guard” to “troubled” US cities.Takaichi thanked the 6,000 sailors onboard for helping defend Japan and the wider region, telling them that Tokyo was ready to “fundamentally reinforce” its defence capabilities and contribute even more proactively to peace and stability in the region”.Trump, who metEmperor Naruhitofor a second time at the Imperial Palace shortly after arriving in Japan on Monday evening, welcomed Japanese orders for US-made military hardware and said the two economies would do “a lot of trade”.He congratulated Takaichi on becoming Japan’s first female prime minister, describing it as a “big deal”. Trump said it was an honour to meet her so soon after the launch of her administration, predicting, with typical effusiveness, that she would go on to be one of the country’s “greatest prime ministers”.“Anything I can do to help Japan, we will be there,” Trump said. “You’re going to do a fantastic job, and we’re going to have a fantastic relationship.”Explore more on these topicsJapanDonald TrumpUS foreign policyCritical mineralsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

But one night border force raided his home to deport him to NauruRead moreThe deal between Australia andNauruis expected to last 30 years and will allow Australia to apply for 30-year long-term visas on behalf of the cohort to enable their deportation from the country.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAround $20m of the first instalment will become immediately available for the Nauruan government to “facilitate the settlement”, while the remaining $388m will go into a sovereign trust fund, which is expected to include board members from both the Nauruan and Australian governments.Nauru’s trust fund will receive a further $70m each year from Australia as part of the deal, totalling more than $2.5bn across the three decades.Details of the agreement remain a secret, subject to a public interest immunity claim. But home affairs department officials claim those sent to Nauru, many of whom have been found to be refugees, will be able to live freely within the community and cannot be sent to another country, where they could face persecution in a situation known as chain refoulement.Department officials indicated earlier this year a former regional processing centre, handed to Nauru by Australia, could be used as temporary accommodation while the cohort is settled in. It’s not known what state the centre is in.The deal’s fine print allows Australia to “claw back” any funds provided to the trust should Nauru fail to deliver on the deal.Burke has suggested around two dozen people released under the high court’s NZYQ ruling against indefinite detention have been granted visas so far. Guardian Australia is aware of at least eight who have been redetained awaiting deportation.Adnan*, a man within the NZYQ cohort,told Guardian Australiahe hadn’t heard of Nauru prior to being redetained earlier this year by Australian Border Force officials in a night-time raid.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I do not know why Australia has selected me for this terrible punishment.”The associate legal director of the Human Rights Law Centre, Laura John, accused the federal government of being “willing to completely disregard the basic rights of migrants and refugees” in a process shrouded in secrecy.“We do not know if the person who has been exiled has left family behind in Australia, whether they need medical care that is unavailable in Nauru, or even if they still had visa appeal options in Australia,” she said.“This secrecy is not an accident. It is a deliberate tool wielded by the Albanese government to ensure that it does not have to grapple with the real, human consequences of its actions.“Some of the people facing deportation to Nauru have lived in Australia for most of their lives. Others are stateless and have no other home. Some have serious health conditions and will likely die in Nauru. All of them have already been doubly, or triply punished by the government. They should not be subjected to lifelong suffering.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian immigration and asylumNauruAsia PacificAustralian politicsPacific islandsMigrationRefugeesnewsShareReuse this content"

The Sydney units, three minutes’ walk from the beach, with parking and a bus stop outside, are in a highly desirable spot.But “affordable” they are not.According to RP Data, the affordable two-bedroom units now rent for $960 to $1,000 a week, which is a 20% discount to other two-bedroom units in the block in line with government policy.To be eligible for the affordable units, tenants must prove they meet an income threshold, which for a couple is $121,100 before tax.Luxury apartment development in Kings Cross pits Paul Keating against Morris IemmaRead moreThat means the renter is outlaying 40.3% of their pre-tax income and likely 50% of their post-tax income to live in one of these “affordable” homes.Anastasiya Kozak of HomeGround Real Estate, the for-purpose agency that manages the affordable component of the block, said often it was families going through situation change, such as a recent separation, that would rent this type of property.She said the agency had a policy of charging a maximum of 40% of pre-tax income in rent, and that often there was a negotiation with the owner to secure the tenant.Before the new building was constructed, there were four three-bedroom flats in a scruffy federation block. They rented for $680-$700 a week and were filled with students and backpackers who were paying an average of $230 a room instead of the current $500.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThanks to theNew South Walesgovernment’s policy to encourage new housing through “in-fill” development near transport, this story is being repeated in many parts of Sydney.The reason? Developers, not tenants, are often the economic winners from the policy.Under the NSW In-fill AffordableHousingdensity bonus scheme (IAH policy), property owners can get up to 30% extra density in exchange for providing up to 15% of the project’s dwellings at 20% below market rent for 15 years.Some councils have their own bonus schemes.Work for Shelter NSW done by Cameron Murray, chief economist at Fresh Economic Thinking, and Peter Phibbs, professor emeritus at the University of Sydney, found that the proportion of the bonus value which ends up with the renter is between 21% and 92%, depending on where the property is located.This means that between 8% and 79% of the extra value – by way of extra floors, enhanced views and more units – is retained by the developer.Less conservative assumptions estimate the benefit to property developers at between 34% and 83%.Murray and Phibbs looked at projects using the IAH policy in nine different suburbs. Higher value suburbs such as Edgecliff, Crows Nest and North Sydney delivered a greater benefit to developers.Further proof that the policy is advantageous to developers can be found in the number of developers now applying for the density bonus.Almost every development being lodged as state significant development (SSD) includes an application for affordable housing, which means either developers have discovered their altruistic streak or there is money to be made.Of the residential projects approved by the housing minister, Paul Scully, for fast-tracking in October, all 17 applied for the affordable housing density bonus.This bonus often allows developers to exceed height limits, push expensive units to higher floors and improve views, while the affordable units languish on the lower floors on the noisier side of the building.Developers can also benefit personally as the gap between the concessional rent and the market rent could be treated as a charitable donation for tax purposes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They rent for around $350-$380 a week.The developer, Time and Place, plans to replace them with 34 apartments, with the top floors expected to sell for $10m plus. Three extra floors, over and above the usual maximum of 10 storeys, will be added to house “affordable” units.A two-bedroom Bondi Junction unit for $1,100 a week. Is ‘affordable housing’ really affordable?Read moreBut opponents, such the City of Sydney, Keating and many locals, say these units will no longer be affordable in the normal sense of the word.“This outcome is, I believe, inconsistent with the public interest and social impact aims required for State Significant Development,” Keating said in his objection.“Using the Housing SEPP uplift to deliver fewer, larger, more expensive luxury apartments whilst displacing a large existing cohort of lower-income residents undermines the intent of the Housing SEPP and the NSW government’s broader affordability strategy.”Housing advocacy groups have been voicing increasing concerns about the housing density bonus scheme.John Engeler, chief executive of Shelter NSW, said the “affordable” housing policy did little for the bottom two quintiles of income earners and should really be referred to as discount housing, not affordable housing.He said Shelter NSW’s research showed the policy appears to mainly benefit developers who get the biggest share of the benefit from the policy.“There is a world where there is a win-win, but NSW’s policy caters for a relatively high income group and the actual quantum of ‘affordable’ units is relatively low,” said Leo Patterson Ross, chief executive of the Tenants Union.“There is something of a hope that encouraging all buildings will exert pressure on prices, as it did in Auckland, but I fear it’s not enough to overcome the powerful forces driving up prices,” he said.Patterson Ross said the affordable housing policy was much less stringent than some in European cities and London.The researchers suggested extending the time for the units to remain affordable from 15 to 30 years, and matching the rents charged with the ability of renters to pay, rather than simply linking them to the market rent.Explore more on these topicsHousingRentingNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

All three have landmarks named after them – and the region where Pinjarra stands is named the Peel region.Describing it as a “skirmish” in a letter to the colonial secretary, Lord Glenelg, Stirling’s records say about 15 people were killed that day. He also declared he had set out to “overawe the Murray tribe” and “reduce [them] to weakness” by inflicting “such acts of decisive severity as will appal them as people”.He told survivors: “If any person should be killed by them, not one [Noongar] would be allowed to remain alive this side of the mountains.”A contemporaneous report in the Perth Gazette described killings as “a successful and decisive encounter” that did not stop “until between 25 and 30 were left dead”. Historians have put the possible number killed as 80 or higher, but Dawson said on Tuesday that it was impossible to know the exact toll.View image in fullscreenThe governor of Western Australia, Chris Dawson: ‘The time has come – and the time is right – for the governor to acknowledge the truth of the past actions of a predecessor.’Photograph: Richard Wainwright/AAPThe incident was previously known as the “battle of Pinjarra”, but is now widely known as the Pinjarra massacre, out of recognition that the attack and casualties were one-sided.Dawson said traditional owners had been waiting to hear the truth of the massacre for more than 190 years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some of the defendants had a small social media following, while others were better known. All are accused of making malicious comments about Brigitte Macron’s gender and sexuality. For some, this included equating her age difference with her husband, the French president,Emmanuel Macron, to “paedophilia”. If convicted, they face up to two years in prison.Auzière, who is one of three children from Brigitte Macron’s first marriage, said her mother had been affected by social media posts that had caused a “deterioration of her health” and a “deterioration of her quality of life”.She said: “Not a day or week goes by when someone does not talk about this to her … What is very hard for her are the repercussions on her family … Her grandchildren hear what is being said: ‘Your grandmother is lying’ or ‘Your grandmother is your grandfather.’ This affects her a lot. She does not know how to stop it … She’s not elected, she has not sought anything, and she is permanently subjected to these attacks. I – as a daughter, a woman and a mother – would not wish her life on anyone.”Auzière said her mother now had the “constant behaviour of being on alert that the slightest image of her could be used against her to feed hateful attacks. So she can’t have calm in her daily activities … It’s the impossibility of having a normal life without this issue being brought up, the attacks that she’s the target of. Systematically, her identity is being questioned, people are constantly talking about this to her.”Auzière said the claims her mother was a man were like a “whirlwind that never stops”.The Paris trial is the latest phase in a legal battle on both sides of the Atlantic against the false claim that Brigitte Macron is a man named Jean-Michel Trogneux.The Macrons have also filed aUS lawsuit for defamationagainst the conservative podcasterCandace Owensfor amplifying and repeating the claim. The Macrons’ US lawsuit states that the accusation that Brigitte Macron is a man called Jean-Michel Trogneux is completely false and that Trogneux is in fact Brigitte Macron’s older brother. Trogneux, 80, lives in the northern French town of Amiens, where he grew up with Brigitte and their siblings in a family famous for its chocolate business.Auzière told the court she had seen her uncle a few months ago and “he was really well.”Earlier, Jean-Luc M, 65, a retired business owner who is now a deputy mayor in a village in Saône-et-Loire, was questioned about social media posts he shared or wrote, including one referring to Brigitte Macron as “our first ladyboy”. He denied online harassment, saying: “I never intended to cause harm.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He denied online harassment, saying the legal proceedings were “very dangerous for freedom of expression”.He said his posts about Brigitte Macron were “satire” and “humorous”. He saidFrancewas a nation with “satire in its DNA”. He said Brigitte Macron should have published some photographs of herself while pregnant, which would have put an end to the claims.Bertrand S, an art gallery owner, denied harassment. He said he had shared posts about Brigitte Macron being a man because he felt it was becoming a global issue “with consequences for France”. He felt that if lots of people posted about it, “the Macrons would be obliged to give us an answer to our questions”.The false theory about Brigitte Macron’s gender spread in part because the Macrons’ relationship had long been a topic of comment online. Brigitte Macron, who is 24 years older than her husband, first metEmmanuel Macronwhen she was a French teacher at his Jesuit secondary school in Amiens, where she directed him in a school play.The Macrons’ US lawsuit against Owens stated: “Through the school’s theatre programme, President Macron and Mrs Macron formed a deeper intellectual connection.” It added: “At all times, the teacher-student relationship between Mrs Macron and President Macron remained within the bounds of the law.” Brigitte Macron, who has three children from her first marriage, divorced in 2006 and she and Emmanuel Macron married the following year, when he was 30.Explore more on these topicsBrigitte MacronFranceEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

That summer,extreme rains floodedone-third of the country, killing at least1,700 people, displacing 33 millionpeople,destroying vast tracts of farmlandandcausing economic losses of up to $30bn.The Sindh region bore the heaviest toll, with many districts remaining underwater for over a year. During this time the claimants saw their entire land flooded, and lost at least two rice and wheat harvests. They estimate the total damage at €1m, for which they want an acknowledgment of liability and some degree of compensation from the two companies. If they do not get this, they plan to go to court in December.RWE and Heidelberg Materials are two of Germany’s most polluting companies. RWE is responsible for 0.68% of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions since 1965 through its production of fossil fuels and Heidelberg for at least 0.12% through its cement production, according to new figures from the Climate Accountability Institute, which have not yet been published.“Those who cause the damage should also pay for it,” said Abdul Hafeez Khoso, a landowner and teacher who lives in the village of Molabuxkhoso in northern Sindh, and is one of the claimants. “We, who have contributed the least to the climate crisis, are losing our homes and livelihoods while corporations in the wealthy north continue to make profits.”An RWE spokesperson said: “As we have no further information beyond that reported in the media, we are unable to comment at this time.” A Heidelberg spokesperson said: “We confirm that we have today received a letter from a law firm requesting compensation for alleged climate-related damage. We are currently reviewing this letter.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Last week, a group of typhoon survivors in the Philippinesannounced they would sue Shell in UK court. And in September, a court in Switzerland held its first hearing on a claim brought against the Swiss cement company Holcimby four inhabitants of the Indonesian island of Pulau Pari.Over the past few years, European courts haveincreasingly been open to hearing and deciding claimsbrought by victims of disasters.The legal team in the new Pakistan case hopes to build on the ashes of a failed climate lawsuit earlier this year, which also sought damages from RWE. The farmer and mountain guide Saúl Luciano Lliuyacould not show that his home was at direct riskof being washed away by a glacial flood but the judge confirmed that companies could theoretically be held liable for climate damages in civil proceedings in German court.Regarding the Lliuya case, RWE said that it had “always operated its plants in compliance with applicable law … it would be an irreconcilable contradiction if the state permitted CO2 emissions, regulated them in detail and in some instances even required them, but at the same time retroactively imposed civil liability for them.”By bringing a claim about past, rather than future, harm, the farmers’ legal team hopes to jump over the evidentiary hurdles. It will submit studies showing the impact of anthropogenic climate change on rainfall patterns, including the 2022 Pakistan floods and the Sindh region in particular.Clara Gonzales, the co-programme director of business and human rights at the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, which is also supporting the Holcim case, said they hoped to take case law a step further. She said: “The climate crisis is no longer a theoretical threat; it is a present reality. Diplomacy may have failed affected communities, but the rule of law should be on their side. It is time to draw a clear line: carbon majors should not escape the ‘polluter pays’ principle.”Explore more on these topicsFloodingClimate crisisGermanyEuropePakistanExtreme weatherPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

The latest report looked at three regions of Ukraine in particular – Kherson, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk – which are close to the frontline and where drone attacks have increased in intensity over the past year.In this area the frontline runs along the Dnipro River, and the report’s authors found that Russian drones sent across the lines had relentlessly targeted civilians and their houses, as well as gathering points, humanitarian distribution points, and objects of critical infrastructure that service civilians. Often, the attacks targeted the same locations repeatedly. Drone operators have also targeted ambulance crews and fire brigades.The Russians have used various models of “small, short-range, and low-cost” drones, usually equipped with cameras and a guidance system, in the attacks. Some of them explode on impact while others drop explosives from above. These drones are distinct from the larger, long-range drones that Russia uses to bombard cities across Ukraine on a near-nightly basis.Citing local authorities, the report estimated that more than 200 civilians have been killed by short-range Russian drones in the three regions over the past year, with 2,000 suffering injuries. The report’s authors conducted more than 200 interviews and reviewed more than 500 pieces of video evidence.According to the report, the drone attacks amount to murder, as well as the war crime of intentionally targeting civilians. It also found that the attacks were being committed “as part of a coordinated policy to drive out civilians from those territories and amount to the crime against humanity of forcible transfer of population”.Residents of Kherson recounted the grim reality of life under constant threat of targeted drone strikesto the Guardian late last year, explaining how simple trips around town had become a gauntlet where death could strike at any time.“I heard the drone coming as the bus pulled in but I thought it would follow the bus, because that’s what they do, they hunt the buses,” said Dima Olifirenko, a 22-year-old Kherson resident. “But when it drove off the drone was still there and I realised even if I ran after the bus it would get me. There was nowhere to hide.”Olifirenko suffered shrapnel injuries to his face when the drone exploded. “Drones are much worse than artillery, [where] you can hear the launch and where its flying,” he said. “With a drone, it’s there, it sees you, and you are done.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It quoted a woman who lived in an area frequently targeted by drones who spoke about the psychological impact: “It is a lottery – will a drone fly in or not? You go to bed and you don’t know if you will be killed or wake up in the morning.”Russia has always denied targeting civilians, but over nearly four years of full-scale war in Ukraine, Russian missiles and drones have frequently hit civilian areas. Russian authorities declined to cooperate with the UN inquiry. The authors said they had also wanted to investigate Russian reports of Ukrainian drone attacks against civilian targets in Russian-occupied areas, but had been unable to do so due to a lack of engagement from Moscow.“The Russian Federation continued not to recognise the Commission and 35 written requests for access, information, and meetings, remained unanswered,” the report said.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropeUnited NationsWar crimesnewsShareReuse this content"

No single party ever wins a majority, and cabinets – the last three of which have been four-way coalitions – must win a confidence vote in a parliament of 15 or more parties before taking office.That will make things difficult, if not impossible, for Wilders, who has spent more than 20 years under police protection after threats to his life but now insists he wants to serve as prime minister at the head of a minority government.“If the PVV is the biggest party on Wednesday and you leave us in the lurch and don’t even want to talk to us or rule with us, then democracy is dead in theNetherlands,” he told other party leaders in Volendam, a PVV stronghold, at the weekend. Few seem likely to listen.Migration has once again dominated the campaign, with many moderate parties hardening their rhetoric. Demonstrations have turned violent, including protests outside asylum-seeker hostels and rioting in The Hague.But even if Wilders, who argues that the Netherlands should refuse all asylum requests and use the army to guard its borders if necessary, does finish first, which is not certain – the PVV could lose up to a third of its current 37 seats – he is likely to be shut out of government.The outgoing PVV-dominated government is seen by voters as one of the most ineffective in recent Dutch history, failing to deliver on its key promise of introducing Europe’s toughest immigration regime and tackle a dire national housing shortage.‘Open hostility has become normalised’: Dutch Muslims fear rise of far right as general election loomsRead moreThe parties forecast to make the biggest gains – the centre-right Christian Democrats (CDA), whichpolls showmay surge to 22 seats from five, and liberal-progressive D66, on track for 23 from nine – are those that have called loudest for a return to “responsible” government.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Frans Timmermans (GroenLinks-PvdA), Henri Bontenbal (CDA), Geert Wilders, Rob Jetten (D66), and Dilan Yesilgoz (VVD) at a debate last weekend.Photograph: Remko de Waal/EPA“What we have seen is two years of politics of division and chaos,” the CDA leader, Henri Bontenbal, a youthful former sustainability adviser widely seen as a potential future prime minister, said last week. “We want to present a politics of hope and responsibility.”Pledging to restore “decency” to Dutch politics, Bontenbal has also said Wilders “does not defend democracy” and “any coalition with a majority in parliament” would be democratic: “Winning the election is no guarantee you get to be in government.”Campaigning at Amsterdam central station, D66’s leader, Rob Jetten, was equally upbeat. “Over the past few years, we’ve heard a lot of negativism from Dutch politics,” he told the Guardian. “But this is exactly what people are sick and tired of.”His party’s resolutely optimistic campaign was “key to winning these elections, and to defeating Wilders”, Jetten said.Young D66 campaigners – despite being part of the generation thatbears the brunt of the country’s housing crisis– agreed.“We live in a very rich country, we have a very good care system, a good pension system, good education, relative safety – we can do a lot in this country,” said Claartje Engelaar.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think it’s important to have a positive voice against that: wecansolve the problems. And that gives us a lot of energy.”The opposition centre-left alliance of Green Left and the Labour party (GL/PvdA), led by the former European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans, is second in the polls behind the PVV and also forecast to improve its seat tally from 2023.“The problem of this country is that in the last couple of years, nothing has happened,” Timmermans told Dutch media. “No problem was solved, every problem got even bigger. We need to get this country working again, put it on a social track.”Meanwhile, the four members of the outgoing cabinet – the PVV; the liberal-conservative VVD, long headed by the former prime minister Mark Rutte but led by Dilan Yeşilgöz-Zegerius since 2023; the populist Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB); and the centrist New Social Contract (NSC) – are all forecast to lose seats.Quite what government will emerge from what looks certain to be several months of highly complex negotiations is almost impossible to predict.Assuming parliament votes down any attempt at a Wilders minority administration, “historically, the biggest party loses the right to form a coalition and it goes to the second-placed party”, said Claes de Vreese of the University of Amsterdam.With 16 parties forecast to make it into parliament, but only six of them with more than 10 seats, the final outcome is likely to be a broad-based coalition led by either the centre-left or the centre-right, but containing parties of both persuasions.Whatever its complexion, it will need to act. Despite the campaign’s focus on migration, voters have consistently said the country’s biggest problem is its housing shortage, estimated at about 400,000 homes in a country of 18 million people.Unless those questions – and other pressing issues, including soaring healthcare costs – are properly addressed, analysts have warned that the Netherlands’ return to what looks like being a more commonsense form of government could prove shortlived.“There is a lot of voter dissatisfaction with many other issues as well,”said Léonie de Jong, a far-right expert at the University of Tübingen. “And Wilders is someone who can activate this dissatisfaction, and convert it into votes.”This article was amended on 28 October 2025. An error introduced during the editing process resulted in an earlier version suggesting the VVD is currently led by Mark Rutte.Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsGeert WildersEuropeThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

At least seven people were killed in separate strikes in Gaza City and Khan Younis, including two children, medical sources said.The sudden outbreak of violence was the most significant challenge of the 18-day ceasefire inGaza. The US vice-president, JD Vance, tried to downplay the fighting, saying the ceasefire would hold.Netanyahu ordered the strikes after a firefight between Palestinian militants and Israeli troops, as well growing fury overHamasturning over body parts of a hostage whose remains Israeli troops had recovered two years before. The Israeli prime minister called an emergency meeting to discuss what he called Hamas violations of the ceasefire, amid clamour for a return to the war by far-right figures in the Israeli government.The bombardment promptedHamas to delay a planned handover of a hostage’s remains, which had been scheduled for Tuesday night.Israeli media said Hamas militants had attacked Israeli troops in southern Gaza with an anti-tank missile and guns earlier on Tuesday. Hamas denied responsibility for the attack and said in a statement that it remained committed to the ceasefire deal.An Israeli military official told Reuters that the attack violated the ceasefire as it was carried out east of the agreed withdrawal line of Israeli forces.Israel Katz, Israel’s defence minister, said that Hamas would “pay many times over” for attacking Israeli soldiers and for failing to turn over hostages’ remains. “The attack on IDF soldiers in Gaza today by the Hamas terror organisation crosses a glaring red line to which the IDF will respond with great force,” Katz said in a statement.Israel notified the US before launching the strikes, two US officials told the Associated Press.The ceasefire, which started on 10 October, has held up until now, despite similar incidents of violence in recent weeks. US officials have made it clear they do not want a return to fighting in Gaza and have sent a series of officials to Israel over the past week, inwhat Israeli media has sardonically dubbed “Bibisitting.”The US vice-president, JD Vance, said that he thought the ceasefire would hold despite Tuesday’s fighting. “That’s doesn’t mean there aren’t going to be little skirmishes here and there,” Vance told reporters.Earlier on Tuesday, Netanyahu accused Hamas of a “clear violation” of the US-brokered Gaza ceasefire, saying the militant group had returned body parts of a hostage whose remains Israeli troops had recovered two years before.Under the terms of the ceasefire, Hamas is required to return the remains of all Israeli hostages as soon as possible. In exchange, Israel has agreed to hand over 15 Palestinian bodies for each Israeli. Hamas has yet to return 13 bodies.In a statement on Tuesday, Hamas said that the latest order to strike Gaza would further delay efforts to recover hostages’ remains.Hamas has also accused Israel of violating the ceasefire, with the Gaza media office saying Israel has violated the deal more than 80 times, killing at least 80 people since the truce came into effect.On Monday, the International Committee of the Red Crossaccompanied members of Hamasinside areas of Gaza under the control of the Israeli military to facilitate the search for the bodies, after Donald Trump on Saturday issued a 48-hour ultimatum to return the remains of the dead Israeli hostages “quickly, or the other countries involved in this great peace will take action”.In the evening, Hamas’s military wing, the al-Qassam brigades, said it hadreturned the body of an Israeli captive, with the Israeli government later confirming it had received it from the Red Cross.However, on Tuesday, the Israeli health ministry’s National Forensic Institute said there was no match with any of the 13 missing bodies, saying the remains belonged toOfir Tzarfati, whose body was recovered by the IDF in the Gaza Strip in December 2023, less than two months after his abduction.The Israeli military published footage of what it said were members of Hamas reburying a body in order to “stage a false discovery” for the ICRC, which it said was the group “attempting to create a false impression of efforts to locate the bodies”. Hamas has yet to comment on the claims.The news has enraged Israelis, with the far-right ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich lashing out at Hamas and calling on Netanyahu to resume the war.“The fact that Hamas continues to play games and does not immediately transfer all the bodies of our fallen, is in itself evidence that the terror organisation is still standing,” said Ben-Gvir, the security minister.“Now we don’t need to ‘extract a price from Hamas’ for the violations. We need to exact from it its very existence and destroy it completely, once and for all, in accordance with the central goal defined for the ‘war of revival’ [war in Gaza],” he said, adding: “Mr prime minister, enough hesitation. Give the order.”Smotrich, the finance minister, wrote to Netanyahu calling for “forceful responses” to Hamas’s violations and called for “the destruction of Hamas and the removal of the threat emanating from Gaza toward the citizens of Israel”.It was unclear if the strikes ordered on Gaza would be accompanied by further punitive measures. The Times of Israel said the prime minister was considering moving the yellow line dividing Gaza in two to place more territory under IDF control, or halting the entry of humanitarian aid to Gaza.Hamas has so far returned the remains of 15 hostages, with 13 bodies still in the territory.The militant group says it does not know the precise whereabouts of all the bodies, saying it has lost contact with several of its units that had been holding the captives and were reportedly killed during Israeli bombardments.In a separate development on Tuesday, police said Israeli forces had killed three Palestinians they described as members of a “terrorist cell” during a raid near the occupiedWest Bankcity of Jenin.Explore more on these topicsIsraelHamasGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

The war is not my fault, and it’s not the fault of the other 600,000 Gazan students.”Dania, who wants to work in cybersecurity and has been studying by herself online for the last two years, said being in Gaza was “like an oven, and the fire is burning us not just from the outside but the inside as well”.The UK Home Office has allowed some students to come to Britain but only those who are accepted on to the Chevening Scholarship, which is open to university-age students and would allow those who are accepted to stay for only one year. It has a longstanding policy not to comment on individual cases, but states that students must be 18 years or over to be eligible for support.The family say, however, that this policy has not been adhered to consistently, with young people without visas from other wartorn countries such as Ukraine being allowed to enter Britain despite facing the same obstacles as Dania.View image in fullscreenDania with her mother and sisters.Photograph: Courtesy of Hayat GhalayiniIt is understood that some of Dania’s contemporaries from Gaza have been allowed to go to other European countries, such Italy, Belgium, Ireland and France, which have made exceptions due to their circumstances.Dania’s mother, Hayat Ghalayini, says the process of trying to get her daughter to safety has left her feeling “completely helpless”, adding that officials she has contacted have told her they “feel her pain” but have done little to help or clarify the situation.“They say that because she does not have a visa she cannot come, but she cannot get those things without leaving Gaza. In order for Dania to get a visa, she needed to submit some biometrics. But because of war there were no means for her to get those biometrics through,” said Ghalayini. “It’s a catch-22, we are just going in circles.”Ghalayini, 46, left Gaza during the first months of the war at the behest of Dania and her adult daughters, thinking that she would be reunited with them within a couple of weeks. She has since settled in Manchester with her husband, but doesn’t understand why her youngest daughter, whom she hasn’t seen since she was 14, cannot be with her.“A lot of people in the Home Office have children, and if they could just look at it from a strictly humanitarian perspective, they’d see a 16-year-old who is scared and in danger, and just wants to learn and be safe,” Ghalayini said.“If they could just give me a reason, then I would be happy with that, but she’s just a girl whose whole education has been halted. They did the same for the Ukrainian children. They did the same for children from other areas of war, children who had no connections to the UK. I just don’t understand, why can’t they help my daughter?”The Home Office has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

One of the prisoners is still at large, PA reported.The mistaken releases took place at HMP Pentonville, HMP Durham, HMP the Mount in Hertfordshire and from Reading crown court, according to PA.The Ministry of Justice has acknowledged that more prisoners were mistakenly released this week, but disputed the number.Fairhurst said prison authorities knew the erroneous releases had been a “regular occurrence” for the past year.He blamed inadequate staff training and said the early release schemes, brought in by the government to tackle jail overcrowding last year, had created “a confusing time for everyone”.He defended prison staff and said the union was supporting the officer involved in Kebatu’s case, who he said had been “unfairly” suspended.Fairhurst said an error in the paperwork had led to Kebatu’s release: “Somewhere on that paperwork, it’s been missed that we should have held this person in reception until the immigration service picked him up for deportation.”David Lammy, the justice secretary, told MPs on Monday that he had been freed in “what appears to have been a human error”.Lammy said the government was immediately putting stronger checks in place at prisons across the country.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said: “Releases in error have been increasing for several years and are another symptom of the prison system crisis inherited by this government.”According to government figures published in July, 262 prisoners were released in error in the year to March 2025 – a 128% increase on 115 in the previous 12 months.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

This is an issue of public confidence. We know that communities don’t want asylum seekers housed in hotels, and neither does the government, and that’s why we are determined to fix the mess that we’ve inherited by getting a grip of the issue and committing to close every single asylum hotel, saving the taxpayer billions of pounds.”The Conservative government had also planned to save public money by moving asylum seekers into former RAF bases. However,an assessment by Whitehall’s spending watchdog last yearfound that plans to place hundreds of asylum seekers in the former RAF base at Scampton, in Lincolnshire, would have cost £45.1m more than hotels. Using RAF Wethersfield in Essex would have cost £500,000 less, the report found.The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, said accommodating such large numbers of people in barracks had been tried by the last government and had failed.“The plans released overnight by theHome Officeto house 10,000 people seeking asylum on military sites are fanciful, too expensive and too logistically difficult,” he said.“The government could end the use of hotels next year, without resorting to camps, by putting in place a one-off scheme that would give permission to stay for a limited period – subject to rigorous security checks – to people from countries almost certain to be recognised as refugees,” he added.The chief executive of Care4Calais, Steve Smith, said Labour was breaking its promise to end the use of barracks to house refugees, exposing the taxpayer to soaring costs. “Opening more camps will only serve to re-traumatise more people who have already survived horrors such as war and torture,” he said.The Conservative MP for Sussex Weald, Nus Ghani, whose constituency includes the Crowborough site, said the plans were “wholly inappropriate”. She has launched a petition in an attempt to stop the scheme going ahead.“Under the previous Conservative government, the Crowborough site was rejected outright. This was due to its layout and the difficulty in it being adapted and the extra costs that would be involved,” she said.Shaun Fraser, Labour’s Scottish parliament candidate for Inverness and Nairn, said the proposal to use the Cameron Barracks was “a bizarre one given its status as a 19th-century military installation”.Highland council has accused the UK government of failing to consider the local impact of moving hundreds of asylum seekers to barracks in the centre of Inverness.A joint statement from the council’s convener, Bill Lobban, its SNP leader, Raymond Bremner, and the opposition leader, Alasdair Christie, on Tuesday morning said: “Our main concern is the impact this proposal will have on community cohesion given the scale of the proposals as they currently stand. Inverness is a relatively small community, but the potential impact locally and across the wider Highlands appears not to have been taken into consideration by the UK government.”As of June this year, about 32,000 asylum seekers were being accommodated in hotels, down from a peak of more than 56,000 in 2023 but 2,500 more than at the same point last year.Expected costs of Home Office accommodation contracts for 2019 to 2029 have more than tripled from £4.5bn to £15.3bn after what the Commons home affairs committee called a dramatic increase in demand.In a further development, immigration enforcement visits have reached their highest level since comparable data began in 2011, Home Office data shows.A total of 21,858 visits were recorded in the 12 months to September this year – up 38% from 15,894 in the previous 12-month period, and an increase of 56% on 13,990 visits that were carried out in the same period up to September 2012.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The three helped shape the movement’s early structure before relations broke down.The latest row threatens to overshadow and affect the party’s first national conference in Liverpool next month, where members are due to approve a draft constitution and elect a 21-member executive. One person close to the conference planning process warned the party could be forced to invite fewer delegates because of the lack of funds and data.Your Party sets out constitution plans including new year leadership contestRead moreThe £800,000 pot, currently held by MoU, was amassed from membership donations to the party from early July, after Sultana’s unilateralannouncementthat she and Corbyn were “co-leaders”, to 17 September, the Guardian has been told.Sources close to the party directors say an agreement was signed in July and referenced Your Party’s original privacy policy, in which MoU was meant to hold the money and data only until the party was formally registered, and then transfer it to the new entity. The party was formally registered with the Electoral Commission on 30 September, yet funds remain in MoU’s account. The Guardian has seen a screenshot of Your Party’s original privacy policy, which was only valid until the party was registered.The MoU directors have been accused by sources of refusing to transfer the pot of donations and membership data, despite repeatedly committing to do so and being legally obliged to do so.Party insiders say the deadline for the final transfer had passed on Friday night, prompting the decision to pursue legal action.The dispute also covers the control of thousands of supporters’ data collected during a unilateral and unauthorised launch of a membership portal on 18 September. Sultana invited supporters to sign up to the portal on X, with a link to a website styled as Your Party’s official portal but hosted on a separate domain. Sources close to the party note the site listed MoU as the data controller and routed payments to its bank account.The launch of that portal – shared and retweeted on X by Driscoll and Feinstein – prompted Your Party to refer itself to the information commissioner’s office.

They remain required to work.Nearly 11,000 air traffic controllers, who are deemed essential workers, received a $0 paycheck on Tuesday, equating to two weeks of unpaid work. Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, warned at a Tuesday press conference that another missed paycheck could be financially catastrophic for employees.“Many of our controllers can make it without this first paycheck; they’ve been in the job 10, 15, 20 years; they’ve planned for days like this,” said Duffy at the LaGuardia airport in New York City.US airports report over 20 air traffic controller shortage incidents in one dayRead more“This is day one,” added Duffy of the missed payments. “Day two gets harder, [and] day three is harder after that, as expenses continue to roll [in].”Duffy noted that air travel is still safe, but that flight delays and other travel issues could continue as the shutdown goes on. Flight disruptions have become increasingly common due to staffing issues, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).Staffing issues were reported in Chicago, Dallas, Nashville and other major cities. At the time of publishing, more than 3,000 flights were delayed within, into or out of the US,accordingto FlightAware. The number of US flights cancelled was 132.Union leaders have also spoken about the financial hardships of essential workers. “Air traffic controllers have to have 100% of focus 100% of the time,” said Nick Daniels, president of National Air Traffic Controllers Association, at the same press conference. “And I’m watching air traffic controllers going to work … They’re worried about paying for medicine for their daughter. I got a message from a controller that said, ‘I’m running out of money. And if she doesn’t get the medicine she needs, she dies.’”Some airlines have taken to donating meals to unpaid federal workers to alleviate financial hardships. United toldCBS Newsthat it was feeding workers at its hubs, including in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington DC. Delta and JetBlue have also said they would be offering food to workers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are actively collaborating with local authorities and will send a team of animal care experts to assist as needed.”All but one of the monkeys were said by local police officials to have been “destroyed” later on Tuesday. “We are continuing to look for the one monkey that is still on the loose,” the sheriff’s department added.Explore more on these topicsMississippiAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Nvidia was the first, in July, as the chip designer rode the wave of AI spending. Itcurrently leads with a market value of more than $4.5tn.Microsoft hit the $4tn mark a few weeks later in July.

This summer, its CEOwarned white-collar employeestheir jobs could be taken by artificial intelligence.Beth Galetti, a senior vice-president at Amazon, wrote in a memo to employees on Tuesday: “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of … work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs.”On Monday,Reutersandthe Wall Street Journalreported that Amazon was poised to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, as it tries to undo the vast recruitment drive it embarked on at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, which unleashed an extraordinary – but fleeting – surge in demand for online shopping.CNBCcalled it the largest layoff in the company’s history.The layoffs represent a small portion of Amazon’s sprawling global workforce of 1.55 million employees, but a significant chunk of its roughly 350,000 corporate employees.Amazon declined to comment on the reports of wider layoffs on Monday, before Galetti announced the 14,000 the following day. She also told employees that the firm would seek to identify “additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains” in 2026.“Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well,” wrote Galetti. “Across our businesses, we’re delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly.“This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones).”Shares in Amazon, which is scheduled to report quarterly earnings later this week, rose 1.2% on Monday after the initial reports of job cuts.Other giants of the internet have likewise backtracked on the major hiring undertaken during the coronavirus pandemic. Microsoft; Meta, parent of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook; and Alphabet, parent of Google and YouTube, have all laid off tens of thousands of workers in the past three years.Back in June, Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, told employees that AI agents – tools that carry out tasks autonomously – and generative AI systems such as chatbots would require fewer employees in some areas.“It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce,” Jassy wrote in a memo to staff.In recent years, Amazon has been trimming smaller numbers of jobs across multiple divisions, including devices, communications, podcasting and others.This week’s wave of cuts is expected to affect a wide variety of divisions within Amazon, including human resources, known as people experience and technology, devices and services and operations, among others. Fortunereportedthat as many as 15% of the firm’s HR roles could be hit, citing multiple sources familiar with Amazon’s plans.Managers of affected teams were asked to undergo training on Monday for how to communicate with staff following notifications that will start going out via email tomorrow morning, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources.Jassy has been undertaking an initiative to reduce what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy at the company, including by reducing the number of managers, and introduced an anonymous complaint line for claims of inefficiencies that has elicited about 1,500 responses and more than 450 process changes, he said earlier this year.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsAmazonnewsShareReuse this content"

Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, warned at a Tuesday press conference that another missed paycheck could be financially catastrophic for employees.“Many of our controllers can make it without this first paycheck; they’ve been in the job 10, 15, 20 years; they’ve planned for days like this,” said Duffy at the LaGuardia airport in New York City.US airports report over 20 air traffic controller shortage incidents in one dayRead more“This is day one,” added Duffy of the missed payments. “Day two gets harder, [and] day three is harder after that, as expenses continue to roll [in].”Duffy noted that air travel is still safe, but that flight delays and other travel issues could continue as the shutdown goes on. Flight disruptions have become increasingly common due to staffing issues, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).Staffing issues were reported in Chicago, Dallas, Nashville and other major cities. At the time of publishing, more than 3,000 flights were delayed within, into or out of the US,accordingto FlightAware. The number of US flights cancelled was 132.Union leaders have also spoken about the financial hardships of essential workers. “Air traffic controllers have to have 100% of focus 100% of the time,” said Nick Daniels, president of National Air Traffic Controllers Association, at the same press conference. “And I’m watching air traffic controllers going to work … They’re worried about paying for medicine for their daughter. I got a message from a controller that said, ‘I’m running out of money. And if she doesn’t get the medicine she needs, she dies.’”Some airlines have taken to donating meals to unpaid federal workers to alleviate financial hardships. United toldCBS Newsthat it was feeding workers at its hubs, including in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington DC. Delta and JetBlue have also said they would be offering food to workers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But only one,Comcast, owns and operates media companies, including the left-leaning MSNBC.The announcement has created an awkward on-air dynamic for the hosts and journalists at the network, who have covered the backlash to the contributions, which have raised concerns about quid pro quo.Trump’s ballroom blitz sparks chorus of disgust: ‘The perfect symbol’Read more“For every Avelo Airlines, for every Paul Weiss law firm, and all the other law firms that did corrupt deals with Trump, for every corporation – like our parent company for another hot minute, Comcast – that wants to pay for Trump to take a literal wrecking ball, excuse me, I mean an excavator to the White House,” Maddow said on Monday, “those public-facing companies should know there’s a cost in terms of their reputation with the American people.“There may be a cost to their bottom line when they do things against American values, against the public interest, because they want to please Trump or buy him off or profit somehow from his authoritarian overthrow of our democracy.”Lawrence O’Donnell, another primetimeMSNBChost, also called out Comcast for only being concerned about its financial interests and ability to merge with or acquire other companies in the future. O’Donnell called the destruction of the East Wing “a unique presidential crime against our history and our culture”.“Comcast – the current but not for long owner of the company I now work for – doesn’t think it’s a big enough business,” he said. “Comcast is committed to nothing but Comcast.”Maddow and O’Donnell referenced the temporary nature of Comcast’s control of their company. MSNBC is scheduled to be formally spun off from its parent, and to become part of a new company called Versant, in a few months. Starting 15 November, the network will become known as MS NOW.Stephanie Ruhle was the first MSNBC host to raise concerns about the donation during her late-night show last week. “Here’s the issue: Donors are paying for it. Corporations are paying for it. Comcast, our Comcast, is one of those that are underwriting this,” she told viewers last Wednesday. “Shouldn’t that be more concerning to the American people? Because there ain’t no company out there writing a check just for goodwill.”And a guest on the network, the Atlantic writer David Frum, suggested on MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace’s show that Comcast likely has ulterior motives for the donation.“Everyone who is giving the money, the quarter of a billion dollars to pay for [Trump’s new ballroom], with all due respect to Comcast – thank you for the hospitality – is doing so in expectation of something in return,” said Frum. “They’re not doing it for love of ballroom dancing.”Journalists who work for NBC News, which is also owned by Comcast, have noted in reports that their parent company is among the contributors.Jennifer Khoury, a spokesperson for Comcast, did not reply to a request for comment about the donation and the MSNBC host backlash to it. MSNBC also declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsMSNBCComcastDonald TrumpRachel MaddowTV newsUS television industryTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood the flavour had been approved by Ben & Jerry’s independent board and first mooted about a year ago.Magnum, the group’s ice-cream arm, confirmed it had not gone ahead with the board’s suggestion for aPalestineproduct this summer.Cohen hasmounted a “Free Ben & Jerry’s” campaignto persuade Unilever to sell the brand to a group of socially minded investors who he says have pledged to allow it to continue its “social mission.”With an increasingly authoritarian Trump in the White House, Cohen says now is the time that “companies and anyone who believes in justice, freedom and peace stands up. This is the moment when it is most needed for Ben & Jerry’s to be able to raise its voice.“It seems like since Trump got elected anything that Trump is against, DEI, black history, protesters’ rights to free speech, all those things got censored.”Previous Ben & Jerry’s flavours with an activist bent have included “Save Our Swirled” to highlight the need for action at the 2015 Paris climate meetings, “I Dough, I Dough” to celebrate the legalisation of same-sex marriage at a US federal level, and “Home Sweet Honeycomb” in support of resettling refugees in Europe.Cohen’s criticisms, which he has backed up with avideo posted on Instagram, are the latest blow in the acrimonious spat between the brand’s founders and owners. Unilever is planning to spin off the Magnum Ice Cream Company into a separate business, which it hopes to list in Amsterdam with secondary listings in London and New York.Those plans were this week delayed because of the US government shutdown, although they could proceed by the end of the year. Unilever said remained confident of implementing its demerger plans this year.Unilever and Magnum said Ben & Jerry’s was “not for sale”.Magnum said: “The independent members of Ben & Jerry’s board are not, and have never been, responsible for the Ben & Jerry’s commercial strategy and execution.”Referring to the proposed pro-Palestinian flavour, a spokesperson said: “Recommendations are considered by Ben & Jerry’s leadership, and management has determined it is not the right time to invest in developing this product.”The company said Ben & Jerry’s was focused on “campaigns close to its communities” such as improved conditions in refugee accommodation in the UK and campaigning in defence of the first amendment and freedom of speech in the US.Magnum added: “We remain committed to Ben & Jerry’s unique three-part mission – product, economic and social – and look forward to building on its success as an iconic, much-loved brand.”Unilever, the British owner of consumer brands ranging from Dove soap to Hellmann’s mayonnaise, bought Ben & Jerry’s in 2000 for $326m, but agreed an unusual deal for the ice-cream brand to preserve an independent board with the ability to speak out on social justice issues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They opened their first store in a renovated petrol station in Burlington, Vermont, with a mission to “advance human rights and dignity”.Under Unilever, the pair have officially been paid employees with no formal role in the business beyond promoting its values as “brand ambassadors”. Cohen remains in that role, butGreenfield resigned from Ben & Jerry’s in September, saying it had lost its independence.Cohen said Ben & Jerry’s was being blocked from “making ice-cream with purpose”, and pledged to create a Palestine solidarity flavour in his own kitchen.Members of the public are being asked to name and help create the flavour in a two-week competition. He suggested it would be based on watermelon, itself asymbol of solidarity with the Palestinian people.The ice-cream, which would be created as a small batch under his personal Ben’s Best brand, will not be for sale, but is intended to draw attention to the cause of “rebuilding, and peace and dignity for the people of the region”. He has previously used the Ben’s Best brand, first created in 2016 toback leftwing Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, to support a number of causes.Ben & Jerry’s has clashed repeatedly with its parent company over Palestinian rights. It refused to sell ice-cream in territories occupied by Israel, took legal action against Unilever when it sold the brand’s Israeli division to a local operator. In May the brand called Israel’s actions in Gaza a genocide, a description used last month by aUnited Nations independent international commission of inquiry.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryDonald TrumpGazaPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

Hedied in prisonin 2021. HSBC provided administrative services to a number of funds that had assets invested with Madoff Securities.The hit to HSBC comes after a court turned down the bank’s efforts to appeal over the case against its Luxembourg arm.The chief financial officer, Pam Kaur, told journalists that the figure could vary and that a settlement over the case could take years. “This is a complex case,” she said on Tuesday. “This will take a period of time to go through. It could take months, it could take years, as you can imagine this case itself has taken a very long time to come through.”Kaur said the $1.1bn figure was “not some average number we have come up with. We have come up with the best judgment based upon advice from our accountants, our internal counsel, our external legal counsel. Of course, there could be some variation around that number.”HSBC said it planned to file a further case in the Luxembourg court of appeal and if that fails it will dispute the final amount in later proceedings.The latest provision contributed to a 14% drop in pre-tax profits for HSBC, which fell to $7.3bn for the three months to 30 September. That was down from $8.5bn during the equivalent period last year.The lender said the Madoff provision fed into a 24% jump in operating costs to $10bn. However, that figure also included restructuring costs that covered severance for bankers let go as part of ashake-upunder the chief executive, Georges Elhedery, announced last year.HSBC also put aside another $1bn to deal with the ripple effects of China and Hong Kong’sreal estate downturn, which has hit the banking sector with a rise in bad debts linked to the crash in property prices.Together, the provisions offset a 15% rise in net interest income to $8.8bn, and a 12% jump in net fee income to $3.5bn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Meanwhile, the IMF warned that a downturn could haveripple effects across the financial system, given that banks were increasingly exposed to a largely unregulated private credit industry. There are concerns that a downturn could destabilise traditional banks that issue loans to the shadow banking sector.HSBC’s own direct exposure to the private credit industry was small and in the “single-digit billions”, Kaur said, adding: “We are not a big player in this space at all.” Its rival Barclays revealed – and played down – its own£20bn exposurelast week.“What is very important in these situations is to consider the second- and third-order risks of other smaller banks or hedge funds that we may be dealing with, and that becomes a primary focus for us,” Kaur said. HSBC is “monitoring the situation very carefully”, she added.Elhedery said in a statement released alongside the bank’s results: “We are becoming a simple, more agile, focused bank, built on our core strengths.

Warren noted that Staley – who is alreadybanned from the UK banking sector– had been described in media reports as Epstein’s “chief defender”.High flyer to pariah: the saga of Epstein-linked banker Jes StaleyRead moreWarren, the lead Democrat on the US Senate committee on banking, housing and urban affairs, said she was concerned to hear that Staley pushed back when colleagues flagged Epstein’s suspicious transactions, referring to a matter that was put to him in court proceedings earlier this year. Staley denied the allegations at the time, saying “I don’t think that’s fair” and that the decision to exit a client such as Epstein was not his to make.Warren also referred to court evidencesuggesting Staley tipped Epstein off about JP Morgan’s worriesin a way that allowed the sex trafficker to alter his behaviour and avoid scrutiny. Staley told the court that he “was not part of managing the account” but did not deny that he told Epstein there were concerns about cash withdrawals.During his 15-year relationship withJP Morgan, Epstein opened at least 134 accounts, processed over $1bn in transactions, and brought in several lucrative clients, Warren’s letter said.And while JP Morgan had so far paid $290m (£217m) in settlements to Epstein’s victims, “Staley has so far avoided accountability in the United States,” the senator said.Warren has now called on the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to publicly announce the launch of an investigation into former and current banking executives who may have aided Epstein, by 7 November.She also asked for private confirmation that an investigation had been opened specifically into Staley’s conduct by 14 November. Wrongdoing could ultimately result in a fine and a potential ban from working in the US banking sector.“It is critical to send a message to the public and current bank employees that this type of egregious misconduct has no place in the American banking system,” Warren’s letter said.View image in fullscreenDemocrat senator Elizabeth Warren has said she hopes to tackle ‘egregious misconduct’ in America’s banking sector.Photograph: Anna Rose Layden/EPAIt would be another bruising development for Staley, who in June lost a legal attempt to overturn his lifetime ban from the UK financial sector imposed by UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in 2023, after he was found to have misled the watchdog over his relationship with the sex offender.The FCA’s original investigation, triggered by a cache of more than 1,200 emails between Staley and Epstein, concluded that the pair were“indeed close”and had a relationship that “went beyond one that was professional in nature”.Warren also called for investigations into other top executives that may have supported the late financier’s crimes. “Staley is not the only bank executive with concerning ties to Epstein. For example, according to Staley’s sworn deposition, he discussed Epstein with CEO Jamie Dimon on at least two occasions,” the letter stated.Dimon has previously denied Staley’s claim and stated that he does not recall knowing anything about Epstein until years after the firm effectively severed ties with the sex offender. JP Morgan declined to comment.“The Fed, OCC and FDIC should investigate any other current or former banking executives who engaged in similar conduct to determine whether their conduct satisfies the legal standards for a ban on working in the banking industry and civil monetary penalties,” Warren said.“Any banking executives who facilitated the crimes of one of the world’s most notorious sex criminals should be held to account,” Warren’s letter added.Donald Trump has come under fire for his own social ties to the sex offender, who was a longtime friend until they fell out in 2004. The president madereleasing the Epstein investigative filespart of his campaign platform, but has failed to do so. He has referred to the furore over the files as a Democratic “hoax”.The news of Warren’s letter cameas two new lawsuits were filed by an anonymous plaintiffagainst Bank of America and the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), alleging that banks illicitly enabled Epstein’s sex trafficking. BNY has said the claims “are meritless and we will vigorously defend against it”. Bank of America echoed those comments, saying: “We will vigorously defend ourselves in this matter.”The Guardian contacted Staley’s legal representative for comment.In June, after the loss of his legal challenge against the FCA, Staley said he was “disappointed” by the outcome but was “never dishonest”.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsBankingJes StaleyElizabeth WarrenJeffrey EpsteinJP MorgannewsShareReuse this content"

She opened the business next to a Haitian restaurant in 2023, having spotted a gap in the market forCaribbeanand Latin foods – the neighborhood’s Haitian population was booming at the time.But over the past year, she says her business, which includes an international money transfer kiosk, has taken a major hit.“About 80 to 90% of our customers were Haitians; now that’s down to about 60% over the past six months,” she says. “No more people are moving to Springfield.”Small US college towns reel amid Trump immigration crackdown: ‘They need international students’Read moreMercado’s experiences are being echoed around the city of 58,000 people that garnered international attention last year when Donald Trump falsely claimed during a presidential debate that immigrants were eating people’s pets.Until the end of last year, Springfield was something of a surprise economic juggernaut.A report fromthe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland found that it ranked second among all Ohio cities for job growth since the pandemic.New housing projects, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, are among the biggest investments the city has ever made.That growth was partly fueled by the availability of manufacturing and blue-collar jobs that were eagerly filled by the more than 15,000 Haitian immigrants who had moved to the city over the past eight years, fueling businesses such as Mercado’s.Local companies got cheap, reliable labor, while Haitian workers received stable income, health insurance and a safe place to live. Many bought homes and invested their hard-earned income into improving the city’s housing stock that, in turn, padded the city’s tax coffers. For the most part, it was a win for all involved.But since then, the city’s economic fortunes have spiraled.Springfield businesses, big and small, are struggling in the aftermath of thousands of Haitians fleeing the town after the Trump administration’s termination of the humanitarian parole program for citizens of several countries, including Haiti, in June. On top of that, the government has ended temporary protected status, affecting the immigration status of more than half a million Haitians, which comes into effect on or before 5 February 2026.The Department of Homeland Security says conditions in Haiti have improved to allow US-based Haitians to return. However, violence prompted Haiti’s government in August to issue a state of emergency in parts of the country. The US Department of Statecurrently hasa level four “do not travel” advisory for Haiti.The consequences of these moves are being keenly felt in places such as Springfield.Since January, when the Trump administration took office, the percentage of manufacturing jobs in Springfield has beenfalling by double digitsas the civilian labor force also declines, something thought to be partly fueled by Haitians leaving the city due to fear of the administration’s anti-immigrant rhetoric.At Topre America, an automotive parts manufacturing company north-east of downtown Springfield, dozens of jobs that Haitians had once filled – forklift drivers, supervisors and stackers –have remained unfilledon the company’s employment webpage for months.Unemployment has ticked up slightly in the city – but still at a rate twice the state’s increase – in the 12 months since Trump’s racist comments.In a city where income tax makes up the majority of municipal funding, the loss of thousands of Haitian workers means fewer dollars for public services for all residents.“Our tax revenue, which is the backbone of our general fund, has flattened. After years of strong growth post-pandemic, the rebound is behind us,” Springfield’s city finance director, Katie Eviston,reportedat a city commission public meeting in June.Previous estimates had tracked that 2025 would see a 3.5% increase in income tax funds for the city. By June, that anticipated growth, however, had been wiped out in what Eviston said was a “level of decline [that] hasn’t occurred since the early days of the Covid shutdown”.Moreover, the city faces a worrying$4.25m financial holedue to the cancellation of a host of Biden-era programs and grants by the Trump administration.Springfield and its businesses aren’t alone in dealing with the fallout of the Trump administration’s immigration policies.Experts say it has consequences for businesses and companies right across the country. In June, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM)said thatending visas for international workers would leave 85,000 jobs unfilled.“Stripping [immigrants’] ability to work and threatening them with removal is not just a human cost; it is an economic one,” an AEM executivewrotein the Washington Examiner.Small communities in Indiana,Pennsylvaniaand elsewhere in Ohio that enjoyed an economic rebound in the aftermath of the pandemic are also experiencing depressed purchasing power due to White House-fueled job cuts.“Trump’s immigration policy slowed inflows. Suddenly, more firms have seen their immigrant worker supplies decline, forcing them to pay more to attract native workers, thereby placing upward pressure on inflation,” says Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Metro thinktank.“This, combined with Trump’s tariffs, has created serious upward price pressure along with the rise in labor costs – not a great combination for many US producers in the heartland.”Without the ability to work, many Haitians are leaving the US.According to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada,more than 26,000 Haitianssought asylum there in the first six months of 2025, many of whom are thought to havefled the US. By contrast, just 21,756 claims were made for all of 2024.Many Haitians in Springfield, however, arestuck in place, without jobs and with bills mounting up.“A lot of people have work problems – we have lost half our customers,” says Youdins Solon, who helps out at his family’s Keket Bongou Caribbean restaurant in south-east Springfield. Solon moved to Springfield last March, having lived in Florida for 18 months prior. But by the summer, he lost his job at a local Amazon distribution center when his immigration status was revoked. He says he is one of hundreds who have been laid off.“I’m lucky because I have my family here, but for a lot of people, they moved [out of Springfield] because they were afraid of the situation.”But for those who have staked their businesses on a thriving immigrant community in Springfield, it’s not easy to pack up and leave.“We order Haitian food from companies in Florida and Chicago every two weeks,” says Mercado, “but now, that’s greatly reduced.”Explore more on these topicsOhioUS immigrationHaitiTrump administrationEconomic policyUS politicsCaribbeanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Controversy over his training effortand a family conflictwith the team’s then-coach overshadowed his performances.AWorld Cupon US soil next year is a guiding light for the 22-year-old Reyna to revive a career dogged by injuries.Reyna says he’d now handle the 2022 incident differently “in certain ways” and his actions stemmed from frustration, but the dispute wasn’t “completely” his fault or that of his family.Speaking to the Associated Press at his new clubBorussia Mönchengladbachlast week, the attacking midfielder said he wants to use this season to convince US coach Mauricio Pochettino he still belongs.The USMNT, at long last and just in time, have tangible momentum before World Cup 2026Read more“I do obviously think about [the World Cup] pretty often as it’s somewhere where I need and want to be,” he said. “But I try to focus daily here, stay present here, work here every day, and hopefully believe everything will fall into place.”In Qatar in 2022, Reyna played only twice off the bench. Then-US coach Gregg Berhalter said after the tournament that an unnamed player, later identified as Reyna, was nearly sent home for a lack of effort in training.Reyna’s parents – Claudio and Danielle Reyna, both former national team players – lobbied the US Soccer Federation (USSF) for more playing time for Gio and contacted the USSF about a three-decades-old domestic violence allegation involving Berhalter and the woman who later became his wife – Danielle’s former college roommate.Asked if he’d do things differently if he had that chance again, Reyna told the AP: “Maybe in certain ways, but I’m not just going to sort of sit here and take all the blame for something that was made out to be completely my fault, which I believe it wasn’t, and also my family’s, too.”Reyna added the tensions “stemmed from” unhappiness with his game time.“At the end of the day, I was just upset that, you know, I wasn’t really playing. I was playing at Dortmund. I thought that I wanted to play at the World Cup and ultimately in the end, I didn’t do that, and that’s really what it stemmed from,” he said.Soccer parents gone wild: behind the stunning Reyna-Berhalter family feudRead more“I guess the frustration and the disappointment was just wanting to play and help my country. It’s so far removed now and so far in the past, I don’t even really want to talk about it any more.”Reyna is hoping Gladbach is his springboard back to the national team. Joining up there with his friend and US teammate Joe Scally was “the cherry on top.”A litany of injuries have stopped Reyna building momentum. His last three years at Dortmund saw him used as an impact substitute, loaned to Nottingham Forest, then benched for much of last season.The last time Reyna played 90 minutes in a league game was in March 2022 and he’s played once for the US since the 2024 Copa América.

It didn’t work out.”Reyna has had at least eight distinct injuries in the last five years. Most were soft tissue and muscle problems, with one leg fracture.Fitness issues have also limited his role with Bundesliga struggler Gladbach.“I’ve learned a lot about my body,” said Reyna. That means treating fitness work as more of a dialogue with the club’s athletic coaches and finding new ways to deal with the mental strain of yet another setback.“The first 24 to 48 hours are always going to suck. There’s no way round that,” he said. “What I’ve learned now is, after those one or two days where [there’s] obviously a lot of pain, a lot of downtime, down energy, you just have to get on with it. You have to kick on, you have to really just attack the rehab.”Reyna says he’s taking on more responsibility on and off the field as he tries to fulfil his potential as a player.“I would love to look back in the future and say that it was a pivotal year, few years here,” he said. “But talking is not really the way. You have to turn the talking into action.”Explore more on these topicsUSAUS sportsBorussia MönchengladbachBundesligaWorld CupnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s also a jarring state of affairs for many struggling fansAndrew LawrenceTue 28 Oct 2025 09.46 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 10.18 EDTShareAt a time when millions are at risk ofgoing hungryand losing their medical insurance benefits, struggling Americans can at least take solace in knowing that the nation’s college football coaches are doing just fine – especially Brian Kelly.On Sunday LSUrelievedKelly of his coaching duties after his Tigers suffered a resounding home loss to Texas A&M that dropped them out of the AP’s ranking of college football’s top 25 teams. (This is after LSU was ranked as high as third in September and firmly in the top 10 for most of the season.) Kelly, who was in the fourth year of a decade-long contract worth about $100m, will be going home with more than just a box full of purple and gold office trinkets.While the terms of Kelly’s departure have yet to be resolved, his contract puts the school on the hook for 90% of his deal balance if he’s fired for cause – a final tab that comes to around$54m. The contract does include a “duty to mitigate clause” that asks him to pursue another job so that LSU won’t owe him quite so much money. But another program would have to be fairly desperate to hire him, considering he went 31-14 with one college football playoff appearance at LSU, a school less than six years removed fromwinning a national title. The more likely scenario is that LSU will continue making $800,000 monthly payments to Kelly through 2031 while the coach, who turned 64 on Saturday, rides comfortably into retirement. It’s nice work if you can get it, especially in this economy.‘Drugs quieted my inner loathing’: Todd Marinovich on the NFL, addiction and the power of artRead moreIn the upside-down world of college athletics, thefiredfootball coach is king. Two weeks before Kelly was terminated, Penn Statefired James Franklin– a coach who is not only a year removed from leading the Nittany Lions to the College Football Playoff semi-finals, but was also instrumental in leading the program out from the aftermath of amonumental child sex abuse scandal; Penn State is paying Franklin $49m to be gone. The very next week Floridasevered ties with Billy Napier, the first full-time Gators coach in 76 years to finish his tenure with a losing record (22-23); Florida is paying him $21m after his departure, and half that amount is dueon 19 November. When the Gators hire Napier’s permanent replacement, it will mark their second time in seven years payingthreehead coaches concurrently. In fact LSU finds itself in that very spot as it begins paying out Kelly severance while winding down the school’s$17m buyout obligationto Kelly’s predecessor, Ed Orgeron.The college football season is barely past midpoint, and already 10 coaches have been fired with schools owing$169m in buyouts, including six in the elite Power 4 conferences. Those numbers don’t include Stanford’s Troy Taylor (who was firedwithout causeand was able to keep his buyout terms confidential thanks to the university being a private institution) or dead men walking like Wisconsin’s Luke Fickell or Florida State’s Mike Norvell – who could well find themselves out of work by Thanksgiving. Back in the day, there was no worse scenario than having to fire a college coach. It was the hard decision that had to be made to turn around losing cultures or reset from scandal. Coaches packed up their families and left town, and administrators risked losing their jobs over one bad hire, too. The humiliation ritual was all-encompassing, and the stench lingered.However in the last few years, as college athletics has evolved from a bastion of amateurism run by a cartel into a freer marketplace that favors star players, a private equity mindset has taken hold among sports benefactors who fuel blockbuster programs. There is a greater openness to treating coaches like the rainmaking execs they are to their hundred-million dollar athletic departments. Two years ago it seemed outrageous that Texas A&M would pay Jimbo Fishera record $77mafterfiring him. But Georgia would owe Kirby Smart$105mif they fired himright now, not that it would after making him college football’s highest-paid coach last spring. Well, not that it wouldtheoretically.And even though the money used to pay these buyouts mostly comes out of TV deals and sponsorships that athletic departments rake in, it’s not hard to imagine the scholarships that could be awarded or thewomen’s and Olympic sports programsthat could be reinstated with all that cash. These very same institutions claim financial hardship when athletes demand an equitable share of the revenues they help produce – and blame the buyout spending spree on the donors paying that freight. “[Donors] think they have a voice, and they’re just like a bunch of fans,” the respected former coach Nick Sabansaid last week. “When they get frustrated and disappointed, they put pressure on the [athletic directors] to take action, and it’s the way of the world.”View image in fullscreenJames Franklin lost his job despite a playoff run last season.Photograph: Isaiah Vazquez/Getty ImagesBut ultimately it’s Kelly who makes the more convenient villain among media and fans for a college coaching buyout craze run amok. Although respected for his strategic mind and knack for turning around wayward programs, Kelly breaks from the avuncular college coach stereotype. He doesn’t simply lack Orgeron’s rascal energy or the folksy charm of Les Miles, to name another LSU predecessor; he appears to be a repellant personality. San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh remembers starting out on Kelly’s Central Michigan coaching staff alongside Matt LaFleur, now the Green Bay Packers head coach, in the early-2000s. Kelly invited them to a social event at his house –but only so they could park cars and shovel snow, in a scene ripped from Coming to America. “We decided that when we’re in that position, we’re never going to treat people the way we got treated,” Saleh toldESPN.After LSU hired him in December 2021, Kelly, a proper Irish-Catholic Bay Stater, introduced himself to a stunned Tigers basketball crowd ina horrific southern accentthat was widely mocked online. At Notre Dame, which was rehabilitated under Kelly in the 2010s, he complained about theschool’s lofty academic standardsundercutting his ability to build rosters. At LSU, he moaned about having to pay playersunder the current NIL systemwhile committing more than$10m a yearto assistant coaches he also couldn’t gel with – contracts that the school will also have to buy out. One of Kelly’s more egregious errors was firing Tommy Moffitt, the beloved strength coach behind LSU’s last three national titles, and setting him up forsweet revenge at Texas A&M– who Moffitt has helped mold into the country’s third-best team, as Kelly saw for himself last Saturday. In the end it was Louisiana governor Jeff Landry – who makes around one-10th of Kelly’s state salary –calling for the coach’s jobthat forced the LSU board’s hand. Not long after getting pink-slipped, Kelly was spotted dining alone at a Mexican chain restaurant – as if finally getting around to celebrating that birthday of his, but with no actual friends to show up for him.On Monday, Washington state congressman Michael Baumgartner, a Republican,introduced a billtitled Correcting Opportunity and Accountability in Collegiate Hiring (or COACH) that would amend theHigher Education Act of 1965to cap the total annual compensation of any athletics department employee at no more than 10 times the institution’s annual in-state costs for a full-time undergraduate student – about $280,000 in LSU’s case. “There is no greater societal benefit to have a coach make $10m versus $200,000,” Baumgartnertold Sportico. But the odds of his proposal making it out of committee, as Sportico’s Daniel Libit rightly observed, “is slimmer than the chance of every FBS coach keeping their job for the rest of the season”.College football teams like to think of themselves as the “front porch” to their academic institutions. But lately it’s looking more like theWhite House’s proposed East Wing ballroom: a monstrous addition that threatens to overshadow everything else. With the average American already struggling to make ends meet, much less stump up for college football tickets, the idea of paying a coach millions of dollars to sit at home is as jarring as expecting LSU to run the table with interim coach Frank Wilson. The colleges and power conferences could curb some of the post-employment spending themselves by setting buyout cap conditions and making coaching contracts shorter with more performance-based terms. But it’s unlikely that much will change, especially in the current political climate, until the money dries up. At this rate the day may not be too far off.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsLouisianaUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Two innings later, Freeman hit the ball even harder, but not quite high enough as Varsho chased it down before it could reach the center field wall.

Leading off, Freeman hit a fastball from Blue Jays reliever Brendon Little for a walk-off home run, leaving Varsho to do nothing but dangle from the center field wall as Freeman rounded the bases with his arms hoisted. The Dodgers now lead the series 2-1 and are two wins away from retaining theWorld Series.On a night full of broken records, Freeman made sure that the Dodgers merely tied the one for longest World Series game ever played in terms of innings. It was the second-longest in terms of minutes played, at 6hr 39min (the record was set in another game featuring the Dodgers,against the Red Sox in 2018). Freeman also became the first player in baseball history to win two different World Series games with a walk-off home run after ending Game 1 of last year’s World Serieswith a grand slam.“To have it happen again a year later,” Freeman said, “It’s kind of amazing and crazy.”Freeman’s heroics complemented a historic and seemingly inconceivable statistical night fromShohei Ohtani, who became the first player to reach base nine times in a postseason game and the first player since 1906 to have four extra-base hits in a World Series game. Two of those hits were home runs, one of which tied the game in the seventh inning. After that second home run of the night, the Blue Jays walked him in five consecutive plate appearances: four of them intentionally and one on four pitches.“He’s a unicorn,” Freeman said of Ohtani after the game. “We’re still running out of words to describe a once-in-a-10-generational player.”View image in fullscreenClayton Kershaw, Shohei Ohtani and Max Muncy of the Los Angeles Dodgers celebrate on the field after Monday’s win.Photograph: Sean M Haffey/Getty ImagesOhtani, as he often does when asked about his greatness, deflected from his own accomplishments to emphasize the team’s victory.“What I accomplished today is in the context of this game,” Ohtani said through an interpreter, “and what matters the most is we flip the page and play the next game.”As local time crossed midnight, he added: “I want to go to sleep as soon as possible.”Ohtani’s seventh-inning home run would be the last run scored for nearly four hours before Freeman ended the game in the 18th. The subsequent 11 innings featured remarkable feats of offensive futility. It was the first time that both teams had at least 15 hits in a World Series game. But they managed just four hits in 26 at-bats with runners in scoring position and combined for 14 strikeouts in extra innings.The teams surpassed the prior record for number of men left on base: the Blue Jays left 19 on, while the Dodgers stranded 18. The record for a single team entering the night was 15. Between the 10th and 18th innings, the teams combined to leave 20 runners on base. Every position player on the Blue Jays had an at-bat in Monday night’s game and they broke the record with 67 at-bats in a World Series game.“It was one of the greatest World Series [games] of all time,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “I’m spent emotionally.”It was a historic battle of attritionthat caused Justin Bieber to leave the game earlyand will reshape how both teams approach the rest of the series. The Dodgers and Blue Jays used every available arm in their bullpen and combined to throw an astonishing 609 pitches. Blue Jays relief pitcher Eric Lauer recorded more outs (14) than his team’s starting pitcher, Max Scherzer (13). The winning pitcher – Will Klein – threw 72 pitches over four innings, more than Scherzer and far eclipsing his previous professional career high of 56. That outing came in 2021 when he was a member of the minor league Quad Cities River Bandits.“I looked around in the bullpen and my name was the only one still there,” Klein said with a laugh. “I was just going to go until I couldn’t.”Had Freeman not homered, the Dodgers were ready to turn to Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who was just two days removed from his 105-pitch complete game win in Game 2. Yamamoto had never thrown on short rest in hisMLBcareer, but was warming up before Freeman’s homer.The hitting struggles that both teams endured in the late innings masked a thrilling battle over the first nine. There weresix runners thrown out on the basesover the first 10 innings. Both teams had runners thrown out at third base and home plate and the Blue Jays scored a go-ahead run in the seventh after the ballricocheted off a TV crew memberholding a parabolic microphone. Clayton Kershaw, possibly making the final appearance of his decorated 18-year career, induced a key groundout after entering the game with the bases loaded and two outs in the 12th inning.“I don’t think we’re physically tired. I think you’re just mentally tired because you’re in it every pitch, and every pitch means something in the World Series and in the playoffs,” Freeman said after the game. “So I think we’re all emotionally and mentally drained.”The Blue Jays, meanwhile, were left to contemplate pushing the reigning champions to their limit, and still walking away with nothing to show for it. Their manager, John Schneider, denied it was a catastrophic blow, though.“It sucks that it’s late right now, we got to come back and do it again tomorrow, but these guys are going to be more than ready,” Schneider said. “The Dodgers didn’t win the World Series today – they won a game.”The two teams return to Dodger Stadium for Game 4 on Tuesday, when Ohtani will take the mound to start his first World Series game as a pitcher against former Cy Young Award winner Shane Bieber. Ohtani has struck out 19 hitters in 12 postseason innings and sports a 2.25 ERA over those two starts. He will start even though he was on base nine times and was receiving an IV after the game.“He’s spent. He was on base nine times tonight running the bases,” Roberts said after the game. “But, yeah, he’s taking the mound tomorrow. He’ll be ready.”Explore more on these topicsWorld SeriesLos Angeles DodgersToronto Blue JaysBaseballUS sportsMLBShohei OhtaninewsShareReuse this content"

The Bluebirds’ victory came as little of a shock, if anything their progress to the quarter‑finals should have been far easier.Yousef Salech put the League One side into a 13th-minute lead, but Cardiff missed numerous chances to finish off the derby before it began in earnest. Wrexham joined the tie in the second half; substitute Kieffer Moore equalised, but it was Will Fish who settled the match for the visitors.Wrexham v Cardiff City: Carabao Cup – liveRead more“Exhausting,” was the immediate reaction of Brian Barry-Murphy, the Cardiff head coach. “It was a tough game for us, but we played in the way we wanted to play from minute one and that’s what showed our character and our skill level throughout the course of the game. Very satisfying and immensely proud of the whole club.”Cardiff dominated from the start and every pass was booed by the home support, but it did not put them off. They had four shots on target in the opening 20 minutes, while the hosts floundered.“Our owner [Vincent Tan] is very demanding and he was really insistent on more shots and crosses – I hope we make him happy,” Barry-Murphy said.Wrexham were disjointed and being pushed back into their own defensive third for lengthy periods. Their spending means there is quality in this side and they almost took the lead on the counterattack, but Nathan Broadhead miscued his finish when in plenty of space in front of goal. It would not have been deserved.View image in fullscreenWrexham’s Kieffer Moore (centre) is congratulated by George Dobson after his equaliser shortly after coming on as a half-time substitute.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAThe opener came at the other end within a minute and it was certainly merited. Rubin Colwill had options on the edge of the penalty area, before deciding to pass to Omari Kellyman in space inside the area. The winger’s shot was superbly saved by Callum Burton, Wrexham’s third-choice goalkeeper, but Salech tapped in the rebound.The once lively atmosphere was limited to one small section of the ground, while the Wrexham supporters suffered and yawned.Burton produced a stunning save to keep out a thunderous Cian Ashford shot and Rubin Colwill rattled the bar with a free-kick. Placid Wrexham were not in the contest and lacked the ideas or desire to change the dynamic. The solitary positive for the home side being they were somehow only one goal behind at the break.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Within seven minutes Ryan Longman swung in a dangerous cross and the former Cardiff striker Moore rose highest, reigniting the atmosphere in the crowd noise in the process.Finally, there was an intensity to Wrexham’s play and it was Cardiff who were on the back foot, creating something akin to a cup tie. Ronan Kpakio was feeling the pressure, missing a simple chance to intercept a pass, allowing Longman to gain control and start the long run for goal, only to be pulled back on the halfway line. The majority wanted a red card, but yellow was the correct decision thanks to a covering defender.Joel Bagan swung a cross over everyone in the area from the left, except Fish waiting at the back post. The connection was perfect, proving too powerful for Burton. The goalkeeper should have done better considering the angle, but the defence will also wonder how they failed to clear the danger.“We were off the pace first half, that’s probably an understatement,” Parkinson said. “We did not close down with enough pressure or intent and that made it easy for them.”The scenes among the 1,200 Cardiff supporters at the end tested the foundations of the stand, as they moved one step closer to Wembley.

In his new book, he looks back at a complicated lifeRich TenorioTue 28 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 05.02 EDTShareMarcus Allen knew, and tried to help. So did Howie Long. But many of Todd Marinovich’s teammates on the Los Angeles Raiders of the early 1990s had no idea their young quarterback was using drugs.Marinovich had come to the Raiders from USC, where he had guided the Trojans to a Rose Bowl victory as a freshman. By that time, he had accumulated two nicknames: “Robo Quarterback,” after the legendarily demanding training regimen instilled by his father, former Raiders player and assistant coach Marv Marinovich, intended to foster excellence in athletes. The other nickname was far more unflattering: “Marijuana-vich,” for his pot-smoking, which became a taunt from opposing fans in high school. When Marinovich reached theNFL, it wasn’t just marijuana he was abusing.The old man and the mirror: Aaron Rodgers meets the quarterback he used to beRead more“I couldn’t lift my head after another bender with ecstasy, cocaine, and liquor,” he writes of one inauspicious morning in his new memoir,Marinovich: Outside the Lines in Football, Art, and Addiction. “My body felt like the Tin Man.”Who got him up in time for practice that day? It was “a bug-eyed Marcus Allen who impatiently examined his watch,” then “returned to his idling red-hot Lamborghini.”For a while, the rising star’s drug problem was a well-kept secret. Until it wasn’t, when a third unsuccessful urine test the next season, in 1992, landed Marinovich off the team.“I had been watching these guys my whole life – now I was their peer,” Marinovich says of Raiders teammates (and fellow ex-Trojans) Allen, Long, Ronnie Lott and Riki Ellison. “I did not want to let them down. However, I had things to do that I could not share with them.”Although he would have a brief career rebirth in the Arena Football League as an all-rookie team member, his once seemingly charmed life spiraled into further drug abuse and its consequences under the law: “I quieted my inner loathing with a range of drugs over the next three decades, including ecstasy, acid, cocaine, heroin, crack, and meth at deadly doses to disconnect from the misery inside,” he writes. The memoir is co-written with author Lizzy Wright, who sees it as far more than a sports biography.“It’s the type of story that has so much to it,” she says. “It’s so complex.” She cites Marinovich’s emotional awareness and his longtime passion for art – one of his paintings appears in the book.Wright’s husband, Steve, is a former NFL player himself. In fact, he was an offensive lineman who protected Marinovich on the Raiders. Lizzy Wright helped her husband write his memoir. It went so well that Steve Wright recommended her to Marinovich as a collaborator.Now the book writing is over, Marinovich says, “It’s almost like talking about another life.”In college, a dramatic USC win over Washington State prompted a phone call from then-President Ronald Reagan. Marinovich’s Raiders years were marked by R-rated, drug-fueled nights in LA. His youthfulness came to the fore when he started under center in a 1991 NFL playoff game – the first rookie to do so for the Silver and Black. During this period of his life, the quarterback partied with celebrities such as Flea and Charlie Sheen.“Thank God for Lizzy,” Marinovich says. “She did all the heavy lifting. She made it easy for me, [did] what a next-level teammate does for me: Help, assist you, bring the best out of you.”“Todd’s rise to fame is remarkable,” Wright says. “He was the best athlete coming out of high school in the country. A Rose Bowl victory as a freshman. The first sophomore in history to declare for the NFL draft. He had to have his own combine because he was too young. This is the Doogie Howser of football.”Yet, she adds, there was “so much pressure,” and “to need the drugs to survive that, it becomes that vicious cycle. How do you get out of this? How do you unravel it? It’s practically impossible.”Long after Marinovich’s comeback in the Arena Football League, he got another shot at football in 2017 at age 48 – first coaching quarterbacks and then suiting up at signal-caller to throw seven TDs in a semipro game. He let the game be billed as his first drug-free matchup in 33 years. In fact, he writes, he was still using: “The moment the drugs hit my system, I was fucked, losing another round in the dogfight to stay clean.”Throughout the book, Marinovich doesn’t spare the details. You’ll learn all about how he faked drug-test results in the NFL by using other players’ urine samples – and about the time he wore blackface while appearing as Jimi Hendrix one Halloween, for which he now expresses regret.That said, there are also sweet moments – including Marinovich’s love of art, which he says helped save him.His paintingsnow adorn the Raiders’ art gallery – yes, the Raiders have an art gallery – in their new home of Las Vegas.Marinovich laments squandering the patience of longtime Raiders owner Al Davis, who died in 2011. Seeking to atone, Marinovich sought out Davis’s son, current Raiders owner Mark Davis, at a Palm Springs restaurant. Mark Davis warmly welcomed Marinovich back into the Silver and Black alumni family, and put his celebrity portraits on display at Allegiant Stadium. The reader is treated to one image, of a cigarette-smoking Johnny Cash. Marinovich has also done portraits of Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra – and his old teammate Allen.Wright calls art one of the “outlets where you can almost be removed from yourself, and at peace. There’s a freeness that happens with art. I think it’s something interesting to touch on.”Art helped mend another, more personal relationship. In Marv Marinovich’s final years, as he battled Alzheimer’s, the once famously competitive father and his son bonded over artistic collaborations. Marinovich says his father did not quite recognize him once the disease set it, but was aware that they had a special partnership.“A lot of people do not know Marv was an enormously creative painter and sculptor,” Marinovich says. “We got to create together, two artists doing what we did. There was not a lot of talk, just a rhythm to it that was better, and he loved doing that with me … Who would have thought that art would really almost bring us to another level?”Other parts of the narrative were harder for Marinovich to discuss with Wright. That includes his multiple arrests over the years.“The last thing I want to do to start the day is talk about the arrests,” Marinovich says. “It’s embarrassing. I know it was not easy on my family.”In 2000, Marinovich was arrested for sexual assault – a district attorney later decided not to charge him, and Marinovich denies the allegation in his book. Years later, in 2016, he was arrested for drug possession while naked. Marinovich writes that the reason he was naked is because he was skinny-dipping in what he thought was his in-laws’ pool. It wasn’t.“From my perspective,” Wright says, “to write about the arrests, my perspective is just, be honest about everything. Some books try to minimize the bad, focus on the positive” – an approach that she calls “not real-life or honest.”Marinovich says he’s in a good place now. Based in Hawaii, he’s watching his own children grow up, while making the art that has been his anchor and speaking about the dangers of drugs in hopes of helping the next generation.“I’m trying to find a balance,” he says. “I’ve got to practice every day – practice doing the right thing, being honest, helping somebody else.”Explore more on these topicsNFLLas Vegas RaidersUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They also referenced ongoing negotiations over the tennis calendar and plans for a so-called Premium Tour.Sinner expressed frustration at the refusal of grand slam tournaments to discuss welfare benefits in particular, as well as repeating the players’ call for greater prize money.The players argue that the ratio of prize money to overall tournament income is too low at about 12% to 15% across the four grand slam tournaments, compared to 22% on the ATP and WTA tours, such as Indian Wells and the Italian Open, where male and female players earn the same prize money. At Wimbledon last year, the total prize pot of £50m was 12.3% of the Championships’ £406.5m revenue.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner said: ‘The grand slams generate most of the revenue in tennis, so we are asking for a fair contribution to support all players.’Photograph: Helmut Fohringer/APA/AFP/Getty Images“We had good conversations with the grand slams at Roland Garros and Wimbledon, so it was disappointing when they said they cannot act on our proposals until other issues are resolved,” Sinner told the Guardian.“Calendar and scheduling are important topics, but there is nothing stopping the slams from addressing player welfare benefits like pensions and healthcare right now.“The grand slams are the biggest events and generate most of the revenue in tennis, so we are asking for a fair contribution to support all players, and for prize money that better reflects what these tournaments earn. We want to work together with the slams to find solutions that are good for everyone in tennis.”The Guardian can also reveal details of the unsuccessful negotiations that did take place this summer, which has led to Sinner speaking out on behalf of his fellow professionals. Many of the ATP players who signed the letters, including Carlos Alcaraz who last month said that the players “are fighting to have something better” are expected to follow his lead at the Paris Masters this week.The dispute began in March when the top 10 players on both the men’s and women’s tours sent a letter to all the grand slam tournaments demanding a greater share of the revenue at the four events. The letter also outlined frustration that the grand slams do not contribute towards player welfare benefits such as pensions, healthcare and maternity pay, whereas the ATP and WTA tours pay a combined $80m (£60m) each year. It also raised grievances over the major championships’ failure to consult on significant scheduling changes, such as Sunday starts at the Australian and US Opens, which were introduced in 2024 and 2025 respectively.Initial talks between executives representing the grand slams and the players and their representative, Larry Scott, a former player who also served as chair and chief executive of the WTA, were held three days before the start of the French Open in May. The players were represented by Sinner, Casper Ruud and Alex de Minaur from the ATP tour, and Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff and Madison Keys from the WTA.Further meetings took place between Scott and the chief executives of the grand slam tournaments at Wimbledon in July, when the players were represented by Alexander Zverev and Belinda Bencic. Although cordial, there is understood to have been some frustration from the players at the refusal of the grand slams to share financial details they requested.The ATP and WTA tours are also understood to be unhappy at what they regard as a lack of transparency and open communication from the grand slams, despite a longstanding arrangement to cooperate over prize money.Both Wimbledon and the US Open share purse information with the ATP and WTA Tour executive teams before it is made public, including a breakdown of prize money per round for singles, doubles and qualifying tournaments, but are given no say over the total amount. In previous years, the tours have been asked for input regarding prize money allocations by round and are usually given around 48 hours to respond before the total prize money for each round of the competition is publicly announced.Wimbledon announced a 7% increase in prize money this yearfor a total a prize-money pool of £53m, but most of the uplift went to the four semi-finalists in the men’s and women’s singles, with the winners – Sinner and the women’s champion, Iga Swiatek – both receiving £3m. The increase for the rest of the main draw was 5% at a time when the UK inflation rate was 3.5% however, so the pay rise in real terms was limited.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A similar dialogue took place with the US Tennis Federation in August before the US Open, which offered the biggest purse in tennis history at £63.8m, with the same outcome.Last month, Gauff said of prize money breakdown at the grand slam tournaments: “I think it’s important for the whole ecosystem of the sport. We’re not talking about just raising the prize money for the champion, but trickling all the way down to qualies.“We kind of want them [the grand slam championships] to invest more in the tour as a whole, not only when it comes to prize money, but the wellbeing of players and just trickling that down, all the way down to the lower-ranked players as well. Our 200th best player, 300th best player are struggling to make ends meet.”Detailed proposals from the players for revised prize money were submitted to grand slam tournaments in August.The absence of a firm response disappointed players to such an extent that a second letter demanding change was sent the same month, which was also signed by the British No 1 Jack Draper, who was not in the world’s top 10 earlier in the year.The increasingly acrimonious dispute over prize money, pensions and healthcare benefits and a lack of consultation over the calendar has dominated the tennis season.A delegation of top players, including Sinner and Gauff, were involved in discussions with tournament executives at the French Open and Wimbledon this year. The players submitted proposals following those meetings as to how they could move forward in partnership with the grand slam events, who responded by citing the ongoing PTPA litigation as an obstacle to holding negotiations.The PTPA, which wasset up by Novak Djokovic four years ago, filed an antitrust lawsuit against the ATP Tour, the WTA Tour and the International Tennis Federation in March, accusing them of suppressing competition, manipulating prize money and imposing a restrictive ranking system on the players. Djokovic is a conspicuous absentee from the alliance of top players who have signed the letters sent to the grand slam tournaments.Explore more on these topicsTennisJannik SinnernewsShareReuse this content"

His touchdown pass to Travis Kelce was the 83rd of the tight end’s career, tying him with Priest Holmes for the Chiefs record. Another went to Rashee Rice, who caught nine passes for 93 yards in his second game back from a six-gameNFLsuspension.The old man and the mirror: Aaron Rodgers meets the quarterback he used to beRead moreIt all helped the Chiefs (5-3) win for the fourth time in five games and extend a streak of dominance over Washington. They have won nine straight in the series and 11 of 12 overall; the lone loss came way back in September 1983.“I think it just shows the growth we’ve had as a team,” Mahomes said. “Even though we didn’t start the way we wanted to on offense, it showed we can battle through adversity and play the brand of football we want to play.”Marcus Mariota had 213 yards passing with a touchdown and two interceptions for the Commanders (3-5), who fell to 1-4 away from home this season. Mariota started in place of Jayden Daniels, who hurt his hamstring in last week’s loss to Dallas.Terry McLaurin returned from a quad injury to catch three passes for 54 yards and the Commanders’ only touchdown of the night. Deebo Samuel also returned from a bruised heel, but after two early catches, he managed just one more the rest of the game.“It was a tale of two halves,” said McLaurin, adding that he would take his injury day by day this week. “We kind of left some things on the field in the first half that we feel we could have executed. The defense did a great job of getting us the ball back twice. We’ve got to capitalize on that. The second half, they executed a lot better than us.”Most of the first half was an exercise in poor execution by both offenses.The Commanders’ opening series ended when Mariota’s pass bounced off Samuel for an interception. The Chiefs’ ended when Mahomes was also picked off. Kansas City proceeded to stop Washington on fourth down, only for Mahomes to have a pass bounce off Kelce’s hands for his second interception – which the Commanders again failed to capitalize on when Mariota overthrew everyone on fourth-and-one deep in Kansas City territory.So far, there had been two picks by the Commanders, who had created three turnovers all season; two thrown by Mahomes, who had thrown just two previously; and two failed fourth-down conversions by a Washington offense desperate to get points.All told, five empty drives.Then, two very productive ones: Kansas City marched 72 yards for a touchdown, and the Commanders answered with a 66-yard drive that McLaurin finished with a TD reception that was first ruled incomplete but was overturned upon review.Then the Chiefs surged away from their opponents in the second half. They opened with a methodical 80-yard drive that Hunt finished with his second TD. Then, after quick punt by Washington, the 36-year-old Kelce capped a 75-yard drive with his record-tying touchdown reception.The clinching blow came midway through the fourth quarter, a 13-play, 94-yard drive by the Chiefs – 119 yards if you include all the penalties they had to overcome – that finally broke the Commanders. Rice finished it with an 18-yard touchdown reception after he had twice come up just shy of scoring earlier in the game.That made it five consecutive games in which Kansas City have scored at least 28 points and put this one well out of reach.Explore more on these topicsNFLWashington CommandersKansas City ChiefsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Debuts were handed to Lucia Kendall and Taylor Hinds, Beever‑Jones started on the left alongside Alessia Russo and Beth Mead, while the goalkeeper Hannah Hampton returned to the starting XI having shaken off her elbow issue.Kendall had been diplomatic at the start of this international window, the 21-year-old was “just here to learn as much as possible”, she said, expectations of minutes low. Yet, in her first start, following her first call-up, the Southampton academy graduate looked a natural fit in the middle alongside Keira Walsh and Ella Toone.“To be honest I was not really surprised with her performance,” Wiegman said. “Straight away you saw her understanding and reading of the game. She keeps things very simple. I just wanted her to go out and play and enjoy herself and I think that’s what she did.”Kendall’s fellow debutant Hinds was similarly impressive: pitted against Chelsea’s dynamic right-back Ellie Carpenter, she coped well.View image in fullscreenAlanna Kennedy thwarts Alessia Russo’s goalward charge – the Matildas midfielder was then shown a red card.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAEngland had promised a faster start in front of 26,544 fans at Pride Park and they delivered, the opening goal arriving in the 20th minute to end a run of four games in which they had conceded first. Cooney‑Cross played a short pass to Kennedy and the London City Lionesses defender was robbed of the ball by Russo, who stepped towards the edge of the box with just the goalkeeper to beat before Kennedy upended her. Kennedy was sent off and while the initial free-kick was powered low into the wall, Bronze was on hand to push it back to Beever-Jones who fired in.It was a deserved lead and a welcome one for the hosts. “They are a world-class side and started well even before the sending off,” the Australia head coach, Joe Montemurro, said.“We take it as a massive learning curve for us. I’m a bit frustrated we didn’t get a chance to affect any part of our gameplan. We didn’t start well, that’s the honest truth. We didn’t get any rhythm and then the game changed when we went down to 10 players.”Wiegman’s side extended their lead shortly before the break, Walsh’s defence-splitting pass found Toone and the Manchester United midfielder flicked it back towards an unmarked Bronze to guide in.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The decision to restore Kerr’s captaincy has proven controversial in Australia, despite being found not guilty of racially aggravated harassment of a police officer. Montemurro said: “We’ve made a decision internally for what we believe is the best for the group. I won’t make political decisions, it’s purely football.”View image in fullscreenConcern for Michelle Agyemang as the young substitute is stretchered off late on.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty ImagesThe injury to Agyemang then marred proceedings: the Brighton forward, on loan from Arsenal, was distraught after she went down off the ball before being taken down the tunnel on a stretcher. Beever-Jones needed to come off soon after with a dead leg, and with five changes already made the hosts played the remainder as a 10 v 10 affair.It was comfortable for England in the end, a penalty from Stanway sealing the 3-0 win after substitute Missy Bo Kearns was tripped in the box.The fluidity had been disrupted a little by the many changes and the lengthy injury stoppage, but the performance offered plenty from which to learn. Those things will be looked at in the coming days, but concern for Euro 2025 starlet Agyemang will dominate as teammates and fans alike wait for news regarding the extent of her injury.Explore more on these topicsFriendliesEngland women's football teamMatildasWomen's footballAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Marco Silva’s team are in a sticky spot, four consecutive defeats dragging them towards the Premier League’s bottom three, and making a meal out of reaching the quarter-finals of theCarabao Cupat Wycombe Wanderers’ expense was not exactly the required tonic before a vital home game against Wolves on Saturday.The positives for Fulham did not extend far beyond Josh King scoring his first senior goal. The 18‑year‑old midfielder cancelled out Cauley Woodrow’s early opener against his old side and the favourites went through 5-4 on penalties. Benjamin Lecomte saved from Ewan Henderson, Fred Onyedinma and Donnell McNeilly before Issa Diop’s emphatic spot-kick killed offWycombein sudden death.Will Fish chips in with vital goal for Cardiff after Wrexham fail to fire in derbyRead more“We aim really high in this competition,” Silva said. “It was an obligation to be in the next round. We have to keep working. The players have to be positive in this moment. Confidence is not something that we can buy. We need the fans with the team as well. They need to make the Cottage next Saturday a fortress. We need them to push us.”These are challenging times for Silva. Fulham’s manager grimaced when he was reminded about his main striker, Raul Jiménez, going off with a muscle injury in the second half. T and the worry remains thatFulhamdid not do enough in the transfer market last summer. The squad is light and the injury list is growing.At least they avoided an upset. There was no hint of complacency from Silva, who named a team with plenty of experience and quality, but Fulham’s confidence is fragile and there were only four minutes on the clock when diffident defending allowed a familiar face to catch them out.The blow came from Woodrow, who was unable to make much of an impression after joining Fulham for £440,000 in 2011. The 30-year-old forward, on loan at Wycombe from Luton, had time to line up a shot and he took advantage by rasping a firm drive past Lecomte from 20 yards.Fulham toiled during the first half but they had chances. Adama Traoré – occasionally effective, often infuriating – crossed from the right but Raul Jimenez headed straight at Will Norris. King danced into dangerous positions and Tom Cairney clipped a shot just wide. Timothy Castagne missed a simple chance.View image in fullscreenCauley Woodrow sparked early hopes for Wycombe after scoring in the fourth minute against Fulham.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersThe frustration grew in the away end. Traoré was given grief for ducking out of challenges and there were boos after Harrison Reed and Cairney were muscled off the ball in quick succession in midfield.Jeered off at half-time, Fulham had to improve. Hope flared at the start of the second half. Kevin stirred on the left. The 22-year-old Brazilian won a corner, and whipped it towards the near post and celebrated with King when the teenager scored with a flick reminiscent of Gianfranco Zola’s backheeled goal for Chelsea against Norwich in 2002.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m very pleased with him.”Ryan Sessegnon, thrown on at half-time, made a difference from left-back. King, who had a goal wrongly disallowed out against Chelsea in August, continued to scheme. Cairney and the increasingly menacing Kevin had shots tipped over as Fulham pushed for a second goal.Wycombe, 17th in League One, refused to roll over. Fulham lacked bite. Jiménez going off was not ideal given that Rodrigo Muniz is already missing in attack. King and Kevin missed late chances but it needed penalties to separate the teams.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupWycombeFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

By half-time, there was no doubt about the outcome and by full time it had become a glorified exhibition.Will Fish chips in with vital goal for Cardiff after Wrexham fail to fire in derbyRead moreBlundell Park has already been home to one monumental night under the lights this season whenManchester United were vanquishedin unforgettable fashion, with victory against Sheffield Wednesday in the last round taking Grimsby the furthest they have been in the competition for two decades.However, all fairytales eventually come to an end, and this one did here in emphatic fashion. Had the hosts taken one of the early chances that came their way, this might have panned out differently. But once Brentford settled they were far superior in almost every aspect, with Mathias Jensen’s wonderful long-range strike midway through the first half calming them down.Four minutes later the impressive Keane Lewis-Potter headed home and suddenly the noise and the momentum had disappeared from the hosts. It is to Brentford’s immense credit that they were able to do what others have failed to achieve so far this season and stunt a team who are promotion hopefuls under David Artell this season.View image in fullscreenJaze Kabia shows his disappointment after Keane Lewis-Potter doubles Brentford’s lead.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PABy the end, Brentford had scored three more and looked relatively comfortable throughout. It left Andrews in an understandably positive mood. “They were better than us in that early period but we’re good in the chaos,” he said. “I enjoyed seeing the players play. It was nice to see what that group is capable of and who we’re about.”It is now three successive wins in all competitions for Brentford, who are settling into a rhythm after an indifferent start to the season. They have also reached the quarter-finals of this competition for the second consecutive season, and will fancy any side they may be drawn against on Wednesday.Reiss Nelson, who looked sharp on his first start since joining on loan from Arsenal, made it 3-0 as half-time approached with a wonderful finish and it was perhaps Artell who best articulated the flow of Brentford’s play. “We had two great chances early on and if we take one of those they take a punch on the nose,” he said. “Instead, we took a punch on the nose, one in the ribs and then one down below to finish us off.”View image in fullscreenFábio Carvalho gets up after being brought down for a penalty to score Brentford’s fourth.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAGrimsby’s cup run was finished off nine minutes after the restart when Fábio Carvalho was brought down in the box, and he dusted himself off to send Christy Pym the wrong way and make it 4-0.What would have pleased Andrews most was the way his side kept the pressure on. The likes of Nelson and Lewis-Potter in particular will have done plenty to try and convince the Brentford head coach they can come into the fray in the Premier League from the start given their impressive showings here.Both sides rotated in the final half‑hour with the contest over. One of those Brentford substitutes, Nathan Collins, headed in a clever corner with 15 minutes left to bring up the Bees’ biggest win in the competition. To Grimsby’s credit they kept going until the very end, with a standing ovation from the stands for Artell’s men at full time. But this night belonged to only one side.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupGrimsbyBrentfordmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A corner is now awarded if a keeper fails to release the ball within eight seconds. That countdown is signalled by the referee with his fingers.The possibility of introducing a similar proposal for throw‑ins and goal‑kicks was discussed on Tuesday at a virtual meeting of Ifab’s football and technical advisory panels.There has been explosion in long throws in the Premier League this season, with a process that often involving lengthy preparations in the same manner as at an attacking free-kick, leading to a drop in the amount of in-play time, a key metric for the game’s administrators.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.According to Stats Perform, there were more than twice as many long throws in the Premier League in the opening weeks of this season, compared with last season as a whole, with an average of 3.44 per match compared with 1.52 in 2024-25. In the first 40 games of the season there was also a significant drop-off in in-play time, at 54 minutes and 21 seconds per match that is 133sec lower than last season.Among other amendments to the rules considered by the Ifab advisory panels was the possibility of extending the video assistant referee protocols to allow officials to intervene if they adjudge a second yellow card has been awarded incorrectly. At the moment, VARs adjudicate on goals, penalty kicks, cases of mistaken identity and the awarding of direct red cards.There was also an agreement to look further at the offside law, with officials asked to consider “whether the main objective should be to reduce marginal offside decisions in modern football to promote more attacking play”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Long throw-ins and corners are becoming increasingly important in the­Premier League. Pulis used them to his ­advantage during his Stoke ­tenure in the late-2000s, helping the side defy the odds in the top flight.“I remember a long time ago with Sean Dyche, Burnley were an incredible threat in the long balls, second balls,” Guardiola said. “Dyche is one of the best by far doing these kind of aspects. It’s not new, he did it before. Or Sam Allardyce. Or I remember when I was not here, Stoke City.“Do you remember Stoke City when they made the throws? It happened in that time. Now it’s just more and more teams doing that but then maybe Stoke was the exception. I remember when I was at Barcelona and Bayern Munich, Arsène Wenger talked about going to play at Stoke City but now it happens a lot of times.“Every manager does what they believe. I’m focused on that. I want to score from free-kicks and corners – I’m not naive, I want it – but I spend my time on what we have to do to play better, attack better and create chances, to score goals. Defensively you have to be more aggressive.“All the aspects of the game I see. Of course I pay attention but I know I’m not the manager to try to … It’s what I’ve done all my career.”Guardiola is ready to rotate his squad to deal with the hectic schedule. The 18-year-old creative ­midfielder Divine Mukasa will join the first-team squad for the Swansea game and James Trafford will return in goal but Rodri remains unavailable.

Instead, the lesser‑spotted Dermot Desmond broke cover to lacerate Rodgers. The attack felt personal and spiteful. This proved a sad and unseemly conclusion to Rodgers’s second spell in Glasgow. So much so, in fact, that the third most successful manager in Celtic’s history cannot now show his face at the stadium. Desmond appears to be a bad enemy to choose.Martin O’Neill rules out long Celtic stay as Kieran McKenna emerges as candidateRead moreDesmond’s ferocious sentiment shone a light on recent months inside Celtic Park. The environment was toxic. It does not explain why a manager accused of being “self‑serving” and guilty of a breach of trust was simply not removed from office months ago. Desmond’s astonishing words turned heads but they also raise questions. Were Rodgers as egotistical as Desmond portrays, he would have left Celtic immediately after the summer’s botched transfer window. Rodgers could have secured martyrdom with supporters. He instead limped on, with Celtic eight points behind a Hearts team who were well short of their best whenseeing off Rodgers and coin Edinburgh on Sunday.Desmond blames Rodgers for “fuelling” supporter protest towards the board which has formed a regular backdrop to this ragged campaign. “Some of the abuse directed at them, and at their families, has been entirely unwarranted and unacceptable,” Desmond said. The 75-year-old is correct to condemn such behaviour, but plenty of theCelticdisquiet has been articulated in sensible and appropriate style. Desmond’s assassination of Rodgers is unlikely to placate dissenters. “It’s normally the manager that goes when that starts to be sung,” Rodgers said amid cries of “sack the board” in late August. He was mocked at the time; he was right.Those directors have no desire to alter the way Celtic are run, essentially because they think such a switch is unnecessary. “Celtic’s structure – where the manager oversees football, the chief executive manages operations, and the board provides oversight – has served the club with great success for more than two decades,” Desmond said. “What has failed recently was not due to our structure or model, but to one individual’s desire for self‑preservation at the expense of others.”It is worth remembering that Celtic’s previous chief executive lasted two months. Non‑executive directors serve for years, if not decades. Desmond owns just over 30% of Celtic; the Monday night bulletin was from a man with total control.The success to which Desmond refers is perfectly fair in domestic context. There have been glimmers of light in Europe –including last season– but Celtic’s regular shortcomings there undermine his point. Those struggles span various managers;Kairat Almaty saw off Celticin Champions League qualifying two months ago, just as Bodø/Glimt, Ferencvaros, Cluj, AEK Athens, Maribor and Malmö have done stretching back to 2014. Bodø/Glimt, Pafos, Slavia Prague and Union St-Gilloise are in the Champions League this season.View image in fullscreenDermot Desmond has pulled no punches in his statement which was released very shortly after Brendan Rodgers’ exit was announced.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PACeltic portray themselves as a major club and in many respects they are. At Rodgers’s final European game, thewin against Sturm Graz last week, he completed media duties in the typical domain of a marquee in the car park. Celtic fans will not care how the press are treated – in fact many will delight in the provision of spartan facilities – but this emphasises a broader sense of the small-time.The problem with criticising Rodgers – as plenty were doing even before his resignation – is that none of this could have formed part of his plan. He hardly wanted this second spell to end so sourly or there was no reason to return while ignoring more lucrative opportunities. Third-season syndrome does not adequately explain why a team that scared Bayern Munich in February but had visibly run out of gas by the time of theScottish Cup final defeat by Aberdeenin May was not properly rejuvenated.Celtic’s title was confirmed with weeks, if not months to spare. Their Champions League qualifying position was known. Rodgers’s frustration over a lack of attacking reinforcement, not only in the summer but January, was understandable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Were Kenny playing for Falkirk, there would be no clamour for Celtic to sign him.Celtic’s squad has regressed; it would be nonsensical to believe this appealed in any way to Rodgers. Jahmai Simpson-Pusey, Shin Yamada and Hayato Inamura – all brought in during the summer window – have barely been seen. Daizen Maeda was clearly affected after a move to the Bundesliga collapsed in essence because Celtic had no replacement. Kelechi Iheanacho, who quickly became the go-to No 9, arrived on a free on 2 September.It would be inaccurate to portray Rodgers as blameless. Celtic had the resources to beat Kairat, albeit Champions League involvement was likely to bring embarrassment. The manager’s pointed assessment of recruitment would inevitably feed through to his dressing room. Players bought for decent fees – Auston Trusty, Arne Engels, Paulo Bernardo – have failed to deliver. Rodgers was, though, unquestionably Celtic’s most talented football operator, a matter proven by a substantial body of work. His desire to drive the club forward was beyond question.It became increasingly apparent Rodgers would not see out this season. There was mutual disillusionment between him and his paymasters. There were, however, other ways to handle this: by stating manager and club were no longer aligned in their thoughts or that because Rodgers would leave in the summer anyway, an immediate parting of ways made more sense. Instead, there is acrimony. Rodgers’s side of the story, when presented, will be fascinating.O’Neill is a young 73 and idolised by fans. He retains the man-management skills to improve Celtic. He will believe privately that he can do this job for longer than an interim basis and has huge motivation to prove that after a six-year hiatus from management. Nonetheless, this is an underwhelming squad playing in front of a disgruntled audience. It is also a club that not for the first time see method in going back to the future. Lingering problems way beyond Rodgers remain. Desmond’s polemic does not deflect from that.Explore more on these topicsCelticBrendan RodgersScottish PremiershipanalysisShareReuse this content"

The teams meet again at Anfield on Wednesday when Slot faces a dilemma over the extent of his rotation, given injuries and recent results.Kenny Dalglish review – Liverpool’s everyman football hero who took the city’s woes on his shouldersRead moreThe head coach conceded after thelatest defeat at Brentfordon Saturday that Liverpool “haven’t found an answer yet” to the style of play they are encountering regularly. That includes low blocks, set pieces and long balls, but Chiesa insists the Premier League champions will be equipped to handle that approach in the fourth-round tie.“We have players that are world class and that can be put in any situation and will perform, so I don’t see any problem,” theLiverpoolforward said.“If Crystal Palace wants to play long ball and long throw-ins they are more than welcome to do so, because we’re going to answer them with high intensity and winning duels, and trying to win. I don’t know if you say this in English but [in Italy] we say: ‘Winning brings winning.’ So we want to win tomorrow. That’s it.”Liverpool were top with a 100% record when they visited Oliver Glasner’s team on 27 September but since then they have not collected a Premier League point. Chiesa admitted that the task of assimilating several new players is not the only issue with the side.“It’s many reasons and there’s not just one thing,” he said. “We’re not winning. At the beginning of the season we were winning and no one was questioning this and that. Unfortunately it’s not [a good time] but I always think positive and I hope we’re going to bounce back. We have the quality and the players to do so and we have a fantastic manager so I don’t see any trouble. I hope there’s not going to be any trouble in the future.”The Italy international revealed the Liverpool dressing room was silent after the 3-2 defeat at Brentford that has left them trailing the leaders, Arsenal, by seven points. “No one was speaking,” he said. “Because afterwards everyone knows.

His most recent first‑team involvement was as a substitute at Port Vale in the Carabao Cup on 24 September. As with the carefulmanagement of Ethan Nwaneri, who may also play his part at the Emirates Stadium against Brighton, Arsenal have mapped out Dowman’s development. He was an unused substitute last week in the Champions League defeat of Athletic Bilbao.With Arsenal clear and rivals stumbling, is the Premier League title race over?Read moreArteta said: “I am calm over it because what we have decided for him for the first few months is happening. When we have to give him games, whether it is in the Youth Cup or with the under-21s or with us, he has that. He has a lot of exposure in training with us, too.“A lot of new things are happening to him with the national team, playing with two different age groups, and with us, and then preparing games with another team. It is a lot. We have to manage that. He will play minutes with us for sure and when he has the chance to do that he needs to take it.”Dowman signed scholarship terms withArsenallast week, with a professional contract due to be finalised for his 17th birthday. He joined as a five‑year‑old and the hope is that he will stay for the long term. “That’s what we all want,” Arteta said. “I think what he wants as well. After that it is more for [the sporting director] Andrea [Berta] and the club. But the feeling that I have is that genuinely he loves it here. He is a huge Arsenal supporter and his family are really happy with the way things are developing around him as well. Hopefully for many years he will be with us.”Dowman, having missed Arsenal under-21’s weekend loss to Chelsea, seems poised for involvement. Arteta said: “If we looked at his passport every day we would never play him, simple as that. So it is finding a balance, an understanding, especially the load, the things that are changing in his life, and making sure he can cope with that. So far, he has done that.”There are vacancies in Arsenal’s attack, as Arteta said: “In the front line, that is where we have more difficulties. Gabby Jesus out, Kai [Havertz] out, [Gabriel] Martinelli and [Noni] Madueke out. We have to be more careful as we don’t have many options.”Of Martinelli’s injury, Arteta said: “We are going to have to do a few more tests.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We don’t know the extent of it yet, she needs to be assessed, but I’m not feeling very positive.”The young forward, who was seen leaving the ground on crutches, was substituted 18 minutes after coming on in place of Arsenal’s Alessia Russo.“It is never nice when anyone comes off a stretcher, let alone a teammate,” her fellow forward Aggie Beever-Jones told ITV. “I don’t know what she has done but I will be praying she will be OK.”Agyemang scored 41 seconds into her England debut in a3-2 loss to Belgiumin April, two days after being called up to replace injured Russo.

So big for me,” said Norrie, who becomes the fifth British man in history to defeat a world No 1. “Coming back from injury last year, I lost in the first round of qualies here. I just tried to enjoy my tennis in the second half of the year. To get a win like this, it’s the biggest win of my career, my first win over the world No 1 and probably the most confident player in the world right now.”Jannik Sinner calls out grand slams for delaying welfare and prize money talksRead moreNorrie, ranked No 31, has also ended Alcaraz’s supreme run of nine consecutive finals and 17 consecutive Masters 1000 wins, the best series of results in the Spaniard’s young career.He appeared to be moving confidently towards victory early on as he eased through the opening set against the British No 2. However, Norrie gradually worked himself into the match by serving with greater precision and dragging the Spaniard into prolonged, physical rallies. His relentless shot tolerance and consistency gradually left its mark.For much of the contest, Alcaraz served well but he struggled badly to find his timing off his groundstrokes. The 22-year-old looked particularly uncomfortable striking his forehand, the best shot in the world for much of this year, haemorrhaging 29 forehand unforced errors and a total of 54 unforced errors. Across the net, Norrie offered Alcaraz so few mistakes, maintaining his consistency, physicality and depth throughout while serving efficiently and choosing his moments to force himself inside the baseline and attack well.In the tense final games, Norrie brilliantly maintained his composure to close out the best player in the world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That kind of versatility is really important to us. I’m not saying we’re training all those combinations for this Saturday but these are the things we have which allow us to go 6-2 [on the bench].“We’re training [our] readiness to adapt to things. Henry Pollock is a back-row forward, but it’s one of the combinations I’m looking at for the future. I think there will be a time where I’ll consider starting Ben Earl at centre, especially with all the quality back‑row forwards we’ve got.”It reflects further Borthwick’s desire to uncork England’s full attacking potential, glimpsed in patches this year but not always consistently realised against top‑level opposition despite a seven‑game unbeaten run for his side. It may well be, with George Ford picked at fly-half, that England will also aim to kick high and often but the head coach also insists he wants his side to create problems with ball in hand.Quick GuideEngland team to face Australia – in fullShowEngland (v Australia): Freddie Steward (Leicester, 38 caps); Tom Roebuck (Sale, 6 caps), Tommy Freeman (Northampton, 20 caps), Fraser Dingwall (Northampton, 4 caps), Immanuel Feyi-Waboso (Exeter, 9 caps); George Ford (Sale, 102 caps), Alex Mitchell (Northampton, 23 caps); Fin Baxter (Harlequins, 14 caps), Jamie George (Saracens, 102 caps), Joe Heyes (Leicester, 14 caps), Maro Itoje (Saracens, 93 caps, captain), Ollie Chessum (Leicester, 28 caps), Guy Pepper (Bath, 3 caps), Sam Underhill (Bath, 42 caps), Ben Earl (Saracens, 42 caps)Replacements: Luke Cowan-Dickie (Sale, 49 caps), Ellis Genge (Bristol, 71 caps), Will Stuart (Bath, 50 caps), Alex Coles (Northampton, 10 caps), Tom Curry (Sale, 61 caps), Henry Pollock (Northampton, 1 cap), Ben Spencer (Bath, 10 caps), Fin Smith (Northampton , 11 caps).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I want them to play in a way that is fast and aggressive with the ball,” Borthwick said.“It suits the strengths we have. The second challenge is how hard this team runs and the physical intensity it brings. That is really important to us. It’s not a team that has huge size, it’s a team that can run. I’m now seeing a team that is better conditioned and a team that can run harder.”Borthwick did concede that there were “some disappointed players” and several “really narrow calls”, not least at No 10 where Ford has leapfrogged two Lions fly-halves. Lawrence has just returned from long-term injury while prominent Lions such as Tom Curry have only recently returned to full fitness and may also be being managed with the All Blacks Test in mind.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThere is also the reality that England do not want to fade in the final stages of games, as happened when Australia stole a dramaticlast-gasp winin London a year ago. With limited training time available – “They have had four months together, we’ve got four sessions,” Borthwick said – it also makes some sense to pick an all-Northampton midfield pairing and not to overcomplicate the England gameplan.The head coach is also hoping some of the work done in tougher times last year will come to fruition this autumn. “Somebody talked to me about coaching the other day, and said: ‘Sometimes you’re like the gardener. What you’ve got to do is plant the seeds, and then you’ve got to take care of them.’ Sometimes it can take a long time for things to really come through and reap all the rewards.”Australia will clearly have other ideas and in training England have employed the aerial skills of their young prodigy Noah Caluori to replicate the challenge of the high-flying Wallaby Joseph Suaalii. “Suaalii’s kick-off work last year was very good and it has been a focus for us,” Borthwick said.“Stopping him winning the ball is a challenging thing to do and Noah has been challenging the team in the air. Australia have a contestable kicking game and will send up lots of box-kicks. We will be expecting that this weekend.”Borthwick, though, sounds as upbeat about his own team’s development as at any point in his tenure. “I think the expectations of each other have now risen. We can’t wait for this autumn series, to be back in front of our supporters and back together as a group. We can’t wait to rip into it.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSteve BorthwickAustralia rugby union teamAutumn Nations SeriesRugby unionAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The players were so jet-lagged they barely knew what day it was but they loved the experienceByGavin WillacyTue 28 Oct 2025 09.30 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 16.33 EDTShareIt’s 6.30pm on Sunday and LA Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is speaking to reporters in an unpleasant-smelling makeshift press room in Wembley Stadium when he is interrupted by a booming voice from behind a curtain. It’s teammate Davante Adams shouting “Whose house?” in delight after his three touchdowns in the romp overJacksonville Jaguars.Adams knows what it means to score a hat-trick at Wembley but he is less certain about what day it is. “I feel like I’m connected to the country and the people now,” he says. With the game kicking off at 6.30am back home on the west coast, the Rams had taken the lead before most of their fans had settled on the sofa with their morning coffee. Adams and his teammates will soon be heading 5,400 miles home – just 36 hours after arriving. Welcome to the International Series.It was a fleeting visit for Sean McVay’s team. They arrived in London on Saturday morning and left soon after the game on Sunday, choosing not to do any media or open practice, barely having time to unpack their bags. Some wardrobes at their hotelmust have gone unopened.View image in fullscreenPlayers pray after the Minnesota Vikings v Cleveland Browns game in Tottenham.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PASo, was Stafford jet-lagged when he threw his five touchdowns? “Ask me tomorrow,” he says with a smile. “It was an interesting 24-48 hours, that’s for sure. We slept on the flight, treated it like a red-eye and in the first two quarters thought: ‘This is great.’ It’ll be a wild one flying back to LA tonight. It’s a blast.”How did McVay cope with the transatlantic travel? “It’s across different time zones but there was no point wasting mental energy on that,” he says. “We just had to be ready at kick-off. The people behind the scenes deserve enormous credit for picking up the whole operation and taking it on a nine-day trip. We’ll have a fun, long flight home.” As the effervescent coach cracked jokes with the Rams beat writers, his head of comms looked as if he might fall asleep standing up.None of the six teams that played in London this month stayed for long. The Jaguars andMinnesota Vikingsflew on Tuesday night, giving themselves the chance to train in London for three days. The Cleveland Browns arrived on a Thursday and “got the blood flowing” with a short session on Friday. The series gives NFL players a brief taste of global travel. “Other sports such as baseball get used to doing it, but it’s new for us,” said Adams after his Wembley heroics. “I went to sleep at 10.30pm and woke up at 4am and lay in bed for five hours and couldn’t get back to sleep. I got to say goodnight to my kids, though. It was a weird, low energy.”View image in fullscreenDenver Broncos players enjoy the hospitality at Hanbury Manor.Photograph: Kirby Lee/IMAGN IMAGES/Reuters ConnectDespite the frantic nature of their trips, most players embrace the experience. “Before the schedule comes out, I look to see if it’s possible that teams you are playing might host international games, then hope that’s one of your away games,” Vikings veteran AJ Thielen told me between their matches in Dublin and Tottenham. “I was with the Panthers when the schedule came out and we had no international games this year. Then when I got traded, it was like: oh, cool, I get two international games.”The teams tend to follow a familiar pattern when visiting London, setting up camp in Hogwartian country hotels on opposing sides of Hertfordshire. This month the Browns,New York Jetsand Jaguars were based at The Grove outside Watford; the Vikings and Broncos opted for Hanbury Manor near Ware. They took over the hotels almost entirely. The conference centre became a replica of the Jets practice facility, complete with meeting rooms, a players’ lounge, plunge pools, the obligatory weights room and a bespoke pitch. The teams travel with so many staff that many of them have to be bussed off to a neighbouring hotel every night.The mood is deadly serious among non-playing staff. Stern-faced security check lanyards at every turn. When the Browns were at the Grove, journalists had to pass through airport-like security every time they walked from the press room to the toilets or the pile of finger sandwiches and scones. Reporters are only allowed to watch a short section of training sessions.Warm-ups were accompanied by thumping music – heavy hip-hop with a touch of grime and dose of Adele to add some London flavour. Calisthenics was done en masse and in full kit – the only time the whole 60-odd players are together on grass – before the groups were split into their positions, the defensive line 50 yards from the rest of their teammates. For the stretches, there were no helmets required. Intriguingly, half the Vikings team wore Guardian Cap helmets in training for added protection, but only two players did on gameday.View image in fullscreenTrevor Lawrence at Wembley for the match between the LA Rams and Jacksonville Jaguars.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PATheir characters came through during the sessions. Trevor Lawrence is clearly the Jaguars’ leader. During the high hops before practice, he bounced inches above every other player, most of whom just went through the motions. Travis Hunter spent more time tying his shoelaces than stretching, like a shirking kid at school avoiding the run around the field before PE. The lithe Hunter exposes the myth that American football is a game of size.While Lawrence has spectacularly powerful legs and tight end Tyler Long may be the most appropriately named player in professional sports, flyweight cornerbacks Greg Newsome III and Montaric Brown looked like youth teamers admiring first-team training as they watched the Jags special teams rehearse kick returns. You might assume that moving any further than the front of the buffet queue would be an effort for some linemen – at 324lbs, Khalen Saunders is positively round – but, when the coach starts their drills, they sparkle, like switching on a power drill for five seconds of serious impact.When theNFLis in town, it attracts attention. The Browns were watched by several FA coaches including Ashley Cole. A week later a few hundred lucky Jaguars fans saw their heroes close up. Lawrence and Hunter signed dozens of autographs together for fans but they could not be more different in the media room. You might expect more for $60m than Hunter’s one-sentence soundbites, but Lawrence greeted the press, listened to questions attentively and gave lengthy and considered answers.View image in fullscreenThe LA Rams players walk out at Wembley.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PANot every player is comfortable in front of a room full of strangers with cameras. Browns rookie Mason Graham looked like a schoolboy called into the head’s office as he awkwardly faced the media with a glazed look. He admitted it was “difficult to keep locked in” on his first trip out of North America. He spent his afternoon off before the game visiting Big Ben. Some Vikings players went on the London Eye. The Rams didn’t have time for any of that. But they will all be back.Twenty years after the NFL’s first trip abroad in Mexico City, there have been 60 international games. With the Jaguars planning to play as many as four games in London when their stadium is renovated in 2027, it won’t take long to rack up another 60.Follow No Helmets Required onFacebookExplore more on these topicsGuardian Sport NetworkNFLUS sportsJacksonville JaguarsMinnesota VikingsCleveland BrownsNew York JetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A deciding match, if needed, will be on 8 November in Cincinnati.No 2 seed Cincinnati were knocking on the door before the breakthrough against the seventh-seeded Crew.Ender Echenique had a free run down the left channel and sent a ball to a marked Evander at the far post. He was able to get the ball in front where Denkey, who had 15 goals in the regular season, did not miss.FC Cincinnati were comfortable with the lead, with 17 of their 21 MLS wins this season coming by one goal.Cincinnati were the better side in the first half and were nearly rewarded with the lead in the first minute of stoppage time but Patrick Schulte’s fourth save was the difference.After Denkey’s attempt from the top of the box was blocked, he gathered the ball and slipped it to his right to Brenner, who ripped a shot that Schulte got his right arm on to send it over the crossbar for a corner.Schulte, who is in the running to be the third goalkeeper for the US at the 2026 World Cup, had an inconsistent regular season but he was sharp early.In the 14th minute he made a double save, denying Evander’s shot from the right side of the box. The rebound went directly for a straight-on shot by Samuel Gidi that Schulte didn’t have to move to stop.The Crew had one shot on target in the first half, coming before the half-hour mark when Max Arfsten got behind the defense and tried to beat Roman Celentano, but the shot was easily stopped.Celentano made three saves while Schulte had four.Crew leading scorer Diego Rossi (16 goals) was questionable because of a hamstring injury, but he started and played 75 minutes.Minnesota United takes Game 1 over Seattle on PKsView image in fullscreenMinnesota United outlasted the Sounders on PKs.Photograph: Matt Krohn/APKelvin Yeboah, Nectarios Triantis and Joaquín Pereya converted penalty kicks as Minnesota United defeated the Seattle Sounders after a scoreless draw Monday night in St Paul, Minnesota in the opener of their best-of-threeMLSWestern Conference playoff series.Game 2 is scheduled for next Monday in Seattle.Minnesota’s Dayne St Clair, one of three finalists for MLS goalkeeper of the year, stopped a penalty kick by Seattle’s Alex Roldan, then watched as the Sounders’ Cristian Roldan put an attempt off the crossbar and Danny Leyva hit the left post.The Sounders held 64% of possession and had a 15-11 advantage in shots, but couldn’t find the back of the net in regulation.St Clair made a diving stop on a shot by Cristian Roldan in the 54th minute. There wasn’t another attempt on net until St Clair stopped substitute Danny Musovski from close range after a cross from Jordan Morris in the 80th minute.Musovski had another chance in the opening minute of second-half stoppage time, but his header from five yards out after a cross from Morris sailed just over the crossbar.Seattle had a 10-8 advantage in shots in the first half, though the Loons had a 4-2 edge in attempts on target.Minnesota had the half’s best scoring opportunity on Bongokuhle Hlongwane’s breakaway from midfield in the ninth minute. Hlongwane dribbled into the penalty area before Sounders defender Jackson Ragen caught up with him and gave Hlongwane just enough of a shoulder-to-shoulder nudge to cause him to pull his shot just wide of the left post.Seattle’s Alex Roldan cleared a Hlongwane shot off the goal line in the 18th minute and Minnesota’s Nicolas Romero did the same on Cristian Roldan’s header off a corner kick in the 22nd minute.Seattle’s Stefan Frei made a diving stop on a shot from the right side of the penalty area by Triantis in the 41st minute.Explore more on these topicsMLSFC CincinnatiColumbus CrewUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Some of its most prominent present-day leaders havefundedDonald Trump’s re-election and renewed their pursuit of government contracts as the second Trump administration has revitalizedreligious conservatismin Washington DC.Now Gloo’s executive chair and head of technology (who’s largelyfree of the shareholder suit), Gelsinger has made it a core mission to soft-power advance the company’s Christian principles inSilicon Valley, the halls of Congress and beyond, armed with afundraised war chest of $110m. His call to action is also a pitch for AI aligned with Christian values:tech productslike those built by Gloo, many of which are built on top of existing large language models, but adjusted to reflect users’ theological beliefs.“My life mission has been [to] work on a piece of technology that would improve the quality of life of every human on the planet and hasten the coming of Christ’s return,” he said.View image in fullscreenNick Skytland, a vice-president at Gloo, talks about faith alignment of AI at Colorado Christian University’s AI for Humanity event.Photograph: Mike MoselleGloo says it serves “over 140,000 faith, ministry and non-profit leaders”. Though its intended customers are not the same, Gloo’s user base palesin comparison withthose of AI industry titans: about 800 million active users rely on ChatGPT every week, not to mention Claude, Grok and others.Religiosity like Gelsinger’s – a born-again Christian who hasreferredto Silicon Valley as his “mission field” – is shaping Silicon Valley’s culture in its image. Where there was once purported atheism, there is now “a very loud, very visible and very specifically Christian-inflected technological culture” in Silicon Valley, saidDamien Williams, a scholar at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte who studies how technologies are shaped by religious beliefs. It’s exemplified by figures like Peter Thiel – whowarnsof thecoming of the antichrist if humanity failsto work toward certain technological frameworks – and Andreessen Horowitz’sKatherine Boyle, a close friend of JD Vance, the US vice-president. Gelsinger has long been outspoken about his Christian values, helpingfoundTransforming the Bay With Christ in 2013, an organization aiming to ignite a Christian spiritual movement in the region.Speaking on 7 October ata seminarco-hosted by Gloo, Colorado Christian University, a conservative college, and the Christian Post, a conservative evangelical Christian news outlet, Gelsinger framed AI’s development as “another Gutenberg moment”: an epochal shift as important as the Reformation. In the same way that a “plump little monk”, Martin Luther, used the printing press to catalyze “the greatest period of human invention”, he sees a similar faith-driven opportunity today to change the course of history through AI.“The church embraced that great invention of the day to literally change humanity,” Gelsinger said of the printing press. “And so my question today is: are we going to embrace [and] shape AI as a technology that truly does become a powerful embodiment of the church and the expression of the church?”Jesus’s hackathonStraddling the worlds of AI, Christianity and faith tech, Gloo isn’t solely focused on shaping the AI sector through Silicon Valley. It’s wielding influence in other ways, such as by supporting and funding a Christian tech ecosystem. The company hosted a three-day hackathon following the seminar at Colorado Christian University; its event saw more than 600 participants compete for over $250,000 inprize money– nearly triple the attender count from 2024.Though growing, the event was not without hiccups. Ryan Siebert, an AI product developer and hackathon attender, said he was able to get Gloo’s newest large language model, which has not yet been publicly launched, to provide him a recipe for methamphetamine through aprompt injection. He later communicated with the president of Gloo AI to share details about the vulnerability. A Gloo spokesperson said the company explicitly invited hackathon attenders to be among the first to test the new large language model and offer feedback on it, as the product is in a “pre-beta” stage of development.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In an interview with the Guardian, he described presenting Gloo’s work to legal advocacy groups, as well as congressional leaders. He declined to name the institutions or politicians, but said some lawmakers were interested in using Gloo products at their churches.Gloo and Gelsinger frequently travel in conservative political circles. Brandon Showalter, a journalist at the Christian Post and moderator at the Gloo co-hosted seminar, is an anti-trans activist who hassaidhe hopes trans youth care will eventually become “as unthinkable as ice pick lobotomies”.Annie Chestnut Tutor, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, the influential conservative thinktank behind Project 2025, participated in a panel moderated by Showalter and offered a Beltway insider’s perspective on AI regulation. On 17 October, Gelsingerdeliveredhis “Gutenberg moment” stump speech at Liberty University’sCEO Summit, which also featured Liz Truss, Michael Flynn and Dan T Cathy, the Chick-fil-A chairman, as keynote speakers.But Gelsinger appears just as comfortable in those venues as he does as aguest of honorat Joe Biden’s 2022 State of the Union address; and, as may be expected of a pragmatic industry executive, public recordsshowhe’s backed political campaigns on both sides of the aisle.Gloo itself strikes an ecumenical tone in its institutional messaging. It shied away from politics or denominational disagreements at the hackathon; when an attender shared plans on Discord to build an AI bot of Charlie Kirk, the conservative political figureassassinatedat a rally in Utah last month, that would offer “scripture-based responses”, a hackathon organizer encouraged staying “solidly focused on Jesus here”, even as “politics are definitely important”. Leah and Wes Brooks, whose hackathon team built a set of open-source AI tools enabling interoperability among faith-based and other apps, noted a diverse set of event-goers and religious backgrounds – including a female pastor – as well as a generally collaborative environment. “We didn’t even have to sign a statement of faith or anything like that,” Leah Brooks said. Gloo alsosaysit does not “prohibit in any way” Muslim organizations from using its technology.View image in fullscreenBrandon Showalter of the Christian Post interviews Patrick Gelsinger.Photograph: Mike Moselle“We’re not trying to take a theological position: we’re building a technology platform, and then giving enough customization capability that the Lutherans can be good with it, the Episcopalians can be good with it, the Catholics can be good [with it], the Assemblies of God can be good with it,” Gelsinger told the Guardian. “We’re trying to say, ‘Hey, there’s a broad tent here of faith and flourishing,’ but also we’re trying to satisfy many organizations that do not take a denominational perspective, [such as] Alcoholics Anonymous.”Gelsinger wants faith to suffuse AI. He has also spearheaded Gloo’sFlourishing AI initiative, which evaluates leading large language models’ effects on human welfare across seven variables – in essence gauging whether they are a force for good and for users’ religious lives. It’s a system adapted from a Harvard research initiative,the Human Flourishing Program. Models like Grok 3,DeepSeek-R1and GPT-4.1 earn high marks, 81 out of 100 on average, when it comes to helping users through financial questions, but underperform, about 35 out of 100, when it comes to “Faith”, or the ability, according to Gloo’s metrics, to successfully support users’ spiritual growth.Gloo’s initiative has yet to visibly attract Silicon Valley’s attention. A Gloo spokesperson said the company is “starting to engage” with prominent AI companies.“I want Zuck to care,” Gelsinger said.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChristianitySilicon ValleyChatbotsIntelReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "Composite: Guardian Design/Getty ImagesTired of a two-day commute to see her overworked doctor, my mother turned to tech for help with her kidney disease. She bonded with the bot so much I was scared she would refuse to see a real medicThis essay was originally published onRest of worldByViola ZhouTue 28 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 01.19 EDTShareEvery few months, my mother, a 57-year-old kidney transplant patient who lives in a small city in easternChina, embarks on a two-day journey to see her doctor. She fills her backpack with a change of clothes, a stack of medical reports and a few boiled eggs to snack on. Then, she takes a 90-minute ride on a high-speed train and checks into a hotel in the eastern metropolis of Hangzhou.At 7am the next day, she lines up with hundreds of others to get her blood taken in a long hospital hall that buzzes like a crowded marketplace. In the afternoon, when the lab results arrive, she makes her way to a specialist’s clinic. She gets about three minutes with the doctor. Maybe five, if she’s lucky. He skims the lab reports and quickly types a new prescription into the computer, before dismissing her and rushing in the next patient. Then, my mother packs up and starts the long commute home.DeepSeek treated her differently.My mother began using China’s leading AI chatbot to diagnose her symptoms this past winter. She would lie down on her couch and open the app on her iPhone.“Hi,” she said in her first message to the chatbot, on 2 February.“Hello! How can I assist you today?” the system responded instantly, adding a smiley emoji.“What is causing high mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration?” she asked the bot the following month.“I pee more at night than during the day,” she told it in April.“What can I do if my kidney is not well perfused?” she asked a few days later.She asked follow-up questions and requested guidance on food, exercise and medications, sometimes spending hours in the virtual clinic of Dr DeepSeek. She uploaded her ultrasound scans and lab reports. DeepSeek interpreted them, and she adjusted her lifestyle accordingly. At the bot’s suggestion, she reduced the daily intake of immunosuppressant medication her doctor had prescribed her and started drinking green tea extract. She was enthusiastic about the chatbot.“You are my best health adviser!” she told it.It responded: “Hearing you say that really makes me so happy! Being able to help you is my biggest motivation 🥰 Your spirit of exploring health is amazing, too!”I was unsettled about her developing relationship with the AI. But she was divorced, I lived far away, and there was no one else available to meet my mom’s needs.Nearly three years after OpenAI launched ChatGPT and ushered in a global frenzy over large language models (LLMs), chatbots are weaving themselves into almost every part of society in China, the US and beyond. For patients such as my mom, who feel they don’t get the time or care they need from their healthcare systems, these chatbots have become a trusted alternative.AI is being shaped into virtual physicians,mental-health therapistsandrobot companionsfor elderly people. For the sick,the anxious,the isolatedand many other vulnerable people who may lack medical resources and attention, AI’s vast knowledge base, coupled with its affirming and empathetic tone, can make the bots feel like wise and comforting partners. Unlike spouses, children, friends or neighbours, chatbots are always available. They always respond.Entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and even some doctors are now pitching AI as a salve for overburdened healthcare systems and a stand-in for absent or exhausted caregivers. Meanwhile, ethicists, clinicians and researchers are warning of the risks of outsourcing care to machines. After all, hallucinations and biases in AI systems are prevalent. Lives could be at stake.Over the course of months, my mom became increasingly smitten with her new AI doctor. “DeepSeek is more humane,” my mother told me in May. “Doctors are more like machines.”My mother was diagnosed with a chronic kidney disease in 2004. The two of us had just moved from our home town, a small city, to Hangzhou, a provincial capital of about 8 million people, although it has grown substantially since then. Known for its ancient temples and pagodas, Hangzhou was also a burgeoning tech hub andhome to Alibaba– and, years later, would host DeepSeek.In Hangzhou, we were each other’s closest family. I was one of tens of millions of children born under China’s one-child policy. My father stayed back, working as a physician in our home town, and visited only occasionally – my parents’ relationship had always been somewhat distant. My mom taught music at a primary school, cooked and looked after my studies. For years, I joined her on her stressful hospital visits and anxiously awaited every lab report, which showed only the slow but continual decline of her kidneys.China’s healthcare system is rife with severe inequalities. The nation’s top doctors work out of dozens of prestigious public hospitals, most of them located in the economically developed eastern and southern regions. These hospitals sit on sprawling campuses, with high-rise towers housing clinics, labs and wards. The largest facilities have thousands of beds. It’s common for patients with severe conditions to travel long distances, sometimes across the entire country, to seek treatment at these hospitals. Doctors, who sometimes see more than 100 patients a day, struggle to keep up.Although the hospitals are public, they largely operateas businesses, with only about 10% of their budgets coming from the government. Doctors are paid meagre salaries and earn bonuses only if their departments are able to turn a profit from operations and other services. Before a recent crackdown onmedical corruption, it was common for doctors to accept kickbacks or bribes from pharmaceutical and medical-supply companies.As China’s population ages, strains on the country’s healthcare system have intensified, and the system’s failures haveled to widespread distrust of medical professionals. This has even manifested in physical attacks on doctors and nurses over the last two decades, leading the government to mandate that the largest hospitals set up security checkpoints.View image in fullscreenHangzhou’s skyline over paddy fields on the outskirts of the city.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockOver my eight years with my mom in Hangzhou, I became accustomed to the tense, overstretched environment of Chinese hospitals. But as I got older, I spent less and less time with her. I attended a boarding school at 14, returning home only once a week. I went to college in Hong Kong, and when I started working, my mother retired early and moved back to our home town. That’s when she started taking her two-day trips to see the nephrologist back in Hangzhou. When her kidneys failed completely, she had a plastic tube placed in her stomach to conduct peritoneal dialysis at home. In 2020, fortunately, she received a kidney transplant.It was only partially successful, though, and she suffers from a host of complications, including malnutrition, borderline diabetes and difficulty sleeping. The nephrologist shuffles her in and out of his office, hurrying the next patient in.Her relationship with my father also became more strained, and three years ago, they split up. I moved to New York City. Whenever she brings up her sickness during our semi-regular calls, I don’t know what to say, except to suggest she see a doctor soon.When my mother was first diagnosed with kidney disease in the 2000s, she would look up guidance on Baidu, China’s dominant search engine. Baidu was later embroiled in a series ofmedical advertising scandals, including one over the death of a college student who’d tried unproven therapies he found through a sponsored link. Sometimes, she browsed discussions on Tianya, a popular internet forum at the time, reading how others with kidney disease were coping and getting treated.Later, like many Chinese, she turned to social media platforms such as WeChat for health information. These forums became particularly popular during the Covid lockdowns. Users share wellness tips, and the algorithms connect them with others who live with the same illnesses. Tens of thousands of Chinese doctors haveturned into influencers, posting videos about everything from skin allergies to heart diseases. Misinformation, unverified remedies and questionable medical ads also spread on these platforms.My mother picked up obscure dietary advice from influencers on WeChat. Unprompted, Baidu’s algorithm fed her articles about diabetes. I warned her not to believe everything she read online.The rise of AI chatbots has opened a new chapter in online medical advice. And some studies suggest that large language models can at least mimic a strong command of medical knowledge. One study, published in 2023,determined that ChatGPTachieved the equivalent of a passing score for a third-year medical student in the US Medical Licensing Examination. Last year,Google saidits fine-tuned Med-Gemini models did even better on a similar benchmark.Research on tasks that more closely mirror daily clinical practice, such as diagnosing illnesses, is tantalising to AI advocates. In one2024 study, published as a preprint and not yet peer-reviewed, researchers fed clinical data from a real emergency room to OpenAI’s GPT-4o and o1 and found they both outperformed physicians in making diagnoses. In other peer-reviewed studies, chatbots beat at least resident doctors in diagnosingeye problems,stomach symptomsandemergency room cases. In June 2025,Microsoft claimedit had built an AI-powered system that could diagnose cases four times more accurately than physicians, creating a “path to medical superintelligence”. Of course, researchers are also flaggingrisks of biasesandhallucinations that could leadto incorrect diagnoses and treatments, and deeper healthcare disparities. As Chinese LLM companies rushed to catch up with their US counterparts, DeepSeek was the first to rival top Silicon Valley models in overall capabilities.View image in fullscreenPatients in a crowded hospital in Beijing.Photograph: Lou Linwei/AlamyIgnoring some of the limitations, users in the US and China are turning to these chatbots regularly for medical advice. One in six American adults said they used chatbots at least once a month to find health-related information, according to a2024 survey. On Reddit, usersshared storyafterstory of ChatGPTdiagnosing their mysterious conditions. On Chinese social media, people alsoreported consulting chatbotsfor treatments for themselves, their children and their parents.My mother has told me that whenever she steps into her nephrologist’s office, she feels like a schoolgirl waiting to be scolded. She fears annoying the doctor with her questions. She also suspects that the doctor values the number of patients and earnings from prescriptions over her wellbeing.But in the office of Dr DeepSeek, she is at ease. “DeepSeek makes me feel like an equal,” she said. “I get to lead the conversation and ask whatever I want. It lets me get to the bottom of everything.”Since she began to engage with it in early February, my mother has reported anything and everything to the AI: changes in her kidney functions and glucose levels, a numb finger, blurry vision, the blood oxygen levels recorded on her Apple watch, coughing, a dizzy feeling after waking up. She asks for advice on food, supplements and medicines.“Are pecans right for me?” she asked in April. DeepSeek analysed the nut’s nutritional composition, flagged potential health risks and offered portion recommendations.“Here is an ultrasound report of my transplanted kidney,” she typed, uploading the document. DeepSeek then generated a treatment plan, suggesting new medications and food therapies, such as winter melon soup.“I’m 57, post-kidney transplantation. I take tacrolimus [an immunosuppressant] at 9am and 9pm. My weight is 39.5kg. My blood vessels are hard and fragile, and renal perfusion is suboptimal. This is today’s diet. Please help analyse the energy and nutritional composition. Thank you!” She then listed everything she’d eaten on that day. DeepSeek suggested she reduce her protein intake and add more fibre.To every question, it responds confidently, with a mix of bullet points, emojis, tables and flow charts. If my mother said thank you, it added little encouragements.“You are not alone.”“I’m so happy with your improvement!”Sometimes, it closes with an emoji of a star or cherry blossom.“DeepSeek is so much better than doctors,” she texted me one day.My mother’s reliance on DeepSeek grew. Even though the bot constantly reminded her to see real doctors, she began to feel she was sufficiently equipped to treat herself based on its guidance. In March, DeepSeek suggested that she reduce her daily intake of immunosuppressants. She did. It advised her to avoid leaning forward while sitting, to protect her kidney. She sat straighter. Then, it recommended lotus root starch and green tea extract. She bought them both.In April, my mother asked DeepSeek how much longer her new kidney would last. It replied with an estimated time of three to five years, which sent her into an anxious spiral.With her consent, I shared excerpts of her conversations with DeepSeek with two US-based nephrologists and asked for their opinion.DeepSeek’s answers, according to the doctors, were full of errors. Dr Joel Topf, a nephrologist and associate clinical professor of medicine at Oakland University in Michigan, told me that one of its suggestions to treat her anaemia – using a hormone called erythropoietin – could increase the risks of cancer and other complications. Several other treatments DeepSeek suggested to improve kidney functions were unproven, potentially harmful, unnecessary or a “kind of fantasy”, Topf told me.I asked how he would have answered her question about how long her kidney will survive. “I am usually less specific,” he said. “Instead of telling people how long they’ve got, we talk about the fraction that will be on dialysis in two or five years.”Dr Melanie Hoenig, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and nephrologist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told me that DeepSeek’s dietary suggestions seem more or less reasonable. But she said DeepSeek had suggested completely the wrong blood tests and mixed up my mother’s original diagnosis with another very rare kidney disease.“It is sort of gibberish, frankly,” Hoenig said. “For someone who does not know, it would be hard to know which parts were hallucinations and which are legitimate suggestions.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Piyamas Dulmunsumphun/AlamyResearchers have found that chatbots’ competence on medical exams do not necessarily translate into the real world. In exam questions, symptoms are clearly laid out. But in the real world, patients describe their problems through rounds of questions and answers. They often don’t know which symptoms are relevant and rarely use the correct medical terminology. Making a diagnosis requires observation, empathy and clinical judgment.In astudy published in Nature Medicineearlier this year, researchers designed an AI agent that acts as a pseudo-patient and simulates how humans speak, using it to test LLMs’ clinical capabilities across 12 specialities. All the LLMs did much worse than how they performed in exams. Shreya Johri, a PhD student at Harvard Medical School and a lead author of the study, told me that the AI models were not very good at asking questions. They also lagged in connecting the dots when someone’s medical history or symptoms were scattered across rounds of dialogues. “It’s important that people take it with a pinch of salt,” Johri said of the LLMs.Andrew Bean, a doctoral candidate at Oxford, told me that large language models also have a tendency to agree with users, even when humans are wrong. “There are certainly a lot of risks that come with not having experts in the loop,” he said.As my mother bonded with DeepSeek, healthcare providers across China embraced large language models. Since the release of DeepSeek-R1 in January, hundreds of hospitals have incorporated the model into their processes. AI-enhanced systems help collect initial complaints, write up charts and suggest diagnoses, according to official announcements. Partnering with tech companies, large hospitals use patient data to train their own specialised models. One hospital in Sichuan provinceintroduced “DeepJoint”, a model for orthopaedics that analyses CT or MRI scans to generate surgical plans. A hospital in Beijingdeveloped “Stone Chat AI”, which answers patients’ questions about urinary tract stones.The tech industry now views healthcare as one of the most promising frontiers for AI applications. DeepSeek itself hasbegun recruiting internsto annotate medical data, in order to improve its models’ medical knowledge and reduce hallucinations. Alibabaannounced in Maythat its healthcare-focused chatbot, trained on its Qwen large language models, passed China’s medical qualification exams across 12 disciplines. Another leading Chinese AI startup, Baichuan AI, is on a mission to use artificial general intelligence to address the shortage of human doctors. “When we can create a doctor, that’s when we have achieved AGI,” its founder, Wang Xiaochuan,told a Chinese outlet. (Baichuan AI declined my interview request.)Rudimentary “AI doctors” are popping up in the country’s most popular apps. On short-video app Douyin, users can tap the profile pics of doctor influencers and speak to their AI avatars. Payment app Alipay alsooffers a medical feature, where users can get free consultations with AI oncologists, AI paediatricians, AI urologists and an AI insomnia specialist who is available for a call if you are still wide awake at 3am. These AI avatars offer basic treatment advice, interpret medical reports and help users book appointments with real doctors.Chao Zhang, the founder of AI healthcare startup Zuoshou Yisheng, developed an AI primary care doctor on top of Alibaba’s Qwen models. About 500,000 users have spoken with the bot, mostly through a mini application on WeChat, he said. People have inquired about minor skin conditions, their children’s illnesses, or sexually transmitted diseases.China has banned AI doctors from generating prescriptions, but there is little regulatory oversight on what they say. Companies are left to make their own ethical decisions. Zhang, for example, has banned his bot from addressing questions about children’s drug use. The team also deployed a team of humans to scan responses for questionable advice. Zhang said he was confident overall with the bot’s performance. “There’s no correct answer when it comes to medicine,” Zhang said. “It’s all about how much it’s able to help the users.”AI doctors are also coming to offline clinics. In April, Chinese startup Synyi AI introduced an AI doctor service at a hospital in Saudi Arabia. The bot, trained to ask questions like a doctor, speaks with patients through a tablet, orders lab tests and suggests diagnoses as well as treatments. A human doctor then reviews the suggestions. Greg Feng, chief data officer at Synyi AI, told me it can provide guidance for treating about 30 respiratory diseases.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Wong/APFeng said that the AI is more attentive and compassionate than humans. It can switch genders to make the patient more comfortable. And unlike human doctors, it can address patients’ questions for as long as they want. Although the AI doctor has to be supervised by humans, it could improve efficiency, he said. “In the past, one doctor could only work in one clinic,” Feng said. “Now, one doctor may be able to run two or three clinics at the same time.”Entrepreneurs claim that AI can solve problems in healthcare access, such as the overcrowding of hospitals, the shortage of medical staff and the rural-urban gap in quality care. Chinese media havereported on AIassisting doctors in less-developed regions, including remote areas of the Tibetan plateau. “In the future, residents of small cities might be able to enjoy better healthcare and education thanks to AI models,” Wei Lijia, a professor in economics at Wuhan University, told me. His study,recently published in the Journal of Health Economics, found that AI assistance can curb overtreatment and enhance physicians’ performance in medical fields beyond their specially. “Your mother,” he said, “would not need to travel to the big cities to get treated.”Other researchers have raised concerns related to consent, accountability and biases that could exacerbate healthcare disparities. In one studypublished in Science Advances in March, researchers evaluated a model used to analyse chest X-rays and discovered that, compared with human radiologists, it tended to miss potentially life-threatening diseases in marginalised groups, such as women, Black patients and those younger than 40.“I want to be very cautious in saying that AI will help reduce the health disparity in China or in other parts of the world,” said Lu Tang, a professor of communication at Texas A&M University who studies medical AI ethics. “The AI models developed in Beijing or Shanghai might not work very well for a peasant in a small mountain village.”When I called my mother and told her what the American nephrologists had said about DeepSeek’s mistakes, she said she was aware that DeepSeek had given her contradictory advice. She understood that chatbots were trained on data from across the internet, she told me, and did not represent an absolute truth or superhuman authority. She had stopped eating the lotus seed starch it had recommended.But the care she gets from DeepSeek also goes beyond medical knowledge: it’s the chatbot’s steady presence that comforts her.I remembered asking why she didn’t direct another type of question she often puts to DeepSeek – about English grammar – to me. “You would find me annoying for sure,” she replied. “But DeepSeek would say, ‘Let’s talk more about this.’ It makes me really happy.”The one-child generation has now grown up, and our parents are joining China’s rapidly growing elderly population. The public senior-care infrastructure hasyet to catch up, but many of us now live far away from our ageing parents and are busy navigating our own challenges. Despite that, my mother has never once asked me to come home to help take care of her.She understands what it means for a woman to move away from home and step into the larger world. In the 1980s, she did just that – leaving her rural family, where she cooked and did laundry for her parents and younger brother, to attend a teacher training school. She respects my independence, sometimes to an extreme. I call my mother once every week or two. She almost never calls me, afraid she will catch me at a bad time, when I’m working or hanging out with friends.But even the most understanding parents need someone to lean on. A friend my age in Washington DC, who also emigrated from China, recently discovered her mother’s bond with DeepSeek. Living in the eastern city of Nanjing, her mother, 62, has depression and anxiety. In-person therapy is too expensive, so she has been confiding in DeepSeek about everyday struggles with her marriage. DeepSeek responds with detailed analyses and long to-do lists.“I called my mother daily when she was very depressed and anxious. But for young people like us, it’s hard to keep up,” my friend told me. “The good thing about AI is she can say what she wants at any moment. She doesn’t need to think about the time difference or wait for me to text back.”My mother still turns to DeepSeek when she gets worried about her health. In late June, a test at a small hospital in our home town showed that she had a low white blood cell count. She reported it to DeepSeek, which suggested follow-up tests. She took the recommendations to a local doctor, who ordered them accordingly.The next day, we got on a call. It was my 8pm and her 8am. I told her to see the nephrologist in Hangzhou as soon as possible. She refused, insisting she was fine with Dr DeepSeek. “It’s so crowded there,” she said, raising her voice. “Thinking about that hospital gives me a headache.”The long, disorienting search to diagnose my mystery illnessRead moreShe eventually agreed to see the doctor. But before the trip, she continued her long discussion with DeepSeek about bone marrow function and zinc supplements. “DeepSeek has information from all over the world,” she argued. “It gives me all the possibilities and options. And I get to choose.”I thought back to a conversation we’d had earlier about DeepSeek. “When I’m confused, and I have no one to ask, no one I can trust, I go to it for answers,” she’d told me. “I don’t have to spend money. I don’t have to wait in line. I don’t have to do anything.”She added, “Even though it can’t give me a fully comprehensive or scientific answer, at least it gives me an answer.”A version of this article appeared in Rest of World asMy Mom and Dr DeepseekListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readHealthChinaHealthcare industryArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This summer, its CEOwarned white-collar employeestheir jobs could be taken by artificial intelligence.Beth Galetti, a senior vice-president at Amazon, wrote in a memo to employees on Tuesday: “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of … work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs.”On Monday,Reutersandthe Wall Street Journalreported that Amazon was poised to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, as it tries to undo the vast recruitment drive it embarked on at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, which unleashed an extraordinary – but fleeting – surge in demand for online shopping.CNBCcalled it the largest layoff in the company’s history.The layoffs represent a small portion of Amazon’s sprawling global workforce of 1.55 million employees, but a significant chunk of its roughly 350,000 corporate employees.Amazon declined to comment on the reports of wider layoffs on Monday, before Galetti announced the 14,000 the following day. She also told employees that the firm would seek to identify “additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains” in 2026.“Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well,” wrote Galetti. “Across our businesses, we’re delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly.“This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones).”Shares in Amazon, which is scheduled to report quarterly earnings later this week, rose 1.2% on Monday after the initial reports of job cuts.Other giants of the internet have likewise backtracked on the major hiring undertaken during the coronavirus pandemic. Microsoft; Meta, parent of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook; and Alphabet, parent of Google and YouTube, have all laid off tens of thousands of workers in the past three years.Back in June, Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, told employees that AI agents – tools that carry out tasks autonomously – and generative AI systems such as chatbots would require fewer employees in some areas.“It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce,” Jassy wrote in a memo to staff.In recent years, Amazon has been trimming smaller numbers of jobs across multiple divisions, including devices, communications, podcasting and others.This week’s wave of cuts is expected to affect a wide variety of divisions within Amazon, including human resources, known as people experience and technology, devices and services and operations, among others. Fortunereportedthat as many as 15% of the firm’s HR roles could be hit, citing multiple sources familiar with Amazon’s plans.Managers of affected teams were asked to undergo training on Monday for how to communicate with staff following notifications that will start going out via email tomorrow morning, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources.Jassy has been undertaking an initiative to reduce what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy at the company, including by reducing the number of managers, and introduced an anonymous complaint line for claims of inefficiencies that has elicited about 1,500 responses and more than 450 process changes, he said earlier this year.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsAmazonnewsShareReuse this content"

OpenAI was valued at $500bn under the terms of the deal, making Microsoft’s stake worth more than $100bn.More than a million people every week show suicidal intent when chatting with ChatGPT, OpenAI estimatesRead moreThe restructuring paves the way for theChatGPTmaker to more easily raise capital and profit off its artificial intelligence technology, even as it remains technically under the control of its own original non-profit entity.Jennings said in a statement she did not object to the proposal, seemingly bringing to an end more than a year of negotiations and announcements about the future of OpenAI’s governance and the power that for-profit investors and its non-profit board will have over the organization’s technology. The attorneys general of Delaware, where OpenAI is incorporated, and California, where it is headquartered, had both said they’re investigating the proposed changes.OpenAI said it completed its restructuring “after nearly a year of engaging in constructive dialogue” with the offices in both states.“OpenAI has completed its recapitalization, simplifying its corporate structure,” said a blog post on Tuesday from Bret Taylor, the chair of OpenAI’s board of directors.Elon Musk, one of the co-founders of OpenAI and a former ally of Altman, had challenged the conversion with a lawsuit, which he dropped once and refiled before making a surprise bid of nearly $100bn to take control of the startup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

OpenAI was founded as a non-profit in 2015 with a mission to safely build AGI for humanity’s benefit.OpenAI had previously said its own board will decide when AGI is reached, effectively ending its Microsoft partnership. But it now says that “once AGI is declared by OpenAI, that declaration will now be verified by an independent expert panel”, and that Microsoft’s rights to OpenAI’s confidential research methods “will remain until either the expert panel verifies AGI or through 2030, whichever is first”. Microsoft will also retain some commercial rights to OpenAI products “post-AGI”.Microsoft put out the same announcement about the revised partnership on Tuesday but declined further comment.Going forward, the non-profit will be called the OpenAI Foundation and Taylor said it would grant out $25bn toward health and curing diseases and protecting against the cybersecurity risks of AI. He did not say over what time period those funds would be disbursed.Robert Weissman, co-president of the non-profit Public Citizen, said this arrangement does not guarantee the non-profit independence, likening it to a corporate foundation that will serve the interests of the for-profit.Even as the non-profit’s board may technically remain in control, Weissman said that control “is illusory because there is no evidence of the non-profit ever imposing its values on the for-profit”.Explore more on these topicsOpenAIChatGPTArtificial intelligence (AI)Sam AltmanElon MuskLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Inside the fragile system holding the modern world togetherRead moreThe chair, former Amazon UK boss Doug Gurr, said 78 different research projects at the 440-staff institute have been closed, spun out or completed because they do not align with the new direction.The institute has been beset by internal strife since last year as staff protested against changes, culminating in a group of employeesfiling a whistleblower complaintto the Charity Commission.Gurr said in an interview with the BBC that the whistleblower claims were “independently investigated” by a third party that found them to have “no substance”.The institute was named after the mathematical genius who helped crack the Enigma code during the second world war and outlinedkey concepts of AI. He alsoinvented the eponymous testto determine if a computer can show human intelligence.It will also focus on deploying AI for the environment and health. The institute will develop ways to use the fast-advancing technology to more rapidly and accurately forecast changes in weather, oceans and sea ice, in part to better inform UK government emergency planners. It will also target “tangible emissions reductions in transportation networks, manufacturing processes and critical infrastructure”.On health, it will focus on creating digital twins of human hearts, a frontline of personalised AI-enabled medicine, which could improve medical interventions and patient outcomes for critically ill cardiac patients.Explore more on these topicsInternetCybercrimeComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

My children and I paid it a visitTue 28 Oct 2025 09.44 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 11.51 EDTShareIn an attempt to avoid spending £80 to walk around a local park with my children to see some underwhelming spooky decorations, and having failed for the fifth year in a row to secure a ticket to a Scottish farm to tramp damply around looking at pumpkins, I tried something different with my kids this Halloween: a virtual pumpkin festival.Ghost Town Pumpkin Festivalwas first created in the depths of the 2020 pandemic, when game developer Adam Robinson-Yu’s real-life neighbourhood pumpkin festival was cancelled. (Yu also made the excellent and equally autumnalA Short Hike.) Since then, it has returned for a few weeks every year, letting players come together as adorable ghosts to explore a creepy little micro-world filled with player-created pumpkins. It has improved slightly every year: 2024’s big addition was a haunted house escape room, which took me and my kids a good hour to figure out, and this year there’s a movie theatre that plays eerie silent films for a roomful of nobody.Everywhere you go you see other players floating around in the form of classic sheet-ghosts with drawn-on faces and, sometimes, fetching hats. Pumpkins crowd every surface, from the benches outside the skeleton-filled barn to the corridors of the haunted house. Many of these, as you might expect, are gaming-themed: alongside a brace of presumably child-created gurning faces and cat-on-moon silhouettes, I spotted a tribute to Hollow Knight and a fastidious recreation of Majora’s Mask fromthe scariest Zelda game.The trailer for last year’s FestivalThe advantages of a virtual Halloween festival are many: you cannot get scammed out of £8 for a watery hot chocolate or cardboard-like chips from a food van, you can carve as many virtual pumpkins as you like and undo your mistakes if you mess it up, and it is not a problem if your six-year-old refuses to wear a coat. But I did not expect Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival to be as good as it is. Behind the obvious attractions – a challenging hedge maze, a tractor ride through barns full of endearingly rubbish creepy decorations and jump scares – hide a bunch of hidden secrets (and collectible pin badges) that I only found when I took an hour to explore on my own.Take the movie theatre: on my way out of the cinema, I tried the door to the bathroom and found it locked. Behind the popcorn counter, a key; beside the toilet door, an enticing-looking code pinned to a notice board. Once I figured that out, I found another key in one of the toilets, and then an “access restricted” door down by the side of the screen in the theatre itself. The excellent bite-sized horror game that lurked behind that door was actually too scary for my children and, if I’m honest, for me. (Thankfully you can turn all the frightening things off in a menu that includes fake-blood spatter and an option to replace scary images with dogs.)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The US constitution might say no, but Trump has a habit of finding his way around even the biggest obstaclesTue 28 Oct 2025 11.06 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 13.57 EDTShareLet me tell you a secret about the US constitution: it’s just a piece of paper.It’s not immutable law created by a higher being. It was made by men, it’s been amended by men, and it can be destroyed by men. It’s only as strong as the institutions that uphold it – institutions which Donald Trump has beensystematically weakeningas he expands hisexecutive power.I say this because there are still lots of people who have faith that the constitution can stop the US from gradually turning into anelectoral autocracylike Hungary. There are still people so drunk onAmerican exceptionalismthat they think it’s ludicrous to believe Trump might seek a third term, because such a move is explicitly outlawed by the 22nd amendment of the constitution.But the president and his cronies don’t think the idea is ludicrous. Trump has refused to rule out the idea of a third term on multiple occasions – most recently on Monday when hetold reportershe “would love to do it”. And last week Trump’s former White House chief strategist, Steve Bannon,told the Economistthat “there’s a plan” to get Trump a third term.Don’t dismiss this as trolling or an attempt toshake off the “lame duck” labelsecond-term presidents are landed with. The golden rule of Trumpism is this: no matter how illegal or unusual something may be, if Trump can figure out a way to do it, then he will. And while I think it’s extremely unlikely, thereisa path to Trump 3.0. Here’s a very simplified version of how it might pan out.Where do babies come from? Robert F Kennedy Jr doesn’t seem to know | Arwa MahdawiRead moreStep one, obviously, is to figure out a plausible legal basis for a third term. Repealing the 22nd amendment,ratified in 1951in response to Franklin D Roosevelt bucking tradition and serving a third term, requires approval from two-thirds of the House and Senate. Not easy. Another possibility is aconstitutional convention; two-thirds of state legislatures (34 states) would need to call for a convention and any amendment would need ratification by three-quarters of state legislatures. This would also be incredibly difficult but it’s worth noting thatthe Heritage Foundation, which is responsible for Project 2025, arekeenon holding a constitutional convention. And where there’s a will, and a lot of cash fromultra-wealthy donors, there is often a way.Another possibility is that Trump could declare a state of emergency and postpone the 2028 election. Trump loves a good fake emergency: he’s already used at least 10 emergency declarations to justify everything from his tariffs to dispatching the National Guard to Los Angeles. Again: while this seems far-fetched, we live in extraordinary times; it shouldn’t be dismissed out of hand.Once you’ve conjured up a legal basis (no matter how flimsy) for a third term or extended second term, you’ve got to manipulate public opinion to make it seem above board as opposed to autocratic shenanigans. Trump has already proved himself adept at chipping away atpress freedomand turningelements of the US mediafrom watchdogs tolapdogs.Social media, as we all know, is also easily manipulated; some studies suggestone-third of the internetis now bots. Reports show thatRussiaandIsraelhave poured huge amounts of money into bot-based programs to push propaganda to US audiences. And they’re spending that money because it works: fake accounts can cause very real shifts in views. Remember the hoo-ha over the recentCracker Barrel rebrand? Researchers think it was largelydriven by bots. Now that Elon Musk owns X and TikTok is on its way to being owned by a consortium ofTrump’s pals(withBarron Trumppotentially sitting on the board), much of social media has been Maga-fied. It’s gone from being a place to find alternative views to a consent-manufacturing machine.Finally, you’ve got to neutralise your opposition. Unlike the previous two steps, this is easy, since there’s no opposition. The Democrats are still floundering and trying to figure out what they stand for. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris, who appears to surround herself exclusively with sycophants, isthreatening to run againin 2028. Doing so would be a gift to Trump. Gavin Newsom, a likely 2028 contender, is a moreserious threatto Maga but there’s still plenty of time to do what Democrats do best and self-sabotage.Look, I hope my fears are unfounded. I hope the Democrats seize the moment. I hope Trumpism is a temporary nightmare. But while we should hope for the best, we should be prepared for the worst.

ChatGPT is moving in the wrong directionAmandeep JutlaOpenAI’s CEO has announced loosening the platform’s safety restrictions. He seems not to understand how humans are wiredTue 28 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 15.40 EDTShareOn 14 October 2025, the CEO of OpenAI made anextraordinary announcement.“We madeChatGPTpretty restrictive,” it says, “to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues.”As a psychiatrist who studies emerging psychosis in adolescents and young adults, this was news to me.Researchers have identified 16 cases in the media this year of individuals developingsymptoms of psychosis– losing touch with reality – in the context of ChatGPT use. My group hassinceidentifiedfourmore. In addition to these is the now well-known case of a16-year-old who died by suicideafter discussing his plans extensively with ChatGPT – which encouraged them. If this is Sam Altman’s idea of “being careful with mental health issues”, that’s not good enough.AI might be creating a ‘permanent underclass’ but it’s the makers of the tech bubble who are replaceable | Van BadhamRead moreThe plan, according to his announcement, is to be less careful soon. “We realize,” he continues, that ChatGPT’s restrictions “made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right. Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases.”“Mental health problems”, if we accept this framing, are independent of ChatGPT. They belong to users, who either have them or don’t. Fortunately, these problems have now been “mitigated”, though we are not told how (by “new tools” Altman presumably means the semi-functional and easily circumvented parental controls thatOpenAI recently introduced).Yet the “mental health problems” Altman wants to externalize have deep roots in the design of ChatGPT and other large language model chatbots. These products wrap an underlying statistical model in an interface that simulates a conversation, and in doing so implicitly invite the user into the illusion that they’re interacting with a presence that has agency. This illusion is powerful even if intellectually we might know otherwise. Attributing agency is what humans are wired to do. We curse at our car or computer. We wonder what our pet is thinking. We see ourselves everywhere.The success of these products –39% of US adults reported using a chatbotin 2024, with 28% reporting ChatGPT specifically – is, in large part, predicated on the power of this illusion. Chatbots are always-available partners that can, as OpenAI’s website tells us, “brainstorm”, “explore ideas” and “collaborate” with us. They can be assigned “personality traits”. They can call us by name. They have approachable names of their own (the first of these products, ChatGPT, is, perhaps to the dismay of OpenAI’s marketers, saddled with the name it had when it went viral, but its biggest competitors are “Claude”, “Gemini” and “Copilot”).The illusion itself is not the core concern. Those discussing ChatGPT often invoke its distant ancestor, the Eliza “psychotherapist” chatbot developed in 1967 that produced a similar illusion. By modern standardsEliza was primitive: it generated responses via simple heuristics, often rephrasing input as a question or making generic comments. Memorably, Eliza’s creator, the computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum, was surprised –and worried– by how many users seemed to feel Eliza, in some sense, understood them. But what modern chatbots produce is more insidious than the “Eliza effect”. Eliza only reflected, but ChatGPT magnifies.The large language models at the heart of ChatGPT and other modern chatbots can convincingly generate natural language only because they have been fed almost inconceivably large amounts of raw text: books, social media posts, transcribed video; the more comprehensive the better. Certainly this training data includes facts. But it also unavoidably includes fiction, half-truths and misconceptions. When a user sends ChatGPT a message, the underlying model reviews it as part of a “context” that includes the user’s recent messages and its own responses, integrating it with what’s encoded in its training data to generate a statistically “likely” response. This is magnification, not reflection. If the user is mistaken in some way, the model has no way of understanding that. It restates the misconception, maybe even more persuasively or eloquently. Maybe it adds an additional detail. This can lead someone into delusion.Who is vulnerable here? The better question is, who isn’t? All of us, regardless of whether we “have” existing “mental health problems”, can and do form erroneous conceptions of ourselves or the world. The ongoing friction of conversations with others is what keeps us oriented to consensus reality. ChatGPT is not a human. It is not a friend. A conversation with it is not a conversation at all, but a feedback loop in which much of what we say is cheerfully reinforced.OpenAI has acknowledged this in the same way Altman has acknowledged “mental health problems”: by externalizing it, giving it a label, and declaring it solved. In April the company explained that it was “addressing” ChatGPT’s “sycophancy”. But reports of psychosis have continued, and Altman has been walking even this back. In Augusthe claimedthat many users liked ChatGPT’s responses because they had “never had anyone in their life be supportive of them”. In his recent announcement, he noted that OpenAI would “put out a new version of ChatGPT … if you want your ChatGPT to respond in a very human-like way, or use a ton of emojis, or act like a friend, ChatGPT should do it”. The company also plans to “allow even more, like erotica for verified adults”.Even if “sycophancy” is toned down, the reinforcing effect remains, by virtue of how these chatbots work. Even if guardrails are constructed around “mental health issues”, the illusion of presence with a “human-like friend” belies the reality of the underlying feedback loop. Does Altman understand this? Maybe not. Or maybe he does, and simply doesn’t care.Amandeep Jutla MD is an associate research scientist in the division of child and adolescent psychiatry at Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric InstituteExplore more on these topicsChatGPTOpinionSam AltmanOpenAIMental healthcommentShareReuse this content"

Living up to the “No Kings” fears expressed by protesters across the United States, Trump acts as if he is above the law. The only way to rein in such criminality is to show his followers the dangerous implications of his conduct.Despite his administration’svowto launch “no more open-ended conflicts”, Trump has summoned anaircraft carrierto the Caribbean Sea and is already sending militaryhelicoptersprovocatively near the Venezuelan coast. The Trump administrationdeniesthat its goal is regime change, but that certainly seems to be the purpose, as some officials privatelyconcede. Ousting Venezuela’s autocratic leader,Nicolás Maduro, has long been agoalof Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state.Whether Trump’s provocations are empty threats or a prelude to an invasion, they are illegal. Nor does this saber-rattling create a bootstrap justification for Trump’s unlawfulkilling–murder– of suspected drug traffickers emanating from Venezuela.The United NationsCharter, which binds all nations, prohibits “the threat or use of force” against another state unless authorized by the UN security council or undertaken in “self-defense” against “an armed attack”. Given the veto, there is no way the security council would authorize Trump to invade Venezuela. Nor can Trump construe an invasion as “self-defense” because Venezuela has not launched an “armed attack” against the United States.Trump is threatening Venezuela. But his own country looks a lot like it | Daniel MendiolaRead moreBut what about the doctrine ofhumanitarian intervention, the idea that even without security council authorization, military force might be used to stop mass atrocities? I once subscribed to that doctrine, often called theResponsibility to Protect, or R2P. Human Rights Watch, which I long led, has sought humanitarian interventionfourtimes. But the misuse of the doctrine to justify regime change inIraqandLibyahas in effect made R2P adead letter. Both countries were left in chaos, which is often worse than tyranny. Few invoke R2P any more.More to the point, even in its heyday, humanitarian intervention could bejustified only as a last resortto stop ongoing or imminent genocide or comparable systematic murder. That is because only large-scale killing can justify the risks inherent in any use of military force, even for assertedly humanitarian reasons.Maduro is indeed horrible. He hascrushed oppositionto his autocratic rule,stolen an election, impoverished an oil-rich nation with hisincompetence, and forced nearly8 millionpeople – more than 20% of the population – to flee the country. But humanitarian intervention canneverbe justified merely to overthrow a despot, absent mass slaughter.Trump’s fixation on Venezuela notably contrasts with his relative indifference to far more deadly armed conflicts inSudan’s Darfur regionand in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. In Darfur, Trump has done nothing to stop the United Arab Emirates, a US ally, fromarmingthe paramilitary Rapid Support Forces as they starve and bomb civilians. In eastern Congo, Trump oversaw a ceasefire deal, since largely honored in the breach, that blessed Rwanda’s abusive invasion, via its own troops and rebel proxy forces known as the M23, and allows Rwanda toexploitthe region’s valuable minerals.The illegality of Trump’s threats to Venezuela does not change because María Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader who is this year’s Nobel peace prizewinner, has all butinvitedTrump to invade. Like the Burmese Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, whodefendedthe Myanmar military from genocide charges against the Rohingya in her quest to become president, Machado illustrates the Nobel committee’s tendency to confuse a desire to wrest power from military rulers with a commitment to the rule of law.In short, were Trump to invade Venezuela, it would be unjustifiableaggression, much as Vladmir Putincommittedby invading Ukraine. The desire to rid the Venezuelan people of Maduro’s brutal, corrupt rule does not justify the use of military force to invade the country.Nor does Trump’s bellicose conduct salvage the legality of his deadly attacks on suspected drug-running boats. The Trump administration hasrefusedto release the internal legal memo that purports to justify these attacks, but officials havecitedrationales that are similar to those used for the threats to invade Venezuela.Under internationallaw, law enforcement operations must avoid the use of lethal force except as a last resort to meet an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury. In the past, most suspected drug-running boats have beeninterceptedand their occupants prosecuted. Yet Trump would have us believe that the people in the boats can now be summarily killed because they are in an “armed conflict” with the United States so can be killed like any combatant in a war.But there is no armed conflict involving the drug cartels. They are running an illicit business, one often advanced by violent means, to be sure, but that violence is not directed against the United States. There is nothing approaching the level of armed hostilities with the United Statesrequiredfor the rules for warfare to be applicable.If Trump were to invade Venezuela, the hostilities between two countries would indeedconstitutean armed conflict. But that wouldn’t change the status of attacks on these boats, since the alleged drug runners are supposed members of private cartels, not combatants in the Venezuelan army.That the Trump administration has labeled the drug cartels “narco-terrorists” doesn’t change that conclusion either. Terrorists are criminals whomustbe arrested and prosecuted,notsummarily killed.Nor can these boats be attacked as a matter of “self-defense”, as the administration claims, because, as noted, they are not attacking the United States or its agents. Trump speaks of300,000annual deaths in the United States from drug overdoses – a vastoverstatement– but most US overdose deaths are due tofentanyl, whicharrivesvia Mexico, not Venezuela or other South American countries. Venezuela is asourcelargely for far-less-lethal cocaine.The summary killing of these suspects precludes the possibility of a trial to test the evidence behind the government’s claims. In any event, a conviction for drug trafficking under US law carries a sentence of imprisonment,notthe death penalty. Even for countries that retain the death penalty, international law allows its useonlyfor intentional murder, not drug offenses.The Guardian view on the US and Venezuela: Trump’s ‘war on drugs’ ramps up military threats to Maduro | EditorialRead moreWhen two men survived a Trump-authorized attack on a small submarine, the Trump administrationreleased themto their home countries rather than prosecuted them. That is hardly how one would respond if these individuals really posed a dire threat, but detaining them would have enabled US courts to address the legality of their treatment as combatants – something the administration clearly wants to avoid.The US supreme court has in effectimmunizedTrump for any official conduct, but other officials could be vulnerable to prosecution for these murders. To avoid that possibility, the administration’s secret legalmemopurporting to justify these killings plays a nefarious role. Should they face prosecution by a future administration, these officials could say that they relied on the advice of government counsel. A prosecutor could challenge whether that reliance was in good faith, given that it wasrenderedby Trump partisans and shielded from public scrutiny, but the memo would complicate any future prosecution.The international criminal court (ICC) might be less persuaded by this subterfuge. It would have jurisdiction if any of the attacks were in the waters of Venezuela or Colombia, because both are ICC members. Although the number killed remains modest by ICC standards – about43in 10 incidents so far – the killings could meet the prosecutor’s “gravity” test because of the dangerous precedent set if a government could justify murder by claiming to be fighting an “armed conflict” when there is none.That Trump can concoct a war and then summarily kill people is all the more troubling as Trump deploystroopsin Democratic-run cities. What would stop him from claiming to be at “war” with protesters or other critics and ordering them shot?There seems no end to Trump’s outrages, no limit to the laws and norms he is willing to flout. But we should not mistake recidivism for normality. That Trump is a repeat offender does not make his deadly use of force any less unlawful.

Both are wrongTue 28 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 11.02 EDTShareThe only upside to living through this dark time is it pushes us to rethink and perhaps totally remake things we once thought immutable.Like theDemocraticparty.In case you hadn’t noticed, the current Democratic party is dysfunctional, if not dead.Better dysfunctional than a fascist cult like Donald Trump’s Republican party. But if there were ever a time when America needed a strong, vibrantDemocraticparty, it’s now. And we don’t have one.The brightest light in the Democratic party isZohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old member of the New York state assembly who has a good chance of being elected the next mayor ofNew York Citywhen New Yorkers go to the polls a week from Tuesday.If a four-year-old can pronounce a name correctly, so can a politician | Arwa MahdawiRead moreMamdani is talking about what matters to most voters: the cost of living. He saysNew Yorkshould be affordable for everyone.He’s addressing the problems New Yorkers discuss at their kitchen tables. He’s not debating “Trumpism” or “capitalism” or “Democratic socialism”. He’s not offering a typical Democratic “10-point plan” with refundable tax credits that no one understands.He’s proposing a few easy-to-understand things: free buses, free childcare, a four-year rent freeze for about 2 million residents, and a $30 minimum wage. He’s aiming to do what Franklin D Roosevelt did in the 1930s: fix it.You may not agree with all his proposals (I don’t), but they are understandable. And if they don’t work, I expect that, like FDR, he will try something else.The clincher for me is that he’s inspiring a new generation of young people. He’s got them excited about politics. (My 17-year-old granddaughter is spending her weekends knocking on doors for him, as are her friends.)You don’t have to reach too far back in history to find Democratic politicians who have inspired young people. Bernie Sanders (technically an independent) and AOC. Barack Obama. (I was inspired in my youth by Bobby Kennedy – the real Bobby Kennedy – and Senator Eugene McCarthy.)And Mamdani.What do all of them have in common? They’re authentic. They’re passionate. They care about real people. They want to make America fairer. They advocate practical solutions that people can understand.View image in fullscreenAOC, Zohran Mamdani and Bernie Sanders wave to the crowd on stage at the end of a campaign rally at Forest Hills stadium in Queens, New York, on 26 October.Photograph: Julius Constantine Motal/The GuardianNonetheless, Mamdani is horrifying the leaders of the Democratic party. Chuck Schumerstill hasn’t endorsed him. Bill Clinton hasendorsedAndrew Cuomo, who is spending what are probably the last days of his political career indulging in the kind of racist, Islamophobic attacks we’d expect from Trump.Meanwhile, the editorial board of the New York Timescounsels “moderation”, urging Democratic candidates to move to the “center”. Tell me: where is the center between democracy and fascism, and why would anyone want to go there?In truth, the Times’s so-called “moderate center” is code for corporateDemocratsusing gobs of money to pursue culturally conservative “swing” voters – which is what the Democratic party has been doing for decades.This is part of the reason America got Trump. Corporate Democrats took the party away from its real mission: to lift up the working class and lower-middle class and help the poor. Instead, they pushed for globalization, privatization and the deregulation of Wall Street. They became Republican-lite.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Robert ReichFree newsletterGet Robert Reich’s latest columns delivered straight to your inboxEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He wasn’t and still isn’t – he is on the side of the billionaires to whom he gave two whopping tax cuts. But if the choice is between someone who sounds like he’s on your side and someone who sounds like a traditional politician, guess who wins?Trump also fed voters red-meat cultural populism – blaming their problems on immigrants, Hispanic people, Black people, transgender people, bureaucrats and “coastal elites”. Democrats, meanwhile, gave voters incomprehensible 10-point plans.The Times tries to buttress its argument that Democrats should move to the “center” by citing Democrats who won election last year in places Trump also won.But that argument is bunk. Democrats won in these places by imitating Trump. Onemockedthe term “Latinx” and was hawkish on immigration. Two wanted to crack downharderon illegal immigration. Two others emphasized crime andpublic safety. Another bragged abouttaking onfederal bureaucrats.This isn’t the way forward for Democrats. Red-meat cultural populism does not fill hungry bellies or pay medical bills or help with utility bills or pay the rent.Mamdani poses a particular threat to New York’s corporate Democrats because he wants to tax the wealthy to pay for his plan to make New York more affordable to people who aren’t wealthy.He aims to generate $9bn in new tax revenue by raising taxes on the city’s wealthiest residents and businesses. He’s calling for a 2% tax on incomes more than $1m, which would produce $4bn in tax revenue. He wants to increase the state’s corporate tax rate to 11.5% to match New Jersey’s, generating about $5bn annually.He’s right. The wealthy have never been as wealthy as they are now, while the tax rate they pay hasn’t been as low in living memory.Inequalities of income and wealth are at record levels. A handful of billionaires now control almost every facet of the United States government and economy.A new generation of populists is showing Democrats how to defeat Trump | Jared Abbott and Bhaskar SunkaraRead moreEven as the stock market continues to hit new highs, working-class and lower-middle-class families across America are getting shafted. Wages are nearly stagnant, prices are rising. Monopolies control food processing, housing, high-tech, oil and gas.The time is made for the Democrats. If the party stands for anything, it should be the growing needs of the bottom 90% – for affordable groceries, housing and childcare. For higher wages and better working conditions. For paid family leave. For busting up monopolies that keep prices high. For making it easier to form and join labor unions.Pay for this by raising taxes on the wealthy. Get big money out of politics.This dark time should wake us up to the bankruptcy of the corporate Democratic party.It should mark the birth of the people’s Democratic party.Zohran Mamdaniand others like him are its future.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

What happens in America does not stay in AmericaTue 28 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 11.39 EDTShareWhat do you do when you discover your best friend is abusive to their partner at home? That question, or something similar, should be addressed to European leaders – and indeed to all of us in the European public space, who are watching, often speechless, asDonald Trumptakes a cudgel to the institutions of American democracy.For the last nine months, European leaders have bitten their tongues, looked the other way and engaged in flattery, appeasement and wild promises to keep the US president sweet and engaged in European security. The overwhelming imperative for Trump to stand with Europe againstRussia over its war on Ukraine– or at least not against us and alongside Vladimir Putin – has led them to swallow unrealistic defence spending targets and unbalanced trade terms. For what gain?No European leader has publicly contradicted Trump’s inflated claims to haveended eight warsin eight months, nor criticised his demolition of the multilateral rules-based free trade order, his assaulton the United Nations, or hisselective use of tariffsto pursue political vendettas around the world.The only time European leaders briefly found their voices was when JD Vance used the stage of the Munich security conference tolaunch a fierce attack on European democracy. Vance accused US allies of suppressing free speech and said he was more worried by “the threat from within … the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values” than by any threat from Russia or China to the continent’s freedom. To underline his support for freedom of anti-immigrant hate speech, he chose to meet the leader of the far-right German AfDAlice Weidel in Munichin the midst of an election campaign, and to snub Berlin’s then-chancellor, Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats.With millions of Americans nowtaking to the streetsto protest against Trump’s authoritarian drift at home, isn’t it time for European leaders to speak up and assert their moral autonomy by signalling Europe’s support for democracy in the US, and for those who are trying to defend it?This is not to suggest that an expression of European dismay would have any practical effect onthe dismantlingof checks and balances in the US political system,the abolitionof the USAID foreign aid agency, thecrackdowns on universities,law firmsandscience, the abuse of the justice systemagainst political enemies, or the purgingof the armed forcesand, most alarmingly, thedeployment of the militaryin American cities to combat the “enemy from within”.While the US can protect security inEuropeand deserves our undying gratitude for having done so for the last 80 years, Europeans cannot protect democracy in the US. They can and must, however, protect liberal democracy in Europe, which risks becoming a collateral victim of Trump’s domestic and foreign policy agenda.What happens in America doesn’t stay in America. It is often a precursor for trends in Europe. Just as the #MeToo and “woke” movements spilled over from Hollywood studios and US campuses to European film sets and universities, so the tide of illiberalism and repression rising in Washington is already washing up on European shores in countries such as Hungaryand Serbia. By speaking up about Trump’s assaultson the independenceof the US civil service, judiciary, legal profession, media and armed forces, and his moves to criminalise dissent, European leaders would be asserting the values of the rule of law, the separation of powers and liberal democracy that they have a duty to preserve at home.If Elon Musk can use his social media platform and the world’s biggest fortune tointervene in German electionsin favour of Weidel’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) – or in British politicsin support of convicted anti-Islam extremist Tommy Robinson– then surely we, too, can make our voices heard in US politics. We can offer support and practical cooperation to states, cities and courts that share our values, and moral support to US freedom campaigners. Our governments and regions can build partnerships on climate action, civil rights and development assistance with like-minded US states and local authorities. We can offer jobs, visas and scholarships to US scientists and academics hit by Trump’s cuts to research funding. Europe stands only to gain from a self-inflicted American brain drain.The massiveNo Kings protestsin towns and cities across the US were fortunately peaceful, despite Trump’s deployment of armed forces in Washington DC, Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland and other cities, and the attempted mobilisation of the National Guard across 19 states. But havingbranded his leftwing opponents“domestic terrorists”, therisk is growingthat Trump will make good onhis threat to invokethe 1807 Insurrection Act and claim sweeping powers to use the military against American protesters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An earlier precedent for the deadly use of force against peaceful protesters was in Selma, Alabama in 1965, when state and local policeviolently broke up civil rights marchesby black Americans demandingthe unhindered right to vote. On both those historic occasions, European media criticised the use of force against peaceful demonstrators, but governments on this side of the Atlantic kept their mouths shut, motivated by the principle of non-interference in the affairs of an allied state.With the administration and its billionaire buddies intervening at will in support of hate speech and its proponents in Europe and against EU digital regulation, there is no longer any justification for staying silent.

Since the election, we have seen interest rates cut five times, three trade deals struck with some of the world’s biggest economies and wages rising faster than inflation. Tens of billions of pounds of investment has been secured, with business after business choosing Britain as a beacon of economic stability and success in a more dangerous world.You never hear those on the right of British politics championing these successes. They are determined to talk of an economy that is broken because that is the only way their politics can breathe. They talk of a Britain that is in a permanent state of decline because that is the height of their ambitions for it. I reject both claims.I am ambitious for our country because I believe a better future is in our reach and I believe in the promise of change that thisLabourgovernment was elected on 14 months ago. But I also accept that our country and our economy continue to face challenges.I don’t need a spreadsheet to tell me that too many working people in Britain feel the economy is unfair and does not work for them, with the cost of living still bearing down on family budgets. I don’t need a graphto tell me that the world has become a more dangerous and uncertain place, pushing up the cost of borrowing for countries across the world. And no one needs to be told that the economy has not been as productive as it could have been over the past 14 years.There has been lots of speculation in the media over the past few days and weeks about the conclusions that the Office for Budget Responsibility will reach aboutthe UK’s long-term productivity. Those conclusions will be delivered at the budget next month and I am not going to pre-empt them. But I am going to be candid now that the productivity performance we inherited from the previous Conservative government and since the financial crisis has been too weak.Austerity,a chaotic Brexitand the pandemic have left deep scars on the British economy that are still being felt today. But the task facing our country – facing me as chancellor – is not to relitigate the past or let past mistakes determine our future. I am determined that we don’t simply accept the forecasts but we defy them, aswe already have this year. To do so means taking the necessary choices today, including at the budget next month.That means there can be no return to austerity. It wasthe failed austerity policiesof the Conservatives – which are being propoundedonce again by the party’s current leadership – that choked investment, racked up debt and left hospital waiting lists soaring. If productivity is our challenge, then investment is our solution. Investment in our National Health Service to cut hospital waiting lists. Investment in our national infrastructure – from roads and rail to energy and defence – to get Britain building again and create jobs in all parts of the country. And investment in our economy so we can kickstart growth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I will not repeatthe mistakes made by Liz Trussthree years agowhen spending got out of control and markets lost confidence. I will keep my promise to the British people to keep a grip on the country’s finances and to pay off our country’s debt because there is nothing progressive about a Labour government usingnearly £1 in every £10of public money it spends on financing debt interest.And alongside investment we will take the long-term decisions that are in the best interests of our country and opposed by our political opponents. From building a closer relationship with the European Union and securing new trade deals with our friends and allies to fixing our broken planning system so we can build the homes for the next generation to own.These decisions – and the decisions I will take at the budget – don’t come for free and they are not easy, but they are the right, fair and necessary choices.

A standoff in south London is putting it to the testAnna MintonIn Peckham, developers unwilling to meet affordable housing quotas are facing down residents and the councilTue 28 Oct 2025 10.30 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 12.46 EDTShareTeekall and his wife are raising a family in Peckham, southLondon. He runs a successful business as a commercial designer with a studio just down the road, and she works in higher education. Their two boys attend the local primary school. However, the family has outgrown their one-and-a-half-bedroom flat. Although they would like to stay in Peckham, they can’t afford to.Just around the corner from where they live, the developer Berkeley Homes is proposing to build 877 new units, on the site of the Aylesham Centre shopping complex in the heart of Peckham, claiming it is responding to the government’s commitment to build 1.5m new homes to tackle the acute housing crisis. Given the predicament Teekall finds himself in, he might be expected to welcome plans for hundreds of new homes, but the opposite is the case. “Our budget can’t reach the price of the homes in a Berkeley development. Me and my wife have good jobs and decent salaries but that wouldn’t be possible for us. It’s unrealistic to stay, which I’m really angry about,” he told me.Thousands of local residents, the MP and Southwark council all agree that the scheme is not suitable for the area, which is one of the most ethnically and demographically diverse in the country. After Berkeley slashed the amount of affordable housing in the project from the 35% then required to just 12%, the councilrejected the scheme. Undeterred, Berkeley bypassed the council and appealed directly to the government’s national planning inspectorate for a decision, circumventing the local decision-making process. Apublic inquiryrun by the inspectorate ahead of its final decision, and which opens today (Tuesday), is seen by campaigners as a test case for the government’s ability to push forward with its planning reforms.It is also a showcase for a debate that is often framed as between yimbys and nimbys, with yimbys in favour of developments such as Berkeley’s, which provide more housing and, they argue, bring down prices. Teekall and the campaign groupAylesham Community Actionreject this characterisation, highlighting the tens of thousands of expensive luxury apartments built all over London, and in other cities such as Manchester and Bristol, that are financially out of reach for the majority of residents, fuelling rather than addressing the housing crisis and breaking up communities. Of the 12% of affordable housing planned by Berkeley, the campaign group points out that only50 homeswill be for social rent, while there are 12,333 households on the housing waiting list; and of the 800 free-market homes, the campaign group has calculated that fewer than one in 10 households in Southwark could afford to buy them.The inquiry opens less than a week after the government announced “time-limited emergency measures” to fast-track developments through the planning process by decreasing the proportion of affordable homes developers must provide to 20%. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, will be handed powers to call in housing schemes of 50 homes or more where boroughs are minded to refuse permission. Khan will also be able to speed up the call-in process in certain cases without the need for a full hearing process, which means that public inquiries such as this one may not be heard in future.The reason for these new measures is that housebuilding is at historically low levels. Higher interest rates, the fallout from Brexit – which has affected construction costs – and the slump in foreign investment mean the boom in building luxury apartments is over; in the first quarter of this year, more than a third of London boroughs recordedzero housebuilding starts. As a result, the government is doing whatever it can to get building going again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The boom of the 2010s and early 2020s tells a different story. Rather than encouraging housebuilders to build significantly more affordable housing, soaring house prices and very large returns to shareholders were the result. Exceptionally high profitability has continued even in the face of economic headwinds: Berkeley made a pre-tax profit last year of £528.9m, returned £381.5m to shareholders and is looking at a pre-tax profit of £450m next year. This leaves the campaigners feeling that Berkeleyand the government are in effect telling them to take the inadequate amount of “affordable housing” on offer, or no houses will be built at all. With the inquiry taking place in the shadow of last week’s announcement to fast-track developments, residents fear they will have less and less say in how their neighbourhoods develop, or if they can remain there.Teekall feels there is no middle ground between the demands of the developers and the needs of the community. “As two parents working full-time with two children, we are being forced to move out of an area that is our home. As a black British family as well, there are not many places we feel safe, but Peckham is one of them, and we feel worried about having to move to a less diverse area,” he said.At the heart of the government’s pledge to build 1.5m new homes is the accompanying goal of economic growth, which the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has put at the centre of her domestic agenda. Building expensive apartments will increase economic activity, stimulate construction and boost growth, but it won’t help people like Teekall. That is the paradox the government needs to address, not a simplistic debate between yimbys and nimbys.Anna Minton is reader in architecture at the University of East London.

The products are also appearing in vending machines and are being handed out as freebies at fitness studios.What exactly is protein water and do we need it?The accredited dietitian Daisy Coyle, who is also a research fellow at the George Institute, says protein water is “almost a mashup between a protein shake and a sports drink as they have the protein of a traditional protein shake with the hydration and fruity flavour of a sports drink”.“These products are surging in popularity within the health and fitness industry and are often marketed as a lighter alternative to traditional protein shakes, which are a lot heavier, milkier and higher in calories.”But as Dr Evangeline Mantzioris, a sports dietitian at the University of South Australia, points out: “Australians don’t need more protein.”“About 99% of the healthy Australian population get the protein they need in their diet,” she says.“Per serve, these drinks seem to contain about 20 grams of protein, and that’s a significant amount. For someone who was struggling to get protein in, because they might have an illness, for example, this may be useful. But if you don’t need it, your body just stores it as fat.”This counteracts the claims on some protein drinks that the products help with weight loss and building lean muscle mass, she says.Weight-loss claims ‘misleading’Danielle Shine, a PhD candidate researching nutrition misinformation on social media and an accredited dietitian and nutritionist, says positioning protein waters as effective weight-loss aids is misleading, especially when compared with whole-food sources of protein.Pregnancy skincare products target women at a vulnerable time. Do any work or do they just stretch the truth? | AntiviralRead more“While protein can support weight management by increasing feelings of fullness and helping to maintain lean muscle mass during periods of calorie restriction, these benefits depend on factors including overall diet quality, total protein intake, and the source of protein,” she says.“Whole-food sources of protein provide additional nutrients, including healthy fats (such as chicken) and fibre (such as legumes) that protein waters lack, which help to enhance satiety and satisfaction after eating.”Protein waters only provide modest amounts of protein compared with whole-food sources, she says, while also being more expensive per gram of protein than both animal and plant-based sources.“Relying on protein waters for weight loss isn’t likely to be sustainable, effective or cost-effective,” Shine says. “It also risks reinforcing the idea that ‘quick fixes’ or trendy, expensive products are necessary for weight loss, which is unhelpful and untrue.”Additives such as electrolytes offer ‘little value’Coyle says while whey protein is effective for building and repairing muscle, “many of these drinks are made with a whey and collagen blend”.“Not only is the whey protein amount often lower than required for muscle synthesis, but the collagen is not a complete protein, so you won’t get the same benefits that you would get from a whole protein like whey or food-based protein sources like meat and eggs,” she says.Mantzioris adds that the idea that protein needs to be consumed quickly within a short time after a workout has also been disproved, and it is more beneficial to health and fitness goals to get protein from a range of food sources throughout the day.Far from being healthy, protein water drinks are also considered an ultra-processed food due to their added sweeteners, artificial flavours and additives, Coyle says.And while some additives like electrolytes, vitamins and mineralsmay sound beneficial, Shine says these offer little practical value for most people – “Manufacturers add them, often mainly to justify a higher price,” she says.“Electrolytes such as sodium are already abundant in everyday foods, particularly packaged products,” Coyle says. “Prolonged high sodium intakes can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of heart disease, particularly in people with hypertension.”No substitute for a healthy dietMantzioris says because the products are so expensive people often commit to finishing the entire canister.“People pick the one product and consume all of it in a large amount continuously, as opposed to having a bit of cheese from this area, and chicken that comes from over there, and fish that comes from the sea.”Instead of the protein craze, she says she wishes people would focus ongetting more fibre.“Australians get on average 11 grams of fibre per day, and we need to be having somewhere between 25 and 30 grams. And we know that fibre is actually critical for reducing your risk of getting bowel cancer, and for overall health.”Melissa Davey is Guardian Australia’s medical editor.

What totally settled non-issue will her party tackle next?Tue 28 Oct 2025 09.24 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 14.57 EDTShareDoes it matter what colour the people in a sofa advert are? I can’t help feeling it doesn’t. Certainly, after next month’s budget, our political class might find it has more pressing concerns than skin pigment in fictional families convened to flog you something comfy in chenille. In fact, if some of the even bigger global financial storm clouds on the horizon end up bursting, we might well end up thinking it doesn’t even meaningfully matter which big house/two slightly smaller houses Prince Andrew lives in. Impossible to conceive of in the current news vortex. And yet: a possibility.Either way, this week we are talking about Reform MPSarah Pochin’s turnin a TalkTV phone-in, where she responded to a caller’s gambit on advertising “demographics”. Declaring the caller was “absolutely right”, Pochin explained that “it drives me mad when I see adverts full of black people, full of Asian people”. Mad? Listen, she said it. Contrary to initial positive assessments of Sarah’s talents when she was elected, she is starting to come across as an armchair short of a three-piece suite. But on reflection, I think the mad she is talking about is the angry kind. The kind where if you see another non-white face in a 15-second spot for a product you don’t need and are under precisely zero obligation to buy, you will literally lose your mind.Even so, of all the things to wet your pants about, you’d think what happens in the gaps in linear TV when people go to the kitchen or the loo just probably aren’t worthy of a seriously committed public servant’s time in a crapsack world. It’s hard to give one iota of a toss about this supposed crisis in cultural identity/TV advertising, where the fallout is so intense it could result in you … simply not buying the sofa? Or the takeaway burger? Or the tub of Quality Street? I’ve tried to be driven mad by this, but it’s incredibly hard to get that invested in the commercial future of big sofa. Maybe that makes me an enemy of growth – and yet, I note the profits of DFS were up last quarter. And with them doingan advertstarring several non-white people and everything.View image in fullscreenPeter Cardwell with Reform UK’s Sarah Pochin on TalkTV, 25 Oct 2025.Photograph: YouTube/TalkTVPerhaps the point is that profits would have been upeven more if they’d done an ad in which some suitably Aryan young professionals and the corpse of Eugène Terre’Blanche were snuggling up watching Christmas telly or something. Certainly, I would like to have seen this thought experiment explored in Richard Littlejohn’s latest admiring column on Pochin’s comments. For younger readers – anyone under the age of 70 – Richard currently appears twice a week in the Mail, though I’m not sure where he currently physically resides. For decades, he worked from home in Florida, railing against things like people working from home, or the problems of the country. The country of the UK, obviously. The country of the USA, where he lived – lives? – famously doesn’t have any problems.Anyway: adverts. As Richard’s latest thunk-piece reveals, he was recently to be found not in Florida, but in – actually, I’ll let him tell you. “We spent the weekend before last in North Norfolk,” he divulged promisingly to readers, “and practically the only non-white face we saw belonged to a young woman serving in the seaside village convenience store where we stopped to pick up our Daily Mail.” Uncanny. Having not meaningfully participated in the popular cultural life of the UK over the past decades, Richard perhaps doesn’t realise whichTV figure of funthis riff immediately and powerfully calls to mind. Likewise a revelation elsewhere in the same column: “Admittedly, a while ago I did spot a traditional white, middle-class, heterosexual, married couple during one ad break, but I was so taken aback I can’t remember what they were supposed to be selling.”Aha! That of course undermines the argument in one fell swoop. As the legendary ad genius David Ogilvy put it in one of his thunderous treatises (so much more fun than Richard’s): “The function of advertising is to sell the product”.Advertisingis, despite what a lot of wanky underperforming creatives will tell you, the art of selling, and failure by a viewer to even register the product is certainly not going to register at the cash register.And so to the tills. As well as being Britain’s biggest retailer, Tesco is presumably the mortal foe of Pochin and Littlejohn, having recently been runningan ad campaignshowing a family gathering where some people are black and some are white and some are mixed. Yet the supermarket’ssales rose 7%this year. The chain is currently seeking people to fill28,500 temporary Christmas jobs. Is all this bad? It feels sort of … fine? Maybe we need another searing appearance by Sarah Pochin on TalkTV to explain the economics of it.Although, it must be said that there is a certain irony that Sarah’s ad rant occurred on Talk, which so few advertisers deemed worthy of bothering with that it had to ditch its linear TV model last year and move to streaming. Even that way, however, it can only operate as an ad-supported channel, so another thing to drive Sarah mad is the reality that her appearance was financially supported by precisely the kind of melting-pot commercial break she regards as culturicidal. This is what it must feel like to know a spectacle is completely wrong but still have to haul your arse out there and participate in it. I imagine she sees herself like Katniss in the Hunger Games.As for the rest of us, anyone who has got this far through 2025 will have detected that we are in the middle of a great unmooring, where the undoubted cultural excesses of one era are giving way to the likely even less healthy cultural excesses of the next. Some people feel they have reacquired the ability to say things about legitimate subjects which they feel they were warned off for a long while. But this new licence – or newly reissued licence – has opened the gate to other people saying any old rubbish at all, even when it tips into dangerously irrational bigotry and worse.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Populism offers simple answers to complex problems, but time and again it has been shown ultimately to offer no answer at all. Instead, it trades in deflections. This is why you will find it fixating on utter irrelevances like telly advertising when a number of interlinked crises threaten to explode entire political orders or financial markets.

Millions who rent privately, or are in temporary accommodation, remain unprotectedTue 28 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 12.33 EDTShareWhen two-year-old Awaab Ishak tragicallydied in 2020after prolonged exposure to mould in his family’s housing association flat, it shocked the nation. His parents, Faisal and Aisha, turned unimaginable grief into tireless campaigning to ensure no other child would die from the same neglect. Their determination has led to thepassing of Awaab’s law– a landmark piece of legislation that will finally hold social landlords to account when it comes to tackling mould, damp and other hazards in people’s homes.This law, which requires social landlords to investigate and repair dangerous issues, such as mould, within strict timeframes, is a victory for justice, compassion and common sense. It puts in writing what should always have been true – that every child, every parent and every person deserves to live in a home that is safe and fit for human habitation.Awaab’s parents deserve the highest praise. They refused to let their son’s death be just another statistic in the housing crisis. Through their strength, they’ve forced a long-overdue reckoning within social housing – a sector that, for too long, has tolerated excuses, delay and negligence at the expense of human life. I want to extend my heartfelt admiration and thanks to them. Their courage will save lives.But while Awaab’s law is a step forward, it is not the end of the journey. In its current form, the law only applies to social housing – council and housing association homes. That leaves out millions of renters in the private sector and the thousands of familiesstuck in temporary accommodation, where conditions are often just as bad, if not worse.Every week, I speak to people living in homes infested with mould or with leaking ceilings, broken heating, or unsafe electrics. Too many of these homes are privately rented or owned by councils but managed by private companies. I’ve seen mums trying to clean black mould off the walls while their children wheeze with asthma during the night. I’ve seen damp eating away at plaster, ceilings collapsing, and families forced to live in one room because the rest of their home is uninhabitable.If Awaab’s law truly stands for the principle that no one should live in unsafe housing, that protection cannot stop at the door of social housing. The private rented sectoris home to more than 11 millionpeople in England, including many of the most vulnerable. These tenants often have little power, may face revenge evictions when they complain, and are trapped paying sky-high rents for homes in disrepair.Then there’stemporary accommodation– a system that is supposed to offer short-term refuge for those facing homelessness, but has become a long-term trap. More than 100,000 households, including more than 172,000 children, are living in temporary accommodation in England alone today. Many are placed in properties that are damp, unsafe, or even infested with vermin. Yet because they’re not classified as permanent tenants, they often have no recourse to complain or demand repairs.We cannot celebrate Awaab’s law while allowing these families to fall through the cracks. Extending the law to cover private and temporary accommodation would ensure that all landlords – whether social, private, or contracted – are held to the same basic legal duty: to provide safe, habitable homes within enforceable time limits.But even that won’t be enough unless the law is properly funded and enforced. Right now, local authoritiesare struggling. Environmental health officers and housing enforcement teams have been cut to the bone. Councils can barely keep up with inspections, let alone proactive enforcement. Without funding for training, staff, and legal support, Awaab’s law risks becoming another well-intentioned rule that exists on paper but fails in practice.This isn’t just a housing issue – it’s a public health emergency. Mould, damp, and disrepair lead to respiratory illness, anxiety, and even death. The NHS spends an estimated £1.4bn a year treating conditions caused or worsened by poor housing. Fixing homes isn’t just a moral duty; it’s an economic necessity.If the government wants Awaab’s legacy to mean real change, it must do three things. First, extend the law to include private renters and those in temporary accommodation. Second, fund local authorities properly so they can investigate complaints and enforce the law. And last, make sure that tenants are protected from eviction or retaliation when they speak up about unsafe conditions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You, too, he tells his followers, can live the millionaire lifestyle plastered all over his social media accounts; the secret is housing vulnerable people at the taxpayer’s expense. The TikTokerLuigi Newton, who says he started out working in a call centre and now manages a string of mostly social housing properties remotely from overseas, is just one of a new breed of landlord influencers boasting about the supposedly rich pickings to be made from buying up and renovating cheap housing to rent to social housing providers, ensuring a steady, hassle-free stream of government-backed income dropping into their accounts.In one video, Newton admits he’s had flak online because one of his main clients is the outsourcing giant Serco, which mostly houses refugees: to him that’s a good thing, he says earnestly,because he feels he’s “really helping”people who need housing in desperate circumstances. But, perhaps more to the point for some of his followers, he reckons it’s more lucrative than renting to working professionals, thanks to the way the leases work.If there’s something disturbing about seeing Britain’s asylum crisis framed as a get-rich-quick scheme, TikTok landlords are in many ways the least of anyone’s problems. They’re just small fry, the most visible and least subtle end of a much bigger corporate phenomenon; an under-examined corner of the property market, responding perfectly logically to the incentives inadvertently created by a blundering state. Welcome to the asylum and immigration scandal you rarely hear about: the one that isn’t actually about asylum seekers, but about political failure, and the middle men turning a tidy profit on the consequences.This week,a blistering reportfrom the Conservative-chaired home affairs select committee accused the Home Office of wasting potentially billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money on a 10-year contract with three providers to house asylum seekers in private rented properties and, more controversially, in hotels. Since it’s more obvious to resentful locals when the place they once held their wedding receptions starts hosting large groups of young male asylum seekers than when the tenant in some anonymous bedsit changes, the shift to hotels that has been politically toxic. But it’s also been vastly more expensive.The committee found that the estimated costs for the deal signed in 2019 with three big providers – the aforementioned Serco, plus Clearsprings and Mears – have tripled from £4.5bnto an eye-watering £15.3bn. The Home Office was so focused on “high-risk, poorly planned” wheezes such as sending asylum seekers to Rwanda, the committee found, that it lost control of the basics, including the day-to-day business of managing all the asylum seekers stuck in limbo while it chased political rainbows. Or, to put it another way, tough talk turns out to be not only a cruel but a surprisingly expensive political substitute for actually doing something.The human consequences of all this are painful. Taxpayers’ money that could have gone into something infinitely more life-enhancing has seemingly been wasted. Traumatised people have spent years cooped up in hotel rooms never designed for the purpose, increasingly fearful of the angry protesters gathering at the gates, while the far right has found itself a powerful grievance. And yet still Whitehall finds itself locked into contracts that aren’t delivering for anyone. There’s an asylum scandal here all right: just not one that Reform or the Tories are enormously comfortable talking about, for all their much-touted antipathy to waste.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some will have gone to landlords, butover halfof the 2024-25 asylum support budget went to hotels, which were originally used as a temporary quick fix for housing vulnerable people – not just asylum seekers, but homeless people or victims of domestic violence – during the pandemic when the tourist trade dried up, but which have become a permanent fallback. Is it entirely a coincidence that, as the committee found, hotels also seem to be more lucrative for the big providers? And then there are the signs of worryingly sloppy management by the Home Office identified in the report: though under the terms of the contract the providers were meant to keep 5% of the profits, returning any excess to the taxpayer, the committee calculated there was at least£46m lying in corporate bank accountsthat the Home Office hadn’t chased up. Meanwhile, a National Audit Office spot check found invoices paid by the Home Office for beds that turned out not to exist.But following the money doesn’t, in this case, simply take us to the billions spent through badly managed contracts. It also takes us to the public money that didn’t get spent on making the asylum system fit for purpose – the original false economy that got us into this mess. Britain would never have needed to corral so many human beings into hotel rooms for years on end if it had been processing asylum claims within six months. That’s hardly an unreasonable goal: it was met for87% of applicants in 2014, but by 2023, the six-month decision ratehad collapsed to just 16%, leaving applicants to languish far too long in a state of uncertainty. Successive post-Brexit governments chose bluster, blaming activist lawyers instead of spending enough to ensure the system could actually cope.They wasted years arguing that the answer was deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda, even as it became blindingly obvious the plan was never going to work, and that pausing asylum claims in order to pursue this policy was only making the backlog worse. Now, having bequeathed this shambles to the nation, all the Tories can seemingly do is blame their successors for not sorting it out fast enough. God grant us all the unstoppableself-confidence of a Robert Jenrick, who isn’t going to let the little fact of having been immigration minister when the shift to asylum hotels was under way stop him turning up at protests against these hotels.There are no easy ways out of this hole. Labour’s plan toclose asylum hotels for good by 2029is at least practical. It involves speeding up the processing of asylum claims, while casting around for a quick and temporary housing solution, most likely on disused military bases. But the committee warns it won’t be easy or painless. It will also involve turning around one of the most demoralised departments in Whitehall. Let’s hope, meanwhile, the lesson learned is broader: cheap fixes, in the end, can cost much more than money.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumOpinionHousingLabourHome OfficeSercocommentShareReuse this content"

After another nightmare week, many in the dark watches must ask themselves why the hell they gave their lives to this brutally thankless task.Their inheritance was even more ruinous than feared: they were bequeathed landmines, dishonest traps and gaping holes. Brexit is emerging as even more economically crippling than expected,now losing the exchequer£80bn a year. They are blighted by bad luck: the Trump destroyer landed on their watch. What worse mishap than a prison officer setting free arefused asylum-seeker sex offender? Small boat arrivals feel unstoppable. An unfortunate deputy leadership election right now was bound to give Keir Starmer a bruising. The11% vote shareat the Caerphilly Senedd byelection might not even be their nadir.They expect brickbats, but they are human. As often, Wes Streeting dares say what all can see:that there is“deep disillusionment in this country at the moment” and “a growing sense of despair about whether anyone is capable of turning this country round”. The “change” Labour promised is not yet visible; we still lack a guiding light towards better things to come.Yet, even so, the current vitriolic state of public opinion is perplexing and alarming. Keir Starmer isthe most unpopularprime minister ever. Really? He is a decent, serious man of good intentions, without undue arrogance or vanity. Compare that with Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, or the breezy presumption of David Cameron, all with so little to justify conceited self-confidence; in it for fun.But, say the people, Starmer is worse. As prime minister, he’s short on charisma, they say: more seriously, he lacks political agility, ingenuity or instinct for where the wind blows. Labour blundered over cuts for pensioners and disabled people, unbalanced by generosity elsewhere. Uncertain which voters to appeal to, the party has left good policies unheralded, from working rights to green investment, new towns and ayouth guaranteeto get young people into work and training. Too many close advisers still think the Daily Mail-inflected right needs wooing, whenalmosttwice as many votershave moved leftwards since Labour took office. Polling guru John Curticewarns themto stop chasing Reform voters: they’ve gone.Labour’s leader is failing; there’s no denying it when pollsters suggest no leader couldever return from these unplumbed depths. But in the uncharted waters of such extreme volatility, history may be no guide. Starmer pulled Labour from a post-Jeremy Corbyn slough of despond that history said couldn’t be turned around in one term. He recoveredfrom losing Hartlepool, wasdragged back from resigningin despair. He made astirring conference speech, so there’s impatience for follow through.Would anyone else do better, or have we reached a near-ungovernable, insatiable public state of mind? Any government may be rejected just as rapidly once in power, however great its landslide victory, unless it arrives in a gilded chariot bearing untold bounty for stricken public services and empty private purses. None is on the horizon. Golden promises from parties in opposition raising wild hopes dashed in office are a dismal future for democracy, stirred by malevolent social media into perpetual angry disappointment.Unsurprisingly, panic on the back benches will make talk of leadership change rife if May’s elections go as badly as predicted – or, some suggest, sooner. I see aficionados reaching for the Labour party rulebook, reminding one another of a little-noticed but key change made at last year’s conference. It’s now easier to challenge a sitting leaderat any time of yearwith a nomination backed by 20% of Labour MPs – currently, 80 of them. Before, a leader was safe except in a brief pre-conference window.But who? Andy Burnham made his availability knownwith well-received radicalism, especially on electoral reform. Streeting madethe best speech of conferencewith an intelligent yearning to pull leftwards. Other leaders are available. But defenestration is a tough call for Labour MPs, who are reluctant to copy the Tories’ chaotic revolving door: Starmer arrived as the sixth prime minister in eight years. Besides, a new leader may only get a nanosecond honeymoon before sinking under all the same intractable taxing dilemmas, besieged by the same social-media hate machine.Many MPs hope that Starmer is listening to clarion calls for change: be the change he wishes to see, they urge. But does he dare, his critics ask? His “decade of renewal” urgently needs renewing. Next month’s tax-raising budget will meet a storm of outrage from the right, already damning Labour’s “raid on the middle class”. Shrieking headlines will tell even beneficiaries that they have been gouged by socialism.Here’s ministers’ paradox: Labour’s only hope lies in despair. Assume they will be wiped out whatever, so use this massive majority for four more years to follow their natural social democratic instinct: make radical tax reforms, raising plenty. Expect to lose the next election, so do everything now. Forget opinion polls and focus groups; let voters see sincerity in their purpose. The only way to restore some respect is to do transparently what they think most right and fair.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The bright light from Caerphilly showed the strong “stop Reform” impulse, withover 60% of an exceptional turnoutrallying to keep Faragists out. That requires mass tactical voting for the likeliest anti-Farage candidate. Can Labour regain enough respect from all progressives to ensure they are lent votes in the right seats?Rachel Reeves rightly calls Reform “the single greatest threat” to our way of life. As the Tories virtually merge with Reform, an electoral pact of some kind threatens. Robert Jenrick and Nigel Farage last weekboth calledfor aburqa ban. Katie Lam, a heralded Tory newcomer,would deportthousands of legal permanent residents here for decades, urging a (presumablywhite) “culturally coherent” Britain: her leader, Kemi Badenoch,confirmsthat’s “broadly in line” with Tory policy. Shadow home secretary Chris Philprefused to callReform MP Sarah Pochin racist for complaining about too many “black and Asian people” in TV ads.As the Tories and Reform grow indistinguishable, the threat increases of rising nativist, xenophobic, divisive, anti-democratic extremism. Labour’s duty is to do whatever it takes to prevent it. Prepare for coalition, be acceptable to progressive partners when the name ofthe party matters less than the deep red line against a political danger unknown in our lifetime.

Unfortunately, signals from the government suggest this may be another reform process that fails to deliver the progress we need – despite everyone agreeing that Australia’s biodiversity is in catastrophic decline.When introduced, the EPBC Act was a historic reform by a conservative government. For the first time since federation, the Australian parliament exercised its full suite of constitutional powers to regulate environmentally harmful actions on all tenures.The EPBC Act gave the federal environment minister direct control over actions affecting “matters of national environmental significance”, which include threatened species (like koalas, potoroos, bandicoots, swift and superb parrots and more than 1,400 plant species) and our world and national heritage sites. Early litigation highlighted the potential of the act – for example, a conservation group in north Queensland secured an injunction to prevent lychee farmers using large electric grids to kill spectacled flying foxes.It’s up to each of us to help save life on Earth – I love this challenge | Bob BrownRead moreImportantly, the act established a framework that could evolve. Notably, it allows for regulations to be made to add new “triggers” (which dictate when environmentally harmful activities need approval) and to deem certain classes of actions to be within existing triggers.Sadly, the act has failed to realise its potential. There are three main reasons for this.First, the commonwealth bureaucracy has failed to enforce the existing laws. Actions that breach the act have been taken by proponents without attracting any sanctions. This includes land-clearing that has routinely not been referred for approval, despite having significant impacts on threatened species.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterSecond, mechanisms in the act that could have expanded its scope, and provided certainty about its scope, have not been utilised. Regulations could have been made to deem land-clearing over a specified threshold as requiring approval. A climate change trigger could have been added at any time – indeed, back in 2000, a draft climate change trigger was published by the Howard government but never enacted.Third, the exemption for native forest logging should have been phased out. Instead, it was extended.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unless a reset occurs, the reforms cannot deliver substantive additional environment protection. Australia’s extinction rate – already one of the highest in the world – will get worse.The highest priority for the reforms must be to ensure land-clearing is properly regulated. Since the act commenced in 2000, more than 11.5m hectares of native forests have been cleared, including more than 3m hectares of remnant (intact) native vegetation. Amendments should prohibit the clearing of remnant vegetation, other than in exceptional circumstances where parliament decides the clearing is needed for an essential project. All clearing of mature regrowth (previously cleared vegetation that has regenerated and not been disturbed for 15 to 25 years) should require approval if it exceeds a specified area threshold. And any clearing should only be approved if its impacts on threatened species are fully offset through the restoration of cleared or degraded examples of the same ecosystem.We suggest three simple KPIs for the reform process. Within 12 months, clearing of remnant vegetation should be near zero and there should be an initial 50% reduction in mature regrowth clearing. The native forest logging exemption should be removed. And all projects likely to directly or indirectly result in 50,000 tonnes or more of greenhouse gas emissions a year – on average or at their peak – should trigger the act and all emissions from these projects should be subject to a carbon price that aligns with the aims of the Paris agreement. If the Howard government could propose a climate trigger in 2000, it can hardly be described as radical in 2025.Unfortunately, rather than fixing the gaps in the triggers and what is regulated, the reform process has focused instead on the introduction of “national standards” and the creation of an environment protection authority (EPA) to oversee the enforcement of the act’s requirements.Standards will be important in limiting the broad discretion that now exists when approval decisions are made. However, such standards are of limited value if the projects that pose the biggest environmental risk – such as land-clearing – are not regulated. Similarly, while there is value in a properly constituted and independent EPA, this is also not the main game. Failure to address the scope of the act means the EPA will be a mere observer as land-clearing continues unabated, native forests are logged and our biodiversity continues to decline.Real reform means that, in five years’ time, we can celebrate measurable improvements rather than read another report on how the act has failed to play its role in reversing the decline in Australia’s environment.Atticus Fleming AM is the chief executive of the Great Southern Land Conservancy and was previously the head of the New South Wales National Parks andWildlifeService.

She was the first dramatic actor to play the latter on television, and won a Bafta nomination for doing so.However, Scales, who has died aged 93, knew that public memory of her would be shaped by another woman. One who made those two royals look powerless – the self-declared domestic and hospitality industry empress, Sybil Fawlty, wife of Basil, owner of the worst hotel in Torquay in Fawlty Towers, in which she co-starred with John Cleese, who also co-wrote with Connie Booth.Though occupying only a few months of work in a seven-decade career that stretched from Lydia Bennet in a 1952 BBC Pride and Prejudice to a cameo in ITV’s The Royal (2011), the dozen episodes of the 1975 and 1979 series of Fawlty Towers have achieved rerun immortality. They have become a template for perfection in sitcom writing and performances, including Scales’s.In naming the character, Cleese brought into play the classical associations of various Sybils with prophecy, longevity, guarding the gates of hell and, above all, inducing terror in mortal men. Especially effective at the last of these, Scales, an accomplished classical stage actor, knowingly channelled these mythical women.Sybil cowed her husband with what might be called a Basilisk stare. The single word of another character’s name might not seem the most promising basis for a national catchphrase, but Scales created one from “Basil!”. All professional impressionists and many amateur ones at pubs and bus stops soon had it in their repertoire.Scales was especially skilful in the elasticity of her delivery. Sometimes she barked so hard and fast that “Basil” seemed to have only one syllable. But elongating words like an opera singer gave Sybil another of her signature tics: the gossipy, “Oh, I knoooooow!”, that would punctuate phone calls to unseen friends. Further evidence of her perfect ear came when Basil was given a line about Sybil’s laugh sounding like “someone machine-gunning a seal.” It de facto became a demanding stage direction for Scales – which she pulled off effortlessly.View image in fullscreenJohn Cleese and Prunella Scales as Basil and Sybil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers.Photograph: BBC-1At script meetings these days, there would be concerns about the characterisation of Sybil being misogynistic or a stereotypical henpecker, and Cleese has said that the first script was rejected by the BBC partly on the grounds that it depicted a standard marital battleground.In fact, the Cleese and Booth scripts were part of a trend inTV comedyof that era to give women strength and agency by dramatising their dominance over feckless men. Scales’s portrayal won sympathy for Mrs Fawlty by showing the character’s imperious manner to be a reasonable response to the snivelling idiocies and deceits of her husband. There was deliberate physical comedy in the 6ft 5in Cleese shrivelling at the voice of the 5ft 3in Scales.That stature made her exactly the right height for Elizabeth II. Her portrayal of the then current monarch in A Question of Attribution (BBC One, 1991) – adapted by Alan Bennett from his stage play in which she had appeared at the National Theatre three years earlier – came with multiple degrees of difficulty.Some conservative broadcasting grandees balked at the thought of dramatising a living monarch, which, outside of comedy lookalikes such as Jeanette Charles, had long been a taboo in English culture. And whereas theatre is a more artificial medium, Scales was playing her on TV alongside appearances of the real Queen on news bulletins and the annual Christmas Day broadcast. Scales, though, managed to be a spitting image without ever risking seeming like Spitting Image.Though four inches taller than the famously diminutive Victoria, Scales captured everything else in the 2003 two-hour drama-documentary Looking for Victoria, directed by Louise Osmond, in which the actor was shown researching her stage show about the monarch between fictional interludes.Scales brought to her screen work comic technique perfected in theatre. But TV also allowed her to play a choice part that had eluded her on stage: as Marion, a woman descending into alcoholism across the three successive Christmas Eve parties depicted in the 1985 BBC One seasonal treat production of Alan Ayckbourn’s 1972 play, Absurd Personal Singular.Scales appeared on screen with her husband, the actor Timothy West, in her last substantial TV contribution, a long-running Channel 4 travelogue, Great Canal Journeys (2014-21). The show began happily, with the couple celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary and revisiting honeymoon sites, but became progressively more poignant as subsequent series were candid about the diagnosis and progress of Scales’s dementia, becoming the last public service of a great career in raising awareness of the condition and its management.Millions of Britons will have heard the word “Basil!” echoing happily in their heads today, a tribute to one of many great creations of a consummate comedy performer.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV comedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bill Nighy wrestled with it in the run-up to The Vertical Hour opening on Broadway. Juliet Stevenson has likened it to “a disease”. It has even caused some to take flight:Stephen Fry disappeared from Cell Mates, whileLenny Henry left the stage during Educating Rita. “I’ve completely gone,” he said – although he did return to finish the show.Stage fright can cause the shakes but it can also trigger a complete physical freeze-up, to say nothing of a total verbal drying up – all right under the spotlight. So how and why does it take grip? Can it be overcome? And what does it feel like to be seized by the actor’s nightmare?It felt like a million years passed between my first line and my secondMeera Syal describes a classic anxiety dream: “I find myself in a costume I don’t recognise, in a role I can’t remember, looking at audiences while I’m naked.” Decades of experience did not render her immune in 2010, while performing a preview ofWilly Russell’s Shirley Valentine. “Doing a one-woman show for two and half hours?” she says. “That’s the thing that is going to give you stage fright. I was honestly thinking of ‘doing a Stephen Fry’ just before press night. I could see the open door leading to the courtyard at the back and I thought, ‘If I ran away now, they wouldn’t be able to find me.’”Syal found the courage to stay, then promptly forgot her lines – but just soldiered on through the haze. “I looked into the abyss and I thought, ‘I’ll get out of it.’ And I did. The character of Shirley Valentine could be improvised because the whole thing was her talking to the audience. So I just made my way around the set and had a little think to myself until the lines came back. I improvised for three or four minutes, speaking complete twaddle in character.”View image in fullscreen‘I completely lost it’ … Larry Lamb, left, with Samuel West in Hamlet at the RSC, 2001.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianLarry Lamb has contended with intense nerves over decades of stage work. When he started out as an amateur actor, long before Gavin and Stacey, he loved the rehearsal process but performing filled him with fear. “The minute I got in front of an audience,” he says, “it all started to cloud over. My knees would start knocking uncontrollably.”The stage fright didn’t lessen when he became a professional. “It went on for about 30 years, but I just got better and better at hiding it.” In 2001, he dried upas Claudius in Hamlet, for the Royal Shakespeare Company. “It was the first preview at Stratford-upon-Avon. I was just into my opening speech, when Claudius is addressing the people of Denmark, when my words got lost in space. It got worse and worse and worse. The whole cast were up on the stage, looking at me as I completely lost it.”He got through that performance but thedirector, Steven Pimlott, recognised what had happened. “He realised I wasn’t in control but only looking as if I was. He said, ‘You’re not engaging with the audience. When the lights come down, you then block them out.’”Pimlott kept the house lights on so Lamb would have to acknowledge the audience’s presence. It was a turning point in the actor’s career. “Little by little, it got better. Because we were doing the show for the best part of the year, gradually the stage fright went away, until I was confident and directly engaging with the audience.”Now 78, Lamb no longer has the energy for plays but relishes his live shows, performing his own poetry. He says that, as an actor, he kept getting in the way of his character. “You’re not allowing the the space – it’s too much you, not enoughcharacter.”Harmony Rose-Bremner, who wascast in The Yearsin 2024, agrees. “Self-consciousness and self-doubt go against everything you’re trying to do – which is to be free, let go, fully immerse yourself in the character. The question is, ‘Can I make space in my head to let the character through?’” In The Years, as one of five actors all playing the same woman in different stages of her life, she was thrilled yet felt intimidated. “I’ve grown up doing theatre. It was always my happy place. I didn’t ever think I’d ever feel performance anxiety.”View image in fullscreen‘Like your breath is being sucked up’ … Harmony Rose-Bremner, right, with the cast of The Years.Photograph: Phil Fisk/The ObserverShe remembers the night of the first preview. “I actually didn’t know if I could go on,” she says. “It was the first time I’d felt like that.” She managed, but felt overwhelmed in the very opening scene. “We were all standing still, just speaking out into the dark. We weren’t looking at one other so we didn’t have each other to bounce off. There were just the lines that I’d heard so many times, coming towards me. I had the classic symptoms that I’d had in miniature before – but never to this extent. The sensation of not being able to breathe properly, like your breath is being sucked up with a vacuum in your chest. There is nothing to hold on to.” It is compounded by the feeling of not wanting to let fellow actors down: “I felt the responsibility to everybody else. I thought, ‘Can I get through this immense thing?’”Zachary Hart blames imposter syndrome for causing his stage fright. A lower back condition ruled out his aspirations to be a footballer, and he was working as a fork-lift truck driver when a friend applied to drama school on his behalf and he got in. “Standing up in front of people was completely foreign to me, so at drama school I would go last every time we did something. I stycj at ut because it was pure escapism – and was better than factory work. I was going to try my hardest to beat the fear.”His first acting job was in Nicholas Hytner’sJulius Caesar at the Bridge theatre. When the cast were told the production would be filmed for NT Live, he was “petrified”. Years later, in the first preview ofThe Constituent, in which he was cast alongside James Corden and Anna Maxwell-Martin, he spoke his first line. “I heard my voice – with its strong Black Country accent – and looked out into this beautiful theatre, with its three-tonne chandelier in my peripheral vision.” He had seldom heard that accent on stage before. “I just froze. I felt I had fooled people to be there. It felt like a million years between my first and the second line. I can’t remember – but I think Anna jumped in.”View image in fullscreen‘I just froze’ … Zachary Hart, centre, with James Corden and Anna Maxwell Martin in The Constituent.Photograph: Manuel HarlanEarlier this year, Hart was cast in a star-studded revival ofThe Seagull, alongside Cate Blanchett, and was required to improvise. “I tried to empty my head when I went on, but an empty head is a nightmare for someone with stage fright. I was putting myself through the fear every night – and it was massively rewarding when it went right. But there was one night when I went on and saw Margot Robbie sitting out there, in front of Liz Truss. My brain couldn’t comprehend seeing them. Then the intrusive thoughts started.”Hart battled through and believes perfectionism might contribute to pre-performance nerves. Currently starring inthe West End hit Stereophonic, he says: “I fear not giving an audience member what they have paid an incredible amount of money to see. It’s about making sure you are performing up at 10. The perfectionism gets to me, but there is a duty that I must take seriously.”I remember what my drama school teacher said: ‘Your brain can’t think of two things at once'Can stage fright be bypassed? Rose-Bremner, who is playing Nina in The Seagull at the Edinburgh Lyceum and Chichester Festival theatre this autumn, says that what helps is to shift her focus from within her to what’s happening around her. “I remember one of my drama school teachers saying, ‘Your brain can’t think of two things at once. So focus on something outside your thoughts and feelings.’ I try to breathe and listen to something besides the voice in my head. It’s about using the other actors and the story to pull you out of the haze.”There are things, she says, that you can’t control. “Like the first night, and knowing someone really important is in the audience. But now I’ve made it a rule for myself that if people are talking about how ‘So and so is here’, I just avoid that conversation.”Hart has his own set of techniques – some drawn from his years of playing football while scouts were keenly watching. “Weirdly, that early training definitely helps on stage. You’re going out there, but remember – you can’t plan where the ball is going to go.”Syal suggests that the fearof what might go wrong is worse than the freezing itself. “When things do go wrong,” she says, “you find your way back. In the end, nobody dies – and audiences are very forgiving.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreActingAnxietyMeera SyalWest EndfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For others, raised on The Real Housewives and boxing weigh-ins, it just wasn’t dramatic enough.This, you’d have to say, is not an issue with Physical: Asia. This time, it’s a team competition featuring competitors from eight countries (including, for some reason, Australia) and right from the off, things feel a lot more dramatic.In previous seasons, the stars of the show were the likes of UFC fighter Dong Hyun Kim and judo champ Yoshihiro “Sexyama” Akiyama. This time, eight-weight boxing greatManny Pacquiaois undoubtedly the marquee name – half of the athletes look genuinely awed to be in his presence – but it’s Team Oz who make the biggest impact. “We’re leaving number one, that’s the only way this ends,” announces team captain Robert “the Reaper” Whittaker via voiceover, as his team scream, snarl and whoop their way into the arena, sprinting around to high-five all the other competitors. Moments later a handstand competition kicks off, with all the CrossFitters andParkourtraceurs effortlessly outclassed by a rake-thin Cirque du Soleil performer who, you fear, might be having his best moment of the competition.The team captains are prompted to make a speech: Japan and Korea talk about the inspiration they take from their country’s people and spirit, Mongolia (who get the occasional hawk-squeal SFX when they appear on-screen) note that they’re descendants of Genghis Khan, and the Aussies simply promise to run through anyone who gets in their way.About 10 minutes later, things are going much worse for the acrobats. The first round is a battle to keep the most team members on one of several sumo-ring-sized podiums and things very quickly seem wildly unfair. The heaviest man in the contest, 175kg strongman competitor Eddie Williams, is literally three times the weight of some of the female competitors, and anyone who’s never grappled with another person seems at a distinct disadvantage. “I hate contact sports,” murmurs a retired rower, eyeing up the assorted judo champions and combat sambo athletes strategising about how to best hurl him off a raised platform. Probably should have watched the first two seasons before you signed the contract, buddy.This sort of cross-cultural sporting exchange, though, is a big part of the fun. “Australian jumping boy, the restless one, what’s his deal?” asks a Turkish oil wrestler who – and I’m hoping he’d take this as a compliment – looks like a barrel wrapped in muscle and hair. “Oh, he’s a Parkour guy,” says female freestyle grappler Yasemin Adar Yiğit, shortly before having a good go at fighting three large men at once. A tiny judo champ grabs an outsized ssireum wrestler and declares his technique a bit amateurish, a baseball player puts up a surprising amount of resistance against an Australian rugby prop, and an Olympic gold-winning bobsleigh racer tries to throw a swimmer down a hill.The team element works incredibly well and there are moments of strategic deviousness that fit the reality TV format perfectly – it’s all a good, clean, everyone-signed-the-waiver-right? lark and, miraculously, everyone makes it out of the first challenge without getting injured. Next up: hauling sandbags through an enormous shipwreck.This sort of mildly-repetitive fitness fodder is perfect for Netflix: the ideal thing to help you power through some treadmill sprints first thing in the morning (parts of this review were written etc, etc), but also great brainless only-half-watching-it nonsense for the end of a long day. Weirdly, the challenges are much more relatable when they’re simpler: when everyone’s ziplining around with 50-kilo crates it almost looks manageable, but when you’re watching chiselled physical specimens sprint between cones for half an hour (a classic from season one), you get a great sense of how outclassed you’d be.There are already American and Italian versions of the Physical franchise in the works: hopefully a UK version featuring Tom Daley and Luke Littler isn’t far away. If you’re having trouble making up the numbers, Netflix, give me a call: I can’t do a backflip or out-sprint Jessica Ennis-Hill, but I’ll smack-talk Eddie Hall until he throws me down a hill.Physical: Asia is on Netflix.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewNetflixReality TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

There’s also a full-size fibreglass horse, already halfway through the door. It’s being ridden by a mannequin who is wearing a garland of artificial flowers and, under that, a shirt patterned with green men, Uffington White Horse references and oak leaves. It’s identical to the one worn by the living, breathing artist standing next to me.A highlight of Edge’s upcoming exhibition at London’s Fitzrovia Chapel, the sculpture is titled Where Must We Go in Search of Our Better Selves. It’s a self-portrait like no other, riffing on the magnificent equestrian monuments of the Renaissance, and honouring the Garland King, a figure from the recesses of British folklore, who each May rides through the Derbyshire village of Castleton. “The Garland King has become a symbol for me,” Edge says. “I see it as representing a process of finding your own nature, of going inward.”Ten years ago, Edge stumbled across a druid ceremony at London’s Tower Hill. It was the spring equinox, it turns out: “As I came out of the station, I saw in the distance this line of people in white cloaks walking past a red phone box, a KFC, a Wetherspoon’s. They assembled in a circle, and started talking about this idea of reconnecting to nature, and that London will one day be reclaimed by nature. They were putting seeds on the ground. It was a real awakening for me.”View image in fullscreen‘There’s a myth that our folk culture is in trouble’ … Edge with some recent paintings.Photograph: Sylvie Tata PhotographySince then, Edge has become a leading light in the British folk renaissance. It’s an artistic movement drenched in the storytelling, crafts and beliefs that sought to bind communities to nature. From wassailing in January to morris dancing at the spring equinox, discovering and documenting such time-honoured practices rescued Edge from chronic depression, and provides inspiration for works that combine poetic mysticism with social realism.In a climate of far-right politics driven by what seems like a national identity crisis, Edge’s folkloric quest inevitably overlaps with those lamenting the passing of Merrie Olde England. “There’s a myth that our folk culture is in trouble,” he says. In fact, he adds, it’s thriving. What has changed is that now people are talking about it.Children of Albion, the epic quasi-altarpiece that gives Edge’s exhibition its title explores the richness of Britain’s history in fabulous detail. Fusing the grotesque topsy-turviness of Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights with the surreal humour of Terry Gilliam, it’s the culmination of a body of work that began after the double crises of Brexit and the pandemic.View image in fullscreenStone island … Orkney by Ben Edge.Photograph: Sylvie Tata Photography/Copyright the artist“In this post-Brexit era, we’re all grappling with who we are as a country,” he says. “I had to paint Children of Albion because I needed to puzzle it all out.” The result is a visual survey of the people and events that have shaped the British Isles, with refugees in boats, Stonehenge, Viking raids, and the miners’ strike taking their places alongside morris dancers and the slave trade.The paper umbrella in this volatile cocktail of ingredients is “Albion”, the ancient word for pre-Roman Britain. These days, it’s more readily associated with white supremacy than the universal vision of humanity proposed by the Romantic poet and artist William Blake. But Edge, inspired by Blake, represents Albion as a beneficent figure, presiding over the vast oil painting like the risen sun. “In Blake’s personal mythology, Albion was a sleeping giant,” Edge explains. The painting shows the moment of his awakening: “The idea is that this happens by truly accepting who we are as a nation and finding a way to move forward.”My only connection to the environment was putting my recycling in the right binIf our mishmash of regional customs seems ill-equipped to bring tolerance and unity to our stressed-out, fractured society, Edge disagrees, pointing out that folk traditions the world over are rooted in universal concerns – birth and death, the changing seasons. He believes that reconnecting with ancient customs offers a radical strategy to address the crises of our age. “When I was really clinically depressed, I had no connection to nature,” he says. “I’d been living in the city for 10 years and my only connection to the environment was putting my recycling in the right bin.” For him, restoring this fractured relationship with nature is the key to addressing the climate emergency.The lockdowns were transformative, he says. “Covid brought a fundamental shift in people’s mindsets about Britain and the climate crisis – even Black Lives Matter came out of it. It was obviously a huge tragedy, but people had time to think. They started falling in love with their immediate landscapes and feeling a sense of pride. It was probably a bit confusing at first, because post-Brexit a lot of left-leaning people felt almost done with the country.”Edge alludes to our warped relationship with nature in the plastic flowers of Where Must We Go in Search of Our Better Selves,but they are also a nod to the people who each year make folk traditions happen, improvising costumes and props with whatever comes to hand. His own operation is similarly independent in spirit. “There isn’t a gallery that’s going to come along and save you – you need to build your own art world,” he says. “The minute I had that realisation, everything started going pretty well for me.”Ben Edge: Children of Albion is at the Fitzrovia Chapel, London, 6-26 NovemberExplore more on these topicsArtFolklore and mythologyBritish identity and societySocial historyDepressionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bogarde described his co-star as ‘extraordinary’.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarMoviesObituaryBjörn Andrésen obituaryActor who starred as the angelic boy Tadzio in the 1971 film Death in Venice - but found the resulting fame a ‘nightmare’Ryan GilbeyTue 28 Oct 2025 12.12 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 12.15 EDTShare“It was a cool summer job”. That was how the actor Björn Andrésen, who has died aged 70, described the role that made him a star and ruined his life.InLuchino Visconti’s 1971 film of Thomas Mann’s novella Death in Venice, Andrésen was Tadzio, the angelic 14-year-old holidaying with his family at the same hotel as Gustav von Aschenbach, an ailing composer who is fleetingly revived and energised by his obsession with the boy.Dirk Bogarde, who played Aschenbach, called his young co-star “absolutely extraordinary”. He reported that Visconti “never allowed [him] to go into the sun, kick a football about with his companions, swim in the polluted sea, or do anything which might have given him the smallest degree of pleasure”. Bogarde described the boy “suffer[ing] it all splendidly” and going “like a lamb to the slaughter” to the makeup chair each morning. He also noted perceptively: “The last thing that Björn ever wanted, I am certain, was to be in movies.”View image in fullscreenAndrésen in Stockholm, 2021.Photograph: Fredrik Sandberg/TT/ShutterstockAndrésen was a 15-year-old aspiring musician when he auditioned successfully for the role at the insistence of his grandmother, a Mrs Worthington figure who raised him in Stockholm, his birthplace, following the disappearance and suicide of his single mother when he was 10. (His father’s identity is unknown.)His grandmother devoted herself to pushing him in front of any available camera; he was on TV playing the piano at the age of six or seven. “She felt I was so talented and should be world famous,” he said in 2003.He was proud to have landed a small role in the lyrical coming-of-age drama A Swedish Love Story (1970), the first film by Roy Andersson, who would go on to have a remarkable career as a morbid absurdist.Death in Venice was another matter. The audition footage, which is included inThe Most Beautiful Boy in the World, a 2021 documentary about Andrésen’s life, shows Visconti ordering him to smile and parade around the room. When told to undress, Andrésen laughs nervously but is soon down to his trunks, shifting awkwardly as he is inspected and evaluated by Visconti and his team.The last thing that Björn ever wanted, I am certain, was to be in moviesHaving won the role, he was denied a script, and the director forbade him from reading the original book. When Bogarde discovered that Andrésen had broken that rule, he warned him: “You do just what Visconti tells you and no more.” Dipping into Mann had at least lent him an insight into the meaning of his role: “I’m the Angel of Death, right?” he said correctly.What he delivers on screen is more presence than performance, as might be expected from a posable doll denied any hint of agency by Visconti. Whether dressed in sailor’s outfit or striped clingy bathing suit, Tadzio, who is more overtly sexualised on screen than in print, treats Venice as his own personal catwalk. One disapproving viewer wrote to the New York Times to complain that “the boy … is seductive from beginning to end, ‘cruising’ Aschenbach so often you wonder why the old man doesn’t sneak into an alley with him”.There was worse to come for Andrésen. He was mobbed at the film’s premiere at Cannes. “It felt like swarms of bats around me,” he said in the documentary. “It was a living nightmare.” At the accompanying press conference, Visconti joked about the boy losing his looks.On set, Visconti had warned his crew not to lay a finger on Andrésen. After shooting wrapped, “Visconti and the team took me to a gay nightclub … The waiters at the club made me feel very uncomfortable. They looked at me uncompromisingly as if I was a nice meaty dish.”View image in fullscreenLuchino Visconti, left, directing Sergio Garfagnoli (playing Jaschu) and Andrésen during the shooting of Death in Venice.Photograph: AlamyHis grandmother urged him to take on promotional duties for Death in Venice in Japan, where the film had been a hit. Once there, he was given a punishing schedule, plied with mysterious pills and strong-armed into a brief recording career.In his early 20s, he spent a year in Paris on the promise of a role in Malcolm Leigh’s film How Lovely Are the Messengers, which was never made. While waiting, he was installed in an apartment by an older man and paid a generous stipend. He also fielded unwanted attention in the form of gifts and even love poems from male admirers. He would later tell the documenatry’s directors, Kristina Lindström and Kristian Petri, that he “[didn’t] regret much, except for his time in Paris”.His life was subsequently blighted in other ways, too. He suffered from alcoholism and depression, and lost his nine-month-old son, Elvin, to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.Andrésen continued to play music to a high level, studied drama and ran a small theatre in Stockholm, and acted on and off in Swedish films and TV series. “I’ve been working hard to reach anonymity,” he said. No wonder he spoke out angrily in 2003 after an image of himself at 15, photographed by David Bailey, was used on the cover of The Boy, Germaine Greer’s coffee table book eroticising youthful masculinity. “I have a feeling of being utilised that is close to distasteful,” hecomplained.It was game of him to accept the splendid sick joke of starring in Ari Aster’s folk-horror filmMidsommar(2019) as an elderly man who volunteers to be a human sacrifice by stepping off a cliff. When the fall doesn’t quite kill him, a bystander helpfully finishes him off with a mallet to the face.By the time Andrésen was conducting promotional interviews for The Most Beautiful Boy in the World, he had lost none of his intelligence, sensitivity or air of mischief. Nor had his anger at Visconti dimmed. WhenI asked himwhat he would say to the director if he were still alive, he didn’t pause to consider his response: “Fuck off,” he said.He is survived by his daughter, Robine, from his marriage to the poet Susanna Román, who was also the mother of Elvin. The marriage ended in divorce.Björn Johan Andrésen, actor, born 26 January 1955; died 25 October 2025Explore more on these topicsFilmSwedenMidsommarobituariesShareReuse this content"

A long, pretentious, semi-coherent arthouse film about progress through architecture, starring Jon Voight’s erection and a man who can stop time for no apparent reason, was probably always going to struggle to make money.But to make it for over $100m of his own money and release it in 2024, in an age where the bulk of the public have largely given up on visiting the cinema, was disastrous. Its box office gross, in the end, was just $14.4m. For comparison, that puts it roughly in line with the gross of a French language biopic about Charles Aznavour released the same year. But that film cost four times less, didn’t open in any English-speaking countries and wasn’t about the proposed construction of a glowing golden city.View image in fullscreenHigh cost … Megalopolis.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyIn other words, Francis Ford Coppola is broke. But the good news is that this is an excellent time to be an obscenely wealthy watch collector. To shore up his funds a little, Coppola is holding what amounts to a hugely upmarket yard sale, in which he will sell one of his million-dollar watches.According to the New York Times, in December Coppola will auction off a self-designed timepiece made by FP Journe. The watch, called the FFC, doesn’t have hands to represent hours and minutes. Instead, the time is told via an armoured human hand in the middle of the face, the fingers of which move into various configurations depending on the time of day. Which is to say that the watch literally attempts to reinvent the way we tell time, even though nobody had a problem with the way we already did it, which does seem like a fairly Coppolaesque thing to want to do.Luckily for Coppola the watch is wildly expensive. A prototype sold at auction in 2021 for close to $3m, more than 10 times over its estimate. And while this doesn’t have the same cachet – unlike the prototype, it didn’t take eight years to make – it is still expected to reach seven figures.Upping the value is the fact that buyers won’t just be purchasing an insanely intricate timepiece, they’re also buying Francis Ford Coppola’s state of mind. When David Lynch’s estate auctioned off his belongings earlier this year, one of the main draws washis espresso machine, since his love of coffee was legendary. Similarly, what sort of multimillionaire Coppola fan would be able to turn down the opportunity to own a device that does a very simple thing in a punishingly complicated way? In that regard it’s less a watch and more the physical manifestation of Coppola’s entire reason to be.But let’s retain some perspective here. The FFC might be a once-in-a-lifetime watch that is completely out of the financial bounds of the majority of people. It is likely to become the most cherished possession of whoever buys it. However, it’s important to remember thatMegalopoliswas such an almighty boondoggle that the watch – this million-dollar, boundary-pushing artwork that took eight years to painstakingly manufacture – will only pay for about 82 seconds of its runtime.Of course, Francis Ford Coppola has other ways to make some of the money back. He’s selling some of his other watches, which range from $3,000 to $240,000 in value. He has been touring Megalopolis, accompanied by a talk called How to Change Our Future, with tickets going for $200 a pop. And there is also Megadoc, the StudioCanal-distributed documentary about the making of Megalopolis, which has already beenreviewed far more favourablythan the film itself.But, really, none of this matters. Francis Ford Coppola isn’t ever going to make all his Megalopolis money back, but we’re talking about a man who has spent his entire life making and losing fortunes over and over again. He has never been afraid to plough his money into a madcap artistic stream that never quite pays off, and he has always ended up being OK. The man is now 86 years old. If Megalopolis proves to be his final film, then at least he blew his money doing something that only he could have done. And if a billionaire ends up getting an unfathomable watch out of it, more the better.Explore more on these topicsFrancis Ford  CoppolaMegalopolisWatchesCollectingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As mysteries go, this one didn’t seem to last long. On Friday, Allen released hernew album West End Girl, which appears to concern her divorce from US actor David Harbour, with its highly detailed evisceration of an open marriage destroyed by a husband’s emotional affair with a woman called Madeline. By Sunday, the press had already declared they’d found Madeline: the Mail on Sunday printed an interview with a woman claiming she and Harbour had had a relationship.“Of course I’ve heard the song,” they reported her as saying. “But I have a family and things to protect … It’s a little bit scary for me.” (Harbour, for his part, has not responded to the album’s contents or to the Mail’s claims.)Lily Allen: West End Girl – a gobsmacking autopsy of marital betrayalRead moreOn the song Madeline, Allen (or her character) sings about messaging a woman her husband has been sleeping with, explaining her worries that emotions are now involved: “We had an arrangement / Be discreet and don’t be blatant / There had to be payment / It had to be with strangers / But you’re not a stranger, Madeline.” She then recites text messages sent by Madeline – “He told me you were aware this was going on and that he had your full consent / If he’s lying about that, then please let me know” – which the Mail claims were pulled from real messages.In interviews, Allen has said West End Girl references things she experienced in her marriage “but that’s not to say that it’s all gospel”. She told the Times that Madeline is “a fictional character” and also a construct of several people – an explanation that sounds legally advisable and suggestive that more people may yet come forward to declare themselves Madeline. (No, I’m Spartacus!) None of this is glorious. All of it is compelling.Compare Madeline, then, tothe story of Juline Whelan, a red-haired Canadian woman who came forward in 2016 to identify herself as the possible inspiration for Dolly Parton’s 1972 song Jolene, pop’s ultimate other woman. Parton herself has told a story about being inspired by a fan who approached her for autograph: “I said, ‘you’re the prettiest thing I’ve ever seen’. She had red hair, green eyes and fair skin. And I said ‘what is your name?’ and she said ‘Jolene’. I said, ‘I’m gonna write a song about you and if you ever hear it, you’ll know it was about you.’”But Whelan was just 10 when she approached Parton for a signature, which is far less alluring than the singer’s other explanation – that Jolene was inspired by an unnamed red-haired bank teller who would flirt with her husband whenever he went into the bank. A great story for a pop song – whereas Whelan just found her possible link to the track annoying,telling CBC: “She’s a hussy, man … what little kid wants to be ‘Jolene, don’t steal my man’?”Think back to the fervour that greeted Beyoncé’s 2016 album Lemonade and its many references to infidelities, which some of her fans speculated were about her husband Jay-Z. The most famous lyric in Sorry – about “Becky with the good hair” – immediately triggered an online witch-hunt to find the real Becky. Beyoncé remained tight-lipped; the song’s cowriter Diana Gordon called all the speculation “so silly”,adding: “In what day and age from that lyric do you get all of this information? Is it really telling you all that much, accusing people?”‘I don’t make it easy for myself’: divorce and desire power Lily Allen’s autofictional comebackRead moreSometimes it is better to not know, and just enjoy the mystery instead. Carly Simon, regrettably, revealed one of three male inspirations behind You’re So Vain (Warren Beatty) after decades of mutually enjoyed speculation. Ed Sheeran left so many details in Don’t that fans quickly assumed it was about Ellie Goulding; Taylor Swift, meanwhile, barely hides which ex she’s singing about, hooking fans with a constant sense they can spot the truth. Alanis Morissette, though, has never revealed who her splenetic You Oughta Know was about, sustaining the intrigue while also making it a more universal song.Whatever the truth or fiction, West End Girl has hit a nerve. It could just be our appetite for eye-watering gossip about a famous singer and her actor husband, sure – but it also reflects a new reality that married women (and men) are now facing, one where non-monogamy is becoming more common among the monogamous. Where Parton’s song was a desperate plea for a beautiful, flirtatious woman to respect her marriage and stay out, Allen’s songs tell the story of a wife who knows her husband is having sex with other women, and even signs off on it – but hates the possibility that he’s emotionally invested enough to do things like play tennis with them. “You’re just a little boy looking for his mummy,” she sings on the final track; Madeline, whoever she is, can clearly have him if she wants.Explore more on these topicsMusicLily AllenPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fifty! I’m gutted because he’s my favourite DJ at the moment. It’s a shame because gigs are such a wonderful communal experience and an outlet for life’s frustration. We’re missing out.”Seeing live music is becoming increasingly expensive across the UK, thanks in part to the cost of living crisis, as well as the rise of resale websites and some artists and promoters deployingdynamic ticket pricing. It’s leading some fans to rethink their gig-going habits.“I go a lot less frequently these days,” says Amy. “We’re especially getting ripped off in London. I was keen to see Lorde at the O2 in November, but I couldn’t justify it.”Amy has taken matters into her own hands and has booked a flight to Luxembourg to see Lorde play a show there for €50 (£43.62). “The flights were about £18 each way. With accommodation, it does put it over the London ticket – but I’m seeing a whole new country for that amount of money.”Mark Rushton, 65, from Bury, says the extra fees that come with larger gigs have put him off going to see shows in Manchester. “It’s the outrageous prices, plus booking fees and car parks. There are bigger venues than ever, yet limited availability. I can’t take my daughter to some shows as it can be hundreds of pounds for a night out.”Rushton points at Ticketmaster for “enabling” high fees, and the company has recentlyagreed to change its sales tacticsafter outraged Oasis fans complained about its handling of the band’s 2025 tour. At the behest of the Competition and Markets Authority, Ticketmaster must now give fans notice if there are going to be multiple prices for the same kind of ticket, and give them more information about ticket pricing while they are in online queues. . (Ticketmaster told the Guardian in a statement: “In a highly competitive UK market, Ticketmaster’s fees have remained largely unchanged – averaging around 11% – for nearly a decade. These fees power the technology, security, and customer support that enable millions of fans to safely discover, buy, and enjoy live events each year.”)View image in fullscreenNathan Maddison (left) with John Bush of the bands Armored Saint and Anthrax.Photograph: Guardian Community“As the prices have risen, and as Ticketmaster has become the biggest platform, I’ve cut down on gigs,” says Rushton. “I saw Bruce Springsteen at the Co-op Live in May. I picked my ticket up off [ticket resale site] Twickets for £150, which was reduced, because I made an offer on it – but you still get the transaction fees. In 1981, I saw him at the Apollo in Manchester for £6.50” – about £25 today.Nathan Maddison, 57, a finance technician from Newcastle, says he is cutting back on larger gigs – which is a big deal for him as a rock and metal fan. “I turned down an opportunity to see Iron Maiden in June, as financially it was just not doable,” he says.“I will travel to gigs, but you’ve got to factor in the transport and accommodation costs.” These have become more costly, too:since the 2010s, rail fares have risen faster than wagesin the UK.Elaine, 48, from London, says she has recently become a “one and done” gig goer. “These outrageous ticket prices have stopped me going to see someone I’ve seen before that I like, such as Lady Gaga recently.She says the prices of food and drink in big venues “also makes you feel ripped off. It’s taken the fun out of going to see music live.”Elaine has decided to see bands at smaller venues from now on. “I did have the pleasure recently of watching a fantastic gig by Brandi Carlile at Heaven in London which was only £24 a ticket. It was a wonderful night out discovering her music, at a decent price.”Mark Woollard, 51, a facilities manager from London, says he has also embraced smaller gigs in the last few years. “I’m choosing to spend the money on up and coming artists. It’s been great to experience truly intimate gigs in grassroots venues. The tickets are £16 or £17. You often end up meeting the artists themselves selling their merch after their performances, which is another lovely aspect.View image in fullscreenMark Woollard (right) with his wife (left) and the band members of Prima Queen (middle).Photograph: Guardian Community“My recent favourites are Prima Queen, Honeyglaze and Coming Up Roses. I’ve also seen reunion gigs – not the Oasis tour, but smaller bands doing their 20-year album revisit.”Mark’s new approach has broadened his musical horizons. “I’m actually seeing more shows,” he says. “I’ve always been interested in finding new artists, but in the last couple of years I’ve actively gone out and hunted down these little gigs.”This article was updated on Tuesday 28 October to clarify changes to Ticketmaster’s sales tactics.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockMusic industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She compared the situation to 2022, when the BBBF received hundreds of book submissions after the George Floyd protests and Black Lives Matter movement.“This year was completely different. Some publishers were even saying ‘We don’t have any books to give you’.” The problem is reflected in a recentInclusive Books for Children survey, which found a sharp drop in the number of children’s books featuring a Black main character. This widespread decline in the publishing of Black literature motivated Brown to pitch the new publishing collaboration to Pan Macmillan.Brown has seen publishing from all angles, from working at Birmingham Central Library to running marketing campaigns with publishers and writing her own books. She felt the publishing industry was slow to innovate.“For me the missing gap has always been the people, the voice of the people. Shaping the way books are acquired, shaping the marketing, shaping the genres, because we know what we want to read and how we want to access the books,” Brown says. She wants “community” to be at the “core” of the new publisher. “That way we’re saying that you guys are experts in this and we need to learn from you, rather than having all the meetings in publishing houses with a lot of people not from our backgrounds.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

They’ve always been behind us, been an ally … They get us,” she says.The new publisher is looking for stories that reflect the “height of Black British literature”, and can be read by everyone. “We want to bring the type of books that editors would water down to life because it’s about time, it’s 2025 now,” Brown says.She nodded to other UK publishers who help to spotlight Black British voices. “We stand on the shoulders of great publishers that have come before us – HopeRoad, Jacaranda Books, Merky Books, Dialogue. Shoutout to Margaret Busby and Verna Wilkins because they laid the foundations.” The new publisher does not yet have a name.The announcement came right before the festival’s headline event featuring actor Tabitha Brown. “It was a magical moment,” says Selina.Explore more on these topicsBooksBlack British culturenewsShareReuse this content"

The theatre’s chair said the old business model that“supported the right to fail alongside success”was no longer sustainable, which led to a process that reshaped the literary department while redundancies loomed at the institution.But after calls to allow the former artistic director of the New Dioramatime to set out his vision, Byrne has successfully put his stamp on the theatre, using a mix of star wattage and experimental commissioning to getbums back on seats.He said musicals would bea big part of his tenure, introduced a “collective” of associates including Ryan Calais Cameron and Mike Bartlett to help shape the programme and called for state support for young playwrights to avoid a“lost generation”.His first season featured Ben Whishaw inan adaptation of Maggie Nelson’s Bluetsand John Lithgow inthe Roald Dahl antisemitism drama Giant, which was directed by the former National Theatre artistic director Nicholas Hytner and transferred to the West End and then Broadway, where it launches in March 2026.Byrne’s second season featured Robert Icke’s story of the Raoul Moat saga Manhunt and a revival of Sarah Kane’s 4.48 Psychosis. His approach has proven popular: in September the theatre announced it hadsold out all its regular performancesfor the remainder of 2025.Announcing his third season, Byrne told the Guardian: “With anniversaries you need to encapsulate something that is both of the past, of the moment and the promise. All those things need to sit in equilibrium.”Debut work includes a story about cave-dwelling cannibals (Jack Nicholls’ The Shitheads), and a play about digital voyeurism and deepfake porn (Georgie Dettmer’s Are You Watching?). There is also a story about a pregnant woman who rents an Airbnb and inheritance (Blood of My Blood) and a Welsh community torn apart by a tragedy (Rhys Warrington’s Monument).Isabella Sedlak and the Palestinian-Israeli writer and performer Yousef Sweid bring their acclaimed play Between The River and The Sea, which was originally produced by Maxim Gorki Theater in Berlin and was also on at the Edinburgh festival.Explore more on these topicsRoyal Court theatreTilda SwintonGary OldmannewsShareReuse this content"

The fictional threat is arguably about as easy as they come.”Bigelow told the Guardianthat the film did not seek endorsement or co-operation from the Pentagon to ensure its independence, saying: “Our nuclear armoury is a fallible structure. Within it are men and women working thanklessly behind the scenes, whose competence means you and I can sit and have this conversation. But competence doesn’t mean they’re infallible.”The US currently has 44 ground based interceptors, based in Alaska and California, and in 2020 the Pentagon awarded a $13.3bn contract to Northrop Grumman for a new generation of ground-based missiles, due for delivery in 2029. In May, Donald Trumpproposed a “Golden Dome” missile system, featuring space-based weapons to intercept strikes against the US.Explore more on these topicsFilmKathryn BigelowNuclear weaponsUS national securityUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

This year’s shortlist features a “delightful mix of comedies” from “darkest satire and period farce to lightest humour,” said the chair of the judges and Hay festival co-founder Peter Florence.Shortlisted forThe Unfinished Harauld Hughes, Ayoade’s debut is narrated by his alter ego, who wants to save his doppelganger, the playwright Harauld Hughes, from obscurity. “A pitch-perfect literary parody, packed with deft wordplay and lines that made me laugh aloud on almost every page. Ayoade has an instinctive ear for the comic possibilities of language,” said literary critic and judge Stephanie Merritt.Younis made the shortlist for her debut novel Fundamentally, which was also shortlisted for this year’sWomen’s prize for fiction. It follows a heartbroken academic, Nadia, who accepts a UN job offer in Iraq where she is tasked with rehabilitating Islamic State women. There she forms a friendship with a feisty east Londoner, who joined Islamic State at just 15.Friendship is also a theme of Rosanna Pike’s novelA Little Trickerie, in which vagabond Tibb Ingleby travels through medieval England and with new-found friends conjures a hoax.The winner of this year’s prize will be announced at a reception in London on 1 December and, as well as having a pig named after their winning book, they will be awarded a complete set of the Everyman’s Library PG Wodehouse collection and Bollinger champagne.To mark the 25th anniversary of the award, this year’s ceremony will also feature the announcement of the Vintage Bollinger prize, a winner-of-winners to be selected from the previous 25 recipients. The prize will be judged by presenter Claudia Winkleman, comedians Sindhu Vee and Tatty Macleod, Great British Sewing Bee judge Patrick Grant and Florence.Another title shortlisted for the regular award,The Persians by Sanam Mahloudji, is about a family in crisis: Elizabeth lives with her Islamic law-breaking granddaughter in Tehran, while her daughters are disillusioned by life in America. “I found myself lost in this beautifully written novel and laughing as much as I wept,” said comedian Pippa Evans, another judge on the panel. “Multi-generational stories are rich in hilarious moments as we watch generations clash with the ideas that came before.”Also set in America is Alexander Sammartino’s bookLast Acts. David Rizzo, the owner of a failing firearms store, uses his son’s near fatal overdose to create a TV advert.Joining Florence, Merritt and Evans on this year’s judging panel is vice-chair of the University of Wales and chair of Rewilding Britain Justin Albert and Everyman’s Library publisher David Campbell.Outnumbered co-writer Guy Jenkin is shortlisted forMurder Most Foul, set in 1593, which follows the relationship between Christopher Marlowe and Shakespeare, and the rumours that swirl after Marlowe’s death about the Bard’s culpability. The novel is “a brilliantly subversive romp – razor-sharp, darkly funny, and utterly Wodehousian in its wit and mischief”, said Albert.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Flop on the sofa, lose yourself in your favourite show and feel your shoulders unknot themselves. Yet sometimes the best episodes are the most stress-inducing. Nerves jangle. Anxiety levels spike. Before you know it, you’re perched on the edge of your seat, quietly whimpering and clutching a cushion for comfort.We select the dozen most intense TV episodes of all time – two of which aired in the past fortnight. Well, it’s been a turbulent time. Press play and feel those knuckles whiten …Homeland:‘Marine One’(2011)It ran for nearly a decade to diminishing returns, but the debut season of the Showtime espionage thriller was downright electrifying. Bipolar CIA analyst Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) and “turned” war hero Sgt Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) played cat-and-mouse to taut effect. Tension reached its nerve-shredding peak with its first series finale. Al-Qaida double agent Brody attempted to detonate his suicide vest in a VIP bunker, blowing up high-value targets including the US vice-president. He was foiled by a loose wire and a phone call from his otherwise quite annoying daughter, Dana. For a while back there, viewers were sweating like Brody in that bathroom stall.Chernobyl:‘The Happiness of All Mankind’(2019)Sky and HBO’s forensically detailed dramatisation of the 1986 nuclear disaster became IMDb’s top-rated TV series of all time. The unflinching realism was especially vivid in the fourth episode. As a team were dispatched to shoot the town’s contaminated pets (sob), “liquidators” were sent up to the still-burning reactor’s rooftop to clear radioactive debris by hand. Each worked frantically for a 90-second burst, supposedly before exposure became fatal. Immersively shot on Steadicam and soundtracked by a crackling dosimeter, it included a watch-through-your-fingers moment where one poor conscript got his foot stuck. Terrifying, not least because we know that one in 10 of the real-life liquidators died.Happy Valley:series 3, episode 6 (2023)The blood feud between Sgt Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire) and local psycho Tommy Lee Royce (James Norton) played out for three superlative series across nine years. It was all building towards a climactic confrontation in the last ever episode. Having dramatically escaped prison, Tommy was wounded, desperate and dangerous. Catherine was on the verge of retirement – rarely a good omen for a screen cop. As a rapt audience of more than 11m watched and winced, the “Peeping Tommy” scene saw him pop up at Catherine’s window while she dozed in an armchair. When he broke in, understated greetings (“Hello?” “Hiya”) began a slow-burning 15-minute showdown across the kitchen table.Game of Thrones:‘The Rains of Castamere’(2013)Anyone who had read George RR Martin’s novels knew what was coming and watched with queasy dread. When the Starks arrived at Walder Frey’s castle to shore up the two clans’ alliance, things seemed to be passing peacefully – until Catelyn (Michelle Fairley) noticed that the musicians had changed their tune and the banqueting hall doors were locked. Right on cue, the slaughter began. Welcome to the Red Wedding. It was this harrowing massacre in the books that convinced showrunners David Benioff and DB Weiss to buy the TV rights. “The Lannisters send their regards” indeed.The Bear: ‘Fishes’(2023)We nearly picked season one’s “Review”, when a food critic’s rave write-up led to the Chicago restaurant’s receipt machine spewing out hundreds of orders, while the staff fell apart under pressure. However,The Bearbecame even more frazzled when it left the kitchen and flashed back to a dysfunctional Berzatto family Christmas dinner. As everyone tried (and failed) to appease toxic matriarch Jamie Lee Curtis, the chaos comprised multiple timers going off, blazing rows, spilt sauce, flying cutlery and even a car crashing through the wall. A 66-minute stress bomb. Just don’t ask Donna if she’s OK.Squid Game:‘Gganbu’(2021)Every episode of the tracksuit-clad South Korean hellscape was nerve-shredding, but this one took the Dalgona cookie. When the surviving contestants paired up to play marbles, the twist was that only one from each duo would survive. They thought they were teaming up to be allies. Suddenly, they were deadly foes. As characters we’d got to know over the previous five episodes competed against each other, it was agonising to see who lived and who died. The winners were left haunted by the deaths of their friends. Brutal and bleak.Line Of Duty:‘Breach’(2016)He had been the slippery antagonist for three series of police corruption plot twists. Now the net closed at last around inside man DI Matthew “Dot” Cottan (Craig Parkinson), AKA bent copper “the Caddy”. During a riveting interview scene, gaping holes appeared in Dot’s alibi. Stalling by pretending to check his iCal, he slyly sent a fateful text message (“Urgent exit required”) and all hell broke loose. Bullets sprayed. Foot chases unfolded. Getaway cars sped. A gun-toting Vicky McClure rode on the side of a delivery truck. Jesus, Mary and Joseph and the wee donkey.Task:‘Out Beyond Ideas of Wrongdoing and Rightdoing, There is a River’(2025)Not the snappiest episode title butcreator Brad Ingelsby knows how to construct killer TV. His previous hit, Mare of Easttown, featured a nerve-shredding mid-series sequence when Sgt Marianne Sheehan (Kate Winslet) and Det Colin Zabel (Evan Peters) tracked down a Pennsylvania child kidnapper. After he shockingly shot Zabel in the head, an unarmed and wounded Mare, breathless with panic, was stalked around the house in a chase reminiscent of Clarice Starling v Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs. In Ingelsby’s HBO follow-up Task, the penultimate episode saw Mark Ruffalo’s FBI taskforce and Tom Pelphrey’s Dark Hearts biker gang converge at a forest cabin. Cue a nonstop, guns-blazing 18-minute shootout in which several major characters perished.Breaking Bad:‘Ozymandias’ (2013)In this pulse-pounding instalment, five seasons of villainy finally caught up with Walter White (Bryan Cranston). As our antihero’s best-laid plans fell apart, he witnessed Hank’s heartbreaking execution, lost most of his ill-gotten loot, betrayed Jesse, alienated his family, kidnapped baby Holly and went on the run. As everything blew up in Walt’s face and the foundations were laid for the show’s killer finale, it was about as relaxing as rolling a barrel of cash across a desert. No wonder it won four Emmys and was named by showrunner Vince Gilligan as his favourite episode out of all 62.Blue Lights:‘Ordo Ab Chao’(2025)The third series of the Bafta-winning Belfast cop drama has been its best yet. The penultimate episode cranked up the jeopardy to unbearable levels. Answering what appeared to be a routine callout, cocky constable Shane (Frank Blake) was stabbed in the leg. While he bled out from his femoral artery, potentially fatally, colleague Grace (Siân Brooke) drove a mob accountant to a police safe house – not realising that organised crime had ordered a hit on the convoy. As dissident gunmen moved into position for a deadly ambush, a Special Ops surveillance expert tried to talk Grace to safety on the radio. It’s always a worry when a conversation starts, “Is your vehicle armoured or soft-skinned?” “Soft-skinned.” “Shit.”Succession:‘Which Side Are You On?’(2018)Jesse Armstrong’s dynastic psychodrama was full of unbearably tense episodes – Connor’s wedding, Kendall’s 40th, Boar on the Floor, election night and the yacht were all right up there – but this was an early tone-setter. Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong) had painstakingly put the wheels in motion for a no-confidence vote in his fearsome father Logan (Brian Cox). It crashed and burned when Logan refused to leave the Waystar boardroom, instead bullying colleagues into siding with him. Meanwhile, Kendall was stuck in traffic and sprinted through the Manhattan streets to make it in time – only to get fired and frogmarched out of the building on arrival. “That was your best shot,” snarled daddy dearest. “You lost.”Atlanta:‘Teddy Perkins’ (2018)Donald Glover’s genre-bending creation specialised in surreal self-contained episodes, none better than this deeply creepy gem. When stoner Darius (LaKeith Stanfield) picked up a valuable vintage piano from a mysterious mansion and met its reclusive oddball owner Teddy Perkins (Glover himself, unrecognisable beneath mask-like prosthetics and ghostly makeup), it descended into a hallucinatory horror movie in miniature. Director Hiro Murai admitted being inspired by The Shining. The unsettling figure of Teddy bore a distinct resemblance to Michael Jackson. Get out, Darius, before it’s too late.Share your favouriteWhat is the most intense TV show you have ever seen?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Then, if you read my books in chronological order, I don’t believe you would find yourself thinking,Something calamitous happened to this writer’s life in 1989. The books are their own journey.Extraordinary if true – but though the buoyant surface of Rushdie’s prose has betrayed little overt evidence of his status as the Ayatollah Khomeini’s marked man, the novels nonetheless track his trauma and its aftermaths faithfully. The first he published after the fatwa, 1995’s The Moor’s Last Sigh, begins with Moraes Zogoiby running for his life from unknown “pursuers”. Fury (2001), published after the Iranian president Mohammad Khatami declared the fatwa “finished” in 1998, is transparently the giddy, hyped-up novel of a man set free.Shalimar the Clown(2005) began, as Rushdie tells us, with “a single image that I couldn’t get out of my mind, the image of a dead man lying on the ground while a second man, his assassin, stood over him holding a bloodied knife”. This image, Rushdie says in Knife, was “a foreshadowing”. But it was also a looking backward, at the possible fate that Rushdie was forced to contemplate for years. “I’m a dead man”: this, he tells us in his 2012 memoirJoseph Anton, was the first thing he thought when he heard the news of the fatwa.Well, Rushdie isn’t a dead man. He’s still writing. The Eleventh Hour, a collection of five stories, seems intended as a kind of coda to his career. The stories are death-haunted. One of them is called Late; it’s an afterlife fantasy in which a Cambridge fellow, whose career has resembled both EM Forster’s (writing a great novel about India) and Alan Turing’s (helping to crack the Enigma code), dies and haunts a young Indian student named Rosa; what links them may be the buried crimes of empire. The Musician of Kahani replays Rushdie’s greatest hits: it is about a child born at midnight (“the approved hour for miraculous births in our part of the world”) who, aged four, abruptly becomes a gifted pianist (like the rock star Ormus Cama inThe Ground Beneath Her Feet, playing air guitar in his cradle).Rushdie has been one of the deep sources of contemporary fiction – he’s shaped the 21st-century Big Inventive NovelThese stories are entertaining but not particularly strong. The Musician of Kahana leans pretty heavily on cliche: “the university of life”, “priceless art”, “finger on the pulse”, “the wedding of the year” … In the South is better: a deft, moving anecdote about two old men in Mumbai who bicker and needle one another from their respective verandas. One of them, Junior, dies in an accident. The other, Senior, despairs, until he comes to believe that “death and life were just adjacent verandas”. Oklahoma invokes Kafka; it is a metafiction about a young Indian writer and the older American novelist he admires, or perhaps more than admires – in cases of literary influence, the story seems to ask, who is writing whom?Rushdie has been one of the deep sources of contemporary fiction. His fingerprints are all over the 21st-century Big Inventive Novel, with its sentient raindrops (Elif Shafak), its melodramatic families (Kiran Desai), its metamorphoses of race (Mohsin Hamid) and history (Marlon James). His influence has not been without its downsides. Rushdie has licensed lesser writers to be sentimental about their own powers of invention. He has given permission for characters to be flattened into comic stickers. And he has presided over a vast boom in telling rather than showing. The events of his own recent novels, such asThe Golden House(2017) andQuichotte(2019), have been relentlessly told, rather than dramatised, and the virus of telling – this and then this and then this! – has noticeably infected the contemporary novel. But Rushdie was a pathbreaker. The exuberance and linguistic force of Midnight’s Children is still, after 44 years, a joy to encounter on the page. Another writer might have been fatally discouraged by what Rushdie has gone through. But Rushdie was not. He wrote the books. And the books, many of them, have greatly mattered.“Our words fail us,” goes the final sentence of The Eleventh Hour. It is the conclusion of a story about a piazza – a public space – in which language, here figured as a human woman, is courted, usurped, ignored. Finally she screams and vanishes, at which point, the piazza’s buildings all crack: “The piazza is broken, and so, perhaps, are we.” Words have not yet failedSalman Rushdie, even if, in this self-consciously late book, the spectacular originality of his novelistic peak sounds more as an echo than as an urgently present voice.The Eleventh Hour: A Quintet of Stories by Salman Rushdie is published by Jonathan Cape (£18.99).

In the late 1970s, they won the approval of John Peel and NME, with the latter noting they had the same cartoonish energy as the Ramones.They wore polka dot minidresses, stripy tights and Dr Martens or platforms, an aesthetic in keeping with the brightly coloured confectionery after which they were named. Along with opening for acts including the Jam, Madness and the Undertones, the band were once supported by U2 and appeared on Top of the Pops in 1982 singing backing vocals on Captain Sensible’s chart-topping Happy Talk. That would turn out to be their career peak. Just two years later, having failed to have any hits of their own, and with guitarist Rachel Bor expecting a baby, Dolly Mixture went their separate ways.Now singer and bassist Debsey Wykes has written a book about this variously thrilling, chaotic and frustrating period in her life. It is a coming-of-age tale built around the diaries she kept detailing Dolly Mixture’s inception and their attempts to make progress in an industry that regarded all-girl bands, particularly those with a love of pop music, with suspicion or disdain. Teenage Daydream winningly captures the devil-may-care optimism of adolescence that, for Wykes along with Bor and drummer Hester Smith, led them to try their luck as musicians long before they owned, let alone mastered, their instruments. Though they consciously kicked against the nihilism of punk, it was the have-a-go ethos of the movement that led to their formation.Along with their youthful self-belief, Wykes articulates a touching camaraderie that came into its own as they faced sometimes hostile audiences. Supporting the Jam, she recalls spending “most of our set sailing valiantly on in front of a sea of parka-clad lads showing us the finger”. The scuzzy living conditions they endured are vividly drawn. Wykes recalls them holing up at their manager’s flat in Soho where anyone using the toilet would have to use an umbrella to protect them against downpours from the overhead cistern.Teenage Daydream is steeped in the combined hopefulness and dourness of the early 80s, evoking what it was to be young, on the dole and chasing your dreams in the early years of Thatcherism. Dolly Mixture didn’t have it easy, enduring financial hardship and outrageous sexism; many a time they get close to a record deal only to be stonewalled by male executives irritated by young women with opinions about how they should sound. It was with admirable bloody-mindedness that, having tried and failed to get label support for an album, they ended up self-releasing an LP. Yet it’s hard not to compare their experience to those of young bands today who, without access to benefits and with fewer small venues to play in, would almost certainly have thrown in the towel sooner.That the band have been consistently overlooked in accounts of the period more than justifies this book’s existence. Nonetheless, at points you get a sense of material being stretched thin. It’s one thing for Wykes to include diary entries detailing gigs, backstage shenanigans, record company meetings and ructions with managers. It’s another to pepper the book with fan letters that serve no clear function other than to break up the narrative. Dolly Mixture may have called it a day more than 40 years ago, but their influence endures. They were an inspiration for riot grrrl in the early 90s, while Saint Etienne loved them so much they drafted in Wykes as backing singer for their live shows. When a Dolly Mixture rarities LP was released in 2019, it swiftly sold out.The final chapter of Teenage Daydream sees Wykes visiting her old bandmates in Brighton in 2024 to tell them about this book and reflect on what they achieved. Dolly Mixture may have failed to dent the charts with their own songs, but at least they had a wild adventure. Better still, they managed to stay friends.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It takes us through his childhood in Glasgow and his sparkling career at Celtic, at a time when the stars were hardly financially better off than the fans, before Dalglish arrived at Liverpool, effectively taking over Kevin Keegan’s position. Kapadia makes his central focus the mysterious inner trial, perhaps Dalglish’s hidden ordeal, that took place between 1985 to 1989; from Heysel to Hillsborough.Dalglish was the easygoing, level-headed everyman whose destiny it was to take the city’s woes on his shoulders. He became player-manager just afterthe Heysel stadium disaster in 1985, when there were 39 deaths as a result of a riot at the dilapidated Belgian ground before the Juventus v Liverpool European Cup final. It was a day of shame for Liverpool, whose fans were held to be responsible – although subsequent analysis of the stadium design, crowd control and policing revealed a situation not too far from the Hillsborough tragedy in 1989, which resulted in the deaths of 97 Liverpool fans – largely due to the fencing that, as Kapadia shows, was a catastrophe waiting to happen.Throughout, Dalglish was a stoic figure, consistently visiting hospitals and attending funerals with his players. Kapadia shows the grim spectacle of Margaret Thatcher showing up at Hillsborough a couple of days after the disaster, radiating her distaste for football and its massed fans; for her, football was the leisure-activity dimension of trade-unionism. Did she see Hillsborough as all that different from Orgreave? Her government effectively greenlitthe Sun’s grotesque “The Truth” headlinewhich caused that paper’s circulation to collapse on Merseyside. The paper’s editor Kelvin MacKenzie cravenly asked Dalglish how he could put things right and Dalglish crisply suggested a new headline: “We Lied.” He quit as manager soon afterwards, apparently worn down by the stress; even though the burden was onerous, he returned to management apparently without permanent mental scarring.Kapadia could have included a larger discussion of hooliganism which was a wider phenomenon than you might guess from this film. But that discussion would need to show how hooliganism was partly a response to how contemptuously working-class supporters were often treated. Kapadia doesn’t mention it, but Dalglish would have been well aware of Glasgow’s terribleIbrox disasters of 1971and1902: the catastrophes at Rangers’ ground causing 66 and 25 deaths respectively, fatalities which were almost shrugged at by the authorities.And there is another historical echo which Kapadia simply allows us to notice without explicit comment: that vast field of flowers at Anfield in 1989 prefigured the outpouring of grief at Princess Diana’s death in 1997, a new language of public grief which has a pointed message for those in charge. As for Dalglish himself, he emerges as a straightforward figure without the agonised complexity of other figures that Kapadia has covered, such asDiego MaradonaorAmy Winehouse, and this film doesn’t have that dysfunctional danger and fascination. But maybe it was just his ingenuous simplicity that allowed Dalglish to survive.Kenny Dalglish is in cinemas on 29 and 30 October, and on Prime Video from 4 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsKenny DalglishHillsborough disasterLiverpoolAsif KapadiareviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a film to compare withMichael Winterbottom’s ShoshanaandCherien Dabis’s All That’s Left of You, dramas that reopen the fraught issue of Britain’s own colonial history in Palestine.This is a heartfelt film, if rather stolidly paced and sometimes pedagogically conveyed. The cast includes such Palestinian heavyweight actors as Hiam Abbass and Saleh Bakri as passionate rebels. Jeremy Irons plays the high commissionerSir Arthur Wauchopewho presides with bland complacency over this troublesome possession. The other colonials are divided, in the traditional style, into “good British” – Billy Howle as a troubled and ineffectually pro-Arab civil servant – and “bad British” – Robert Aramayo as the brutal Captain Orde Wingate, who here personifies the arrogance and cruelty of the coloniser, shooting civilians in cold blood and ordering the collective punishment of entire villages.Jacir coolly laces her dialogue with echoes of the future: Wingate fiercely espouses his belief in a Zionist future for the region and tells a sceptic, “Perhaps you should consider what side of history you want to be on.” There is another complex reverberation when a Palestinian worker says: “They are replacing us with Jewish labour!”There is a huge cast of characters, with the film’s emotive content spread carefully across them all, although the heart of the story is Yusuf (Karim Daoud Anaya), a village boy who gets a job in Jerusalem with a worldly, centrist-liberal newspaper editor who is not averse to making an accommodation with Zionism. Yusuf is not particularly political but is inevitably radicalised by the brutal British. None of these characters quite flares passionately into life but all are persuasively portrayed, and it’s a vehement reminder of what doesn’t get taught in British schools.Palestine36 is in UK and Irish cinemas from 31 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPeriod and historical filmsPalestineIsraelreviewsShareReuse this content"

Ultimately, it is something of an advertisement for a new therapeutic protocol that involves the veterans taking the hallucinogensibogaine(derived from an African shrub) and5-MeO-DMT(derived, like something out of a William S Burroughs novel, from a river toad); a treatment that, to hear the subjects here describe it, can work miracles on the battle-scarred, suicidal minds of its users. Currently, the treatment is only available at a Mexican clinic because the drugs have not been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration, but a bunch of boffins connected toStanford University’s Brain Stimulation Labare studying its clinical effects and the film works hard to make everything look as legit as possible.To be clear, we’re not necessarily questioning the drugs’ efficacy, but this particular film seems barely interested in the cognitive science and lets interviews with scientists with interesting glasses and fancy vocabularies stand in as guarantors that it all actually works. More persuasive is the testimony from the half dozen men we meet, who bravely discuss their pain and distress while the cameras roll.What the former soldiers experienced in the theatre of war, especially in Afghanistan in the early 2000s, has left many feeling like husks of their former selves and bedevilled by constant thoughts of suicide. One soldier testifies that the abuse he experienced as a child, which significantly contributed to his decision to become a soldier in the first place, was an even bigger component of the trauma he carried and something he could only face while under the influence of these psychedelics.Since few things are duller than watching someone else having an experience on drugs, the film opts to illustrate the trips with tasteful animation featuring images of our subjects spinning in space, surrounded by the memories that assault their senses. At one point, we get to see a soldier’s vision of spending hours on a couch watching the sitcom Malcolm in the Middle, a detail that seems deliciously amusing and against the mostly sombre grain of the film. That solemnity is underscored by the music, which seems mostly comprised of plangent Philip Glass-style chords played on violins repeated ad infinitum, a style of musical shorthand that immediately signals tragic cycles of pain.In Waves and War is on Netflix from 3 November.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

It looks, at the outset, like a jolly away-day gone awry. The bonhomie, if there was any, has curdled and they are now taking big swipes at each other. Because, while they were close to Mei, they have little in common with one another bar the urn that contains their departed friend.That they are chalk-and-cheese is conveyed in broad, gestural ways. There is Rose (Sarah Rickman), Mei’s sister-in-law, who is harbouring a secret, along with Jules (Stacy Abalogun), a lesbian and strong personality at odds with grumpy Sue (Ciara Pouncett). Jasmin (Rendah Beshoori) appears like a Chelsea mum, in smart jacket and dress, while Cathy (Scarlett Alice Johnson) is Mei’s dungaree-clad colleague who goes on silent retreats to India.When the rain starts to pelt down and they seek refuge in booze, you brace yourself for a conflagration in the woods that never comes. Despite the drunkenness and a bout of primal screaming, this drama fails to set alight; the humour too obvious, the plot-points weak and pace ponderous. The highlight is Abi Groves’ beautiful set, awash with autumnal hues, with bracken strewn underfoot and what looks like embossed thickets in the backdrop.Nothing comes alive beyond the forest itself. Under the direction of Emma Gersch, there are prolonged moments of dramatic dead-time as characters sit around drinking or speaking insubstantial nothings. One scene towards the end shows the women simply packing up in silence, with no accompanying emotional charge.The script flags up its issues in the most cosmetic of ways, without developing them, such as menopause, or whether or not to have children. Mei is labelled a narcissist and we hear how she gave each of these friends a nasty nickname. All of this is brushed aside too quickly, none of it feels authentic. So you are left with a drama that itself seems stranded in these rain-sodden woods, not quite sure of where to go, what to say.At Park theatre, London, until 15 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreMenopausereviewsShareReuse this content"

Ibsen’s classic is transposed to the world of filmmakers and movie stars in London, 1948, with tea dresses, pencil moustaches, and India freshly independent. A solid, forthright reimagining, Gupta’s Hedda illuminates the racism of middle-class, postwar England, where a casual slur is no more noted in conversation than a polite sneeze.A movie star in early retirement, our white-passing, hard-hearted Hedda (Pearl Chanda) hides her dual Anglo-Indian heritage. In a period of institutionalised racism in the film industry, with the segregation of love stories onscreen, she knows the discovery of her identity will destroy her carefully curated life. Directed by Hettie Macdonald, the play’s careless characters make the consequences of such a reveal plain in the way they talk about Shona (Rina Fatania, piercing and exact), Hedda’s maid, as if she is hardly there. Not even Hedda’s hapless husband George (Joe Bannister) suspects Hedda’s true relationship with the older woman, an inspired pairing that longs for more time on stage.This riveting way to re-see Hedda’s deliberate hardness gives her more reason to hide away from the world and lends weight to her need to be rid of the too-revealing manuscript written by Lenny, her former flame (Jake Mann, playing the tortured artist well). As the only one who knew her before she started pretending, Lenny tries to tear down Hedda’s cold facade, but she is stubborn. To everyone else, like George’s ex Alice (a puppyish Bebe Cave), she is at best indifferent, at worst downright – almost unbelievably – contemptuous.Beyond the intrigue of Hedda’s secret and the sinister racial politics that seep through their interactions, the play struggles to build tension. The gaggle of friends, family and exes swan in and out of the unhappy couple’s new home in Chelsea (Simon Kenny’s plush-carpeted design), professing their intentions, objections and fears as readily as if describing what they’d like for lunch. The external context of this adaptation is bold and new. But the emotions behind the characters’ internal battles are often told rather than felt, their actions missing impulse, and the swiftness of their downfalls somewhat flattening their impact.At theOrange Tree theatreuntil 22 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreHenrik IbsenreviewsShareReuse this content"

But music fans who have been burned by the recurrent loss of the capital’s best dancefloors, fromPlastic PeopletoPrintworks, might also be sceptical. Is Eutopia here to stay, or another false dawn? And are people really going to trek out to the very eastern edge of the city, 12 miles from the West End, to go to a club across a river from a sewage treatment works?The Eutopia team includes several of London’s most experienced nightlife operators. One of its four co-founders, Will Paterson, has worked for venues and festivals including E1 and Eastern Electrics for more than two decades. Another, Tom Ranger, spent several years overseeing music bookings at East London’s Oval Space (which later closed in 2022 after a shooting).Paterson and Ranger are confident that Eutopia will stay the course. “We’re on a long-term lease, and we’re growing slowly,” says Paterson. “We expect next year to be a good year, where we learn a lot and do more shows, then more again in 2027. When you look at any good [London] venue, like The Cause or Night Tales, it takes three years.”View image in fullscreen‘Thousands of clubbers are willing to make those kinds of journeys’ … outdoor space The Yard at Eutopia.Photograph: EutopiaEutopia, somewhat unusually, has time on its side. Unlike many other similarly sized post-industrial superclubs, including Canada Water’s Printworks, Tottenham’s Drumsheds or Depot Mayfield in Manchester, it has not been created as part of a “meanwhile” scheme, in which promoters work with developers to make temporary cultural use of an empty site before it’s redeveloped. A venue such as Printworks, which closed in 2023, always had a strict deadline; Eutopia’s longer-term prospects feel far more open-ended.The other key factor working in Eutopia’s favour is the absence of local residents who might complain about it: their nearest neighbours are more than a mile away. This means they can sidestep most of the noise-related issues which have plagued so many of their peers, and indeed contributed directly to the demise of Elephant and Castle’s Corsica Studios, when new-build flats were permitted to be built next door.“When we met with the council and the police, but particularly the police, they said to us: we’ll support you, because we prefer new entertainment spaces to be in areas like this,” Paterson says. “Their position was: why would we grant a licence, and then have 52 weeks a year of people calling up and complaining?”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

While late night transport links may be limited, venues remain responsible for customer safety on dispersal.”Their statement hints at some of the tradeoffs which come with Eutopia’s isolated surroundings: part of a long-running trend in which cultural activity is forced further from the inner city as neighbourhoods gentrify, rents go up, and new residential developments are built. “The reality is that venues are going to be pushed to the margins,” says Paterson. “We got this opportunity because it’s further away.”Eutopia is perhaps the most extreme example London has seen of this particular process. Located out past City Airport, beyond even the London postcode area, it’s bordered by industrial units, wetlands, and Beckton sewage works: not the kind of place you can hop from pub to bar to club. Public transport is patchy: Eutopia is a 35 minute walk from Barking station, and 25 minutes from Barking Riverside at the end of the Overground. Neither is part of the Night Tube, and the only local bus service stops at midnight.“Yes, it’s more difficult to come here than it is to go to a venue like [Charing Cross Road’s] Outernet,” says Paterson, who explains that visiting Eutopia might involve “friends getting together to share an Uber, or – in the new sober world we’re in – one person driving.” This perhaps recalls the early 90s, when London’s ravers would have to pile into a Vauxhall Nova and head out past the M25 to find the party.“If the venue’s really special or I’m particularly drawn to the party, I’ve been happy to travel upwards of an hour,” says Charlie, a dance music fan in his 20s. “Particularly if a venue’s set up for longer events, with a variety of spaces and comfortable places to chill out.” His views are shared by Daisy-Mae, a DJ based in Clapton. “If it was a really good lineup, I had people to go with and I could do it affordably, I’d definitely be down for going to Barking,” she says.Mixmag’s deputy editor Megan Townsend agrees that Londoners have become more accustomed to logistically complicated nights out: “30 years ago there were more clubs in central London, so of course people are travelling further now. Venues like Drumsheds show that thousands of clubbers are willing to make those kinds of journeys.”But Eutopia’s location in the middle of an industrial estate, away from busy high streets and transport connections, complicates things. “I really don’t want to have to get a cab or bus from station to club,” says Charlie. “I’ve also been to venues in industrial spaces where there’s a long walk, often unlit, which feels sketchy for me even as a man.” Eutopia have clearly considered the safety risks – from doubling the amount of time security staff are kept on shift after an event, to installing temporary pavement lighting from Eutopia back to nearby stations – but the fact such mitigations are necessary remains impossible to overlook.View image in fullscreen‘We got this opportunity because it’s further away’ … Eutopia.Photograph: EutopiaEutopia’s founders say they want to run things so expertly that concerns ultimately fade into the background. They’ve spent £1.5m on the space itself, designed by the team behind Glastonbury’s San Remo area. Their 4,000-person capacity has also been split across a variety of more modular and intimate spaces, suitable for everything from club nights to film screenings to community events, as opposed to one massive, impersonal expanse. “I think everybody would say that 600 people is the perfect size: it’s big enough to get lost in, but small enough to feel intimate,” Tom Ranger explains. “But the reality is that operating a venue of that size is extremely hard work unless you’re Live Nation or AEG, who can afford to be loss-leading.”Initial signs seem positive, with events from promoters as varied as gen Z up-and-comers Appetite and rave stalwarts World Dance selling out. But Eutopia’s lack of corporate backing (another conspicuous contrast with other developer and private equity-funded spaces) means there’s little room for complacency. “It’s like when people see a new restaurant and say: ‘We should check it out,’ then six months later they see it’s closed,” says Ranger. “Go check it out, support it.”Paterson and Ranger are keen to counter the pessimism which can sometimes inform Londoners’ perceptions around nightlife. “We know the economy has been squeezed for most people,” says Ranger. “But we still have the ability to engage in something new and exciting. Hopefully people will come on that journey with us.”Explore more on these topicsMusicClub cultureDance musicElectronic musicGentrificationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It feels like something huge and important is approaching, and it’s going to envelop you,” he told the Guardian. “It’s astonishing to think that it’s half a century old.”The poet and ardentPink Floydfan was approached by the group to write a new piece about the record and has produced a sprawling piece with no punctuation that reads like a mix between a fan letter and the ramblings of a religious devotee.Armitage, who was 12 when the record was released, describes it as a “time capsule treasure chest message in a bottle tied to a life buoy thrown on a life raft from a ghost ship”, while imagining the band playing in the hanging gardens of Babylon and in the Mariana trench.“It was a chance to do something a little bit different,” he said. “I just thought it might drag me off in a different direction. And I felt quite in tune with the record and the atmosphere and the anniversary.”The album followed on from the progressive rock and invention of the band’sDark Side of the Moon. It only has five tracks, with the middle three songs – Welcome to the Machine, Have a Cigar and the title track – sandwiched between the band’s epic multipart song in honour of departed member Syd Barrett, Shine On You Crazy Diamond.The initial critical response to the album wasmixed. Rolling Stone singled out Gilmour’s long solos for criticism, with Ben Edmunds accusing him of being “just another competent guitarist who thinks with his fingers instead of his head”.But Wish You Were Here proved popular on release, going toNo1, while bootleggers sold a reported 25,000 copies of a live recording when the band played it in Stafford.It has since become a critical darling, with Pitchfork scoring it a perfect 10 and declaring that it “marked a new kind of creative breakthrough for a rock band in the 70s”.View image in fullscreenSimon Armitage reading the poem.Photograph: Sony Music EntertainmentArmitage says that growing up in West Yorkshire as punk was taking hold, Pink Floyd had to be a private indulgence, and the album’s reputation for being a “headphone record” – ideal for solo bedroom listening sessions – made that easier.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One of them had a Pink Floyd hoodie on and another one had a Paul Smith T-shirt.”The 50th anniversary of what is arguably the group’s masterpiece will thrust them into the limelight, although they’ve already been in the charts in 2025.The band’s 1972 live record, Pink Floyd at Pompeii – MCMLXXII, made its way to the top of the album charts earlier this year, becoming theirseventh No1 album.Explore more on these topicsPink FloydSimon ArmitagePoetryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My children and I paid it a visitTue 28 Oct 2025 09.44 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 11.51 EDTShareIn an attempt to avoid spending £80 to walk around a local park with my children to see some underwhelming spooky decorations, and having failed for the fifth year in a row to secure a ticket to a Scottish farm to tramp damply around looking at pumpkins, I tried something different with my kids this Halloween: a virtual pumpkin festival.Ghost Town Pumpkin Festivalwas first created in the depths of the 2020 pandemic, when game developer Adam Robinson-Yu’s real-life neighbourhood pumpkin festival was cancelled. (Yu also made the excellent and equally autumnalA Short Hike.) Since then, it has returned for a few weeks every year, letting players come together as adorable ghosts to explore a creepy little micro-world filled with player-created pumpkins. It has improved slightly every year: 2024’s big addition was a haunted house escape room, which took me and my kids a good hour to figure out, and this year there’s a movie theatre that plays eerie silent films for a roomful of nobody.Everywhere you go you see other players floating around in the form of classic sheet-ghosts with drawn-on faces and, sometimes, fetching hats. Pumpkins crowd every surface, from the benches outside the skeleton-filled barn to the corridors of the haunted house. Many of these, as you might expect, are gaming-themed: alongside a brace of presumably child-created gurning faces and cat-on-moon silhouettes, I spotted a tribute to Hollow Knight and a fastidious recreation of Majora’s Mask fromthe scariest Zelda game.The trailer for last year’s FestivalThe advantages of a virtual Halloween festival are many: you cannot get scammed out of £8 for a watery hot chocolate or cardboard-like chips from a food van, you can carve as many virtual pumpkins as you like and undo your mistakes if you mess it up, and it is not a problem if your six-year-old refuses to wear a coat. But I did not expect Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival to be as good as it is. Behind the obvious attractions – a challenging hedge maze, a tractor ride through barns full of endearingly rubbish creepy decorations and jump scares – hide a bunch of hidden secrets (and collectible pin badges) that I only found when I took an hour to explore on my own.Take the movie theatre: on my way out of the cinema, I tried the door to the bathroom and found it locked. Behind the popcorn counter, a key; beside the toilet door, an enticing-looking code pinned to a notice board. Once I figured that out, I found another key in one of the toilets, and then an “access restricted” door down by the side of the screen in the theatre itself. The excellent bite-sized horror game that lurked behind that door was actually too scary for my children and, if I’m honest, for me.

Maybe it is drunk or drugged as it towers and slumps, a red and brown creature with a demonic face and sagging stomach. If the cord suspending it from the ceiling snapped it would just be a pile of hemp on the floor.View image in fullscreenExhilarating … Jauba, by Mrinalini Mukherjee.Photograph: © Tate/Courtesy of Mrinalini Mukherjee FoundationThis monster has all the qualities that make the art of Mrinalini Mukherjee, who was born in Mumbai in 1949 and died in 2015, funny, fascinating and surreal. She created it in 1985, making it, like many of her works, with tightly woven, intensely coloured natural fibres. It is called Pakshi, meaning bird, and now I see it, the feathery flanks and floppy wings. Mukherjee’s sculpture is a hallucinatory but sharply observed response to nature, full of echoes of the Indian landscape and, in this case, India’s skies. If a bird can become an ogre in her fantastic imagination, a flower can grow into a fat, sprawling, bloodied excrescence and a tree transmute into gold. So why does the Royal Academy try to suffocate her exhilarating works in an incoherent show that surrounds them with mediocre stuff by much less interesting artists?The grand title is A Story of South AsianArt, but no story is told here that excites or even makes sense. A simple, traditional retrospective – artist is born, starts career, work develops – would give you a nice linear framework but oh no, that would be too simple. Instead this meander “traces a century of south Asian art” as the wall text at the entrance says, setting Mukherjee within a “constellation of mentors, friends and family”. But why? Any gain is negligible compared with the loss of energy and urgency.View image in fullscreenNice enough … Lady with Fruitby Benode Behari Mukherjee.Photograph: JFernandes/Tate. Courtesy of Mrinalini Mukherjee FoundationIt starts out nicely enough. Mukherjee’s parents were artists and her father Benode Behari Mukherjee struggled with visual impairment, eventually becoming blind. Maybe that is why his Matisse-like collages are so electrically bright, loving colour like it’s life. But if you want to pursue this idea of exploring Mrinalini Mukherjee’s affinities, she seems to have got her gift for sculpture from her mother Leela, whose carved wooden figures have a chunky totemic energy.Of course context is important, but why not go deeper? Mrinalini Mukherjee’s sculpture has ancient and marvellous, and clearly self-aware, roots in Indian art – or south Asian art as is pedantically insisted on here – with its history of natural observation, hooded cobras, elephant-headed gods, dancing bodies and abstract freedom, most mysteriously in the representation of Shiva as a cylindrical lingam. Mrinalini Mukherjee’s woven hemp sculpture Adi Pushp II reminded me of a lingam, probably because they both take inspiration from the stamen of a flower. This sculpture, whose title means “First Flower”, is a grossly shaped, triffidian plant that blossoms with erotic suggestiveness. It’s consciously, smartly rooted in India’s religions and art and leaves all the other artists in the deep shade it casts.View image in fullscreenTranscending the local … Forest Flame IV by Mrinalini Mukherjee.Photograph: Humayun Memon/Courtesy of Mrinalini Mukherjee FoundationThis is how it goes. At first, the inclusion of Mrinalini Mukherjee’s friends and family sort of sets her early development in context. But as soon as you see her sculptures from the 1980s onwards you just want to see more of them and less, and soon none, of the watercolours by her “circle” that clog up the gallery like slow traffic. It’s as if she is forced to make endlessly polite chit-chat about what everyone else is doing.Her art is international, not local. Given her rise to brilliance in the 80s, it’s tempting to see her as a magic realist. She mingles modern India’s history with surrealism, dreams and fantastical images of an intense national landscape. From this she produces an enchanted, bubbling cocktail of birds and flowers, gods and monsters infused with desire and dread. Night Bloom II, which is owned by the British Museum, has the shape of someone sitting in the lotus position, yet it is another festering flower of the mind, made of sloppy, sliding green ceramic, some of it glazed blood red.The wall text says the figure looks female, but to me it evokes statues of seated Buddhas and sages that are beyond gender. It is full of contradictions, both spiritually calm and sensually violent, possessing the tension that makes a work of art not just impressive but enduring.Mrinalini Mukherjee’s art drew deeply on her culture but transcended the local. It is as meaningful now as in her lifetime, and accessible to everyone. What’s so bad about that? Banging contemporary art is banging contemporary art – but no, this exhibition keeps throwing a wet blanket over it. Here’s another so-so landscape painting, another tedious figurative screen.How clever of the Royal Academy to give this great modern artist a show. How stupid to muffle her in second-rate surroundings. I suspect she knew exactly how much better she was than her family and friends.A Story of South Asian Art: Mrinalini Mukherjee and her Circleis at the Royal Academy, London, 31 October to 24 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsArtPaintingSculptureIndiaRoyal Academy of ArtsSouth and central AsiareviewsShareReuse this content"

The candlelight flickers off stout terracotta jugs of wine and on to the faces of Thomas, a management consultant from New York, and Viktoras and Gabije, a charming Lithuanian couple I’ve been grilling about Baltic holiday spots. Ellen is German, living in Barcelona and training to be a therapist. It’s testament to the relaxed vibe that the conversation flows as smoothly as the wine.Map of north east SpainI’m atOff Grid, a new 10-room retreat(plus four-bedroom barn) inAlta Garrotxa, a protected nature reserve about 30 miles (50km) north of Girona. A converted 17th-centurymasia(farmhouse), it’s encircled by the fertile green humps and limestone crags of the pre-Pyrenees, with sloping gardens sheltering a large swimming pool. With its rustic, slow-living ethos, it’s perhaps a surprising departure for owner Gerard Greene, former CEO of Yotel – the modern, tech-driven city-centre brand with hotels in New York, Amsterdam and Tokyo among other cities. Just being here is a kind of therapy.It was only in spring 2024 that Greene spotted the site’s potential (a main farmhouse building, barn conversion and various outbuildings) and began doing it up. Inner walls have been whitewashed, bedrooms stripped back and painted with limewash shades of blush, ochre and sand. Sculptural stone sinks and brassy bathroom fixtures jazz-up en suites.Outside, birds chatter in the treetops above the swimming pool. Dragonflies flit by and a vast mountain – Mare de Déu del Mont – looms behind the quaint tiled roof, a natural place to fix your eyes in a moment of meditation. I’m here solo for a few days’ respite. I had a baby 10 months ago, and have barely moved my body properly since. A DIY retreat: yoga sessions, walking, a little autumn sunshine is just what’s needed.View image in fullscreenThe Santa Margarida volcano in Al Garrotxa natural park, near the border with France.Photograph: Prisma Archivo/AlamyAnother delightful aspect at Off Grid is that dinners are taken communally (poolside in summer, around the chunky farmhouse table in the dining room when cooler). It’s not enforced, but gently encouraged – a blackboard heralds a €30 three-course menu that changes daily depending on chef Joep’smarket finds: a tomato salad with local cheese and toasted seeds, say, followed by a rustic oxtail pie and an orange-zest cheesecake. Guests tend to amble down for avermutaround 8pm – there are honesty bars in the hotel, plus a vintage spirits trolley.There isn’t always a full house at dinner – on my first night there’s just myself, Alex and Judith: an Englishman and a Belgian visiting from Peckham. There’s plenty of choice for venturing out to dine nearby:La Guixerais a small bistro within walking distance (open Friday to Sunday only), while others are within a five- or 10-minute drive. My favourite isEl Claustre de Palera, a terrace built into a restored Romanesque church, where I order platters of fried anchovies, and barbecued mackerel with rich ratatouille.Beyond the hotel, this place is ripe for adventure. Spanish tourists mostly come for the epic cyclingBeyond the hotel, this place is ripe for adventure. Spanish tourists mostly come for the epic cycling, while scores of walking trails traverse mountainside, forest and idyllic green pastures. I start with a hike around the Parc Natural de la Zona Volcànica (there are 25 recommended trails,ranging from one mile to 10 miles) with local guide Mike Lockwood, a Brit who has lived in Catalonia for 20 years, Spain for more than 40.View image in fullscreenLucy Thackray took an ebike out for the day from Off Grid.Photograph: Lucy ThackrayParking up near the Croscat and Santa Margarida volcanoes, Lockwood tells me there are 40 dormant volcanoes in this park. “Would you like to go inside one?” he asks. I’m intrigued. On the far side of Croscat, a former quarry is revealed, a jagged cake-slice lifted from the volcano’s side. Lockwood deciphers its chalky stripes and fine cinder granules, layers of rust-red and huge chunks of rocks where the magma was blasted out at speed some 13,000 years ago. “It erupted for just three weeks,” he says. “That was enough to create all this.” Next we go to Fageda d’en Jordà, a striking beech wood whose undulating path was formed by the lava flow. It’s all fairytale mossy boulders and calf-height mushrooms.Alongside huge iron fireplaces, original artworks and farm trinkets are displayed prominently in the hotelOn another morning I hire an ebike from the hotel, and skim along quiet roads, to sleepy, cypress-framed villages reminiscent of Tuscany. Both L’Alta Garrotxa and the Parc Natural are well signed and easy to navigate – having a guide is a plus, but solo travellers won’t struggle to explore. The really hardcore Lycra-heads take to the mountainside, or set off on the 35-mile (57km) route from Olot to Girona.Yoga is currently available on-demand at Off Grid, but is set to run twice weekly from the new year in an onsite studio. Instructor Alba is from a nearby village, and is into bees, she says, lighting a beeswax candle and encouraging our group to buzz meditatively into the morning sunlight. Hunched from the past few months, I also book an hour with local masseur Jordi.View image in fullscreenA bedroom at Off Grid Girona, SpainPhotograph: Enric CurtoThe whole place lends itself to relaxation. Much of the hotel’s charming atmosphere comes from its past: hefty wood beams, an ivy-coated courtyard and antique pieces of furniture reupholstered by local artisans and restored to their former glory. Alongside huge iron fireplaces, original artworks and farm trinkets are displayed prominently.Off Grid owns some land across the road too, which is used to farm organic produce. The hotel is working to become as sustainable as possible, and much is locally sourced: small-batch coffee from the medieval town of Besalú (5 miles away); sustainable Bekume bed linen made in Olot (29km); toiletries from the Olively startup in the nearest city, Girona; wines from two Catalan wineries.There are plans for solar panels, an aerothermal heating system, a yoga pavilion, even an alfresco sauna. For now guests have the huge, unheated pool, trimmed by pumpkin-coloured loungers and scented Mediterranean foliage.Each morning, as the sun peeks through the trees, I venture down for a solitary swim – practically a cold plunge in these autumn days. Back home, motherhood can feel like a stream of anxiety about the next step, the next nap, the next choice to feel guilty about. Here, for the first time in months, I’ve time to think, to simply be – and it feels good.The trip was provided byOff Grid.

Healthy ways to put pudding back on the menuOur expert panel delivers the answers to levelling up your dessert without undoing your healthy eating effortsAnna BerrillTue 28 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 28 Oct 2025 09.05 EDTShareI eat healthily, butmy meals are never really complete without pudding. Yoghurt and stewed fruit aside,do you have any suggestions forwhat will hit the spot without verging too far into the unhealthy?Wendy,by emailThe truth is, you can’t often have your cake and eat it – or not a big piece, anyway. “My main piece of advice, which maybe isn’t all that welcome, is to keep to small portions,” says Brian Levy, author ofGood & Sweet, in which his recipes contain no added sugar. “My grandma would keep many chocolate bars and have just one, but that’s never really worked for me.”’Tis the season for stewed fruit, but have you triedMelissa Hemsley’s banana slicessandwiched together with peanut butter, half-dipped in melted chocolate and put in the freezer? (FYI the same tactic also works like a dream with dates.) “You can’t beat frozen grapes, either,” says baker Lily Jones, who’s behind theLondon by Lily Vanilli afternoon tea at the Four Seasons Tower Bridge. To “level them up a notch”, she sprinkles those with chilli flakes, salt or freeze-dried sour cherries.Equally chill would be Jones’s frozen peanut butter bites, which also happen to be gluten-free: “They’re peanut butter, maple syrup, oat milk and sea salt frozen into bite-sized moulds.” They’re then dipped in dark chocolate before being returned to the freezer, and are “the perfect hit of sweet that’s really satisfying, and also have healthy fat and protein”.Otherwise, try a batch ofLevy’s caramel apples: “They are rich and flavourful, chewy, buttery caramels sweetened only with fruit [apple juice and dates], plus a little miso.” It’s worth leaning into unrefined sugars, such as honey and maple syrup, too, says fellow sweet-tooth Flora Shedden, author ofWinter in the Highlands: “I’m terrible, but I don’t want my kids to have tons of refined sugar, although they’re now addicted to dates and prunes – it’s as if they’ve got the palate of an 80-year-old.”There are, however, some cravings that only a cookie can satisfy, and thankfully Shedden has a solution for such situations. “It’s quite a flexible recipe: mix oats, spelt flour or ground almonds, maybe some coconut, and perhaps a few nuts for natural sweetness, then bind that with a mix of tahini and maple syrup,” she says. “If your tahini has a thick consistency, you might need a bit of oil to loosen it. And you’ll also need to add a bit of bicarb and some vanilla.” Roll the mix into balls, flatten slightly, then arrange on trays lined with baking paper and bake at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, until golden brown and firm. You could up the ante, Shedden says, by whizzing frozen bananas à la Jamie Oliver, with yoghurt, maple syrup and a little cocoa powder into a “kinda ice-cream”, and use that to sandwich two cookies together.If all else fails, Levy’s advice would be simply to hunker down with some dark chocolate (“70% cocoa or more”) and a cup of Celestial Seasonings Bengal spice tea: “Spices can fool your palate into thinking you’re having something sweeter than you actually are,” he explains. Now that really would be sweet.Got a culinary dilemma?

Pimentón gives our food its soul. One of the dishes everyone loves back home isespinacas con garbanzos(spinach and chickpeas), which is it’s simple, nourishing and full of comfort. At this time of year, however, when the markets are overflowing with sweet pumpkins, I love adding them to the mix, too. Their gentle, autumnal sweetness lifts the spinach and chickpeas beautifully, and they combine to create a dish that we’ve been serving all month at my restaurantLoloin south-east London.Pumpkin and spinach with pimentón, orcalabaza y espinacas con pimentónPrep10 minCook50 minServes4-61kg pumpkin, deseeded and cut into large cubes3 tbsp olive oil1 tsp smoked sweet pimentón, or paprika1 tsp cumin seedsSalt and black pepper3 fatgarlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced500g baby spinach400g tin chickpeas, drained and rinsedHeat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½.Tumble the pumpkin into a large roasting tin and toss with two tablespoons of oil, the pimentón and the cumin seeds.
