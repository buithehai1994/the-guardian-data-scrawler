Reiner had a family interest in the workings of on-screen comedy: his father Carl had played a key role on Sid Caesar’s TV shows, which themselves were revolutionary, and helped birth a new generation of screen comics by directing Steve Martin’s film debut The Jerk. Rob had become a household name as Meathead, the liberal foil to Carroll O’Connor’s bigoted Archie Bunker in 70s sitcom All in the Family (the equivalent to Mike Rawlins v Warren Mitchell in the British original, Till Death Us Do Part). But it was as a director and producer that he really made his impact felt.Rob Reiner: a life in picturesRead moreIn 1984, Reiner releasedThis Is Spinal Tap, a “mockumentary” about a fictitious heavy metal band from the UK that rewrote the rules on what comedy could do. It sent up rock’n’roll behaviour and codified its cliches (with Reiner himself doing a hilarious parody of Martin Scorsese’s hosting role in The Last Waltz) and gave us zingers that haven’t lost their comedy power more than 30 years on: “The numbers all go to 11”, “it’s such a fine line between stupid, and er … clever.” Its deployment of improvised comedy was revolutionary for a Hollywood feature, and while Reiner wasn’t the first to use the fake-documentary techniques for comedic purposes (that goes back at least to Woody Allen’s Take the Money and Run), it hugely popularised the mockumentary style; subsequent efforts include Bob Roberts, Fear of a Black Hat, Drop Dead Gorgeous and Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. All these owe Tap a huge debt – as well as the microgenre of star Christopher Guest’s improv-mockumentaries: Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show and A Mighty Wind. Almost incidentally, Spinal Tap became a sort-of-real band, with tours, record releases and a follow-up feature (Spinal Tap II: The End Continues), in which the presence of music industry titans Paul McCartney and Elton John demonstrated the high regard in which the original was held.View image in fullscreenRob Reiner directing When Harry Met Sally in 1989.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library/AlamyReiner’s next film, The Sure Thing, was not perhaps as pioneering: a teen movie starring John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga, it was released a month after John Hughes’s The Breakfast Club in 1985, and somewhat overshadowed by it in public affection. But Reiner followed it up in 1986 with a very different type of teen movie:Stand by Me, adapted from Stephen King’s novella The Body. By no means the first adaptation of King’s work – Carrie had been a huge hit a decade earlier, with The Shining, The Dead Zone and Christine solidifying King’s reputation as “King of Horror” – but it alerted the wider culture to the author’s more literary output. The Body suited Reiner’s more romantic, nostalgic imagination, and Stand By Me became a film as inserted in the popular mindset as Tap, as well as playing a part in the 80s revival of 60s R&B by using the Ben E King song on its soundtrack – pushing it back into the Top 10 andprompting its use in a Levi’s commercial. Stand By Me also showed Reiner had the chops for drama as well as comedy – not for nothing did he name his production company Castle Rock, after the fictitious small town that King invented for much of his work (and itself named after the fort in Lord of the Flies).1:18A look back at some of Rob Reiner's top film and TV moments – video obituaryNext came Reiner’s third 80s masterwork, The Princess Bride, adapted from William Goldman’s novel; again, it wasn’t the first in the 1980s “storybook” cycle (The NeverEnding Story came out in 1984), but its brilliant melding of teen romance and comedic cliche-puncturing made it another enormously influential film, particularly in its sympathetic and articulate portrayal of its female protagonist Buttercup, played by Robin Wright. Having seemingly perfected the teen romance, Reiner then went on to release in 1989 one of his most triumphant works:When Harry Met Sally, with a script by Nora Ephron. Again, Reiner and Ephron can’t really be said to have invented the modern romcom (arguably Allen got there first with Annie Hall), but they recalibrated it for a new generation – particularly women, for whom the advent of notional workplace equality in the 1980s was beginning to throw up major life-goal dilemmas. With character weight and screen time distributed equally between leads Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan (as well as creating the epochal fake-orgasm sequence), Reiner and Ephron reinvigorated a classic template and made it newly relevant.View image in fullscreenRob Reiner (left) and Christopher Guest on the set of This Is Spinal Tap in 1984.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyPerhaps inevitably, Reiner’s directing career couldn’t quite live up to those four films in bending popular culture its way, though he did summon up one of Tinseltown’s biggest fears – stalkers – for another King adaptation,Misery, and gave us an early sighting of Aaron Sorkin by directing two films from Sorkin scripts: A Few Good Men and The American President. (The latter led directly to Sorkin’s hit TV series The West Wing, though Reiner wasn’t involved.) It was as a producer and studio executive of Castle Rock that he would make an even bigger impact. In 1989, the company produced a little-regarded pilot called The Seinfeld Chronicles, which tested so badly even they thought it was doomed to fail. As history records, Seinfeld became one of the most successful TV shows of all time, notching huge ratings, critical superlatives and ushering in the golden age of TV by showing that the medium could produce sophisticated, grownup entertainment for a mainstream market.Kiefer Sutherland and Rob Reiner: how we made Stand By MeRead moreAs a producer, Castle Rock reached new heights once again courtesy of King: two non-horror prison movies,The Shawshank Redemptionand The Green Mile, released in 1994 and 1999 respectively, both became major cult hits, with Shawshank regularlytopping audience pollsas the greatest film ever made. As befitted Reiner’s status as a liberal activist, Castle Rock also brought John Sayles’ politically inflected work into the mainstream with Lone Star and produced George Clooney’s cover-up thriller Michael Clayton; it also gave Larry David his first post-Seinfeld outing with the feature film Sour Grapes, and underwrote Richard Linklater’s endlessly influential Before series of romcoms featuring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.Reiner’s influence on Hollywood wasn’t about detonations and superpowers, but about ideas and empathy and wit, and was all the more impressive because of it.Explore more on these topicsFilmRob ReinerComedy filmsDrama filmsHorror filmsStephen KingSpinal TapfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They can tell when shoppers have stayed indoors by the number of sausage rolls left in the window. It’s a Tuesday before Christmas – supposedly the busiest time of the year. But there’s still a big pile remaining.“In 10 years’ time, we’re all going to be going, ‘We need shops. Where have they all gone?’,” Marriott says. Her warning echoes widespread fears for Brighton’s plentiful independent shops, which have given the Sussex city international renown.Small businesses are the life blood of the North Laine – the colourful streets around Dormitory, filled with quirky gift shops and cafes that spill into the road – and the Lanes, the neighbouring area where the narrow passageways and hidden squares are famous for their jewellers and antique shops. Last month, research by American Express and GlobalDatafoundthat the North Laine district was the most popular UK destination for independents among generation Z shoppers.But even here – the affluenthomeofsome of the UK’s favourite independents– the potential last generation of shopkeepers is under threat. The challenges have racked up: Brexit and the pandemic, the growth of online shopping, asqueeze on consumer spending, increased costs and concerns over crime – problems some say the recent budget does not go far enough to address.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves,announced plansdesigned to ease the business rate burden on retailers. While some independents will be small enough to qualify to not pay rates at all, some may ultimately receive higher bills linked to lower discounts and an increase to their property value.Many independent business owners in Brighton say any permanent discounts will also be offset by increases tonational insurance contributions (NICs)and thenational minimum wage– and that they are not seeing any benefits for the rates they already pay.Graham and Marriott opened Dormitory five years ago after long careers in retail, and maintain a wholesale and consultancy business that keeps their brand afloat. But over half a decade, owning bricks and mortar has reached a tipping point where their costs to run a physical store outweigh the returns. Once they are gone, Graham says, there’s no new generation of independent shopkeepers to replace them: “It will be the big chains.”View image in fullscreenSue Graham and Cathy Marriott opened Dormitory five years ago after careers in retail.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian“The internet’s becoming impossible to get what you want or to get advice – it’s so full of misinformation. A lot of the expertise will be lost,” she says, adding that they can tell customers which Italian manufacturers produce the yarn in their sheets and the name of the atelier where the fabrics are hemmed, embroidered and finished by hand.On nearby London Road, the coffee shop Presuming Ed’s has been serving drinks and supporting artists and musicians in an old HSBC bank for 11 years. Its owner, Richard Grills, says a combination of higher business rates, VAT, staff costs and additional council charges have reduced his profit margins significantly. As a hospitality venue, he has benefited from business rates relief, but since his premises were rerated and his relief reduced, his annual bill has gone up from £1,200 to £12,000.Grills says the relief hides a bigger problem of businesses not receiving essential council services in exchange for the payment. “The busier we get, the more people we need, the more costs incurred. There’s very little benefit in expanding. If you’re trying to start something now you haven’t got a chance,” he says. “The nation of shopkeepers will go on the dole because it’s easier.”On nearby Sydney Street, Kate Turnbull is making up a funeral wreath in the back of Gunns, a fourth-generation florist that has been in Brighton since 1875. “Brexit has certainly changed things,” she says, feeding chrysanthemums into florist foam.Gunns imports its flowers from the Netherlands, which means each delivery is subject to a customs charge. With three branches, Gunns pays a charge for each drop. Deliveries are held up regularly by customs checks in France or once they enter the UK, meaning Turnbull has to allow extra time to meet orders.Alongside pressures from increased staffing costs and more expensive utilities, Turnbull is worried about crime. She has had bikes stolen and the shop window smashed, but, she says, nothing has happened after she told the police.View image in fullscreenKate Turnbull from Gunns florist says Brexit has meant longer times for deliveries.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianInstead, the traders have set up a WhatsApp group and warn one another about suspects. When the window of Gunns was smashed, the nextdoor neighbour boarded it up in the night. “It’s a nice community,” Turnbull says. The WhatsApp group was started last summer by traders facing an increase in shoplifting and the threat of far-right riots. Recently, it evolved into a series of meetings with the council, tentatively called the Brighton Independents Forum, set up by the Green councillor for the West Hill and North Laine, Ellen McLeay.Councillor Jacob Taylor, the deputy leader of Brighton and Hove city council, says the forum is one way the council is trying to repair its relationship with small businesses, which he considers an essential part of the local economy and the city’s identity. “There hasn’t been a strong two-way relationship with the council acknowledging that the independent retail sector is such an important part of the city. The council can’t fix everything – the existence of Amazon or rates set by the government – but we can be more responsive and improve the local services we do control,” he says.At 9%, Brighton has one of the lowest retail vacancy rates in the country, according to a recent report by the Centre for Cities thinktank, coming in fifth after London, Cambridge, Oxford and York. In the central business improvement district, the rate is even lower, at 4%, compared with a national average of between 13% and 14%, according to the British Retail Consortium. Business churn, according to Taylor, is higher than average, signalling that while there is an appetite for entrepreneurship in Brighton, lots of shops fail.View image in fullscreenAmerican Express and GlobalData found that the North Laine district was the most popular UK destination for independents among generation Z shoppers.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianOn Bond Street, which runs south of Sydney Street, Mountain Warehouse acquired premises for the chain surf store Animal in August. In October, Ben & Jerry’s opened a branch there. McLeay says the makeup of local businesses is changing and chains are creeping in. “If we lose this footprint of independent shops we risk losing footfall in the high street,” she adds. “You end up with boarded-up shops – and it takes a long time to get the footfall back again.”The trend has been shown to have political impact. Reform UK wins more seats in places where the high street is in decline, according to Power to Change, a charitable trust supporting community businesses. Reform is the second most popular party in a quarter of parliamentary seats where persistent high street vacancy increased significantly between 2015 and 2023, compared with 14% across the rest ofEngland, its analysis shows..In Brighton, councillors are selling properties in public ownership to create housing in the face of a crisis in temporary accommodation and a homelessness problem.Susannah Dowse runs Dowse, an independent homewares store on Gardner Street. She has been trying to scale up as her business is growing and needs more space. But private landlords and property agents, including those working on behalf of the council, consistently favour big chains, leaving smaller traders stuck in premises that limit their potential, she says.“People still come to Brighton for the independent shops,” she says, “but that community is being chipped away by chains moving into areas where independents and creative businesses belong”.McLeay says change from the top is needed. She is calling for corporations to pay a greater share of tax to create a balanced economy, in recognition of the value independent and smaller traders bring to a community. Without change, she says, “we may see that this Christmas is the last for some businesses in the North Laine, and that’s local jobs gone and a community gutted”.Explore more on these topicsRetail industryEconomicsBrightonEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He’s a naturalJohn CraceThe liaison super-committee has an unavoidable tri-annual encounter with the prime ministerMon 15 Dec 2025 13.22 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 18.00 ESTShareAn afternoon withKeir Starmerisn’t necessarily many people’s idea of fun. A period of time when every minute feels like five.Sadly, for the select committee chairs who make up the liaison super-committee, they didn’t have the option of saying no. This was one of their unavoidable tri-annual encounters with the prime minister. Still, at least they all had the Xmas recess to look forward to at the end of the week. They would need a long lie down.To be fair, Keir also gives the impression he would rather not spend the afternoon with himself. He’s a man who has no trouble putting himself to sleep with his tortured use of English. Mind you, he isn’t the first prime minister to have worked out that boring the committee to death is the best strategy. And it helps that he’s a natural.The goal for such occasions is damage limitation. To end the session having committed no news whatsoever. Leaving everyone wondering why they had bothered. Democracy at its most pointlessly performative.“Order, order,” Meg Hillier began. Having allowed Starmer to make a brief statement on the Bondi terror attack, she announced that the first half of the session would be devoted to standards in public life. Keir immediately perked up. This wasn’t going to be a problem. He is a man who likes to think of himself as Mr Rules: there is nothing he likes better than talking through procedural matters.First up was the Conservative MP Alberto Costa. The pedant’s pedant. A man to make Keir seem spontaneous. He began with one of the prime minister’s tweets about the new bus fare cap. Had he broken the ministerial code? Paragraph 6, clause 3. You could feel what little energy there was being sucked out of the room. Starmer patiently tried to explain that the Tory price cap had ended a year ago and that his was a new one. As if anyone really cared that much. In the world of X, this wasn’t a major offence.Costa then moved on to ministers briefing government policy to the media before announcing it in parliament. Something every government has done for decades and which provokes faux outrage from the speaker and the opposition. Something people like to moan about but no one can be bothered to change.You couldn’t help feeling that Costa was a man whose life goal is to always miss the point. To ask the wrong questions at the wrong time. Imagine having 10 minutes to ask the prime minister whatever you want and you choose to waste everyone’s time with such dreary, trivial questions. There may well be questions of propriety to be asked. Freebies, Angela Rayner, Louise Haigh for a start. But these weren’t them.Labour’s Cat Smith went next. Had No 10 been briefing against cabinet ministers, she asked. For the first time, Starmer showed a flicker of life. No one had been more appalled by the briefings than him. He had set up an inquiry and would take action on wherever the evidence led. Just so long as it didn’t lead back to him. In any case, he knew it wasn’t him who had authorised the briefings because Keir had already asked Keir that question and Keir had assured him he had nothing to do with it. Case closed.“That’s odd,” said Hillier. Because Rachel Reeves had said much the same to the Treasury select committee the previous week. She had been furious that her decision not to raise income tax had been leaked by someone to the FT. Rachel had known it was definitely not her, because if it had been it would have been a briefing not a leak. Briefings were leaks that were authorised by her. A leak was a leak that someone else had done without her permission. These are fine distinctions at the top of government.Costa was not quite finished. Even though we all hoped he was. What about all the Labour leadership briefings? Starmer was fairly clear Wes Streeting and Andy Burnham were quite capable of leaking their ambitions to friendly hacks in the media without any help from No 10. Apart from the leaks that had come from No 10 in the mistaken belief that they might be beneficial to the prime minister.We then slid into an aimless discussion about the House of Lords. Though no one could quite bring themselves to suggest it was an idea well past its sell-by date. That it was packed with a bunch of superannuated politicians, party donors and third-rate loud mouth careerists. Mainly because you suspect that most of the people in the room have one eye on a peerage. Their reward for failure. Tory Simon Hoare did say he was worried about the “good chaps” principle of preferment. You couldn’t avoid the irony. Simon owes his career to being a good chap.Having wasted half the session on matters of little importance, Hillier moved on to Labour’s “plan for government” AKA Starmer’s five missions. This proved to be problematic. Because no one – not even Keir – can quite remember what they are. Each one dies first on the tongue and then on the memory.“How do you think things are going?” various committee members asked. Keir was alone in thinking they were all going really well. He couldn’t quite believe he hadn’t been given more credit. Though he was surprised that some things were taking longer than expected. No one else was.Smith and Alistair Carmichael tried to nail Starmer on the inheritance tax for farmers. Was he aware that it was now financially prudent for some farmers to die before the new rules came into effect in April? Keir nodded. Of course he was. He had given farmers more than a year to make their arrangements and they should just hurry up and die if they were so obsessed with passing on their farms to their children.This farm tax wasn’t targeting farmers. Farmers were just collateral damage in a tax aimed at farmers. It was just a bog standard change in the tax regime. “If you don’t listen to me, then listen to your colleagues,” Carmichael seethed. Keir ignored him.The rest of the session was a race to the bottom. Brief nods to the resident doctors’ strike, energy prices and the Swiss railway system. Tory Geoffrey Clifton-Brown – “Killer” to his friends after being thrown out of the Tory party conference in 2019 after an altercation – wasn’t even sure why he was there. And nobody bothered to enlighten him. Right at the end, Tan Dhesi was invited to ask about Ukraine. But he had lost the will to live. Starmer had to get to Berlin and we had all suffered enough.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe politics sketchLabourHouse of CommonscommentShareReuse this content"

David Coulthard later told me that all the Formula One drivers were staying there and were annoyed because they couldn’t sleep’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 15 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 17.17 ESTSharePer Gessle, singer, songwriter, guitaristIn my early 20s, I was in the biggest band in Sweden. But afterGyllene Tider[Golden Times] collapsed, I was depressed for two years. At first, Roxette only got together whenMarie Fredriksson, our singer, wasn’t busy with solo stuff. To keep her in the band, I needed to make it successful, so I was very motivated.Back then, apart from Abba, Sweden were pop underdogs. Our aim was just to get into other Scandinavian countries, or even Germany. But EMI Germany couldn’t get us on the radio, so they suggested I write a Christmas song. I wrote It Must Have Been Love (Christmas for the Broken Hearted), as it was originally titled, on the grand piano at home in Halmstad. I’d already started it as a love song: “It must have been love, but it’s over now.” But after the German label’s request, I added in asolitary reference to Christmasin the second verse. It was spring and I wasn’t feeling very Christmassy.I got 4,000 cards for my birthday. Today, the song is approaching a billion streamsThe demo I made had terrible vocals, because it’s a really tricky song to sing, but Marie was up for the challenge. We recorded it in time for Christmas 1987 and inSwedenit went Top 5. But EMI Germany hated it and didn’t want it.A couple of years later, after we’d had other hits, EMI called from Los Angeles asking me to write a song for Pretty Woman, starring Richard Gere Julia Roberts. The soundtrack already had David Bowie and Robert Palmer, but we were just about to fly to New Zealand so I told them I was too busy. Then I remembered “the Christmas song”.We dashed back into the studio, changed the “Christmas Day” lyric to “a winter’s day”, and added a new guitar melody at the beginning. Not long after, the director Garry Marshall called to say: “I wanted to let you know that when your song plays in the film, there’s no dialogue. It’s just 55 seconds of your music driving the whole movie.” The rest is history.One time after we became huge, we had 2,000 people outside our hotel room in Buenos Aires singing our songs all night long. David Coulthard later told me that all the Formula One drivers were staying there the same evening and were really annoyed because they couldn’t sleep. I got 4,000 cards for my birthday. I had people sleeping in my garden, stealing my underwear, even the aerial on my car!Today, the song is approaching a billion streams.People think it’s a power ballad, but it isn’t. The production is sparse. It doesn’t need power chords or big orchestrations: all the power is in Marie’s voice. She had the ability to pour her heart out.After she became ill, she came to one of my solo shows in Amsterdam and I asked if she wanted to join me on stage. She hadn’t sung in public for eight years but came on for the encore and sang It Must Have Been Love. I’ve never in my life seen so many people crying. Marie got so much energy from that that she wanted to make another album and go on tour, which we did. I think that gave her a couple more years.ClarenceÖfwerman, producerA friend of our engineer had just bought a studio in Stockholm that had a Synclavier, one of the first digital-sampling synthesisers, so a lot of It Must Have Been Love was made by programming. Then we added drums and guitar in the EMI studios. I improvised the piano solo, the only time I’ve ever done that. Just after the solo, there’s a big key change where Marie suddenly sings much higher. It’s really difficult to sing like that, but she gave such a great vocal performance.Marie Fredriksson obituaryRead moreIt wasn’t a party tune, so we didn’t try to make it Christmassy, with bells or anything. For the second version, Marie came in again to sing the changed line “a winter’s day”. Otherwise, the two versions aren’t that different. For the second one, though, the mixing engineer in LA put a load of gated reverb on the snare drum that he called his “lucky snare”, because it had already been on about 10 No 1 singles.Before the film came out, we’d almost forgotten about the song and weren’t playing it live. Then suddenly it was a monster hit. I never got to meet Richard Gere or Julia Roberts, but I’ll always remember that first day in the studio together. Per made us T-shirts saying: “Today Sweden, tomorrow the world.” We all laughed and said: “It happened to Abba but it’ll never happen again.” And then it did.Don’t Bore Us – Get to the Chorus!

Here is how to steer clear of the worst offenders, and what to do if they do make it throughJoel SnapeMon 15 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 05.02 ESTShareMany people in the modern world, it’s probably fair to say, do not take food poisoning particularly seriously. Yes, most folks wash their hands after handling raw chicken and use different chopping boards for beef and green beans – but who among us can honestly say we’ve never used the same tongs for an entire barbecue or left a storage box of cooked rice on the sideboard for a couple of hours? Ignore that rhetorical question for a moment, though – before you comment thatof courseeveryone should do all those things, let’s talk about what’s happening in your body when it all goes horribly wrong.At the risk of stating the obvious, food poisoning occurs when you eat food contaminated with harmful bacteria, viruses or toxins – but that doesn’t mean it always works the same way. “Some bacteria, such asBacillus cereus– sometimes found in reheated rice – produce toxins before the food is eaten, meaning they can cause symptoms such as sudden vomiting within hours,” says Dr Masarat Jilani, an NHS specialist who regularly manages children and adults with food poisoning.Bacillus cereusalso produces another type of toxin in the small intestine, which can cause diarrhoea. “Others, such asSalmonellaandE. coli, act after you’ve eaten and often cause longer-lasting symptoms through inflammation of the gut.”Technically speaking, then, an expert might be able to guess what type of bacteria or virus you have ingested based on how quickly you become ill after eating. But in practical terms, that rarely happens.“All of these bacteria work in different ways,” says DrEmma Doughty, an infectious disease scientist. “Campylobacter jejunibacteria, which you often find in poultry, are spiral-shaped and corkscrew their way through your gut lining. That’s different from, say, ShigatoxigenicE. coli, which excretes Shiga toxins. Both make you sick with gut inflammation and diarrhoea.” This means that, even though there are some effective treatments for food poisoning, such as antibiotics, it is not always easy for doctors to know which to prescribe.“If you’ve got a stomach bug and you go to the doctor, typically they’re not going to give you antibiotics,” says Doughty. “The reason for that is that if you’ve got the Shiga toxin-producing variant ofE. coli, and if you then kill all those bugs with antibiotics, they’re just going to release all the toxins inside them and make you even more sick. So without a specific infection diagnosis, it’s quite often safer to just let things get better on their own.”View image in fullscreenBeware the bacteria … they can lurk in every crevice.Photograph: Kinga Krzeminska/Getty ImagesWhat should you be doing to avoid all this unpleasantness? “Some of the most classic advice is still relevant,” says Doughty. “Oysters are always a risk, as is eating any kind of raw meat – there’s been a vogue for people to eat medium-rare burgers recently, which is a bit troubling.” To explain: if you are about to eat beef, you need to sear the parts that have been exposed to air to kill most of the bacteria likely to be living on it. With steak, that just means the outside, but with mince, that’s almost all of it.Washing chicken – stillbizarrely popular on TikTok– is an absolute no-no, as it’s likely to spread bacteria all over your kitchen and utensils, rather than reducing your chance of infection. Obviously, you should be keeping things clean, keeping raw meat separate from other food, quickly cooling cooked food and refrigerating it within two hours of cooking, and ensuring food is properly cooked, perhaps using a meat thermometer. “As with a lot of other infections, washing your hands is really valuable to prevent getting sick,” says Doughty. “In this case, it means washing your hands thoroughly after handling food, and after using the toilet.”If it all goes wrong, most people won’t have too much to worry about, assuming they aren’t in an at-risk population. “The main risk from food poisoning is dehydration, which is why it is important to drink plenty of water and supplement with oral rehydration salts when you are experiencing it,” says Jilani. “Reintroducing a balanced diet is also important for recovery, and in the initial stages we often recommend a Brat diet – bananas, rice, applesauce and toast – if you feel that you can’t reintroduce your normal one straight away.”View image in fullscreenBeige food – bananas, rice, applesauce and toast, among other things – is best for an upset stomach.Photograph: a_namenko/Getty ImagesIn more extreme cases food poisoning can lead to sepsis, which can include symptoms such as a fast heart rate and light-headedness. If you feel this might be happening, call the GP straight away. “In a minority of cases, you might also develop post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which can be characterised by abdominal pain and bloating,” says Jilani. Again, see a doctor if it persists.The good news is that most cases of food poisoning will clear up on their own in a few days, as your immune system sorts them out. Just be more careful with the tongs next time.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It still fails to treat us with respectJack FletcherWe can still call off this week’s strike – if the health secretary meaningfully addresses job shortages, real-terms pay cuts and the ongoing exodusDr Jack Fletcher is chair of the British Medical Association’s UK resident doctors committeeMon 15 Dec 2025 12.13 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 12.15 ESTShareResident doctors in England havevoted overwhelmingly to go aheadwith this week’s planned strike, because the government’s latest offer fails to address the medical jobs crisis and does nothing to stem the exodus of medics from this country.Despite the government spin, this offer will not lead to more doctors in our NHS. It makes a start, but the proposed increase of specialty training posts over the next three years, from the 1,000 extra announcedin the 10-year health planto 4,000, simplyrepurposes“locally employed doctors”, rather than increasing capacity. It will not mean more doctors on the shop floor of our A&E departments – it’s just shuffling the deck chairs on a sinking ship.This year it is estimated thatnearly 40,000 doctorswill apply for about 10,000 specialty training places. These are doctors who have completed years of training and who stand ready and waiting to care for patients, yet they will be denied opportunities because the posts do not exist. Even with the proposed legislation, without further measures we will still be turning those doctors away. Many more will join the training bottleneck queue. A lot will leave the NHS entirely.Patients already feel the consequences of these shortages. In some regions, including my own in the north-east, some lifesaving treatments are available only during office hours because there are not enough specialists to deliver them. A&E departments are overwhelmed. Yet, we continue to turn thousands of aspiring A&E doctors away because of the lack of training places in emergency medicine. These problems are the result of political choices, and they are unravelling in real time.Alongside this jobs crisis is the well-established fact that resident doctors havefaced a significant fallin the value of their wages over more than a decade. We asked for a fair multiyear process to begin repairing that loss. We made clear that we did not expect an instant reversal and that we were prepared to negotiate constructively. Yet the government’s last-minute offer did nothing on pay at all. Meanwhile, the government is quietly pushing real-terms pay cuts on to doctors in early 2026 through abelow-inflationuplift.Resident doctors in England vote to go ahead with strikeRead moreWhat has made this situation even harder to accept is the health secretary’s rhetoric in recent weeks. The very professionals whose union he accused of “juvenile delinquency” will be holding overstretched services together at the peak of this flu season. Thousands of us, myself included, will be caring for patients over the busy festive period instead of spending time with loved ones. We knew we’d be working Christmases when we signed up, but the disrespectful language being used, and lack of meaningful engagement with the problems we raise, shows a worrying disconnect with both the workforce and the public we care for.Accepting the current offer would mean accepting further decline. It would mean continued shortages of jobs. It would mean more real-terms pay cuts that push more doctors out of the profession and theNHS.There is still a constructive way forward. The government can choose to work with us to develop a workforce plan based on evidence, create the training posts required and enter serious negotiations on pay to retain doctors. These steps are essential for an NHS that depends on resident doctors who want to stay, to progress and to care for patients.I remain ready to negotiate and to call strike action off. But we need the secretary of state to recognise the reality we’re in, to treat the profession with respect, and work with us towards a credible deal – even at this late hour.Dr Jack Fletcher is an acute medicine doctor working in the north-east of England and chair of the British Medical Association’s UK resident doctors committeeDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But Washington has paused the implementation of the agreement, citing a lack of progress from the UK in lowering trade barriers in other areas.British officials sought to downplay the development, which wasfirst reportedby the New York Times. The newspaper said Trump’s administration was unhappy about the UK continuing to levy a digital services tax on American tech companies and its food safety rules, which bar the export of certain agricultural products.One British government source said it was “the usual bit of hardball negotiations by the Americans” and said that thedeal to allow tariff-free British pharmaceutical exports to the USwas on and off before it was finalised.“[The US commerce secretary] Howard Lutnick is a tough guy. We understand that the Americans negotiate incredibly hard but we’ll stand our ground. They want what’s best for their country, we want what’s best for ours,” the source said.A second government source said the development was “part of the shape of the negotiations” with Washington.The prosperity deal included the creation of an artificial intelligence “growth zone” in the north-east of England, which UK officials said could bring in up to £30bn and create 5,000 jobs.Starmer to pick new US ambassador as relations with Trump testedRead moreBut the text of the agreement stated that it only “becomes operative alongside substantive progress being made to formalise and implement” it.The decision to put it on hold is a blow to the UK government, which touted the agreement as a prize of its intensive year-long engagement with the US to avoid punitive tariffs on British exports. As part of his diplomatic charm offensive, Starmer hosted Trump for a second state visit at Windsor Castle in September, an unprecedented honour for a US president.Starmer has resisted US pressure to scrap or amend the digital services tax, a 2% levy on the revenues of tech companies including Amazon, Google and Apple that raises about £800m a year. Trumphas repeatedly threatened to retaliateagainst countries with digital taxes, including the UK.The Guardian revealedthat during trade negotiations in the spring, the government drew up proposals to reduce the amount paid by US tech companies and by applying the tax to a wider range of companies without reducing its total take. But so far the tax has remained unchanged.The US has also exerted pressure over the UK’s online safety rules, with officials promising to review their enforcement during the talks.A third area of contention has been the UK’s food safety regime, with ministers admitting that the US has raised objections to it. As part of the trade deal the government agreed to lower tariffs on some US agricultural products including beef, but it has stood by its manifesto commitment not to water down farming standards.Any decision to weaken these could open the door to Americanchlorine-washed chickenor hormone-treated beef being sold in Britain, a prospect that has long been highly controversial with farmers and consumer groups.At a press conference at Chequers in September, where he unveiled the tech prosperity deal, Starmer said it had “the power to change lives” and “renewed the special relationship for a new era”.“It’s our chance to ensure that technologies like AI, quantum and others amplify human potential, solve problems, cure diseases, make us richer and freer, strengthen democracy not tyranny,” the prime minister said. “This is the territory on which the future will be won.”Trump at the time said the deal would help the US and UK “dominate” in the world ofartificial intelligenceand “ensure our countries lead the next great technological revolution side by side”.Peter Kyle, the business and trade secretary, was in the US last week for negotiations with Lutnick, the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, and the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. Their discussions touched on whisky and steel tariffs and collaboration on critical minerals. Kyle’s department said talks were due to continue in January.A UK government spokesperson said: “Our special relationship with the US remains strong and the UK is firmly committed to ensuring the tech prosperity deal delivers opportunity for hard-working people in both countries.”The Guardian reportedat the weekend that Starmer was poised to choose his new ambassador to Washington after interviewing the three finalists last week. The three shortlisted candidates are the prime minister’s business adviser, Varun Chandra, who was central to negotiating the prosperity deal; Christian Turner, the incoming ambassador to the UN; and Nigel Casey, the ambassador to Russia.Explore more on these topicsTrade policyForeign policyTechnology sectorArtificial intelligence (AI)Donald TrumpKeir StarmerInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

A GoFundMe page set up to support his family has already raised more than $1.3m.The ABC reported on Monday that Naveed Akram, the younger man, had been investigated by domestic intelligence agency Asio over possible links to an Islamic State terror cell in Sydney. Albanese said on Monday that he came to the attention of authorities in 2019, “on the basis of being associated with others”, but did not specifically confirm the Islamic State connection.Federal government sources also declined to comment on this issue. On Tuesday morning, speaking on the ABC, Albanese expanded further on Asio’s 2019 investigation.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“The advice that we’ve received, though, is that Asio investigated him, found that he wasn’t subject to ongoing monitoring. They interviewed him, they interviewed his family members, they interviewed people around him,” he said.“He was drawn to their attention because of his association with others. Two of the people he was associated with were charged and went to jail, but he was not seen at that time to be a person of interest.“Whether he was radicalised further after that, what the circumstances are, that’s the subject of further investigation.”Albanese did not specifically draw links between Akram and IS, but in a later part of the ABC interview in response to a separate question, he said: “Antisemitism, of course, has been around for a very long period of time … Islamic State is an ideology that tragically over the last decade, particularly since 2015, has led to a radicalisation of some people to this extreme position, and it is a hateful action.”On the ABC’s 7.30 on Monday, Albanese said there was “no evidence that these people were part of a cell”.But, he said: “Clearly, they were motivated by this extremist ideology, and further detail, of course, will be released when the police go through their work.”The prime minister said he was “absolutely ready for the fight” to pursue major reform on gun laws,as proposed at national cabinet on Monday.One of the alleged gunmen, 24-year-old Naveed Akram, remains in hospital. TheNew South Walespolice commissioner, Mal Lanyon, said he expected to bring charges against Akram in the coming days.The other alleged gunman, Naveed’s father Sajid Akram, was shot dead by police at the scene.More thana thousand people gathered at the Bondi Pavilionto mark 24 hours since Sunday’s deadly attack. Rabbi Yossi Shuchat lit the candles of a five-foot-high menorah, telling those gathered: “Lightness will always persevere, darkness cannot continue where there is light.”Among the crowd were the NSW premier,Chris Minns, and opposition leader, Kellie Sloane.Hundreds also attended a prayer vigil at the Chabad of Bondi synagogue, the place of worship for many of those caught up in Sunday’s attack and whereone of those killed, Eli Schlanger, was assistant rabbi.In the Melbourne suburb of Caulfield, the heart of the largest Jewish community in Australia, more than 2,000 people including the deputy premier, Richard Marles, Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, and state opposition leader, Jess Wilson, gathered at the Caulfield Shule.Rabbi Effy Block from the Chabad of St Kilda said his congregation were reeling from “broken hearts, deep shock, and profound pain”.“Yes, our hearts are heavy. Yes, we are grieving ... but we will not be broken,” he said.“We will not be silenced and we will not give in to fear.”A multicultural celebration of Hanukah in Melbourne’s Federation Square, for the Pillars of Light festival, also went ahead. Addressing the crowd, Rabbi Gabi Kaltmann thanked everyone “for showing up and being here in solidarity”.Shock, grief and political reaction: Bondi terror attack aftermath – podcastRead more“We gather not in fear, but in strength,” he said. “We will light up our hearts and shine away this darkness by lighting the menorah.”A crowd also gathered outside the Australian High Commission in London for a vigil on Sunday evening, and vigils were held in Israel.The men are believed to have used legally obtained firearms to commit the massacre. Sajid Akram, who was a member of a gun club, had six weapons registered to him, which have all been recovered, police said.Four of these weapons, thought to include a rifle and shotgun, were seized at the scene in Bondi, with other weapons also found during a police raid at the house in Campsie.Naveed was an Australian-born citizen. His father had arrived in the country on a student visa in 1998, transferred in 2001 to a partner visa and had since been on resident return visas.Restricting the number of firearms a single person can ownand only issuing gun licenses to Australian citizens are among the changes to gun laws being considered in the wake of the attack.Antisemitic incidents, including assaults, vandalism, threats and intimidation, surged more than threefold in the country during the year after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, and Israel launched a war on Hamas in Gaza in response, the government’s special envoy to combat antisemitism, Jillian Segal, reported in July.Last year, there were antisemitic attacks in Sydney and Melbourne. Synagogues and cars have been torched, businesses and homes vandalised with graffiti, and Jews attacked in cities where 85% of the nation’s Jewish population lives.Visual explainer: how a night of terror unfolded in BondiRead moreBenjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, said he warned Australia’s leaders months ago about the dangers of failing to take action against antisemitism. He claimed Australia’s recent decision to recognise a Palestinian state “pours fuel on the antisemitic fire”.At a press briefing,Albanese rejected the accusationsand listed actions his government had taken, including criminalising hate speech and incitement to violence and a ban on the Nazi salute.Funding for physical security for Jewish community groupswould also be extended, he said.Segal, who was appointed by the Australian government last year to tackle a spate of graffiti and arson attacks on synagogues and Jewish businesses, said Sunday’s terrorist attack “did not come without warning”.“The writing has been on the wall,” Segal said in a radio interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Monday.Jewish community leaders echoed the call for more action. “There has been a shocking level of antisemitism that has been rearing its head in this country as it has in other countries. When antisemitism goes unchecked from the top, these are the things that happen,” said Levi Wolff, the lead rabbi at Sydney’s Central Synagogue.Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackAustralian police and policingAustralian politicsNew South WalesAnthony AlbaneseChris MinnsAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

But they added that significant differences remained over the future status of the Ukrainian territories occupied byRussia.Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday he had “very long and very good” talks with Ukrainian counterpartVolodymyr Zelenskyyand European and Nato leaders, adding: “We had numerous conversations with President Putin of Russia, and I think we’re closer now than we have been ever, and we’ll see what we can do.”Asked if he had recently spoken directly toVladimir Putin, Trump replied “yeah, I have,” but did not give any details.But Trump appeared to suggest that in exchange for security guarantees, Ukraine must agree to give Russia the parts of the eastern Donbas region that Kyiv still holds – something Zelenskyy has previously ruled out.“Well, they’ve already lost the territory, to be honest,” he said when asked what incentive Ukraine would have to give up land.Zelenskyy said talks with Trump’s envoys were “not easy” but brought “real progress” on the question of security guarantees. However, differences remained on the question of what territory. “There has been sufficient dialogue on the territory, and I think that, frankly speaking, we still have different positions,” Zelenskyy told reporters.Under the proposal, Ukraine would have western support to maintain a standing army of 800,000 troops, the US would lead a “ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism” to provide early warning of any future attack, and the European countries would also sign a “legally binding commitment, subject to national procedures, to take measures to restore peace and security in the case of a future armed attack”. Europe would also back Ukraine’s accession to theEuropean Union.The deal would effectively provide “article five-like” guarantees to Ukraine, according to two US officials briefed on the negotiations, comparing the security guarantees to those provided toNatoallies from foreign attacks.The US presented the new package at talks in Berlin this week with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as senior diplomats and security officials from European allies. The US officials said that they believed Russia would accept the security guarantees presented at the talks, which would mark a significant relaxation in the Kremlin’s demands for limitations on the size of Ukraine’s army and opposition to troops from Nato countries operating in Ukraine.The American delegation, which was led by the US envoy Steve Witkoff and Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, said Zelenskyy and European leaders had responded positively to the White House’s latest proposal for security guarantees resembling those given to Nato allies, and intended to prevent Russia from resuming its invasion if a peace agreement is reached.Any Russia-Ukraine deal is doomed without security guarantees, says StarmerRead more“I think the Ukrainians would tell you, as would the Europeans, that this is the most robust set of security protocols they have ever seen,” said one US official briefed on the negotiations. “It is a very, very strong package. I think hopefully the Russians are going to look at it and say to themselves: ‘That’s OK, because we have no intention [of restarting the war].’ We’re going to take them at their word.”US officials declined to give specific details of what that security package would include and who would defend Ukraine if Russia resumed its invasion after a peace deal was reached. They confirmed the US would not put boots on the ground in Ukraine as part of the deal.Nonetheless, the German chancellor,Friedrich Merz, told a news conference on Monday he believed the two sides were the closest to a real peace process since Russia’s large-scale invasion began in 2022.View image in fullscreenFriedrich Merz greets Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the chancellery in Berlin.Photograph: Action Press/Shutterstock“What the US has placed on the table here in Berlin in terms of legal and material guarantees is really considerable,” Merz said during a joint press conference with Zelenskyy.The Ukrainian president said he welcomed the “productive” discussions, as Kyiv’s top peace negotiator hailed “real progress” in the second round of talks in Berlin.The security guarantees are considered a key factor of a potential peace deal. Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, hadsaid earlierthat a deal between Russia and Ukraine would fail if it did not include “robust” security guarantees from the west.“It’s really important we attend to this in detail,” he said. “[Vladimir] Putin has shown time and again that he will keep coming back for more if he sees the chance.”Any Russia-Ukraine deal is doomed without security guarantees, says StarmerRead moreUS officials said on Monday they were still “brainstorming” the future status of the occupied territories of Ukraine under a peace deal, adding that they were considering these areas becoming an “economic free zone”. But they said there remained significant differences on the control and status of theterritories taken by Russia.“Ultimately, if we can get that defined, then it will really get to [Russia and Ukraine] to work out the final issues of sovereignty and to see if there’s a deal that can be done between them,” said a US official briefed on the talks.The two sides were also not in agreement on the future operations of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is located in Ukraine but is under Russian control. US officials said they wanted the two sides to split the power produced by the plant “50/50”. US negotiators claimed they had resolved “90%” of the disputes between the Russian and Ukrainian sides.Zelenskyy described the talks with the US side as “not easy” but said they had made headway. He said Russia was using its relentless strikes as leverage in negotiations and noted that not a single power station inUkrainehad been spared attack.Rustem Umerov, the secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, also struck an upbeat note on the discussions: “Over the past two days, Ukrainian-US negotiations have been constructive and productive, with real progress achieved,” he said.Umerov wrote on X that Witkoff and Kushner were “working extremely constructively to help Ukraine find a way to a peace agreement that lasts”.View image in fullscreenVolodymyr Zelenskyy (left) with the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, at Bellevue Palace in Berlin on Monday.A German government spokesperson said earlier that Witkoff and Kushner had also been invited to the working dinner.

Zelenskyy has said the US leader istargeting Christmas as a deadlinefor a “full understanding” on a peace plan.The search for viable terms for an end to the war has run into major obstacles, including a dispute over control of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, which is occupied mostly by Russian forces.Zelenskyy on Sunday expressed readiness to drop his country’s bid to join Nato if the US and other western nations gave Kyiv legally binding security guarantees similar to those offered to alliance members.View image in fullscreenZelenskyy departs the chancellery after talks with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersHe also said he hoped Washington would accept freezing the frontline where it was, rather than Ukraine ceding the entire Donbas region, which comprises Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.Putin has described Ukraine’s drive to join Nato as a major threat to Moscow’s security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. “Naturally this issue is one of the cornerstones and, of course, it is subject to special discussion,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Monday, adding that Moscow was expecting a US briefing on the Berlin discussions when they were over.European leaders stressed that the outcome of the talks on Ukraine would affect their own countries’ security for decades to come. Merz said at the weekend that Putin’s goal was “a fundamental change to the borders in Europe, the restoration of the old Soviet Union within its borders”.“If Ukraine falls, he won’t stop,” the German chancellor told a conference of fellow conservatives in Munich.Russia has denied it intends to attack Nato members.View image in fullscreenSteve Witkoff, the US special envoy, leaves the Adlon hotel in Berlin on Monday.Photograph: Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty ImagesIn London, meanwhile, the head of Britain’s foreign spy service, MI6,has warned that Russia poses an “aggressive, expansionist” threatin her first speech since taking office.Blaise Metreweli took over from Richard Moore in October, becoming the first woman to leadMI6.She said Putin was not serious about trying to end the war in Ukraine, describing him as “dragging out negotiations” and shifting the burden of the conflict on to his own population.The EU, meanwhile, is scrambling this week to agree a plan on financing Ukraine in the coming years by using frozen Russian assets. A leaders’ meeting is scheduled to begin on Thursday and a deal still appears elusive.European leaders including Zelenskyy will also meet in The Hague on Tuesday to launch an International Claims Commission to compensate Kyiv for hundreds of billions of dollars in damage from Russian attacks and alleged war crimes.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropean UnionKeir StarmerEmmanuel MacronFriedrich MerzVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

Trump also claimed Reiner died “due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind-crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME”.Trump then pivoted to praising his own accomplishments, asserting that Reiner’s alleged “raging obsession” and “obvious paranoia” toward him stood in contrast to his administration. Trump also maintained that he had “surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness … with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before”.Later on Monday, Trump responded to a reporter’s question during an unrelated White House event by doubling down and mocking the director. “I wasn’t a fan of his at all, he was a deranged person as far as Trump is concerned,” the president said.“He knew it was false, in fact it was the exact opposite, but he said that I was a friend of Russia, controlled by Russia, the Russia hoax, he was one of the people behind it. I think he hurt himself career-wise, he became like a deranged person,” he added.Los Angeles police on Mondayconfirmedthe Reiners’ 32-year-old son, Nick, had been arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the deaths of his parents. His bail was set at $4m.Celebrities and lawmakers, meanwhile, were swift to lambast Trump over what they described as “petty” and “disgusting” comments.“What a disgusting and vile statement,” actor Patrick Schwarzeneggerwroteon X.Similarly, television host Whoopi Goldberg, who described Reiner as her friend and “quite an amazing man,” condemned Trump.Referencing Trump’s ownattackson critics of the far-right political activist Charlie Kirk, who was shot dead in September. That killing prompted reprisals from the White House against those who cited Kirk’s history of hostile rhetorictowardimmigrants, women and other marginalized groups. And Goldbergsaid: “I don’t understand the man in the White House. He spoke at length about Charlie Kirk and about caring, and then this is what he puts out. Have you no shame? No shame at all? Can you get any lower? I don’t think so.”Meanwhile, California’s Democratic governor Gavin Newsomwroteon X: “This is a sick man.”Echoing Newsom, US House member Maxwell Alejandro Frost, a Florida Democrat,said: “What a despicable piece of garbage.”US senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, similarlysaidof Trump: “He’s just lost it. Now saying Rob and Michele Reiner caused their own murder because they didn’t support him. So sick.”US House member Zoe Lofgren, another California Democrat,calledTrump’s comments “a new low for this petty, hateful man”. Lofgren added: “His party needs to condemn this.”Similarly, US House member Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican,wrote: “This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies.”Greene also seemingly alluded to Nick Reiner’s past experiences with addiction and homelessness, writing, “Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It’s incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.”Greene’s fellow Republican US House member Thomas Massie struck a similar chord. The Kentucky representativesaid:“Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered.”Massie also said he challenged anyone in his party – including vice-president JD Vance and White House staff – to defend Trump’s commentary.Reiner had long been a vocal critic of Trump. In a 2017 interview with Variety, he said Trump was “mentally unfit” to be president. And Reiner warned the Guardian that the US could slide into autocracy if Trump successfully ran for a second presidency in 2024 – which he did.“We see autocracy making its move around the world,” Reiner said at the time. “If we [the US] crumble, there’s a danger that democracy crumbles around the world.”Despite hiscriticismsof Trump and far-right Christian nationalist movements, Reiner expressed “absolute horror” and unequivocally condemned political violence after Kirk was shot.“It’s beyond belief what happened to him,” Reiner said at the time. “That should never happen to anybody. I don’t care what your political beliefs are. That’s not acceptable. That’s not a solution to solving problems.”Meanwhile, Reiner’s wife, Michele – formerly Michele Singer before her marriage – was the photographer behind the cover image of Trump’s 1987 book The Art of the Deal.“My wife, Michele, who is a professional photographer – she took the photo that’s on the cover of the book The Art of the Deal,” ReinertoldPolitico at one point. He also said: “They were up on this high-rise that he was constructing, and they were going to take the pictures overlooking [New York City’s] Central Park. And the wind was blowing, and he said: ‘I got to get this hairspray, you know, I need this special hairspray.’”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpRob ReinerUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

They have had to reschedule an estimated 38,500 outpatient appointments and treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy for cancer.They also fear that consultant (senior) doctors will be too busy covering the work of their more junior colleagues during the strike to help hospitals undertake their traditional pre-Christmas clearout of patients who are well enough to leave, so they can give their beds to others who need to be admitted during the cold snap that usually causes problems during the festive season.The Patients Association called for third-party arbitration after resident doctors voted 83% to 17% against a deal the BMA called “too little, too late”. They had voted in a survey of opinion about an offer that, if accepted, would have led to the doctors’ union calling off their five-day walkout, which will now start as planned at 7am on Wednesday.Arbitration could break the “endless cycle of disruption, cancellations and anxiety” that has existed since the dispute began in March 2023, the association’s chief executive Rachel Power said.“It’s clear the current approach isn’t working. Independent mediation is the only credible path to a lasting solution that protects patients,” she said after the rejection.“Both the BMA and the government must now commit to independent arbitration immediately. This must happen now. This cycle must end.”A senior NHS official admittedthat hospitals may be harder hit than during previous walkoutsand unable to provide the 95% of planned, non-urgent care they did the last time.Senior doctors will be stationed at the entrance to A&Es to encourage less seriously unwell patients to seek help elsewhere, such as with a GP, pharmacy or urgent treatment centre.The doctors’ rejection triggered a new round of verbal hostilities. Streeting decried resident medics for taking part in “self-indulgent, irresponsible and dangerous” industrial action. Their pursuit of a 26% pay rise, having already seen their salaries increase by 28.9% since 2022, was “a fantasy demand”.His offer would have doubled the number of training places early careers doctors can apply for from 2,000 to 4,000, but did not include a further pay rise for 2025-26, which he has ruled out.In a direct appeal to resident doctors, Streeting asked them to work normally this week, despite the union’s stance. “Abandoning your patients in their hour of greatest need goes against everything a career in medicine is meant to be about.”Keir Starmer said he was “very gutted” by the BMA’s “irresponsible” decision to press ahead with the walkout.But the BMA hit back. Ina comment piece for the Guardianthe chair of the BMA resident doctors committee decried “government spin” about the offer, said it would not result in the NHS having any more doctors and accused Streeting of using “disrespectful language” about them.Dr Jack Fletcher saidthe government’s offer, made last Wednesday, involved simply “repurposing” existing “locally employed doctors” and amounted to “just shuffling the deck chairs on a sinking ship”.The 4,000 places will do too little to end an NHS-wide “training bottleneck” of unemployed doctors that results from up to 40,000 of them competing with each other for only about 10,000 places to train in their chosen specialist area of medical practice, such as psychiatry, A&E or surgery.The lack of training places is the result of “political choices” not to fund or staff the NHS properly, Fletcher added. In addition, the government’s pay offer to resident doctors for 2026-27 – a 2.5% uplift in their salaries, despite inflation being closer to 4% – represented a “real-terms pay cut”, he added.Meanwhile, hospital bosses warned that the strike would harm patients and put them at risk, and urged the BMA to reconsider. “Despite NHS leaders working increasingly hard to prepare for these strikes, we are concerned if resident doctors walk out during a record flu surge it could put patient safety at risk,” said Rory Deighton, the NHS Confederation’s acute and community director.“We would urge the BMA to recognise these strikes are disproportionate given the generous pay rises resident doctors have already had, call them off and moderate their demands so a solution to this long-running dispute can be found.”Its timing makes this week’s stoppage difficult for the NHS. It is already facing its toughest winter in years as a wave of flu has left 2,660 people seriously ill in hospital – the most ever for the time of year – amid a warning from the NHS England chief executive, Sir Jim Mackey,it could soon hit 8,000.“We expect the operational impacts of this round of industrial action to be more severe due to the combination of winter pressures and proximity to Christmas,” NHS England’s national director for emergency planning, Mike Prentice, said indetailed guidanceissued to the service on Monday on how to handle the strike.Explore more on these topicsHospitalsIndustrial actionHealth policyNHSEnglandPublic services policynewsShareReuse this content"

Safety was never compromised, and we are working with policing to ensure nobody is incorrectly prosecuted in future.“Enforcement is still in place, and the public can remain confident that only motorists who break the rules will be penalised.”A spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs’ Council said police forces were working to identify and contact “a very limited number of motorists”.They added: “Policing enforces a range of offences, including speeding, on the strategic road network through a number of tactics including mobile camera deployments, roads policing patrols and average speed sites.“This remains unchanged. If you are affected by this issue, you will be contacted and details of the compensation scheme will be shared in due course.”Explore more on these topicsMotoringEnglandTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

It was the nightly menorah candle lighting, typically a festival of joy and celebration, but this year the atmosphere had a sombre tinge.As well as celebrating the annual festival, members of the Manchester Jewish community are mourning those who were killed in a terrorist attack in Bondi beach, Sydney, where15 people were shot dead and dozens injuredduring a religious gathering on Sunday.The car park where worshippers gathered was lined with police and security, now a normality for the Jewish community, who have faced a recent rise in antisemitism. As festivities commence, attenders were juggling feelings of sorrow.Sholom D, 33, a member of the synagogue, said he had “mixed feelings because it’s quite difficult going through what we have to go through, and that sense of insecurity”.“The difficult part is that we’re sort of used to it, we grow up knowing the history,” he said. “It’s always part of us, but you just realise it more and more.”View image in fullscreenWorshippers at Heaton Park synagogue during the second day of Hanukah.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIt is just two months since two people were killed during anantisemitic terrorist attack at Heaton Parksynagogue.Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, were killed in the attack on 2 October. Cravitz was stabbed by attacker Jihad al-Shamie. Daulby was accidentally shot by police as he tried to stop Shamie entering the synagogue.That tragedy also took place during a Jewish festival, Yom Kippur, making the community particularly worried around holiday periods. But in spite of events, spirits were raised, traditional music was blaring and members of the crowd danced jubilantly, the glowing lights of the giant menorah candle blurring with the blue lights of police cars parked outside.“Here on this spot, evil stood,” said rabbi Daniel Walker, as he led the opening prayer on the steps outside Heaton Park synagogue. “But this is a place of joy and tonight we are reclaiming that joy, we are reclaiming that light and we’re shining it out into the whole world.”Rising antisemitic hate crime has left Jewish communities across the world fearing for their safety. In Heaton Park, their worst fears became a reality and events in Australia were another cruel reminder of the deadly threats Jewish people face.TheCommunity Safety Trustrecorded more anti-Jewish hate crimes in 2023 than ever before in the UK, with 4,296 reports. The following year, 3,528 instances were recorded, the second-highest annual total.View image in fullscreenMayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, addressed the event and condemned ‘abhorrent acts of antisemitism’.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe mayor of Greater Manchester,Andy Burnham, was in attendance and addressed the crowd, condemning “abhorrent acts of antisemitism”.“We think today of people affected by what happened in Sydney and I know it has reverberations here,” he said, pledging to “do more to provide reassurance and work with partners in the Jewish community to protect the community”.In Hebrew, Hanukah translates to dedication, a celebration of the triumph of light over darkness. Many in attendance embraced this spirit.Bondi beach terror attack: thousands mourn at vigils around Australia as Albanese promises stricter gun lawsRead more“I feel strongly about how people can get together and make one big happy family,” said Neil Reisman, 36, a member of a nearby synagogue. “It doesn’t matter if you’re in a different country, we’re all holding hands and hugging each other and I feel very warmly about that.”Meanwhile, in London, about 3,000 people attended a vigil outside parliament in memory of those who died in Sydney.Organised by the Campaign AgainstAntisemitism(CAA) and the Jewish organisation Chabad Lubavitch UK, the event combined Hanukah celebrations with a call to stand against rising antisemitism.Dozens of Israel flags fluttered in the December night as roads were closed to facilitate attendees. On a small stage lit by a large menorah-style decoration, the CAA chief, Gideon Falter, opened proceedings by condemning the killings.View image in fullscreenPolice were stationed outside the synagogue during the event.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“We stand in solidarity [with the victims],” Falter told the crowd in Parliament Square before religious leaders led prayers.The Labour MP, Ashley Dalton, told the vigil: “We’re here to stand together against the hatred and the vitriol from wherever it comes. The government does not and will not tolerate antisemitism. We stand with Jewish people today.”The event was heavily policed, with CAA stewards and additional private security monitoring the crowds.“I came down tonight to show my support and solidarity for Jews on Hanukah after the horrible events that took place in Sydney,” said Aaron Cowland. “I felt a real need to come and support my community.”Cowland said that any British Jew who did not already fear antisemitism was “very mistaken in their understanding of what’s happening in the UK currently”.“At the minute, there is so much hatred shown towards Jews – especially in London – and I think tonight is almost a message about someone please protect us. Against people who needlessly want to kill us,” he said.Among those attending was Sophie Lupton. “Too many people are dying,” she said. “Because too many lies are being believed. The world is turning a little bit upside down. We’re living in strange times.”Explore more on these topicsManchesterAntisemitismJudaismGreater ManchesterReligionAndy BurnhamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Among the many tributes he has paid to Pinochet, Kast said during the 2017 presidential campaign: “If [Pinochet] were alive, he would vote for me.”His election “is bad news for Chile’s democratic system”, said Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser, a populism researcher and professor at the Institute of Political Science at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.“What we are seeing with Kast is a return to the origins of a right that clearly did not have democratic credentials,” said Kaltwasser.Like many rightwing leaders across the region, Kast describes himself as an admirer of El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele, who has imprisoned at least 2% of his country’s adult population as part of a controversial crackdown on gangs.“My fear is not that Chilean democracy will collapse in four years, but that the conventional right will shift ever further to the right and democratic rightwing forces will therefore disappear,” said Kaltwasser, adding that there is no evidence to support Kast’s claim that rising migration is responsible for the increase in crime.Many analysts and political leaders see Kast’s election as part of a rightwing wave sweeping Latin America, with victories this year in Ecuador, Bolivia, Argentina and – according to the latest data from a vote count that has dragged on for three weeks – Honduras.Colombia’s leftist president, Gustavo Petro, acknowledged the trend, tweeting: “From the south and from the north come the winds of death … Fascism advances.”Alongside the rightward shift, there is also a regional swing towards “hardline security measures,” said Sandra Pellegrini, a senior analyst for Latin America and the Caribbean at the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED).She attributes this wave largely to a widespread public belief that Bukele’s measures have been successful in El Salvador. “What people are not seeing, or seem not to worry about, is the trade-off behind such a decrease – which has been a striking surge in state-perpetrated violence and human rights violations.”Under Bukele’s state of emergency imposed, hundreds of indiscriminate raids particularly in low-income neighbourhoods have led to the arrest of more than 81,000 people, drawing widespreadcondemnationfrom human rights groups.Pellegrini recently published areportarguing that the US military buildup on Venezuela’s doorstep and its deadly strikes on alleged drug boats – which have already killed more than 80 people – “may be more about pressuring governments to align with its foreign policy goals”.Trump has justified the operations as part of a “war on drugs” and has threatened similar action in Colombia, accusing the country of not being tough enough in curbing its cocaine production.But many in the region see the threat of a US invasion or strike on Venezuela is intended to force regime change and the removal of dictator Nicolás Maduro,According to the ACLED report, pressure from the White House for governments to be “tougher” is aimed at “reasserting the US as the dominant economic player in the Western Hemisphere and securing access to the region’s resources, staving off Chinese influence by promoting the emergence of US-aligned governments”.Pellegrini added: “Conducting strikes – or extrajudicial killings, as the UN has called them – is clearly sending a message to governments across the region that human rights are no longer a priority for the US and that the cost of committing human rights violations is much lower.“There is a real risk that we could see more of this in the coming years, not only in Chile, but across the other governments that have embarked on the path of militarisation,” she said.Explore more on these topicsChileThe far rightAmericasAugusto PinochetanalysisShareReuse this content"

She lost a majority, lost multiple Commons votes on her flagship policy, lost dozens of ministers and cabinet ministers, had members of her own party selling “chuck Chequers” badges at her party conference, and narrowly survived a confidence vote before she was finally ousted. Yes, the Labour leader is polling at historic lows – but things can get a lot worse.But can anything stop the Westminster leadership rumour mill once it gets going?Keir Starmereven joked about it at the liaison committee on Monday. “It seems to be pretty rife,” he said.‘Could do a better job than Keir Starmer’: who could replace the PM if he is forced out?Read moreLike May, Starmer does not intend to go quietly. The message from the prime minister’s allies doing the somewhat cack-handed briefing about a supposed coup plot byWes Streetingwas not primarily aimed at the health secretary himself, but to remind would-be challengers that Starmer would stay and fight.“This is not like Hartlepool,” one cabinet minister says, referring to the byelection loss thatalmost resulted in Starmer quittingas Labour leader. “He was on the brink then because he was finding the job of being opposition leader very hard, but this is different, he wants to stay as prime minister.”Everyone in Westminster has their different theory about how things went so bad so quickly: Starmer’s aloofness towards his MPs, the early harshness of the whipping system, unforced errors such as the winter fuel allowance cut or wardrobes furnished by Waheed Alli.Some blame the assisted dying vote as the first moment MPs got a taste for rebelling against the prime minister and organising their own internal whipping systems.No 10 has tried various tactics to counter the leadership speculation – and the one that is working better than the macho briefing war is the quiet but dogged work of the new political secretary, Amy Richards, to get Starmer to spend much more time with his own MPs.But once the warm wine starts flowing at the regional Christmas receptions, MPs and advisers can talk of little else but wargaming the leadership battles to come.For Labour, this is a particularly diverting topic of conversation, because no one knows exactly how a leadership challenge could come about. When the Conservatives were in power, it was all talk of letters to the 1922 Committee.This time there is no clear sense of how Streetingor Andy Burnham– or anyone else – might seize power. And because of how widely this is being discussed, it is not surprising that various theories make it into the newspaper pages.View image in fullscreenAndy Burnham has been repeatedly mentioned in Labour leadership speculation.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAThe mayor of Greater Manchester and the health secretary protest in public about the attention, issuing angry posts on social media or tortured metaphors about pantomime baddies in interviews.But they are not novices. Burnham knows the headlines that will follow when he says: “If the call came, I’m not going to just turn away from it.” Streeting knows his comments about how the government is acting like a “maintenance team” will be interpreted as a critique of Starmer’s style.Neither man has a clear route to doing anything about their current frustrations. Nor doesAngela Rayner, waiting for judgment day from HMRC before she can start to truly plot her route back.And so it goes on, with MPs discussing how Streeting and Rayner might reach a deal, never quite clear in whose favour. They talk about who will be the kingmakers in any coronation – Ed Miliband? Lucy Powell? Louise Haigh and the Tribune group?They talk about how Streeting might face a runoff against Shabana Mahmood and be thus able to present himself as the plucky leftwinger. They muse on how Burnham might return to Westminster, if Andrew Gwynne is really serious about staying the full parliament – or if the recently ousted ex-minister Jim McMahon might fancy a job swap for mayor of Greater Manchester.They ponder whether internal Labour and union elections – especially the next general secretary of Unison – might shift the balance of the NEC and give Burnham an opening – or whether Morgan McSweeney could engineer an all-female shortlist to block him.It is all diverting gossip. Some of it is at least in touching distance of reality, but any really serious leadership contender will need to articulate exactly how they plan to do things differently, when so much of what has hamstrung Starmer – a rocky economy, international turmoil and a febrile party – will remain the same.Explore more on these topicsLabour party leadershipLabourKeir StarmerWes StreetingAndy BurnhamAngela RayneranalysisShareReuse this content"

There are synths that sound like a Dyson on its last legs. There are the kind of trashy guitars that contractually can only be played by someone sporting a lime mohawk, low-riding leather trousers and nothing else. There is the baby talk of her biggest hit Bad Romance, only where that was “Ro-ma, ro-ma-ma / Gaga, ooh la la” it’s now “Ama ooh na-na / Abracadabra, mutta ooh Gaga”. You can see the difference, right?The least charitable reading is that this was a cynical, market-driven, even artistically lazy move from someone who had to centrally realign her brand after a number of failures. The broadening of her music on Artpop (2013) and Joanne (2016) hadn’t played well with the public, and while heractingandsoundtrack recordingsfor A Star is Born were superb, hersimilarly ambitious workfor Joker: Folie à Deux badly flopped. The Bennett duets had charm – played so incredibly straight that they were almost subversive – but they were gooey, not gaga.And yet the song that gave her the biggest hit of her career was just as traditional: Die With a Smile, last year’s multi-billion-streaming duet with Bruno Mars. The more cynical move would have been to replicate it. Instead, when you hear it tacked on to the end of the joyously chaotic Mayhem, it sounds like Mars is holding her hostage in a Vegas casino ballroom.Lady Gaga: Zombieboy – videoGaga’s own explanation for the sound of Mayhem is more persuasive. She told Rolling Stone that the years she spent expanding her artistry took a psychic toll, and making Mayhem was “months and months and months of rediscovering everything that I’d lost. And I honestly think that’s why it’s called Mayhem. Because what it took to get it back was crazy.” The strength of the record, and how at home she sounded, underscored her claim that she was authentically expressing her true self.The backing tracks are cybernetic Frankenstein’s monsters knocked together from fragments of digital sound, a natural fit for Gaga’s voice and hers alone. She leans into the hamminess that makes her great: the Meat Loaf yell at the peak of Perfect Celebrity, the flirtatious backchat on Zombieboy, the stentorian operatics of Vanish Into You. All three, plus LoveDrug, How Bad Do U Want Me and Garden of Eden, could easily have been hit singles – as it is, they are some of her very best album tracks, full of zest and zip.At times you can hear influences from beyond the realm of pure Gaga. The vocal on How Bad Do U Want Me is reminiscent of Taylor Swift, while the backing dances tantalisingly close to Yazoo’s Only You. Killah does the same with David Bowie’s Fame. There are stray drops of Leona Lewis’s Bleeding Love on The Beast, and shades of DeBarge’s Rhythm of the Night on Shadow of a Man.Lady Gaga review – from skeletons to sexy plague doctors, this is a glorious, ridiculous spectacleRead moreGaga’s “come on” in Garden of Eden is a dead ringer for Rihanna’s on S&M – but that song was itself in thrall to Gaga’s earlier work, and Mayhem shows beyond doubt how influential Gaga has been. The top line of Vanish Into You, for instance, shows how much she must have informed Sia’s pop songwriting. And while Nile Rodgers-style disco guitars are now a stock element of pop, Gaga uses them not just as a signifier of nightlife, but to genuinely evoke the bliss and abandon of a mad night out.After some projects that felt like Gaga was trying too hard to be bigger than herself, on Mayhem she settled back into exactly who she is – a feeling enhanced by the dramaturgically wonky but extremely vibeyMayhem Ball tour, which was like a goth influencer’s wedding with an infinite budget. If it all looked and sounded familiar, it’s mostly because we’ve been living in a pop world shaped by Gaga herself for nearly two decades.Explore more on these topicsLady GagaBest music of 2025Pop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here was Al Pacino andRobert De Niro, two legends the movie’s trailers flexed by their rhyming last names only, both masters of their craft who, much like their characters, had been watching each other from a distance (maybe competitively, maybe with respect and admiration), sharing the screen for the very first time. The pent-up anticipation was built right into the narrative, which patiently delays the onscreen face-off between Pacino’s dogged homicide detective Vincent Hanna and De Niro’s career criminal Neil McCauley for almost 90 textured and intense minutes.‘The age of toys is over’: first Toy Story 5 teaser trailer introduces a new tech foeRead moreImagine the surprise then, and the comic relief, when the moment finally arrives, and these two opposing forces collide (as the trailers would say) … for a warm and exceptionally civil cup of coffee.That calling card scene, inspired by a 1964 exchange between Detective Chuck Adamson and the real-life Neil McCauley, may not have delivered the fireworks we would have expected in a high stakes cat-and-mouse thriller with a mounting body count. But there are fireworks to be sure: two larger-than-life performances of men left alienated and melancholic by their chosen careers. They ever so briefly set their differences aside, let their tough guy demeanor slide, and simply see each other’s vulnerability.Michael Mann’s masterpiece, a sprawling, epic beast of a movie, may be remembered and celebrated by most film bros, 30 years on, for its centrepiece bank robbery. Those thunderous claps of a mid-day shootout and Val Kilmer’s tactical maneuvering as he rains down gunfire, which is said to be studied by Marines, are unparalleled to this day. But what really stands out is the way Mann loosens up the cops-and-robbers formula and lays out a tapestry of lost souls in LA, its remarkable tenderness and lyrical beauty transcending the genre tropes.Steely determination keeps these characters at opposite ends of a gun and a badge. Heat is constantly searching for the cracks that expose their yearning for human connection, even in their foes. The book McCauley is reading in preparation for a heist, Stress Fractures in Titanium, is a clever little nod to who these people are and what this movie is about. It would have made a cool movie title too, but the current one is just fine.Heat is the movie Mann had been slowly building towards, expanding the LA noir style and labour-intensive ethos in his previous heist thriller Thief (in which the real Adamson appears and worked as a consultant), not to mention his earlier stab at the same story in the abandoned pilot turned TV movie LA Takedown. His return to the crime genre in Collateral and Miami Vice, while towering works on their own, largely live in Heat’s shadow. They’re in good company. The Dark Knight, Den of Thieves and HBO’s acclaimed new crime series Task don’t just share that space, with their eagerness to channel Heat’s gravitas, they proudly wear it as a badge of honor.Heat ticks along on the dueling performances from Pacino and De Niro, the former’s blustery swagger a stark contrast to the cool, carefully curated composure of the latter. Those kinds of competing notes could be found and savoured across the movie. There’s the luxurious and seductive sheen in Mann’s images capturing industrialized landscapes, and the ugly violence that erupts from within; the airtight control that McCauley and Hanna (and Mann) exert over their work, compromised by the mess that comes with their attempts at having relationships (which the former, for the most part, resists); the grandiose and mythical qualities the movie lends to characters who might wax philosophical but go about their jobs with a blue-collar rigor, as if the movie is constantly riding a fine line between neorealist drama and opulent Greek tragedy.The tragedy in Heat ultimately boils down to work-life balance. If the thrills can be found in the execution of its heists and takedowns, the despair comes from how long it lingers over what these characters sacrifice to pull those off. What this work takes, as McCauley repeatedly and so memorably puts it, is to “allow nothing in your life that you cannot walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you spot the heat around the corner”.More than Thief, Heat is about labour. The movie opens with a shot of a light rail train, ushering people to their jobs in the early hours, and spends a lot of its time in warehouses and scrap yards. McCauley’s crew, including Kilmer’s Chris Shiherlis and Tom Sizemore’s Michael Cheritto, have high thread counts at home but seem more in their element when slipping into coveralls to drive garbage trucks or rewire electrical panels, all part of the job.In slick and subversive ways, Mann romanticizes an honest day’s work, yes even among thieves. There’s valor in the professionalism that McCauley lives by and expects from all his colleagues and business partners. The movie’s villains cross moral codes. But perhaps what’s more important to McCauley is their lack of professional integrity, when Kevin Gage’s serial killer Waingro lets his depraved urges compromise the spectacular armored car robbery that opens the movie, and William Fichtner’s slithering money launderer Van Zant, the only character in this movie occupying a high-rise white collar office space, reneges on a deal. These betrayals come with bullets.View image in fullscreenAl Pacino and Robert De Niro in Heat.Photograph: Ronald GrantThere’s also exploitation in this labour, a fissure in all that idealised integrity, which grows more troubling; from McCauley’s attempts to patch up Chris’s marital problems, if only to make sure he’s not distracted before an upcoming score, to the moment his story crosses paths with Dennis Haysbert’s Breedan.The latter is on parole, forced to grind it out in a kitchen for a sleazy employer who docks his pay, refuses his breaks and threatens to send him back to prison. Breedan’s fighting hard to hold onto his dignity, with the affectionate support of his partner Lillian (Kim Staunton). It’s in these trying moments that McCauley swoops in, seizing on an opportunity. He needs a getaway driver for the movie’s big robbery. Breedan obliges and becomes the first in McCauley’s crew to be killed.We can’t ignore the trope where the Black character always dies first. Heat doesn’t either. Instead, Mann leans into the unceremonious ruthlessness of it, and Haysbert’s performance refuses to be limited by such tropes. His immense presence throughout Heat makes sure we feel the loss when his character’s death is reduced to an afterthought in a news bulletin, witnessed by Lillian, whose anguished face in that moment is quite simply haunting.She, alongside the neglected wives and girlfriends played by Ashley Judd, Diane Venora, and Amy Brenneman, occupy thankless roles, bent helplessly in the direction of the men they orbit. But in that space, they don’t just leave an impression, they carry the sadness their men don’t often have the capacity to express.The confined nature of these roles, and the grace afforded the women and people of color within them, is just another one of those conflicting notes that makes Heat so compelling. I’m not sure a movie today could pull that off (critically unscathed at least). I would also say you couldn’t get away with making a movie like Heat today.But then, Michael Mann’s already hard at work on Heat 2.Explore more on these topicsMichael MannRobert De NiroAl PacinoThrillersCrime filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The recipes were not all that intelligent. TheAIhad taken elements of similar recipes from multiple creators and Frankensteined them into something barely recognizable. Inone memorable case, the Google AI failed to distinguish the satirical website the Onion from legitimate recipe sites and advised users to cook with non-toxic glue.Over the past few years, bloggers who have not secured their sites behind a paywall have seen their carefully developed and tested recipes show up, often without attribution and in a bastardized form, in ChatGPT replies. They have seen dumbed-down versions of their recipes in AI-assembled cookbooks available for digital downloads on Etsy or on AI-built websites that bear a superficial resemblance to an old-school human-written blog. Their photos and videos, meanwhile, are repurposed in Facebook posts and Pinterest pins that link back to this digital slop.Recipe writers have no legal recourse becauserecipes generally are not copyrightable. Although copyright protects published or recorded work, they do not cover sets of instructions (although it can apply to the particular wording of those instructions).‘One of the most disgusting meals I’ve ever eaten’: AI recipes testedRead moreWithout this essential IP, many food bloggers earn their living by offering their work for free while using ads to make money. But now they fear that casual users who rely on search engines or social media to find a recipe for dinner will conflate their work with AI slop and stop trusting online recipe sites altogether.“There are a lot of people that are scared to even talk about what’s going on because it is their livelihood,” says Jim Delmage who, with his wife, Tara, runs the blog and YouTube channelSip and Feast.Matt Rodbard, the founder and editor-in-chief of the websiteTaste, is even more pessimistic. Taste used to publish recipes more frequently, but now it mostly focuses on journalism and a podcast (which Rodbard hosts). “For websites that depend on the advertising model,” he says, “I think this is an extinction event in many ways.”The holiday season is traditionally when food bloggers earn most of their ad revenue. For many, this year has been slower than usual. One blogger, Carrie Forrest ofClean Eating Kitchen,told Bloombergthat in the past two years, she has lost 80% of her traffic.[People are] absolutely trusting in the [search] results that are getting thrown in their facesKaren TedescoOthers, like Delmage and Karen Tedesco, the author of the blogFamilystyle Food, say their numbers, and ad revenue, have remained steady – so far. They attribute this to focusing their energies less on trying to game the search engines than on the long-term goal of attracting regular followers – and, in Delmage’s case, viewers.Tedesco’s strategy has been to create recipes that rely on her experience and technical knowhow honed by years in restaurant kitchens and as a personal chef. HerItalian meatball recipe, for example, based on her mother’s, includes advice about which meat to use, an explanation of why milk-soaked breadcrumbs are essential for texture, and a dozen process photos and a video.But she is still worried about the potential impact of AI. When she recently did aGooglesearch for “Italian meatballs”, Familystyle Food appeared as the top result. Then she switched to AI Mode. There, she found the recipe had been Frankensteined – or “synthesized” as Gemini put it – into a new recipe with nine other sources (including Sip and Feast and a Washington Post recipe for Greek meatballs). The AI-generated recipe was little more than a list of ingredients and six basic steps with none of the details that make Tedesco’s recipe unique.AI Mode linked to all 10 recipes, including Tedesco’s, but, she says, “I don’t think many people are actually clicking on the source links. At this point, they’re absolutely trusting in the results that are getting thrown in their faces.”Other bloggers have seen a more definite impact on their viewership. Adam Gallagher, who runsInspired Tastewith his wife, Joanne, and who has become an outspoken critic of AI on social media,toldthe podcast Marketing O’Clock that since spring, he has noticed that while the number of times viewers saw links to the site on Google has increased, the number of actual site visitors has decreased. This indicates, to him, that users are satisfied with the search engine’s AI interpretation of Inspired Taste’s recipes.[With] so many pop-up windows and so much crashing, we kind of lost as publishersMatt RodbardAfter the Gallaghers posted about the discrepancy on X and Instagram, a number of readers replied to say they had not realized there was a difference between the recipes on the blog and the version that showed up in Google searches. Perhaps they had also appreciated the convenience of not having to click on another website, especially when Google’s page design was so clean and uncluttered.Rodbard acknowledges that many food blogs have gotten ugly and overloaded with ads, which has exacerbated the problem. “Ad tech on these recipe blogs has gotten so bad, so many pop-up windows and so much crashing, we kind of lost as publishers,” he says.According to Tom Critchlow, the EVP of audience growth at Raptive, a media company that works with many food bloggers to find advertisers, it isn’t ads that are driving viewers away. It’s Google itself, with its changes to the algorithm and now with AI Mode, that’s making the sites harder to find.There is some hope though: a survey of 3,000 US adults commissioned by Raptive showed that the more interaction people had with AI, the less they wanted to engage with it, and nearly half the respondents rated AI content less trustworthy than content made by a human.View image in fullscreenFood bloggers are now feeling the pressure to move to a subscription model to stay afloat; ‘If I were to give up my website or even try to go over to Substack, I would be broke,’ says Karen Tedesco.Photograph: Maskot/Getty ImagesBut unless the public rebels against AI Mode, there is only so much bloggers can do. They can block OpenAI’s training crawler, which gathers information that ChatGPT uses to create content, including its ownrecipe generator, but theyare not necessarily willing to make themselves invisible to web searches; as Delmage puts it: “You can’t bite the hand that feeds you.”There is also the option of moving over to a subscription model, such as Substack or Patreon, and keeping the recipes behind a paywall, but both Tedesco and Delmage point out that the most successful Substackers, like Caroline Chambers or David Lebovitz, came to the platform with much more substantial followings than they have. “If I were to give up my website or even try to go over to Substack, I would be broke,” Tedesco says.Rodbard suggests that the analog version of the recipe blog, the cookbook, might be due for a comeback. Cookbooks, after all, offer the same experience of spending time and learning from a trusted source, and it’s likely the recipes have been tested. As a bonus, unlike phones or laptops, they don’t go dark when you neglect them for too long and you can splash tomato sauce on them without inflicting permanent damage. According to the market research firm Circana (formerly BookScan), sales of baking cookbooks are up 80% this year, but other areas have been relatively flat.‘Eat the future, pay with your face’: my dystopian trip to an AI burger jointRead moreBut AI bots are stealing from published cookbooks, too. When Meta was training its own AI, itcompiled thousands of booksinto a dataset called Library Genesis (LibGen). Now unscrupulous publishers have raided LibGen and repackaged some of the books into dupes, which they aresellingon Amazon.As more people become aware of the amount of AI slop on the internet and how to identify it, Critchlow believes they will develop a greater appreciation for content produced by humans. “People will ultimately place a higher premium on being able to know that these recipes have been tested and made by somebody that I follow or somebody I respect or somebody that I like,” he says.The recipe creators themselves are not so sure. “I’m putting my faith in that there’s always going to be a segment of people who really want to learn something,” Tedesco says. But as for the business of blogging itself, “it’s like a rolling tide. It’s always up and down and you have to roll with it and adapt.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Add the murders ofRabbi Zvi Koganin the UAE andZiv Kipper, an Israeli-Canadian businessman, in Egypt, and Jews have been killed on five continents since the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas upended the Middle East and unleashed a wave of antisemitism around the world. Anti-Jewish terrorism is now a global problem, as is the hateful extremism that drives it.The death toll from the appalling atrocity in Sydney is shocking enough: at the time of writing,15 people killed, including a child, and many more injured. Awful images circulate, as they always do. The mobile phone footage of two gunmen calmly taking aim at families enjoying a Hanukah party is utterly chilling. It takes a special kind of dehumanisation, an ideology of pure hatred and self-righteous conviction, to do that.The sheer randomness of these sites of anti-Jewish murder adds to the terror. Places that used to feel like safe, cosy corners of the Jewish world are now suddenly on the frontline. In Manchester, it was the solemn occasion of Yom Kippur that was targeted. In Sydney, it was the happy, lighthearted joy of Hanukah. If you are Jewish today, wherever you are, the decision about whether to celebrate Jewish festivals anywhere other than in your own home may be a matter of life and death.Nobody should have to live like this. More to the point, our societies cannot continue to function if this becomes the norm. The whole basis of western liberal democracy, the belief in shared values within a diverse society, is endangered by these attacks.We are yet to discover the detailed motivations of the Bondi attackers, but it looks for all the world like a product of the same Islamist extremism that struck in Manchester. And nobody doubts that it will strike again.Some people react as if this terrorism is akin to a natural disaster or unforeseen tragedy: blind hatred with no cause or purpose, and therefore no deeper explanation needed. But terrorism does not emerge from a vacuum. It is merely the most violent, lethal expression of a set of attitudes and beliefs that are much more widely held than just by those who wield the gun or the knife.When it comes to antisemitic terror, the ideas that some take as justification for murder are popularised and normalised through the language of much of the anti-Israel movement that has marched up and down our city streets and through our university campuses these past two years. That might be uncomfortable for some to accept. But violent words lead to violent actions, especially when left unchallenged by fellow marchers and unchecked by the law.Just this weekend in Birmingham, “One Solution Intifada Revolution” was brandished on a huge banner across the front of a pro-Palestine march. Elias Rodriguez, the man accused ofshooting deadSarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinskyoutside the Jewish Museum in Washington DC in May, wassaid by witnessesto have shouted “There is only one solution, intifada revolution” afterwards. There is no shyness about this support for violence: the Birmingham banner even included the upside-down red triangle that has become the symbol of the Hamas military wing, used in propaganda videos to mark out their targets ever since 7 October 2023.After rapper Bobby Vylan, one half of the group Bob Vylan, chanted “Death, death to the IDF”during a setat the Glastonbury festival in June, it became the rallying cry of anti-Israel protesters everywhere. It got Bob Vylan invited to theIrish parliamentand Bobby Vylan on to Louis Theroux’s podcast. Far from a call for death putting the rapper beyond the pale, it made him a celebrity.Is there a connection between this embrace of a call for death in the name of Palestinian rights, and people inflicting actual death apparently in the name of the same cause? As soon as you ask the question, the answer seems obvious.Perhaps this speculation sounds unfair. The devastation in Gaza is real and lots of people involved in pro-Palestinian activism do not support antisemitic violence against Jews, whether in Britain or Australia. But like it or not, it seems this movement has generated and sustained a political culture in which violence is both conceivable and enacted.Shooting Jews celebrating Hanukah is the most extreme manifestation of this hatred. But in sentiment, in the message it sends Jews, it is little different from the “Free Palestine” graffiti scrawled on a Hanukah menorah in north London on Friday that was reported to the Community Security Trust. None of this brings Palestinian freedom any closer, but antisemites have other priorities.The upshot is that yet again, Jews around the world are grieving. They will probably flock to Hanukah events in even greater numbers now, to show their resilience and solidarity. Jewish life will go on. Beneath that defiance, everyone is asking: will this country be safe for our children? Yet as the massacre at Bondi beach shows, even if you go to the furthest corners of the Earth, there is no escape.This is now a global emergency of antisemitism, and it is the consequence of two years of turning a blind eye, taking the easy path and ignoring the warnings. Make no mistake: alongside the grief and the defiance, Jews are angry. And they have every right to be.Dave Rich is director of policy at the Community Security Trust and the author of Everyday Hate: How Antisemitism is Built into Our World – and How You Can Change itDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Amid all the noise, it’s difficult to know how bad this flu really is – and how much is political spin. I should start by saying “super flu” is not a scientific term or one used by any academics or clinicians I work with. It’s a colloquial phrase that’s been used by various NHS England bosses and taken up by Wes Streeting, the health secretary, andKeir Starmer.This year, a couple of factors have come together to make it a harder flu season for hospitals to manage. First, flu has arrived earlier than previous years. This isn’t unique to the UK: it’s the same picture across the US, Canada, Japan, Germany – basically the northern hemisphere going into winter. This is in the context of multiple viruses circulating such as Covid and rhinoviruses, which means patients could be fighting one or more viruses at the same time and are more susceptible to getting sicker from influenza.The current level of hospitalisations usually occurs in January, but it’s happening a month earlier. According to recentNHS England data, flu-related hospital admissions have risen sharply in December 2025, with figures showing an average of around 2,660 flu patients in hospital per day, the highest level recorded for this time of year, and a 55% rise in admissions in just one week. A&E attendances for flu and respiratory illness overall have also reached record levels, compounding pressure on emergency services.View image in fullscreenA sign encouraging people to get their flu jab in the window of a pharmacy in Langley, Berkshire, on 12 December 2025.Photograph: Maureen McLean/ShutterstockWhen we refer to seasonal flu, the predominant circulating strains are H1N1 and H3N2 (both influenza A) and influenza B. All three are included in this year’s influenza vaccine. H3N2 is more severe as a “flu” than the other strains, especially among those who are elderly or young children. This winter, a new variant of H3N2 has emerged, called K. This strain emerged (through mutation) too late to be included in the update for this year’s seasonal vaccine. This means that the vaccine offers less-than-ideal protection. This is not unusual for seasonal flu vaccines, given how quickly the influenza virus mutates.Does this mean this year’s flu vaccine doesn’t work? No, not at all. While not perfect, it still offers partial protection against H3N2, and against the two other strains circulating. Real-world vaccine effectiveness data from theUK Health Security Agencyshows that even with the subclade K H3N2 dominating cases, the 2025–26 seasonal vaccine still provides typical protection: around 72–75% effectiveness against emergency department attendance and hospital admission in children and adolescents, and 32–39% effectiveness in adults. That means vaccinated people are significantly less likely to be hospitalised compared with unvaccinated people, even if infection isn’t completely prevented.But there’s another problem this winter in the UK: both the take-up and the provision of the flu vaccine. Among those at-risk groups covered by the NHS,data from last yearindicates around only 40% of people under 65 in clinical risk groups and roughly 42.6% of two- to three-year-olds were vaccinated, while uptake in those aged 65 or over was higher at around 74.9%. We, the public health community, haven’t done a good enough job explaining to people how serious a disease flu can be and the benefits of vaccination, or making it easy to get jabbed.But what about if you’re not in an NHS-covered group, and just don’t want to get severely ill with flu this year? Unfortunately, theUK currently has vaccine shortagesin the private market, meaning many pharmacies have low or no stock. It’s a bizarre situation. The cost to get vaccinated (prevention) falls on individuals who need to take time off from work, potentially visit multiple pharmacies to find a jab, and pay £18-20. This is time and money that many people would struggle to find, given other pressing demands.But if someone goes unvaccinated and is admitted to hospital, the cost falls on theNHSand taxpayers into tens of thousands of pounds for admissions, plus adds to the huge patient load. These are the opposite incentives to what we should have for individuals.Coming to hospitals, the UK government is correct in saying that they are in a critical state, but this is because there is little surge capacity. As one clinician told me: “Both primary care and secondary care run close to or at capacity all the time, so any increase in illness tips the system over capacity and into ‘crisis’.” Hospital bosses are worried because if December already looks this bad (like a typical January would), what will January and February be like? The million-dollar question is: have we hit the peak already for flu (and just had an earlier season), or is the entire baseline going to be higher for the coming months, which would be very worrying? I don’t think anyone knows the answer.I do worry that we need to be careful of crying wolf, and calling it “super flu”. This is not a novel pathogen (like SARS-CoV-2) which made many people critically ill, and where we had no vaccine, no diagnostics and no treatments, plus no prior immunity in the global population. Overstating also carries that risk that if we do get a step-change in a virus – likeH5N1 avian flu– causing human-to-human transmission with a high fatality rate, that people are desensitised to public health information. Covid was a once-in-a-century pandemic. I don’t think you can compare what’s happening now to that at all.The NHS is struggling and in crisis, but not because of a “super flu”. It is struggling because flu season has come early, vaccines are offering partial protection from a mutated circulating strain, there has been poor take-up and inaccessibility of the seasonal flu vaccine, and it is a health service that hits a critical state every single winter. As a final aside, is it too late to get vaccinated? Not at all – I’d strongly encourage you to find a local pharmacy with stock and get protected going into the festive period.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghFit Forever: Wellness for midlife and beyondOn Wednesday 28 January 2026, join Annie Kelly, Devi Sridhar, Joel Snape and Mariella Frostrup, as they discuss how to enjoy longer and healthier lives, with expert advice and practical tips.

We need the condemnation, and the solidarity, but we also need actionMon 15 Dec 2025 18.12 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 18.14 ESTShareBeing Jewish in Australia today feels very different to when I was a child.Growing up, it was about family, community, culture. It was about our customs, cuisine, our shared history and connectedness.I learned about antisemitism, but it was mostly historic. Centuries of the persecution, expulsion and mass murder of Jews around the world – not least during the Holocaust, recent enough that there were living survivors to tell their stories first-hand.But I grew up in a country with no real history of antisemitism, in a small, tight-knit community that was deeply embedded in the nation around it.Antisemitism was not an obviously immediate threat to Jewish Australians. There were incidents, but they were relatively minor by historical or global standards. Deadly attacks on synagogues, Jewish businesses and community centres were things that happened overseas, not here.Man who tackled alleged Bondi gunman ‘couldn’t bear to see people dying’, cousin saysRead moreWe knew there were threats. We passed the armed guards and fences every time we went to a synagogue or Jewish school. But mostly we felt safe. This was the lucky country – a safe, diverse, welcoming and tolerant nation. There was scarcely a safer place or time in history to be Jewish than this Australia.It doesn’t feel like that any more.Antisemitism has increased over the past 26 months. Synagogues, Jewish businesses, homes and vehicles have been defaced and firebombed. Jewish people have been doxed and ostracised from communities. It has been soul crushing and heartbreaking. It has caused anger and distress. It has cast a long and dark shadow over our lives.In recent times, antisemitism has dominated the national political debate. It has been exhaustively partisan. As a former Labor adviser – including to Anthony Albanese – I have found this personally challenging.There have been many announcements and denouncements, but the attacks have continued. Now, I’m writing in the aftermath of the worst terrorist attack on Australia’s soil – targeted at Jewish people celebrating a Jewish festival.There have been deadly attacks on Jewish communities around the world over the past few years. This is not unique to Australia. We have seen it in Manchester, in Washington, in Berlin and in Rouen.This attack could have happened anywhere – but it happened in Australia. And it is Australia’s job to make sure it never happens again.The massacre at Bondi beach sits heavily on us all. The entire nation has been shocked. Many are speaking about antisemitism for the first time.I have experienced many emotions over the past 24 hours. Anger is not one of them. I don’t have the energy for it. I have cried many times – both from devastation and from kindness. I have been inundated with messages and calls from non-Jewish friends and colleagues, past and present. Many have moved me to tears.But what I also know is that condemning a terrorist attack is easy. We need the condemnation, and the solidarity, but we also need action.Antisemitism requires practical leadership from governments and the agencies who keep us safe, but it also needs action from all of us.We must all call it out whenever we see it. We must not diminish or deny it. We must acknowledge it is a real and persistent threat to Jewish Australians.We also need to recognise that if Jewish people aren’t safe in Australia, none of us are. Modern Australia has been built on migration and multiculturalism. I hold my commitment to these values dearly. They are the reason I am here – the reason my family could flee the horrors of antisemitism in Europe and find safe refuge here.We must understand that the fraying of our social cohesion is a threat to every multicultural community in this country. We are seeing public support for multiculturalism decrease in Australia. It will be a disaster if the forces of rightwing populism succeed here as they increasingly are in Europe and the United States.‘Everyone should play our part’: 20,000 Australians heed the call to give blood after Bondi beach terrorRead moreJewish people are on the frontline of this fight but, if we are the first to succumb to it, we won’t be the last.On Sunday, every Jewish person’s worst nightmare came true. Many feared and warned this day would come, yet it is still more shocking and horrifying than we could imagine.Attending Jewish events will never feel as safe as they did before. Our usual response in these times is proud defiance – but how can we be proudly Jewish if there is a risk we might be killed for being so?Jewish people are questioning their future in Australia. They are considering leaving. I’m not, but I’m devastated that so many others are. This is our home, where we belong, or at least where so many once felt that they belonged.This fight carries no quick fix. If there was one, it would have been fixed long ago.I know that most Australians are not antisemitic. We are all horrified by what happened at Bondi. If that horror can be turned into unity and action, I truly believe we can restore the Australia I grew up in.Dean Sherr is a Jewish Australian writer and consultant who previously worked as an adviser to Anthony Albanese, as well as federal and state Labor MPs, and with Jewish community organisationsExplore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackOpinionSydneyAntisemitismcommentShareReuse this content"

Almost a decade ago I decided to quit my well-paid job in advertising in order to pursue a precarious career in freelance journalism. The merits of that decision are up for debate but the real stupidity is in how I quit my job: I wrote a rather cringeworthy column for the Guardian about my “meaningless job in advertising” and publicly proclaimed that I’d decided to quit. My boss saw the piece and, well, he obviously wasn’t happy. (Sorry, Sean!)I bring this embarrassing anecdote up because I’ve been doing a lot of reflecting recently on the reasons why I left advertising. Maybe this sounds twee, but I was sick of selling people things they didn’t need. I wanted to do something meaningful.You know what, though? While selling underwear and vodka to the masses may not be entirely fulfilling, it’s better for the soul than selling people wars and genocide. Peddling cleaning products via 30 second TV ads is a far nobler calling than whitewashing authoritarian politicians via both-sides reporting that consists, to quote George Orwell, “of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness”.Journalists should work without fear or favor. Whether writing about foreign policy or new technology, our focus should be on the truth, not cozying up to the powerful or making corporations look good.And yet here we are, in a world where the lines between advertising, public relations and journalism are dangerously blurred; where once-respected media institutions have been hijacked by billionaires like Jeff Bezos, the Murdoch family, and Larry Ellison and turned into strategic megaphones. Where politicians are sold to the public with the same cynical strategies with which ad-people market alcohol. Guinness is good for you? Authoritarianism is even better!Look, for example, at the Washington Post, where a Pulitzer-prize winning cartoonist resigned in January over the paper’s refusal to publish a cartoon showing Bezos kneeling in front of Donald Trump. In September the Post also dropped columnist Karen Attiah, reportedly after she posted on social media about the late Charlie Kirk making racist comments. There are, of course, still plenty of hardworking journalists doing great work at the Post. But the paper is now inextricably tied, via Bezos and his business interests, to the Trump administration.This is not just about bowing to Trump; it’s about who the media chooses to protect and who to dehumanize. As a Palestinian-Brit, it has been difficult to work in the media over the last couple of years. Difficult to function while a genocide in Gaza – which is still ongoing – and accelerated ethnic-cleansing in the West Bank unfolds. And it has been difficult to wrestle with the ways in which the media is complicit in what is happening. More than 200 Palestinians journalists have been killed in Gaza by Israel since 7 October; far too many journalists in the West have been silent about this. The scale of carnage in Gaza simply wouldn’t have been able to take place without the media dehumanizing Palestinians and manufacturing consent for atrocities.For example: one of the biggest and most inflammatory talking points after 7 October – one which helped convince people there wasn’t a single innocent Palestinian civilian – was that Hamas beheaded 40 babies. Hamas committed verified atrocities, but this was a lie. It was one, however, which plenty of journalists, including CBS news correspondent and a CNN anchor, spread without properly confirming. The CNN anchor later apologized; CBS did not.Speaking of CBS: it’s now owned by billionaires (and father and son) David and Larry Ellison. And the news division is now run by Bari Weiss who was scouted by David Ellison, it was reported by the Financial Times, for her pro-Israel views. The Ellisons are also battling to acquire Warner Bros Discovery (which owns CNN), with the elder Ellison – a longtime Trump donor and ally – already having had discussions with the White House about axing of some of the CNN hosts whom the president is said to hate.Look, I know it’s hard to keep track of which megacorp owned by which billionaire is acquiring the next media outlet and how much money they’ve all given to Trump. But here’s the bottom line: instead of holding power to account, the US media is increasingly getting into bed with it.Before my current boss summons me into their office: I obviously wouldn’t be writing this if I thought the Guardian was part of the problem. Of course, the Guardian, like any institution, is not perfect. But there really isn’t anything else like it: independent, un-paywalled, unapologetically progressive. I don’t think there is any other media organization that can stand up to the growing global tide of authoritarianism like we can.We can’t be bought by billionaires, for one thing. We are independent, and we act like it. If you want to read some both-sidesing of Trump, the Guardian is not for you.

It’s no surprise that this year’s adverts are a complicated lotMon 15 Dec 2025 11.36 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 12.32 ESTShareThere can’t be anyone skirting closer to burnout, more deserving of our sympathy and complicated respect, than the people who conceiveChristmasads. The goal is straightforward: make people feel good about Christmas so that they spend more than they otherwise might. Amp up the love and affection of the season; play down the labour (emotional and otherwise); make everyone feel a bit hungrier and thirstier – job done.This must be at least the fifth year, though, that the world looks so perilous, so fraught and vexed, so sad and chaotic, that what’s an honest supermarket to do? The retailers weathered the first Covid Christmas, when demand for nut multipacks and pigs in blankets was poignantly low; then they weathered Christmas 2021, when restrictions came back so unexpectedly that it wasn’t unusual for a household to have 14 times as much turkey as they could possibly eat.Wham, it was the end of 2022, and they were trying to sell excess and indulgence and worry-about-the-bills-tomorrow in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis. From 2023 to the present day, it has felt a bit gross to talk about the joy of family togetherness when so much of the world is wartorn. And I have to say,hats off first and most forcefully to John Lewis. Its ad is absolutely tragic.The Guardian view on the John Lewis Christmas ad: a modern story of fathers and sons | EditorialRead moreIt opens on a small nuclear family, atomised by the fact that the teenage kids won’t wash their hair or take their headphones off, and the mum is using her tired, guilt-trip voice to get everyone to clear up. The dad, coiffed to convey the ineffable disappointment of middle age, finds a lone present to himself, somehow missed under the tree. It has a Post-it note instead of a gift tag – this is the bait and switch: you’re meant to think the gifter hasn’t put much thought into it, whereas in fact it’s the most thoughtful gift ever, a vinyl of a club classic that catapults Mr Dad back in time to when he still went out on the razzle. Images of his son as a toddler, then a baby, flood his mind; is there anything as achingly sad as the passage of time? I can now make myself cry at any point, just picturing the intense and mournful love, as he regards his nearly grown offspring and hard-misses all the smaller versions that went before. I’ve never been able to do that before. I could get a job on a soap opera.This year’s runner-up is the far more cheerful but, in some ways, equally unvarnishedversion of Christmas that comes from Marks & Spencer, through the medium of Dawn French. Ah, there she is in a car, singing to Christmas hits. She seems pretty happy, then you pan out – this is not joy. This is a traffic jam. It’s dark, it’s completely stationary, nobody will ever get home. There’s something incredibly, unseasonably declinist about this narrative – a sort of everything-is-broken-and-everyone-is-stuck vibe that you’ll recognise, no doubt, from current affairs. Then the deus ex machina; an M&S van, right there in the queue, its doors swinging open to reveal not just finger food but a cocktail-party-ready scene with room for everyone and a piano. “The world’s gone mad,” says Tom Kerridge from behind a steering wheel, very much echoing what must have been the first concept-meeting: what kind of ad do you make, when the world’s gone mad?Tesco has said the quiet part out loud, putting out a press release with its ad that said: “We know that Christmas isn’t just about the picture-perfect moments, it’s about everything perfectly imperfect that happens around them too … We want to celebrate the wonderfully relatable chaos that fills homes across the UK.”Sainsbury’s went with surrealism, with a Christmas scene you’d recognise from the ads of the innocent 2010s, only now the family is unaccountably joined by the Big Friendly Giant, who luckily really likes ham.On top of everything, do people even watch adverts any more? Or are they shouting into the void with these flights of fancy? This only makes the commitment even more impressive.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Well, the chances are slightly improved aftersix leading business groups published a temperature-lowering letteron Monday that said parliament, which in this instance means the blockers in the House of Lords, should get on with it.The employers, note, are still unhappy about the issue that triggered the most recent revolt by Conservative peers and a few cross-benchers: the removal of a cap on compensation claims for unfair dismissal. But they’re more worried that further delays would jeopardise their negotiating victory last month, namelythe government’s U-turnon rights guaranteeing workers protection against unfair dismissal from day one of employment. A six-month qualifying period was adopted instead, with the blessing of the TUC, which was similarly motivated by trying to get the bill over the line quickly.The Lords is still free to object and add amendments again, of course. But there is now a general mood that it would be seriously out of touch if it did so.However, it would be a mistake to think that royal assent will mark the moment when the lobbying ends and everybody, employers and unions alike, can concentrate on implementation. In fact, the reverse is true. The extraordinary feature of the employment rights bill is that many critical details have been deliberately left to be resolved in secondary legislation.Take the introduction of guaranteed hours contracts. This flows from the laudable aim of tackling abuses of zero-hours contracts. But it’s not clear how a worker’s right to guaranteed hours, having worked those hours regularly during a reference period, would operate in practice.What is the threshold for a “low hours worker”? Does it mean as few as eight hours a week or, say, as many as 30? How regular is “regular work”? How long is the reference period? Employers warn of unintended consequences if they are disincentivised from offering extra casual hours to existing employees. Unions warn of the danger of creating loopholes or leaving ambiguities. The point is that the primary legislation leaves key details to be worked out later.Other items on the employer groups’ list of “concerns”, aside from the compensation system in unfair dismissal tribunals, include issues related to “seasonal and temporary workers, thresholds for industrial action, and the practical application of union rules”. They are all mini-battles that also lie ahead.The business secretary, Peter Kyle, welcoming the employers’ letter, assured all sides he’s keen to see “the spirit of consensus and cooperation” continue, emphasising that “we are committed to extensive consultation on [the bill’s] detailed implementation and in secondary legislation”. Yes, that’s the right message while the ping-pong between the Commons and Lords is unresolved. But “extensive” consultations, one assumes, means lengthy consultations, so this is all going to take a while even after the bill passes.One can take the view that this is how industrial relations should be improved – by thrashing out on-the-ground details once high-level principles have been passed by parliament. Maybe, but it also all feels as if the government, in its rush to meet the manifesto commitment to introduce legislation within 100 days of taking office, left too many hard details undone. The secondary legislation will be when the arguments properly start.Explore more on these topicsBusinessNils Pratley on financeEmployment lawHouse of LordsLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

That means a new economic approachMon 15 Dec 2025 14.23 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 17.49 ESTShareMore than a year after the election that handed Donald Trump a decisive comeback victory, the Democratic party has still not released its postmortem analysis. But last week, an influential progressive lobby grouppublishedits own. Kamala Harris’s campaign, its authors argued, failed to connect with core constituencies because it did not focus enough on addressing basic economic anxieties. By prioritising the menace to democracy that Maga authoritarianism represented, progressives neglected the bread-and-butter issues that were uppermost in many people’s minds.As the EU braces for a tumultuous period of politics between now and the end of the decade, that is a lesson that needs to be fully absorbed in Brussels, Paris and Berlin. The White House, as its recently published national security strategy makes clear, is hopeful that “patriotic” partiesin Europe will soon replicate Mr Trump’s success. In the EU’s Franco-German engine room, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) and Alternative für Deutschland (AfD)leadthe polls, backed by large swaths of blue-collar voters. But among mainstream leaders and parties, it is hard to discern a response that is adequate to troubling times.The challenges Europe faces are expensive and era-defining. They include the war in Ukraine, maintaining the momentum of the green transition, addressing demographic change and developing economies that are less vulnerable to bullying by Mr Trump and China. According to the Brussels-based Breugel thinktank, the new age of geopolitical insecurity couldrequirean additional €250bn in annual EU defence spending. Mario Draghi’sreportlast year on European economic competitiveness demanded massive investment in public goods and infrastructure, to be partly funded by jointly held EU debt.Such a fiscal paradigm shift would boost growth figures that have flatlined for years. But at both the pan-European and national levels, there continues to be a lack of boldness when it comes to revenue raising. The EU’s so-called “frugal” nationsopposethe idea of collective borrowing, and Brussels’ budget proposals for the next seven years are deeplyunambitious. In France, the idea of a wealth tax on the super-rich is overwhelmingly popular with voters. But Emmanuel Macron’s beleaguered centrist government – though desperate to cut its budget deficit – refuses to contemplate such a move.The reality is that in the absence of such measures, the less well-off will pay the price of financial adjustment through austerity budgets and greater inequality. Bitter recentdisputesover pension cutbacks in both France and Germany testify to a developing struggle over the future of the European social model – a phenomenon that the RN and the AfD have happily exploited to promote a politics ofwelfare chauvinism. Ms Le Pen’s party, for example, has opposed moves to raise the retirement age and has said that it would target any benefit cuts at non-French nationals.In the US, Mr Trump’s pledges to protect blue‑collar interests were deeply disingenuous, as subsequent Medicaid cuts andtax breaksfor the wealthy underlined. But in the absence of a convincing progressive counteroffer from the Harris campaign, they worked on the campaign trail. Without a fundamental change in economic approach, social contracts across the continent risk being ripped up. Governments must avoid handing this political gift to the Trumpian forces already on the march in Europe.Explore more on these topicsEuropeOpinionEuropean UnionDonald TrumpUS politicsRepublicansKamala HarrisDemocratseditorialsShareReuse this content"

Many of these do no harm. As the cancer specialistProf Chris Pykenoted last year, people undergoing cancer treatment will often try meditation or vitamins as well. When such a change is in addition to, and not instead of, evidence-based treatment, this is usually not a problem. If it reduces distress, it can help.But the proliferation of online health influencers poses challenges that governments and regulators in many countries have yet to grasp. The Guardian’sinvestigation into the Free Birth Society (FBS), a business offering membership and advice to expectant mothers, and training for “birth keepers”, has exposed 48 cases of late-term stillbirths or other serious harm involving mothers or birth attendants who appear to be linked to FBS. While the company is based in North Carolina, its reach is international. In the UK, the NHS onlyrecently removed a webpagelinking to a charity “factsheet” that recommended FBS materials.Giving birth without medical assistance, or free birth, is legal in countries including the UK and US. The risks are not well understood due to a lack of data. “Across whole populations, going through labour and birth without professional support is associated with higher levels of risk for mother and baby,” according to Soo Downe, professor of midwifery at the University of Lancashire.Childbirth can be a frightening prospect, and high-quality care is far from guaranteed. In England, a shockingrecent reportfound two-thirds of NHS maternity units to be unsafe or in need of improvement. In the US, births must be paid for either by individuals, insurers or Medicaid. Criticisms of medical systems and specific, longstanding issues with maternity care are in many cases justified. Most of the women interviewed for the Guardian’s investigation andpodcast serieshad previously undergone traumatic births.But while distrust of institutions may be based on experience, it has also proved to be a fertile ground for other influencers seeking converts to their unorthodox methods and DIY ethos. During the pandemic, a “wellness” industry supposedly focused on healthy living was implicated inspreading lies about vaccinesand fuelling paranoia about official advice. Concern is rising that such ideas are gaining more general purchase. One paper given at a cancer conference in July focused onmisinformation, which it said had “acutely worsened in the past decade”. Our FBS investigation shows that behind the image of an anti-establishment sisterhood lies an enterprise that trains women as social media influencers as well as birth attendants. FBS does not claim to be a qualified medical provider.There is no turning the clock back to a time when doctors were presumed to know best. Vast quantities of scientific research are published online and many people use these to beneficial effect. But there is also a need for safeguards from poor advice. It is well known that the algorithms used by tech companies rewardmore extreme content.In the UK,improvements to NHS maternity servicescannot come soon enough. They should include the option of home birth and the provision of data to support women in making decisions. Ministers and bodies including the World Health Organization should also develop strategies for the information ecosystem so that evidence-based healthcare is not undermined.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There is an even earlier case. In a trial held by a German court pursuant to the treaty of Versailles (1919), two officers of U-86 were convicted of “an offence against the law of nations” for attacking survivors after the sinking of a Canadian hospital ship, the Llandovery Castle, off the coast of Ireland in the final months of the first world war. The judges said the rule against such attacks was “simple” and “universally known”. They rejected the defence argument that the officers were following orders of the submarine’s captain. They said such an order was manifestly unlawful. The precedent is still cited today and is codified in the Rome statute of the international criminal court.William SchabasProfessor of international law, Middlesex UniversityExplore more on these topicsWar crimesFirst world warEuropelettersShareReuse this content"

Plus letters fromProf Hugh Hunt, Dr Portia Adade Williams and Angela Churie KallhaugeMon 15 Dec 2025 13.03 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 13.11 ESTShareYour editorial (8 December) says that it is “hard to disagree” with calls to ban research into climate interventions or geoengineering solutions, citing well-worn tropes about a “termination shock” scenario and a dislike of private-sector involvement in the field. The pretext for forming this opinion – and claiming it represents all of Africa – appears to be the brief reference in a joint statement earlier this year from theAfrican environmental ministers.I can’t help feeling that the Guardian is being played. Every advance in human technology elicits cries from a vocal few that a line must be drawn that cannot be crossed. Usually seeded in the corridors of western NGOs, legitimate concerns are whipped up into fearmongering and luddism, with the goal of holding back scientific inquiry.We saw this with genetic modification in agriculture, it’s been ever present in the anti-nuclear camp, and it’s back again – betting against human agency in the face of increasing climate impact. A lot of people want to reduce climate risks, and the range of plausible actions that could be taken to avert suffering is thankfully getting broader. This is especially important as climate impacts escalate far faster than predicted. But to evaluate new ideas requires more research – carried out responsibly and transparently.Compared with the reckless experiment that humanity is conducting with the atmosphere, exploring if we can increase the reflectivity of the planet (which is currently dimming, stoking climate risks even further) is a tiny, temporary and reversible action that could have profoundly beneficial outcomes.Time has shown that previous “ban science” campaigns were wrongheaded and to the detriment of countries that are most exposed to environmental risks. The morally correct action for newspapers like the Guardian is to raise awareness objectively and to allow scientific inquiry to help us out of the mess we are in.Bryony WorthingtonLead author,Climate Change ActYour editorial advocates the “precautionary principle” – better to do nothing than to put risky technology under Donald Trump’s control. No one is promoting solar geoengineering as a solution to global heating. It’s a stopgap that may become our only strategy if we fail to curb CO2emissions. We are already well down the dangerous road of net zero, where we are promised that untried technologies can offset our emissions so that we can carry on with business as usual. To make a difference, these carbon dioxide removal schemes would need to draw down some 30bn tonnes of CO2a year.One form of solar geoengineering is to spray particles into the high atmosphere to reflect sunlight away from Earth – solar radiation modification (SRM). Cooling of 10C can be achieved by spraying 10m tonnes of material. There are other strategies, including spraying seawater to make clouds more reflective. All these ideas are the subject of serious research, in universities around the world, that takes ethical and governance considerations seriously.Solar geoengineering doesn’t cut greenhouse gas emissions – there is no suggestion that it should. What is clear is that the rate at which we are reducing emissions and devising methods to remove CO2are not fast enough. SRM is, unfortunately, becoming a necessity. We cannot afford the risk of doing nothing.Prof Hugh HuntDeputy director, Centre for Climate Repair, University of CambridgeWe were dismayed by your editorial on the purported African view on solar geoengineering. The view was not reflective of the discourse that took place in the margins of UN environment assembly in Nairobi.First, the published view conflates solar radiation modification (SRM) deployment with research. The current debate is not about embracing or rejecting SRM as a solution; it is about gaining more knowledge and widening informed dialogue that can make us better prepared for the hard choices that may lie ahead.The issue of geoengineering is increasingly important as stakeholders seek solutions for potential worst-case scenarios against the backdrop of inadequate action and increasing impacts. We must ensure the all stakeholders have an equal seat at the table.African and other stakeholders have the right to this information to make informed decisions for themselves. Deployment rightly raises profound concerns. But shutting down any research and dialogue – closing the very spaces where we can interrogate and contribute science, debate risks and shape objective future decisions – would diminish agency and increase vulnerability.Your editorial’s homogeneous characterisation of the African continent, paired with this lack of fundamental understanding of the current substantive topic, exemplifies this problem and silences the range of African perspectives that do exist. This is not benign, and it is part of a broader narrative that routinely discounts scientific experts and research networks on the continent from global discussions.Africa has contributed least to the climate crisis and stands to lose the most. African researchers are already contributing significant knowledge on climate change. We cannot afford decisions about our common future without their engagement. A more accurate and respectful discourse starts with lifting these diverse voices rather than subsuming them.Dr Portia Adade WilliamsSenior research scientist, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, GhanaAngela Churie KallhaugeExecutive vice-president, Impact, Environmental Defense Fund, USHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Overuse of AI for mental health support could well lead to the next public health emergency if the government does not take urgent action.We shouldn’t be surprised that teenagers are turning to tools such asChatGPTin this way. NHS waiting lists are rising, and one in five young people are living with a mental health condition. It is unacceptable that young people who require support for their mental health are unable to access the services they need, before they reach crisis point.AI cannot replace the vital human element in mental health care. It does offer many benefits, but it should be thoughtfully integrated to support human therapist-led care.The government must take note of this stark warning and commit to expanding the mental health workforce to ensure that teenagers who are struggling can access timely, in-person support before the potential consequences are felt by the next generation.Dr Roman RaczkaBritish Psychological SocietyHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

That’s not so. Most council estates, such as Becontree and Harold Hill, were built following the first and second world wars to house ordinary working families when decent housing was in dire straits. Privately rented properties were often of poor quality and devoid of basic amenities.The governments then believed it imperative to house ordinary families in good-quality modern housing. Relying on private landlords and precarious tenancies was seen practically as an insult to the nation’s people, and even financially well-off council tenants could rest assured that their tenancy was not going to be terminated.This civic mindset endured until Margaret Thatcher kickstarted the sell-off of social housing, resulting in up to half of social housing ending up in the hands of private landlords. One can often spot these by their poorly maintained look.Roger DriscollEpping, EssexTen years ago I wrotean article for the Guardianthat predicted the slow death of social housing. I was heavily criticised by sector leaders at the time for doing so. My main argument was that various factors were coming together, which meant that in future housing associations would no longer provide homes for poor people.Last week, Crisis produced a report which says exactly that (People on lowest incomes being denied access to social housing, research finds, 8 December). The lack of social-rent homes, the increase in so-called affordable housing, the letting criteria of many housing associations and government policy on benefits all now prevent poor people from accessing social housing. In the same week,Shelter reportedthat the number of homeless people has reached unprecedented levels.This begs the simple question I asked 10 years ago: where will those people go? And what is the future for social housing if it is no longer able to carry out one of its main functions – to provide homes for those in the greatest need? Perhaps a new form of social housing is required, funded directly by the government, managed locally and accountable to local communities. I wonder what we would call it?Tom MurthaStudley, WarwickshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But then, yet more horrific defending allowed Eli Junior Kroupi, on as a substitute, to score Bournemouth’s third equaliser and the points were shared.Fernandes’s strike was a pinpoint curled free-kick and Cunha’s finish came 120 seconds later when Benjamin Sesko’s cross from the left hit Adrien Truffert and diverted into the Brazilian’s path.Manchester United 4-4 Bournemouth: Premier League – as it happenedRead moreBefore this, United were heading for Aston Villa on Sunday in a foul mood and staring at a miserable Christmas Day if another defeat followed. Instead, despite Kroupi’s intervention, a single defeat in 10 games is a run that speaks of United’s upward trajectory under Ruben Amorim, though their defending is amateurish.His side havescored the same 30goals as Arsenal yet conceded 26, the same as Fulham who are 14th, eight places lower.This game’s charge sheet featured silly errors from Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot, questionable Senne Lammens goalkeeping, and leaden-footed positioning by Ayden Heaven and Leny Yoro. Amorim claimed he does not need to bolster the defensive ranks so the onus is on him to improve the current ones. The plus is United’s forward play. Twelve minutes in and Amad Diallo began and finished a move.Along the right he pinged the ball to Casemiro who relayed it to Dalot along the left. A diagonal pass was dropped into Bournemouth’s area, Cunha missed a header and the ball hit Djordje Petrovic, leaving the goalkeeper helpless to prevent the Ivorian nodding in from under the bar.The strike was the culmination of a bright United phase. Now, the first bit of dubious backline work. Antoine Semenyo hurled a long throw high into United’s area that needed Casemiro’s aerial acumen to clear. Then, when Justin Kluivert popped up on the right, a delivery picked out Marcus Tavernier whose close-range header was beaten out by Lammens before the ball went to safety.View image in fullscreenBruno Fernandes curls in Manchester United’s third goal from a free-kick.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAAmorim’s setup was interesting, considering the hue and cry over his 3-4-3. Intrigue came in the warm-up when United had a quartet of defenders in luminous bibs. Was the head coach finally to send out a back four of Dalot, Leny Yoro, Ayden Heaven, and Shaw? The answer was no as Diallo then donned a bib. Yet while United defended in a five, when attacking, the No 16 pushed ahead to leave a four.Diallo enjoyed himself before jetting off to join up with Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco. A zigzag run took him into the area, before being thwarted by Adam Smith. And, next, a moment of fantasy that was a throwback to the great United sides. A no-look Cunha cross swerved on to the boot of a flying Bryan Mbeumo, whose volley came agonisingly close to thundering home.United were pummelling Bournemouth and still they conceded. Shaw was bullied by Kluivert on United’s left touchline. Smith fed Semenyo and, 40 yards out, he dashed in and beat Lammens, shooting across the keeper, into the corner. Shaw was as furious with himself as Amorim surely was.Then came a Dalot-Semenyo flareup. The former shoved the latter over, backing in when the Ghana international was mid-air – so the forward grabbed his throat. Each was booked for their pains. The half ended sweetly for United. Fernandes’s corner from the left was headed in by Casemiro, past Petrovic’s powder-puff hands – and Shaw had an equal in the culprit stakes.Bournemouth’s second equaliser was due, in part, to Yoro and Heaven whose defending was lax, plus a killer Tavernier pass that split the youngsters, and a cool Evanilson finish, who rolled the ball beyond the stationary Lammens – to his left.View image in fullscreenAntoine Semenyo fires home Bournemouth’s equaliser in the 40th minute at Old Trafford.Photograph: Phil Duncan/Every Second Media/ShutterstockIf this left Amorim visibly stunned, further uncertain play – from Dalot – ceded possession and presaged Tavernier’s goal. The defender lost the ball and United were turned as he raced at goal, so Casemiro felled him. The Englishman’s free-kick was drilled past a United wall that had Cunha and Fernandes to the side and this error was compounded by Lammens, who allowed the ball to pass him down low.United needed to locate some of the backbone Amorim likes to say they have. His team had allowed their grip to be loosened far too easily and on the hour, to a raucous cheer, the manager introduced Kobbie Mainoo for Casemiro. Could the 20-year-old, barely trusted by Amorim, help pull the contest from the fire? United did revive, Mbeumo, Mason Mount, Cunha and Fernandes all threatening.Amorim sent for Sesko and the No 9 from Slovenia, who has had an injury-hit season, wished the ball fell to him when Mbeumo blasted over. Now came the helter-skelter ending.The bottom line for United is a need for defensive solidity. Amorim’s system is supposed to give this but is just not doing so. Time for a rethink, Ruben?

People are in shock here trying to make sense ofthe horrors that unfolded on Sunday evening– a day that was supposed to be one of celebration for Sydney’s Jewish community.As the first national public event being staged in Australia since, the third Ashes Test that starts here on Wednesday will play out to a sombre backdrop. The flags at Adelaide Oval will fly at half-mast, a minute’s silence will be observed before the toss, while players are likely to wear black armbands throughout. Inevitably, security for the match has been increased.If Harry Brook is truly a generational talent, that promise needs to be delivered now | Barney RonayRead moreIt will doubtless be an emotional week for Australia’s players and not least given the number of links to New South Wales within their squad. Nathan Lyon summed up the helplessness many were feeling on Monday, offering thoughts and prayers to those affected before admitting: “Nothing I’m going to say right now is going to make anyone feel any better.”Needless to say, the cricket itself feels pretty trivial right now. But if nothing else, it can play a role in bringing people together at a time of such overwhelming sadness: a reminder of shared values and kinship.The Ashesrivalry has been running hot all series but ultimately this does not reflect the real world, where the two countries stand shoulder to shoulder.View image in fullscreenWill Jacks in the nets at Adelaide Oval, keeping his place after showing plenty of heart batting at No 8 in Brisbane.Photograph: Robbie Stephenson/PAFor England, the situation in the series itself is acute, 2-0 down after two self-inflicted defeats. Ben Stokes has followed his head coach, Brendon McCullum, here, insisting now is not the time to think about jobs being on the line. “We both give everything that we possibly can towards the team,” he said. “It will always be like that as long as we are both in these roles.”According to the Association ofCricketStatisticians & Historians, only three teams in the last 100 years of Ashes cricket have won the third Test after going 2-0 down. The good news for England, at least, is that this current side – changed in places, admittedly – sits among them: the fightback at Headingley in 2023, when incensed by Jonny Bairstow’s stumping at Lord’s.Stokes, though, has been drawing on a more recent Test match to gee up his players, reminding them of the summer just gone and the blow-up with India at Lord’s that spurred them on to a battling victory. The question here is why it has taken them so long to find this sense of urgency; why players have failed to capitalise on the notable absentees from Australia’s attack.Two of those absentees now return this week, bringing a combined 871 Test wickets of experience. Pat Cummins will lead his side for the first time in the series after allowing the potential start of a lower back stress fracture to settle down. And after just two overs in Perth, and the bench in Brisbane, Lyon is back at the ground that launched his career. This week saw him added to its “Avenue of Honour” for his 12 wickets against India here in 2014.Quick GuideThird Test teamsShowEngland(confirmed): Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (c), Jamie Smith (wk), Will Jacks, Brydon Carse, Josh Tongue, Jofra ArcherAustralia(possible): Usman Khawaja, Jake Weatherald, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Cameron Green, Alex Carey (wk), Pat Cummins (c), Mitchell Starc, Scott Boland, Nathan LyonWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.England by comparison have swapped out Gus Atkinson, 66 Test wickets, for Josh Tongue, 31, but have otherwise backed the incumbents. It means no place for Shoaib Bashir – Will Jacks still preferred – and with it perhaps the first acknowledgement that two years of hot-housing a stripling with this tour in mind has simply not worked out. Add it to an ever-lengthening list.Either way, and for all the talk of poor preparation before the series, England have no excuse not to be hardened to the task of playing in Australia by now. Nor can they claim to feel anything but fully refreshed followingthe break in Noosa. On Monday Harry Brook happily described it as “a belting time” during which apparently next to no cricket was really discussed.And England should be optimistic: the pitch at Adelaide Oval should feel more familiar than the bounce at the previous two venues, while the square boundaries are 13m tighter on either side compared to that monstrous outfield in Perth. The bigger question is how they take 20 wickets, not least given a heatwave that is forecast to span the first two days. In that respect, playing a spin-bowling all-rounder at number eight feels instinctively defensive.Tongue’s awkward angle and ability to move the ball late should ask fresh questions of Australia’s batters, at least, even if he can at times be wild and expensive. Although the same can be said for Brydon Carse so far, nine wickets yet going at five an over. His retention, ahead of the less demonstrative Atkinson, may well reflect the inner “dog” that Stokes now deems a non-negotiable.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26The AshesEngland cricket teamCricketAustralia cricket teamAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead the Italian made no attempt to clear up a situation entirely of his own making.He rebuffed questions about hiscryptic response to beating Everton on Saturdayand even reacted with exasperation when he was asked if he regretted saying a lack of support from unspecified people had put him through his “worst 48 hours” since joining the club.Maresca’s cryptic comments spark confusion after Chelsea sink EvertonRead moreWhat did Maresca expect? It was unclear why he decided that a standard home win over Everton, who have a dismal record at Stamford Bridge, was the time to air frustration with the criticism that followed last week’sdefeat against Atalanta in the Champions League. He did not single anyone out, but he was not talking about supporters and he gives no indication that he cares about the media, so he can not complain about outsiders assuming there are issues either with Chelsea’s owners or their sporting directors, Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley.When that was put to him before the Carabao Cup trip to Cardiff on Tuesday, though, Maresca offered little. Saying repeatedly he had nothing to add, he mused that “we are in an era where everyone can say what they want”. An insistence his comments were “quite clear” was laughable. It continued with Maresca refusing to reveal whether he has spoken to his bosses since Saturday.After much prompting, he later relented and said:“It’s OK, it’s good,” when asked about his relationship with the ownership. He added that owners are the most important figures at any club as they “put the money in”. While the 45-year-old said he remains happy at Chelsea, he declined to retract his comments about those 48 hours.It had been a tough fortnight for Chelsea, who followed fine performances againstArsenalandBarcelonabylosing at Leedsanddrawing at Bournemouthbefore the reverse in Bergamo. One theory is that Maresca had bristled at being given more feedback than usual by the sporting directors after his substitutions backfired against Atalanta. Another is that he expected public backing from the club after three games without a win.Chelsea, though, have repeatedly stood by Maresca this season. Backing does not have to follow every setback. Chelsea’s plan is to review his position next summer. The danger is that this episode will go down badly. Chelsea are baffled.Some have attributed the outburst to inexperience and the hope is that the dust will settle, but Maresca has taken a risk. He was not speaking from a position of strength and it will be awkward if Chelsea lose at Newcastle on Saturday. It also feels unnecessary. Chelsea have not put pressure on Maresca to win the title this season. They just want evidence of progress.View image in fullscreenChelsea won the Club World Cup, but long-term injuries to important players such as Cole Palmer (centre) have hindered their campaign.Photograph: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty ImagesThe strategy implemented by Behdad Eghbali, the co-controlling owner, and carried out by the recruitment team is starting to work. Chelsea have built a talented young squad, are fourth in the league and remain in every cup competition. They are nowhere near crisis territory.It is true some of Maresca’s recent selection and tactical decisions have not been received well. Overall, though, he has done a fine job since replacing Mauricio Pochettino. Chelsea qualified for the Champions League,won the Conference Leaguelast season and destroyedParis Saint-Germain in the Club World Cupfinal in the summer. Maresca has maintained their progress this season, even though he has had to deal with a disrupted pre-season and long-term injuries to Cole Palmer, Liam Delap and Levi Colwill.Cardiff’s Brian Barry-Murphy: ‘If we rocked up with tiki-taka, the locals wouldn’t be having it’Read moreEven then, though, it would be a grave miscalculation from Maresca to assume his achievements would earn him more power. Managers who want to work at Chelsea have to exist within the club’s collaborative structure. Their voice carries weight, but it is never going to be a one-man show. Stability comes from the sporting leadership team. Maresca would be naive to start a civil war.It is hard tell which way this goes. There was tension when Maresca’s request for a new centre-back after Colwill ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament in August was dismissed. A key dilemma is that Chelsea are a match for anyone when they field their strongest side. However, some of their most important players are unable to play three games a week. Wesley Fofana falls into that category, but the alternatives to the centre-back are unconvincing.Chelsea are supportive of Maresca managing his team’s workload. The problem is that standards fall when he makes changes. Maresca has said Andrey Santos is a downgrade on Moisés Caicedo in midfield and has shown little faith in Jorrel Hato since the 19-year-old defender’s nightmare against Qarabag last month. Facundo Buonanotte, the Argentina forward on loan from Brighton, has not been in the squad for a league game since October.Maresca has often spoken glowingly of the Chelsea project. The problem now is that he has left it open for outsiders to question his true feelings. He talked himself into a hole on Saturday and should have made more of an effort to dig himself out of it. Any more hints of discontent will do nothing for his chances of being at Chelsea next season.Explore more on these topicsChelseaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The manager wants to know Barnes is ­sufficientlykeen on swapping international allegiance– he has a single cap for England – before con­sidering the Newcastle player for a potential World Cup berth.Scotland’sWorld Cup return after a 28-year waithas put Barnes’s inter­national future back on the agenda. The feeling within the Scottish ­Football Association has thus far been that Barnes believes he can play for England again, but the player left the door open on a switch during an interview last month.Scotland to face Brazil and Morocco in World Cup group stage in repeat of France 1998Read more“They have to be committed, they have to want to play forScotland,” Clarke said on Monday. “It is 26 [in a squad] again so there are some spaces there, but not too many.”Clarke denied introducing a player such as Barnes to the squad so close to aWorld Cupcould disrupt team harmony. “Football players are quite selfish,” he said. “They like to think that if someone is going to help them be better and the team to be better … like I said, as long as they come and they are ­committed then I am pretty sure anyone who comes into this group of players will enjoy it.”Clarke has raised the possibility of staying on as the Scotland manager beyond the World Cup. The 62‑year‑old’s contract ends when his team exit the tournament and the widespread belief has always been he will call time on his tenure at that point. Yet Clarke is open to an extension. He will hold talks with the ­Scottish FA in the early part of next year.View image in fullscreenSteve Clarke has led Scotland to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA“It would need to be right for me and I would need to find out whether it’s right for them,” he said. “I want to wait until the turn of the year, get the training camp and the bases sorted and get the [World Cup] programme sorted first. Hopefully, that will give me a little bit of time before the March games to sit down and just go through everything.“I’ve got a few questions for them in terms of how we move forward and how we make sure it’s not over 20 years before we qualify for another World Cup.“This group of players can ­definitely do 2028. Not all of them, but most of them.

So why does the Ally Pally crowd enjoy goading him?Jonathan Liewat Alexandra PalaceMon 15 Dec 2025 16.34 ESTFirst published on Mon 15 Dec 2025 15.20 ESTShareBy the time Cameron Menzies finally leaves the arena, theblood gushing from the gash on his right handhas trickled its way down the whole hand, down his wrist, part of his forearm and – somehow – up to his face. Smeared in crimson and regret, and already mouthing sheepish apologies to the crowd, he disappears down the steps, pursued by a stern-looking Matt Porter, the chief executive of the Professional Darts Corporation.The physical scars from Menzies’s encounter with the Alexandra Palace drinks table after his 3-2 defeat against Charlie Manby will be gone within a few weeks. Most probably there will be a fine of some sort. What about the rest? Man loses game of darts, punches table three times in fury, goes to hospital, repents at leisure: simple cause and effect. But of course this is not, and this is never, the whole story. In a way this tale is a kind of parable for elite darts itself, a pub game elevated to the level of a prize-fight, even – very occasionally – a bloodsport.Title hopeful Bunting survives huge scare at PDC World ChampionshipRead moreCredit, first of all, where due. The 20-year-old Manby is clearly going to be some talent: a star of the Modus Super Series who this year posted a mind-bending average of 130.7 on the Development Tour, smashing the previous record held by Luke Littler. This was his debut on the big stage, and he owned it thoroughly.Twelve months ago, Menzies was on this same stage, playing his first-round game against Leonard Gates of the US. The crowd didn’t need an excuse to goad him, but in the likable Texan they had one anyway. As Gates edged into the lead, boisterous support for the underdog spilled into something a little nastier. Menzies was jeered every time he missed a double. Before long they were jeering the missed doubles and missed singles too.A skittish and anxious player even at the best of times, Menzies started to choke up. From a distance, he appeared to be displaying the classic signs of a panic attack. He lost 3-1, left the stage in tears, pursued by a chorus of “Scotland get battered, everywhere they go”. Unbeknown to everyone, his father was in hospital recovering from a triple heart bypass. Menzies would later describe it as one of the darkest times of his life.Of course pantomime villains have been part of the Palace liturgy since way back. Gerwyn Price used to get it, and Peter Manley before him. But Menzies is nobody’s idea of a hard-bitten, shit-talking heel. He’s a wry, funny, slightly daft ex-plumber who wears his heart on his sleeve. So why do the Ally Pally crowd take such pleasure in tearing strips off him?Being Scottish is a factor, but Gary Anderson and Peter Wright get nothing like the same treatment. Maybe some find his histrionics a distraction. Chris Dobey has named him as one of the most irritating players on tour because of that sense of constant theatre, the emotions and the contortions, a player teetering on the edge of a precipice, whose toughest opponent has often seemed to be himself.View image in fullscreenCameron Menzies rues missing a double in his match against Charlie Manby.Photograph: Godfrey Pitt/Action Plus/ShutterstockBut ultimately the reason the Alexandra Palace crowd get at Menzies is they know he can be got at. If you’ve ever fancied influencing the outcome of a darts game, the world No 26 gives you maximum bang for your bark. He suffers. He miscounts. He misses. You will get under his skin, and you will know you’ve got under his skin, and so you will keep trying. If his ex-partner Fallon Sherrock was Queen of the Palace, Menzies is more akin to its whipping boy.The irony is that for long periods Menzies was successfully hushing the crowd. He led 2-1 in sets, grabbing the third with a sublime 11-dart leg, and despite a little queasiness on the doubles looked fully in control. But as Manby rallied, levelling at 2-2 and then breaking the Menzies throw in the deciding set, the volume began to swell, a kind of madness rolling in at the edges, a dark fog of chaos and doom.By the time Menzies had fatally miscounted in a leg he had to win, throwing treble-20 on 66, his good sense had departed him entirely. Manby missed a dart for the match. Menzies returned with six required. He missed. Then hit a single-3. Flung his last dart aimlessly at the bull to bust his score, only for the referee, Kirk Bevins, to inform him that it was invalid, as he had already stepped past the oche.Finally, Manby finally claimed victory on double-1. Reeled across the stage in triumph. Sought out Menzies to offer his commiserations, only to discover that the hand he was expecting to shake was drenched in blood.Afterwards, Menzies issued a statement apologising for his behaviour. His uncle Gary had passed away last month, and it was on his mind, but he didn’t want anyone to think he was making excuses. And for all the spite and condemnation that will be flung his way, ultimately nobody will be harder on Menzies than Menzies himself: a man constantly trying and failing to balance his feelings for the sport, a man who you hope is getting the help he needs.He will be back next year, and so will the crowds, and he knows it will be 10 times worse next year, and he knows the PDC will do nothing. This is the pact, the dark side of darts’s golden age. Take a man with a history of mental health problems, throw him on stage in front of people who have seen him bleed on the television, chuck in some morning pints and a little petty English nationalism, and see what happens. The good news is that Menzies is a good enough player to conquer this stage eventually. The bad news is that he’ll need to be.In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or emailjo@samaritans.org.

Tommy Svensson’s team finally came unstuck against a Brazil side not only containing the wonderful Romário, but also Bebeto, Dunga, Jorginho and Raí. Brazil went on to win the World Cup, beating Italy on penalties in the final.This year, as I was discussing the Guardian’s top 100 footballers with Thiago Rabelo, a Brazilian football journalist who contributes to our coverage and also helps with judges for the list, he mentioned that Romário could be interested in taking part. I thought it may be too good to be true, but in mid-November his votes had arrived.Not only that, Thiago managed to get Dunga on board, as well as Walter Casagrande, Juninho (x2) and other legends of the Brazilian game. From Germany, Didi Hamann said he would be happy to join compatriots Philipp Lahm and Thomas Hitzlsperger to be part of the voting panel.View image in fullscreenRomário (left) and Dunga after winning the World Cup in 1994.Photograph: Henri Szwarc/Bongarts/Getty ImagesNone of these judges are getting paid – and neither are the coaches or journalists who are part of the 219-strong jury.

All the votes were added together to give a raw score. To minimise the influence of outliers in the list, the highest score awarded to a player was then deducted to give a final score.If players are level on points in the scoring, the number of individual votes cast is used as a tie-breaker. If they are still level the decider will be the highest individual vote. The voting breakdown will be published when the full list has been revealed.Voting disclosureWe are very grateful to our judges for taking part, and none have been paid for participating in this project.To allow our judges the freedom to express their opinions without fear or favour, individual voting records will be anonymised in the full breakdown of scores.Voters are identified only by their category and a number chosen at random.

If the King George VI Chase atKemptonon Boxing Day is on your racing bucket list, next week’s renewal might be one of the final chances to tick it off.That, sadly, is the only conclusion to be drawn from what was almost a throwaway comment by Jim Mullen, the Jockey Club’s new chief executive,to the Racing Post’sindustry editor, Bill Barber, over the weekend.Kempton the victim as Jockey Club puts a price on ‘priceless’ heritage | Greg WoodRead more“Kempton,” Mullen said, “is out of my hands,” before adding: “Back in 2018 the Jockey Club and [the developer] Redrow negotiated an option to develop Kempton and that option was negotiated and transferred to Redrow. They have the option to exercise that for development, but sinceI’ve been here [from April 2025]there have been no concrete plans or agreements to develop it. But they do have the option to do so.”This was the trade paper’s first mention of an option to develop Kempton (although its existence wasfirst revealed by the Sunin June this year). The timing of Mullen’s comment, though, feels significant, as the government’s planning and infrastructure bill – which will limit the powers of local councils to block developments – is currently awaiting royal assent.It would be no great surprise were Redrow to exercise its option to buy Kempton as swiftly as possible. The Jockey Club’s initial plan to consign the 147-year-old track to the wrecking ball envisaged 3,000 houses on what is, from a developer’s perspective, an irresistible plot a stone’s throw from the M25, and with a pre-existing rail connection to Waterloo in 46 minutes. The new law will likely ensure that no amount of local opposition, or the site’s status as “strongly-performing” green belt land, will save it.The Jockey Club likes to trumpet the fact that it operates under a royal charter, and states on its website that this requires it to “act for the long-term good of British racing ineverything[the Club’s italics] we do”. It is also the largest employer and commercial organisation in British racing.The ongoing saga of the attempt to bulldoze Kempton, however, is a reminder that while the Jockey Club claims to be thoroughly modern and commercial in its outlook, there is more than a hint of feudalism about its governance, membership and decision-making. Ultimate power lies, as it has since the club was founded in 1750, with nine stewards, elected from within the ranks of around 200 members that are, in turn, recruited by invitation only.The overwhelmingly negative response to the Jockey Club’s initial proposals for Kempton in January 2017, from fans, trainers, jockeys and owners within racing as well as Spelthorne borough council and local residents,prompted an alternative proposalfor the site in February 2020 with 500 houses and racing continuing.What we know now that we did not know then, however, is that Redrow had been sitting on an effective 12-year option for the site since 2018. The lord of the manor had already effectively relinquished control over the land, but saw no reason to inform the serfs.The King George at Kempton is one of the most cherished and storied races in the jumping calendar. Mill House, Arkle, Desert Orchid and Kauto Star are among the great champions that have thrilled the Boxing Day audience down the years. The fact that Kempton’s flat, right-handed track is very different to Cheltenham’s demanding contours makes it a test of a chaser’s versatility, and it takes a true great to complete the King George/Gold Cup double.View image in fullscreenThe great Desert Orchid is commemorated with a statue at Kempton racecourse.Photograph: Steven Paston for the Jockey Club/PAIt is also within easy reach of the jumping hotbed of Lambourn, and Nicky Henderson – who once threatened to lie in front of the bulldozers should the demolition plans come to pass – is among the many trainers to have used it to introduce future stars of the winter game. And while its extensive programme of all-weather Flat racing is not to all tastes, it generates so much media rights income from off-course betting that Kempton is believed to be the third-most profitable track in the Jockey Club’s 15-strong portfolio.While it is handy for Lambourn, however, it is a long way away from the Jockey Club’s home in Newmarket, the headquarters of Flat racing, where the Club has suggested it could build a new all-weather track with some of the hundreds of millions of pounds it would realise from the sale of Kempton.That, clearly, would be in the long-term interests of the Jockey Club. Whether it is in the long-term interests of the sport as a whole, as the club’s royal charter demands, is a different question entirely.And it is the same royal charter that has effectively allowed the stewards of the Jockey Club to secretly cede control of one of the sport’s prized assets into the hands of a developer, in the face of overwhelming opposition, with no oversight and no accountability. In the third decade of the 21st century, the Jockey Club’s governance still seems stuck in the mid-18th.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowCatterick Bridge12.15 Apieceovfortune 12.45 Keyboard 1.15 Passing Pleasure 1.45 Court Canyon 2.15 Stellarmasterpiece 2.45 Prospect House 3.20 Clay PigeonsWincanton12.30 Regent’s Stroll 1.00 The Big Reveal 1.30 Gatineau Park 2.00 Bespoke Tailor 2.30 Diplomatic Ash 3.00 Apples Moon 3.30 Oakley’s WayNewcastle3.12 Educate 3.45 Balthamos 4.15 Data Fata Secutus 4.45 Inspired 5.15 Miss Raincloud 5.45 Alpine Sierra 6.15 Call Glory 6.45 Teardrops (nb) 7.15 Carlton And Co (nap)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Before writing this column, I asked the Jockey Club to explain the reasoning behind its decision to give Redrow an option on the Kempton Park site in 2018, whether this was unanimously approved by the stewards at the time, why the decision remained secret for seven years and whether the Club was confident that it had not breached the terms of its royal charter to act “in the best interests of British racing?”.A spokesperson for the club said in a statement on Monday: “Kempton remains the subject of a deal agreed in 2018 that gave a housebuilder the right to purchase the course for a significant sum if they were to achieve planning consent to build on it. That has not changed and the right expires in 2028, with a limited ability to extend if a planning application is under consideration. Any future change is determined by the gaining of planning permission.”Explore more on these topicsKemptonTalking HorsesHorse racinganalysisShareReuse this content"

The victory also meant the Lionesses became the first senior England team to win a trophy abroad.The England women’s rugby union team, meanwhile, were overwhelming favourites to take the World Cup on home soil, and did so with a33-13 win over Canadain front of a record crowd of 81,885 at Twickenham’s Allianz Stadium.It was England’s first world title for 11 years as they stretched their own record for consecutive victories, taking their sequence to 33 matches. But the sight of packed crowds across the country - and the sense of a sport crashing into the mainstream - will also linger in the memory.“To be recognised in this way is somethingvery specialfor our team,” the head coach, John Mitchell, said after the shortlist was announced. “We hope 27 September 2025 will be remembered with pride and joy for years to come;not just as a moment we celebrated, but as a spark that inspires a movement for thousands of young girls and boys to dream big and begin their own rugby journey.“Ifwe’vehelped changewhat’spossible for the next generation, that is truly the greatest win of all.”A Rory McIlroy-inspired Europe clinched a nail-biting win toretain the Ryder Cupat Bethpage Black, only their fifth win in the United States and the first since the Miracle of Medinah in 2012.Europe fended off a dramatic US fightback in the singles - having gone into the final day with a seven-point lead, they held on to win 15-13.Explore more on these topicsBBC Sports Personality of the YearEngland women's football teamEngland women's rugby union teamRyder Cup 2025Ryder CupGolfRugby unionShareReuse this content"

They said police forces could be legally liable for their failure to progress cases, as excessive delays may breach the UK’s obligations under the European convention on human rights (ECHR).The super-complaint accuses police of routine de-prioritisation of some sexual offence cases, poor collaboration with theCrown Prosecution Service, and staffing, resourcing and case management issues.Sexual offence cases taking more than three years to investigate have increased more than sevenfold over the past 10 years, from 533 in 2014-15 to 4,008 in 2024-25, according to freedom of information requests submitted by the organisations to the Home Office and police forces across England andWales. At the end of March 2025, there were almost 14,000 investigations that had been open for more than three years, the organisations said.Their research found that investigations lasting between three and four years had increased from 137 cases in 2014-15 to 2,261 cases in 2024-25.The organisations also surveyed survivors involved in delayed cases and found that more than two-thirds said they were unsure if they would report to the police again.The super-complaint highlighted the case of a woman who reported childhood sexual abuse, including rape, to the police in December 2014. The alleged perpetrator was arrested soon after and bailed, but was not charged until 2021.Call for system that frees rape suspects as alternative to bail to be scrapped in England and WalesRead moreA 2022 trial date was postponed due to the barristers’ strike and was re-listed for 2023. But the woman could no longer cope with the emotional toll of supporting the prosecution and withdrew from the case.She said: “I find it difficult to bring myself to explain the level of pure disappointment I feel towards the police. The police are supposed to be a body that protects citizens. The police have not just failed me, but many others.“It is truly inhumane to put a victim through a process lasting nine years. I have been disappointed by the so-called justice system under which we are meant to feel safe.”The police super-complaints system allows designated organisations to raise issues on behalf of the public about harmful patterns or trends in policing. The organisations’ complaint comes at a time ofunprecedented delaysand challenges across the criminal justice system, particularly in sexual offence cases.The long wait for police investigations, coupled with delays in the court system, has meant that reporting rape and other sexual offences has become increasingly difficult and re-traumatising for survivors, the organisations said. It also means that suspects could spend yearsreleased under investigationdue to changes to the law around bail.The organisations have called for an audit by all forces to establish how many survivors’ cases are effectively stuck in the system.Ellie Ball, an independent sexual violence adviser manager at CRCC, said: “These survivors report to the police in good faith, only to have their cases repeatedly de-prioritised and pushed to the back of an informal waiting list for justice.“Not only does this prevent survivors from being able to move forward with their lives, it also leaves many with a deep sense of mistrust and disillusionment, that their traumatic experiences can be treated with such seeming indifference and apathy.”She added: “The fact that three, four and five year-long investigations can appear almost unremarkable now to those working within the system, points to the need for an urgent wake-up call, and effective solutions.”Maxime Rowson, head of policy and public affairs at RCEW, said survivors were “being asked to engage with a process that no longer resembles a functioning justice system”.She added that in some cases prolonged delays “prevent justice altogether, as survivors understandably withdraw due to stress and distress, memories fade, and perpetrators pass away before cases reach trial”.A spokesperson for His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services said: “Rape and serious sexual offences are devastating crimes that can have lifelong impacts. Many victims and survivors struggle to come forward, being unable to access support or out of fear of not being believed. It is crucial that the police, together with other public services, do all they can to respond effectively.“Alongside the College of Policing and Independent Office forPoliceConduct, we will jointly assess this super-complaint.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Several were moved to make way for new MPs to join the fold – including Murray, who was replaced by the recently returned former foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander.He told Holyrood magazine that his wife was “absolutely fucking furious” about his demotion and that he had not been given enough credit for balancing family life with the role.He said: “She thought I was massively underappreciated, because she’s seen it from her side about how much I was balancing family life, parliament, being one of the new 37 Scottish MPs, being in government, the travelling up and down, not just in the constituency, but also aroundScotland, and all the rest of it. But she was most angry about the fact that the prime minister didn’t have an explanation.”In the interview, Murray said No 10 had not given him any recognition for his work in the Scotland Office or explained why he was moved.Business groups urge Tory peers to stop blocking Labour’s workers’ rights billRead moreHe added: “For me, the hardest part was the complete lack of any sort of recognition for doing a half-decent job. That’s the hardest bit.“The second hardest bit is having no explanation of why I was sacked, and as we sit here today, I still don’t have that despite me asking on a number of occasions. And the third bit is that I didn’t think I deserved the public humiliation of it all. I genuinely don’t know why it happened and that feels like an unfair gap.”Murray said it had taken him five hours to decide whether to accept the job of technology minister – split between the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. He will take on a significant share of the responsibility for the government’s flagship digital ID card iniative.“My big questions about coming back into government were, why was it not offered to me at the time – and it wasn’t – why has the decision now been made and why?” he said. “If I’m not good enough for the Scotland Office, why am I now number two in two major UK departments?”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It follows UK deals with India and the US, and the free tradeagreement with the EUclinched this year.Existing trade between the UK and South Korea is worth more than £15bn a year under a 2019 post-Brexit arrangement. The new deal covers the exports of services, automotive, pharmaceutical and food and drink, and would bring an extra £400m a year to the British economy, the UK government said.Significantly, the deal also lowers the threshold on the quantity of parts in a car that must be British or from the EU to qualify for zero tariffs from January.Under the current rules, 55% of a car must be made in the UK or the EU to qualify for duty-free sales. This has been dropped to 25% under the new deal, enabling carmakers to buy batteries or battery components from China and still qualify for zero-tariff exports to South Korea.View image in fullscreenThe trade minister Chris Bryant tries a racing simulation at Samsung in London to mark the end of negotiations on the UK-South Korea deal.Photograph: Lisa O’Carroll/The GuardianRichard Molyneux, the chief finance officer at Jaguar Land Rover, welcomed the deal, while Frank-Steffen Walliser, the chief executive of Bentley Motors, described continued access to a key market for the luxury brand as “great news”.Nik Jhangiani, the interim chief executive ofDiageo, said the new trade arrangement would “support export growth for Guinness”, which although made in Dublin, is canned in Runcorn and Belfast.Announced by the UK trade minister, Chris Bryant, and his South Korean counterpart, Yeo Han-koo, at the Samsung superstore in King’s Cross, London, the deal also offers British companies the opportunity to tender for public procurement contracts in Seoul, to offer legal services and the chance to do business via e-contracts for the first time.“Today’s agreement secures the UK as a global leader in digital trade and innovation while boosting our world-class services sector, supporting iconic brands, and giving cast-iron protections to our key industries to speed up economic growth as part of our plan for change,” Bryant said.Yeo said the deal would “strengthen the free-market system” at a time of “heightened uncertainty” and allowed allies to continue operating in the rule-based trading environment that Donald Trump disrupted with hisUS tariff push this year.The deal also gives British exporters tariff-free trade on 98% of goods, aligning it with the EU’s trade deal with Seoul.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeSouth KoreaAutomotive industryFood & drink industryPharmaceuticals industryServices sectorTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Communities around the world have already held funeral ceremonies for lost glaciers, and aGlobal Glacier Casualty Listrecords the names and histories of those that have vanished.About 200,000 glaciers remain worldwide, with about 750 disappearing each year. However, the research indicates this pace will accelerate rapidly as emissions from burning fossil fuels continue to be released into the atmosphere.Current climate action plans from governments are forecast to push global temperatures to about 2.7C above preindustrial levels, supercharging extreme weather. Under this scenario, glacier losses would peak at about 3,000 a year in 2040 and plateau at that rate until 2060. By the end of the century, 80% of today’s glaciers will have gone.glacier extinction graphicBy contrast, rapid cuts to carbon emissions to keep global temperature rise to 1.5C would cap annual losses at about 2,000 a year in 2040, after which the rate would decline.1:44Glacier collapses, burying evacuated Swiss village in mud and rocks – videoPrevious studies have focused on the volume of ice lost, given its contribution to rising sea levels that threaten coastal towns and cities. Individual glaciers, however, are also important as water sources and tourist attractions for many communities, and often have spiritual significance for local people. This prompted the researchers to analyse the number of glaciers disappearing.Matthias Huss, a senior scientist at ETH Zurich inSwitzerlandand a member of the study team, said: “As glaciologists, we do not only model the disappearance of glaciers globally, but we are very directly concerned with this loss of glaciers in our daily work.”As the director of the Swiss glacier monitoring network, Huss recently declared four extinct, the latest in an estimated 1,000 lost in the country over the past three decades.Huss also spoke at afuneral ceremony for the Pizol glacierin 2019. “More than 250 people climbed up to this glacier to say goodbye. It was very impressive.”Such funerals have also taken place in Iceland, Nepal and elsewhere. “People climb up to these vanishing glaciers to say goodbye for themselves, but also to send out a strong signal to the public to tell them it matters to us.”View image in fullscreenThe Kā Roimata o Hine Hukatere in New Zealand is experiencing substantial ice loss.Photograph: Jon Bower New Zealand/AlamyMany glaciers hold spiritual significance, for example Māori culture regard them as ancestors. The Māori political leader Nā Lisa Tumahai visited the melting Kā Roimata o Hine Hukatere in 2022 and told the Global Glacier Casualty List:“This mighty glacier, a presence once so physically commanding, is shrinking into oblivion. [It] has been subdued, humiliated by the actions of humans.“To see this retreating giant is to understand impermanence, to understand the real and terrible results of industrialisation, of climate change.”The new study,published in Nature Climate Change, analysed more than 200,000 glaciers from a database of outlines derived from satellite images. The researchers used three global glacier models to assess their fate under different heating scenarios.Regions with the smallest and fastest-melting glaciers were found to be the most vulnerable. The study estimates the 3,200 glaciers in centralEuropewould shrink by 87% by 2100 – even if global temperature rise is limited to 1.5C, rising to 97% under 2.7C of heating.View image in fullscreenThe towering Dawes glacier carves into the Endicott Arm fjord in Alaska, where glaciers are melting at a record pace.Photograph: VW Pics/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesIn the western US and Canada, including Alaska, about 70% of today’s 45,000 glaciers are projected to vanish under 1.5C of heating, and more than 90% under 2.7C. The Caucasus and southern Andes are also expected to face devastating losses.Larger glaciers take longer to melt, with those in Greenland reaching their peak extinction rate in about 2063 – losing 40% by 2100 under 1.5C of heating and 59% under 2.7C. However, the melting is forecast to continue beyond 2100.The researchers said the peak loss dates represent more than a numerical milestone. “They mark turning points with profound implications for ecosystems, water resources and cultural heritage,” they wrote. “[It is] a human story of vanishing landscapes, fading traditions and disrupted daily routines.”View image in fullscreenGlacier melt in Antarctica threatens sea levels.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThese transitions also underscored the urgent need to help communities adapt to changing conditions, they said, with 2 billion people downstream reliant on mountain water for regular supplies and food security. Adaptation measures could include new types of farming, alternative businesses to replace tourism and evenartificial glaciers, which have been trialled in Kyrgyzstan.Dr Arun Bhakta Shrestha, a senior adviser at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development and not part of the study, said: “[The study] underscores how today’s climate decisions will profoundly influence the future of these vital natural features.”Shrestha said the work offered a valuable perspective on the rapid changes occurring in glacier landscapes and the people that depend on them, while noting some limitations, including uncertainty in counting small and debris-covered glaciers and the lack of up-to-date data.Explore more on these topicsGlaciersClimate crisisIcePolar regionsMountainsSwitzerlandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

At the moment, fewer than 2% of new HGV registrations are electrically chargeable trucks.“If the trajectory of uptake continues as is … the industry would pay about €2bn in yearly fines,” Levin said.Rådström said there were only 1,500 public charging points for HGVs across Europe but there needed to be 35,000 to enable the transition to electric, or about 500 installed a month.“I’ve been chief executive of Daimler Truck now for 14 months, and I think in total, during these 14 months, there were less than 500 built. So that just shows you the magnitude of acceleration that we need,” she said.Last year it emerged there was onlyone public electric charging pointfor HGVs in the UK.Sigrid de Vries, the director general of the ACEA, called on the commission to instigate an early review of the targets so there “can be a closer alignment between the enabling conditions that are not in place and are not coming online, and the obligations on the sector, including having to pay penalties”.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentAutomotive industryEuropean UnionEuropeElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsRoad transportEuropean CommissionnewsShareReuse this content"

With temperatures expected to continue soaring above 40C (104F) over the coming days, the Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe heatwave warning across much of the south-west.The conditions follow bushfires in New South Wales this month, which resulted in the destruction of homes and loss of life. Severe heatwave warnings have also been issued for later this week in parts of South Australia and New South Wales, as a ridge of high pressure moves eastward, bringing blazing sunshine to much of the region.InBrazil, São Paulo was plunged into darkness last week after strong winds damaged the city’s power grid, with falling trees bringing down power lines. The weather conditions also caused travel disruption at Congonhas airport, where hundreds of flights were cancelled. Severe damage to electrical infrastructure is expected to cause further problems as utility companies scramble to restore power to more than 1 million residents.View image in fullscreenDense fog blankets wind turbines in California.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, California’s Central Valley – known for its clear skies and abundant sunshine – has experienced one of its dullest and foggiest weeks on record. Tule fog, which typically lingers for only a few days, has been unusually widespread and persistent this year, keeping temperatures at Sacramento international airport below 8C for more than a week – the longest such streak in more than three decades. The prolonged fog has been fuelled by exceptional autumn rainfall that left soils saturated.And inSpain, Storm Emilia has brought intense rainfall, strong winds and even snow to the Canary Islands – conditions many would not associate with the popular holiday destination. While snow is not unheard of at higher ground on Tenerife, Emilia delivered some of the deepest accumulations since 2016 to the Teide national park, forcing its closure on Sunday.Alongside the snowfall, strong northerly winds swept across the archipelago, with gusts exceeding 50mph recorded on several islands including Lanzarote and Gran Canaria. The effect of Storm Emilia is expected to ease this week with more seasonal weather taking hold.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsWeather trackerBushfiresWestern AustraliaCaliforniaSpainBrazilanalysisShareReuse this content"

The market for UK government bonds, also known as gilts – the oldest major asset market in the world – waswitnessing major turmoil in April 2020.Sunak said: “I’d been chancellor for, you know, what felt like five seconds and then you could see a very material tightening in UK financial conditions.“And in the end, we organised with theBank of Englandsomething called the ‘ways and means’ facility, which thankfully we never needed to use, but essentially as a backstop for the government if it can’t raise the money it needs on the bond markets.”He said the facility, in effect a large overdraft organised with the Bank of England, was last used in the financial crisis and would have lasted for “a temporary period of time”.Instead, the central bank extended its quantitative easing (QE) programme,creating £200bn to purchase government bondsand easing the concerns of foreign investors.Sunak said job subsidies such as the furlough scheme, while expensive, meant ministers were successful in “preventing mass unemployment”, which was the “biggest fear” in the early stages of the pandemic.He agreed withAndrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, who gave evidence earlier in the inquiry, that there was the potential for a breakdown in social order without significant government intervention.He said there were projections thatunemployment would rise from about 4% to 12%, which would have left millions of people without a job.The number of people in work fell by 825,000 between January to March 2020 and October to December 2020, while unemployment rose by almost 400,000 and the number of people who were economically inactive rose by 327,000,according to House of Commons library research.Sunak said that in the early days of the pandemic his priority was to protect people’s jobs, household incomes and to ensure businesses did not fail.He said there was no “perfect science” to the decisions he made and acknowledged he was constantly weighing difficult economic trade-offs when formulating policy.“It wasn’t going to be possible to save every single person’s job, and people were going to experience economic hardship as a result of what was happening,” Sunak said. “I thought it was important to be honest with people about that upfront.”Explore more on these topicsCovid inquiryRishi SunakEconomic policyEconomicsBank of EnglandAndrew BaileyCoronavirusnewsShareReuse this content"

Winn has strongly denied the allegations and said she did not write the letter.The Observer said it verified the contents of the alleged letter, which appear in a new Sky documentary, with four members of Winn’s family and four relatives of her husband, Timothy “Moth” Walker. It reported that Winn’s niece said the letter had been given to her by Winn’s sister before her death last year. Winn reportedly declined an invitation to meet and discuss the allegations. A statement issued by representatives for Winn, whose real name is Sally Walker, dismissed the claims.“Tortoise Media’s Observer and documentary makers continue to spread a false narrative about my life, despite me having addressed them in my earlier statement,” she said.“It is a great source of sadness that Tortoise Media’s Observer and documentary makers are now seeking to drive a wedge between our family members. The family have always been able to share their concerns privately, and they still can.“I did not steal from family, as others can confirm. Nor have I confessed to doing so and I did not write the letter suggesting I did.”The latest claims follow an ongoing controversy in which Winn has been accused of fabricating aspects of her bestselling 2018 memoir. The Salt Path describes Winn’s experience of walking the 630-mile South West Coast Path with Moth, after the couple lost their home in Wales, and Moth was diagnosed with a terminal illness.An investigation by the Observer presented legal documents and witnesses who alleged that the couple lost their home after Winn took out a private mortgage to repay tens of thousands of pounds she was alleged to have taken from her employer. The couple’s account that long-distance walking reversed Moth’s symptoms has also been questioned by medical experts.In the latest allegation, Winn’s niece claims that Winn typed a letter confessing that she had taken £25,000 from her husband’s parents after getting into financial difficulty. The alleged incident is said to have happened around the same time that Winn was accused of taking £67,000 from her employer in 2008. In a July statement, Winn said: “Any mistakes I made during the years in that office, I deeply regret, and I am truly sorry.”The Observer reported that the letter was addressed to Winn’s sister and states: “Please don’t look any further for the money. I’ve taken it. All of it. I have to ask you not to take things any further with the bank, but tell them it was just a mistake … I have a police record and should this go any further I will go to prison this time.“In a mid panic when the mortgage was threatening to foreclose, I transferred £25,000 from Tim’s mum and dad’s account to Tim’s.” It also says that the couple were forced to live in a barn conversion on their property after being left with hardly any money.Winn is said to have made millions of pounds from sales of the memoir, events and the film adaptation of The Salt Path, which starred Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs.TV tonight: the next chapter of the shocking Salt Path exposéRead moreIn the statement responding to the new claims, Winn reiterated that her husband was diagnosed with corticobasal degeneration, now often referred to as corticobasal syndrome, describing this as “a fact”, and said the couple lost their home because of “a financial dispute with a lifelong friend, as described in the book”.“To everyone who has read and loved my books, thank you,” she said. “Nothing has changed. The Salt Path remains my honest recollection of the time when we lost our house and found hope on the coast path.”Explore more on these topicsBooksRaynor WinnAutobiography and memoirDocumentaryTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

She said information was becoming “increasingly weaponised”.The order of world institutions “designed in the ashes of the second world war” was, she said, being deliberately contested “from sea to space, from the battlefield to the boardroom” and “even our brains” through the deliberate spread of disinformation online.She said Britain and the world were “operating in a space between peace and war” – which the spy agency, traditionally focused on running agents and working with human sources, had to contend with. She said MI6 had to become “fluent in technology” and anticipate the impact of future advances.Metreweli, 48, took over as the head of MI6, the UK’s international spy agency, in September,becoming the first woman to hold the post. As its chief, or C, she is the only member of the organisation to be publicly named.An Arabic speaker, her early career included running agents in the Middle East as well as deployments in easternEurope. She was appointed to the top job by the prime minister after running MI6’s technology department, or Q branch.Metreweli said she would “break with tradition” and not “give you a global threat tour”. This allowed her to sidestep any direct analysis of China, which has been accused of trying to run espionage and hacking campaigns against the UK.Outgoing MI6 chief says Putin has ‘bitten off more than he can chew’ in UkraineRead moreIn the autumn, a row broke outafter the collapse of an espionage prosecutionagainst two Britons, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, accused of spying for Beijing. A trial had not been able to go ahead under now-repealed Official Secrets Act legislation because a government witness would not describe China as an enemy of the UK.China “will be a central part of the global transformation taking place this century”, she said, devoting a single paragraph to the country in her remarks. She added that “it is essential that we, as MI6, continue to inform the government’s understanding of China’s rise”, without describing Beijing as posing a challenge.Ministers have yet to decide whether to grant planning permission toChina’s proposed new super-embassy at London’s Royal Mint Court, while Starmer hopes to visit the country in January. MI6 emphasised that Metreweli’s aim was to focus on one or two issues, not to touch on the full range of topics within the agency’s remit.Russia,the focus of remarks trailed in advance, was described as “aggressive, expansionist and revisionist, seeking to subjugate Ukraine and harass Nato”. She said Putin was not serious about trying to end the war in Ukraine, describing him as “dragging out negotiations” and shifting the burden of the conflict on to his own population.Meanwhile, the head of Britain’s armed forces said on Monday that Britain needed to develop “a whole of nation response” to deal with the growing military threat posed by Russia.Richard Knighton, the chief of the defence staff, said that while there was a “remote chance” of a direct attack on the UK, the invasion of a Nato ally in eastern Europe by Russia’s 1.1 million-strong army was more likely.“We should be under no illusions that Russia has a massive, increasingly technically sophisticated, and now, highly combat-experienced, military,” he said, and that it has inUkrainegradually shown greater tactical awareness and increased its proficiency in the use of drones.He stopped short of hinting at a return to conscription, but noted that Germany and France had reintroduced limited forms of military service. Instead he argued that the UK needed “more people being ready to fight for their country” through increases in the size of the armed forces.Explore more on these topicsUK security and counter-terrorismMI6UkraineDefence policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The climbdownprompted angeramong some backbench Labour MPs, who accused Keir Starmer’s government of betrayal.However, peers voted down the bill for a fourth consecutive time, imposing amendments tabled by Tory peers protesting against a concession made as part of the deal to lift a cap on compensation claims for unfair dismissal.Some business leaders have warned lifting the cap could enable high earners to secure unlimited compensation.Workers can currently receive payouts equivalent to the lower of their annual salary or £118,223 if they win a claim for ordinary unfair dismissal.TheCityUK – which represents banks and other financial services companies – has written to ministers after the surpriseamendment to the employment rights billleft its members feeling blind-sided, and fearing open-ended payouts for highly paid staff, a source familiar with the letter told the Guardian.TheCityUK’s members, which employ some of the UK’s highest-paid staff in areas such as investment banking, warned it could create an avenue for well-paid bankers or City executives to secure big windfalls if they can successfully argue that they were unfairly fired.Those prospects could deter companies from investing in the UK and could make bosses more hesitant to take a chance on hires, the lobby group has warned ministers.Ministers vowed there would be no further compromises in an attempt to force through the legislation before Christmas, with sources suggesting further sittings of parliament could be used.The bill is expected to be passed without any amendments in the Commons on Monday and will be back in the Lords on Tuesday. If peers insist on tabling further amendments, the bill would need to again pass back and forth between the two houses before it receives royal assent.Writing in their letter to Kyle, the business groups said they wanted to focus on securing compromises from the government in the phase of secondary legislation that would follow the primary passage of the bill. Kyle has pledged to listen to bosses’ concerns and to hold a series of 26 consultations after the bill becomes law.The lobby groups argued that blocking the bill could put cooperation between business leaders, the government and trade unions at risk, and could lead to the loss of the six-month compromise.“We believe that the best way forward is to keep working with the government and trade unions to find balanced solutions through secondary legislation. To avoid losing the six months qualifying period, we therefore believe that now is the time for parliament to pass the bill.”Writing in response, Kyle saidLabourhad made “difficult but necessary compromises” to make progress.“If we can make progress towards achieving royal assent, I can assure your members, and the trade unions, that we are keen to see the spirit of consensus and cooperation shown to date continue in its implementation,” he said.Business leaders had stepped up their lobbying efforts against the workers’ rights changes, warning that companies could cut jobs as a result or be forced to put up their prices – with the potential to stoke inflation.Under Kemi Badenoch, theConservativeshave attempted to make in-roads to repairing the party’s bruised relationship with business leaders by promising to rip up Labour’s changes to employment rights.Although the business groups called for the bill to be passed by parliament, they also said they remained unsatisfied with the removal of the cap on compensation for unfair dismissal.Andrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said: “Different business groups will differ on the best tactic to secure any common sense from this government, but it’s clear not a single one supports scrapping the cash cap, which only benefits high earners and will lead to fewer jobs and lower growth.”Explore more on these topicsEmployment lawWorkers' rightsConfederation of British Industry (CBI)ConservativesLabourTrade unionsHouse of LordsnewsShareReuse this content"

Officials showed reporters surveillance aerial footage of the suspects moving a large black object in the desert to a table. Officials said they were able to make the arrests before the suspects assembled a functional explosive device.In the criminal complaint, the four suspects named are Audrey Illeene Carroll, 30; Zachary Aaron Page, 32; Dante Gaffield, 24; and Tina Lai, 41. They are all from the Los Angeles area, Essayli said.Officials did not describe a motive but said they are members of an offshoot of a pro-Palestinian group dubbed the Turtle Island Liberation Front. The group calls for “the working class to rise up and fight back against capitalism,” according to the criminal complaint.The charges against each suspect include conspiracy and possession of a destructive device. Essayli said additional charges were expected in coming weeks.It wasn’t immediately clear if the suspects had attorneys, and the Associated Press was unable to reach family members. AP also sent Turtle Island Liberation Front’s social media accounts messages asking for comment, but did not get a response.Essayli said Carroll last month created a detailed plan to bomb five or more business locations across Southern California on New Year’s Eve. He declined to name the companies but described them as “Amazon-type” logistical centers.“Carroll’s bomb plot was explicit,” Essayli said. “It included step-by-step instructions to build IEDs … and listed multiple targets across Orange county and Los Angeles.”The plan included planting backpacks filled with complex pipe bombs that were set to be detonated simultaneously at midnight on New Year’s Eve at five locations, according to officials and the criminal complaint. New Year’s Eve was identified as an opportune time in the plan that stated “fireworks will be going off at this time so explosions will be less likely to be noticed,” according to the investigation.The eight-page handwritten plan titled “OPERATION MIDNIGHT SUN” stated more locations could be added. The locations were identified as property and facilities operated by two separate companies tied to activities affecting interstate and foreign commerce, according to the complaint.Two of the group’s members also had discussed plans for future attacks targeting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and vehicles with pipe bombs in 2026, according to the criminal complaint.Carroll noted “that would take some of them out and scare the rest of them,’” according to the complaint.The plans were discussed both at an in-person meeting with members in Los Angeles and through an encrypted messaging app, Essayli said.Photos included in the court documents show a desert campsite with what investigators said were bomb-making materials strewn across plastic folding tables.The suspects “all brought bomb-making components to the campsite, including various sizes of PVC pipes, suspected potassium nitrate, charcoal, charcoal powder, sulfur powder, and material to be used as fuses, among others,” the complaint states.The plan included instructions on how to manufacture the bombs and also how to avoid leaving evidence behind that could be traced back to the group, officials said. The suspects recently had acquired precursor chemicals and other items, including purchases from Amazon, according to the complaint.The FBI moved in last week as they rehearsed the attack in the desert near Twentynine Palms, California, officials said.“They had everything they needed to make an operational bomb at that location,” Essayli said.Authorities issued search warrants and found posters for the Turtle Island Liberation Front at Carroll’s home that called for “Death to America”, and “Death to ICE”, Essayli said. In Page’s residence, police found a copy of the detailed bomb plan, he added.Jim McDonnell, LA’s police chief, said while federal and local officials disagree on the Trump administration’s immigration raids, they come together still to protect residents. The LAPD does not stop people or take action for any reason related to immigration status, and it doesn’t enforce immigration laws, a practice that has been in place for 45 years.“The successful disruption of this plot is a powerful testament to the strength of our unified response,” McDonnell said.The suspects were taken into custody without incident. They were scheduled to appear in court in Los Angeles Monday afternoon.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

His name appears on an online page of ICE detainees.“I just want my child to be well. He’s still young, and has a long life ahead,” said Guan’s mother.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The company expects its global mix of hybrids, extended-range EVs and pure EVs to reach 50% by 2030, from 17% today.Ford will spread out the writedown, taken primarily in the fourth quarter and continuing through next year and into 2027, the company said. About $8.5bn is related to cancelling planned EV models. Around $6bn is tied to the dissolution of a battery joint venture with South Korea’s SK On, and $5bn on what Ford called “program-related expenses”.Ford’s shift reflects the auto industry’s response to waning demand for battery-powered models, after car companies plowed hundreds of billions of dollars into EV investments early this decade. The outlook for electrics dimmed significantly this year as Donald Trump’s policies yanked federal support for EVs and eased tailpipe-emissions rules, which could encourage carmakers to sell more gas-powered cars.US sales of electric vehicles fell about 40% in November, following the September 30 expiration of a $7,500 consumer tax credit, which had been in place for more than 15 years to stoke demand. The Trump administration also included in the massive tax and spending bill that passed in July a freeze on fines that automakers pay for violating fuel-economy regulations.“Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas,” said Andrew Frick, head of Ford’s gas and electric-vehicle operations.The F-150 Lightning rolled off assembly lines starting in 2022 with much fanfare Comedian Jimmy Fallon wrote a song about the truck. Ford increased production of the model to meet an influx of 200,000 orders, but sales haven’t kept pace.The company sold 25,583 Lightnings through November of this year, a 10% decrease from the prior-year period.The successor to the F-150 Lightning, the T3 truck, was supposed to be built ground-up for production at a new complex in Tennessee, and be a core part of Ford’s second-generation EV lineup. Ford is now replacing production of the EV pickup with new gas-powered trucks starting in 2029 at the Tennessee factory.Ford effectively killed the entirety of its announced second-generation of EV models with Monday’s announcement.For its future EV lineup, the company is shifting focus to more affordable EV models, conceived by a so-called skunkworks team in California. The first model from that team is slated to be priced at about $30,000 and go on sale in 2027. This midsize EV truck is being built at Ford’s Louisville plant.Explore more on these topicsFordAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

This followed an intervention by the FCA on the “stress tests” that some lenders were doing to check that people’s repayments would remain affordable even if mortgage rates went up.In its new mortgage review, the regulator said there was wide agreement that some potential first-time buyer groups “could be better served”. This included people who cannot afford a big deposit, are self‑employed, are recovering from a “negative life event”, or had a negative mark on their credit file.One idea under discussion involves offering greater payment flexibility to self-employed people, contractors, freelancers and others, which could include “alternative payment schedules to help those with irregular income flows”. This could mean that individuals would be allowed to vary the amount they pay each month, or it might be that instead of – for example – having to pay £1,000 to their bank every month, they could pay £2,000 every two months.Some of the FCA’s rules refer to “monthly payments”, which may act as a barrier to product innovation, so the regulator said it would review the wording and look at whether it needed to be updated.The watchdog is also examining the idea of giving more recognition to a decent record of paying rent when someone applies for a mortgage and is undergoing affordability checks.The FCA said: “Some consumers have previously reported frustration where the regular payment a lender considers affordable is less than the rent they currently pay, leading to a smaller overall mortgage offer than expected.”Another group who may benefit from the shake-up are those who previously had a negative mark on their credit file, perhaps because of debts they had previously run up, but are now in a better place financially. The regulator said some mortgage lenders may be applying its definition of a “credit‑impaired customer” more broadly than was originally intended, which may be causing some to pull back from lending to people whose adverse credit situation had been resolved.The FCA is also exploring the idea of making interest-only mortgages easier to get hold of. These mortgages were hugely popular but almost became extinct after the 2007-08 financial crisis, with some viewing them as an example of irresponsible lending. However, the FCA has said they could be suitable for some consumers who may struggle to afford a traditional repayment mortgage.It added that, looking ahead, more people would be taking out a mortgage that runs beyond state pension age, so it would be exploring what could be done to boost the “later life lending” market, which includes equity release mortgages that older people can take out against their homes.Emad Aladhal, the FCA’s retail banking director, said people’s financial lives and needs were changing, and that today’s home ownership affordability challenges “may be creating problems for the future”.He added: “In a world where pension income is less reliable, housing wealth will be more important to financial wellbeing,” which was why the regulator was keen to widen access to affordable borrowing and help more people own their own home.Separately on Monday, Nationwide building society said house prices in the UKcould rise by as much as 4% next yearbut getting on the property ladder may become slightly less difficult.Explore more on these topicsMortgagesFinancial Conduct AuthorityFirst-time buyersPropertyRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

Additional targets for forest, land and agriculture (Flag) emissions reflect the importance of land-use and agricultural impacts across the business.”He added that industry-wide collaboration would be essential in achieving these goals.The government, under Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, has a target of reaching net zero in the UK by 2050, with interim carbon budgets for 2030 and beyond.Morrisons is trying to turn around its sales performance, after running up debts in a£7bn takeoverby the US private equity group Clayton, Dubilier and Rice in 2021.

They are also considering floating it on the London stock market – a decade on from its flotation by previous private equity owners. The plans are still in the early stages.Separately, the owners of the RAC are working on a stock market listing with a £5bn valuation. The business is owned by the Jersey-based private equity firm CVC Capital Partners, GIC – Singapore’s investment fund – and the US investment company Silver Lake Partners. A sale is also an option, although a stock market flotation is thought more likely.The AA, which was founded in 1905 as the Automobile Association, was taken private by TowerBrook and Warburg Pincus in a £219m takeoveragreed in 2020. The motoring group had endured atorrid time during its six years on the stock market.The AA’s previous private equity ownersfloated the company on the stock market in 2014at 250p a share, which valued the business at £1.4bn. CVC, Permira and Charterhouse made £1.2bn in the float. The shares hit a low of 15p in 2020 as concerns mounted over its ability to pay off its £2.6bn debts.The AA says it has transformed itself and now has debts of £1.9bn, equivalent to 4.1 times earnings, compared with 6.7 times when it was a public company.With 17 million customers, it posted revenues of £623m in the first half of the year, up 5%, and a profit before tax of £50m, up 54% and driven by a reduction in finance costs. Underlying earnings rose by 8% to £243m.The RAC has 15 million members, up from 14.1 million last year. Its revenues rose by 8% to £411m in the first half, while underlying earnings rose by 12% to £152m. The 128-year-old business said in August that it was confident about its outlook for this year and beyond.The AA, the RAC, TowerBrook, Warburg Pincus, CVC and Stonepeak declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsMotoringRoad transportStock marketsIPOsLondon Stock ExchangeTransportPrivate equitynewsShareReuse this content"

Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser on life after Grand Theft AutoKeith StuartHe rewrote the rule book with Rockstar then left it all behind. Now Dan Houser is back with a storytelling-focused studio to take on AI-obsessed tech bros and Mexican beauty queensMon 15 Dec 2025 07.35 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 10.07 ESTShareThere are only a handful of video game makers who have had as profound an effect on the industry as Dan Houser. The co-founder of Rockstar Games, and its lead writer, worked on all the GTA titles since the groundbreaking third instalment, as well as both Red Dead Redemption adventures. But then, in 2019, he took an extended break from the company which ended with his official departure. Now he’s back with a new studio and a range of projects, and12 years after we last interviewed him, he’s ready to talk about what comes next.“Finishing those big projects and thinking about doing another one is really intense,” he says about his decision to go. “I’d been in full production mode every single day from the very start of each project to the very end, for 20 years. I stayed so long because I loved the games. It was a real privilege to be there, but it was probably the right time to leave. I turned 45 just after Red Dead 2 came out. I thought, well, it’s probably a good time to try working on some other stuff.”At first, he looked into film or TV writing, but didn’t like what he found. “That world was not overly excited by me and I was not overly excited by them,” he says. “I’ve spent 20 years talking about how games are the coming medium and now theyarethe medium […] you look at TV and the budgets and the amount of money they can generate, but the creative ambition is so small at times”. It seemed to Houser that it would be easier to come at the industry with IP that had already been generated. So he moved to Santa Monica and formed Absurd Ventures, bringing in Greg Borrud (founder of SeismicGamesand Pandemic Studios) as head of games and, as COO, Wendy Smith, previously at the New Yorker and Ralph Lauren, and a White House special assistant during Bill Clinton’s presidency.View image in fullscreen‘It was a privilege to be there’… Red Dead Redemption 2.Photograph: Rockstar GamesIt was clear from the start it wouldn’t just be a video games studio. In 2024, the company released the 12-part story podcast A Better Paradise, a dystopian thriller about an ambitious online game world overseen by a powerful AI presence that begins to become sentient – with devastating consequences. Its creator is the mysterious tech billionaire Dr Mark Tyburn, a British inventor who intends the game as a digital utopia, then abandons it when things go awry. In some ways it is a satire on our current digital oligarchy, in which billionaire tech bros wield astronomical influence over society.“All of these tech companies start out with grandiose ambitions, this ‘we are going to save the world through togetherness’-type gibberish,” he says. “We’ve created some of the most powerful people in history in terms of reach and mind control. Those people end up living with far more money than anyone’s ever had. And it feels, as someone who lives in the society that they have helped create, that there are moments in those journeys when they must have felt their product was not quite what they intended it to be and was doing unforeseen harm, and … they went out of their way to ensure that was not regulated. That Faustian moment I find fascinating, and that’s not to say I wouldn’t make the same choice or judge them for it, I just find it interesting.”We’ve created some of the most powerful people in history in terms of reach and mind controlTellingly perhaps, the company at the centre of A Better Paradise, Tyburn Industria, feels much more like a games studio than a social media mega-corp. Also, the lead protagonist is a writer who finds himself at the centre of the game’s development. Is there an element of autobiography here?“Yeah, of course – at that level,” says Houser. “But I also wanted to write about games and tech in a way that felt authentic. To lean slightly more into the games side in terms of the office environment was really easy for me. I know what it’s like to work in a games company obviously. I wanted to try and bring that to life in a way that felt real and to capture some of the micro dramas.”Having turned A Better Paradise into a novel, Houser’s Santa Monica studio is now working on an open-world video game version. He’s not saying how it will fit in with the podcast, just that Mark Tyburn and the AI at the heart of his game, NigelDave (a wildly intelligent program, fixated by humans but with no understanding of how they function), will both figure in the action.Also in development at the company’s second studio in San Rafael, is the Absurdaverse, a comedy universe populated by a menagerie of weird characters, from a skeletal warrior to an ageing hippy. The company is planning a series of animated TV shows and/or movies for the concept, but also another open world game, which Houser has described as, “a living sitcom”. Again, he’s vague on the details, but it looks to be a more story-driven take on The Sims, possibly utilising AI to create emergent narratives around the characters and their lives. “We’re trying to use the memories of NPCs in a fun way,” he says. “Just trying to make it a bit more alive. You’ll see when we talk about it more, but it is shaping up really well. It’s a completely gamey game – very mechanics driven. With both games, we’re trying to make them really strong on mechanics, really fun to play, accessible, but plenty of depth.”View image in fullscreen‘A living sitcom’ … Absurdaverse.Photograph: Absurd VenturesHouser is also planning a game around the company’s third IP, the comic book series American Caper, co-written with fellow Rockstar alumnus, Lazlow. With its cast of escaped convicts, crooked lawyers and Mexican beauty queens, it is perhaps the closest out of all his new projects toGrand Theft Auto. Which is perhaps why the interactive version is going in a different direction. “I’m not making an open-world game for that,” says Houser. “We’re actually looking at maybe doing more of a story game. We’re still kind of exploring it.”We talk a little bit about the current prevalence of forever games such as Minecraft, Fortnite and Roblox and how they’re sucking up a lot of the world’s playtime. But Houser is adamant that there’s still a vast audience for mature single-player narrative experiences – and that’s what he’s aiming at.‘Our industry has been strip-mined’: video game workers protest at The Game AwardsRead more“We’re trying to be ambitious, to make new stuff,” he says. “At some level [our projects] are traditional console games, accessible, but action-oriented story-driven open world console games – but then at the same time, we’re doing it a slightly different way or with slightly different subject matter. Three years ago we were watching one of those PlayStation showcases, and if you blinked and missed the credit sequences, you couldn’t tell where one game ended and the other began. Everything was sort of dark purple and about space ninjas. They were about this apocalypse or that apocalypse but always felt the same.”“That’s fine. Some of them are amazing games. But we were like, well, we’ve got limited money and we are starting from scratch. We have to have good stories and fun dialogue, and make sure our gameplay is amazing and accessible, and our art direction has to be fresh – at all points, it has to feel different. We have to make stuff where people go, ‘Well, I’ve never played a game aboutthat’, and then treat the audience, not just as gamers, but as human beings.”So he’s not worried about the industry’s current obsession with live-service multiplayer mega-games? “I still think there is enough of an audience who want new stuff and single player-led stuff,” he says. And then in his characteristically self-deprecating way he adds: “I hope so. Or we’re in a little bit of trouble.”Explore more on these topicsDan HouserGrand Theft AutoGamesinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It has now been lovingly restored – with a thrillingly bolstered libraryKaty HesselMon 15 Dec 2025 06.02 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 08.32 ESTShareIt is the place where Salvador Dalí painted The Enigma of Hitler, a haunting landscape featuring a giant telephone receiver that seems to be crying a tear over a cutout picture of the Fuhrer. Conceived in 1939, the work seems to anticipate war. It is also the place where Winston Churchill penned parts of his multi-volume A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, and painted its dappled-light view. Somerset Maugham would visit, too, as well as novelist Colette, composer Igor Stravinsky and playwright Jean Cocteau, partaking in lunches that lasted all day and night, with debates and discussions around artistic ideas.This place is La Pausa: the Mediterranean villa in the hills of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, once owned by husband-and-wife writing duo Charles Norris Williamson and Alice Muriel Williamson, followed by French fashion designer Gabrielle “Coco”Chanel, who had it rebuilt from scratch at the end of the 1920s. She later sold it to an American publishing couple, Emery and Wendy Reves.Sprawling yet monastic, the white-walled house – with blue shutters and black crittall windows clustered in groups of five in homage to Chanel’s No 5 – has just been restored to its original specification, after being bought back by the luxury fashion brand in 2015. Architect Peter Marino studied countless photographs to get it right: from the concrete squares that sit in a quilt-like grid atop the lawn, to the potted cacti at the foot of the staircase. Original bedframes were bought, too, as well as the installation of an entirely mirrored bathroom, not unlike the one at 31 Rue Cambon, Coco’s address in Paris.View image in fullscreenRevived … La Pausa, the Mediterranean villa in the hills of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, in 2025.Photograph: Jason Schmidt/ChanelBut when you’re restoring a place with such a rich past, how do you capture its spirit and honour its history, bringing to life the words and minds of its illustrious guests to create the most multi-layered portrait of all? Simple. You build a library.Bookshelves are, after all, a record of the knowledge, characters and ideas that have swirled around someone’s mind, reflecting their interests, desires, and – often in the case of artists or writers – their friends. Whenever I go to an artist’s studio, or visit someone’s house, I am always intrigued about what lives on their shelves – especially if the writers are no longer alive. It’s an intimate way to get to know someone. It deepens our understanding of them, gives us access to their interior worlds, takes us to places we didn’t know they’d been to.I remember visiting Alice Neel’s Manhattan apartment and seeing her many books on topics that ranged from socialism to psychoanalysis. And Leonora Carrington’s Mexico City home was filled with texts on Buddhism, magic, Celtic history, as well as books on loneliness.View image in fullscreen‘We believe the future is made with fragments of the past’ … La Pausa’s library after Peter Marino's restoration.Photograph: Jason Schmidt/ChanelBut what if someone’s library could continue to grow after they had gone? Had the residents of La Pausa lived on, what books would they continue to read, and how might we perceive them in the present day?This was the challenge set by Chanel during the restoration, aided by the specialist booksellers at Hatchards in London (where Coco’s lover, the Duke of Westminster, had an account) and 7L in Paris. Given a list of 100 books that Chanel was known to have cherished and read, the team set about choosing titles in line with her scholarship. But they also wanted to create a broader portrait of her friends and interests, and who and what passed through La Pausa. “And what has happened since, across music, architecture and fiction,” says Yana Peel, president of arts, culture and heritage at Chanel.Entering the wood-panelled library was like stepping into the minds and worlds of those who stood there before me. Adorning the shelves were biographies of Picasso by John Richardson, rare editions of Cecil Beaton’s Scrapbook, dust jackets designed by Vanessa Bell for her sister Virginia Woolf’s book, The Waves; plus first editions of those who frequented the French Riviera, such as F Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. There were also books by (or about) guests who visited the villa, from Somerset Maugham to Greta Garbo, as well as glimpses into their private worlds, with the bounded volumes of Jean Cocteau’s letters.View image in fullscreenSalvador Dalí at La Pausa in the 1930s.Photograph: Photo Wolfgang Vennemann/ Fundació Gala–Salvador Dalí/ADAGP, Paris“We believe the future is made with fragments of the past,” says Peel, which is why the library is also brought up to date with works by Hilary Mantel, Margaret Atwood, Zadie Smith and Rachel Cusk. To make it even more contemporary, says Peel, “as our guests come to visit, they will leave their own books”.Standing back and admiring the library as a whole, you sense a sprawling web of artists who worked, conversed, inspired and consumed each other’s works – directly and indirectly – across centuries. And at its centre was a woman who shaped, and is still shaping, culture today. But why would a library be important to her?Books were the very medium Coco harnessed to escape from her hard and humble beginnings. Aged 11, she was left parentless after her mother died of tuberculosis and her father abandoned his daughters at an orphanage run by Cistercian nuns at the abbey of Aubazine. Never with much money, she found canny ways to access books: “I read everything … We never bought books at home; we cut out the serial from the newspaper and we sewed together long sheets of yellow paper. That’s what little Coco lapped up in secret … I copied down whole passages from novels … [they] taught me about life.”View image in fullscreenCoco Chanel at La Pausa in 1938.Photograph: Roger Schall/ Schall CollectionBooks were a place of refuge, a conduit for Coco to dream about being the heroine in her own fabulous tale and imagine countless other lives for herself. One has to remember how difficult it would have been for her as a woman to build an empire from scratch, decades before women even got the vote in France. It would have required huge amounts of imagination and storytelling. As she said: “Books have been my best friends.”So when it came to restoring La Pausa, the library was to be its beating heart and pensive mind, the place that held everything together. In many ways, aren’t all of our bookshelves? They reflect back to us what we’ve done, learned, and have stored inside of us; who we’ve met (sometimes literally as well as imaginatively) and how we’ve escaped. As with Neel’s and Carrington’s, they reveal our curiosities, secrets and desires. Memory palaces housing our sprawling inner worlds, they can be the most intimate portraits of all. Take a look at your own bookshelves and ask: “What do they say about me?”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureChanelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Was Hollywood’s most annoying actor going to go for broke in what promised to be the most irritating film of all time? Well I am here to hold up my hand and say that first impressions couldn’t have been more wrong. Marty Supreme is one of the most exciting, indeed sensational films of the year, and if the Guardian film critics’ poll wasn’t a democracy, many of us would made it No 1 by some distance.For it turns out thatMarty Supremeis a character drama of quite remarkable richness, its excitement and sensation deriving from the nervous energy of its protagonist – who is indeed a ping pong player called Marty – but plying his trade in the decidedly non-quirky early 1950s where our hero, played by Chalamet, is essentially trying to use this non-traditional sport to plot a way out of the dullness and grind of his normie life, where he is on track to become a manager of a shoe store. Marty (whose last name is not actually Supreme, but the amusingly alliterative Mauser) is a pretty dislikable individual: happy to abandon a girl he gets pregnant, throw a fit when he loses a match, and think he can talk his way out of any kind of difficulty. But such is his verve, charisma and never-say-die attitude, he carries you with him.Key to his character, of course, is his Jewishness; he is a restless chaser of the American dream that has already been chronicled in a brilliant body of literature in the 1940s and 50s – What Makes Sammy Run, The Adventures of Augie March, Goodbye Columbus – and though it appears to have no literary antecedent other than a memoir by real life ping pong champion Marty “the Needle” Reisman, Marty Supreme has earned its place alongside these giants. Arguably the chef’s kiss of the whole situation is that “Marty Supreme” refers to the orange coloured ping pong ball that Mauser develops with his cousin that will supposedly be more visible to the players.Amazingly, Chalamet is absolutely mesmeric in the role, fully inhabiting the character of this bespectacled live wire as he bounces from shoe store to penthouse suite to basketball court (where he humiliatingly accepts a paying half-time gig with the Harlem Globetrotters). Director Josh Safdie (who co-wrote the script with regular collaborator Ronald Bronstein) has pulled off a string of frankly brilliant casting coups: TV presenter Kevin O’Leary as vindictive businessman Milton Rockwell, Abel Ferrara (yes, him) as a mobster whose missing dog Marty tries to find, Fran Drescher and Sandra Bernhard as Marty’s mother and aunt respectively, and – most brilliant of all – Gwyneth Paltrow as a movie star on the slide who tries to resuscitate her career with a stage production.I could go on for hours about this film’s riches, and perhaps your tolerance for it will depend on how much you buy into Chalamet as a scrappy Jewish hustler – but I bought it, big time. As I see it: all life is here.Explore more on these topicsFilmBest films UK 2025Marty SupremeTimothée ChalametfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It broke the record for highest-grossing documentary on Amazon’s Prime Video within 48 hours of its release, Deadlinereported this week.‘The public has been lied to’: secretly made documentary insists that aliens existRead moreBut not everyone is impressed by the film’s claims that UFOs – now called UAPs (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) – are real and that governments have been hiding evidence for decades. Several sceptics have gone online to push back at The Age of Disclosure, contending that it has been over-hyped and fails to present new or compelling evidence.In their telling, the documentary has slick production values but rehashes familiar, decades-old grainy infrared videos and anecdotal pilot testimonies insufficient to support extraordinary claims of alien technology.Michael Shermer,the founding publisher of Skeptic magazine, says by phone from Santa Barbara, California: “All we have are blurry photographs, grainy videos and anecdotes from people that say they know somebody who knows something, or they know somebody who said they saw the spaceship, touched the aliens or worked on back engineering the spaceships and so on.“But if you say, who was this person you talked to? ‘Well, I can’t tell you.’ Where was the spaceship? ‘I can’t tell you.’ Do you have any photographs? ‘No, but here’s this grainy video of this blob that was taken from a navy pilot 14 years ago off the coast of San Diego. This is kind of weird. It’s hard to say what it is but it could be aliens.’”Shermer, who for 30 years taught college and university courses in critical thinking and has written books including Why People Believe Weird Things, adds: “From a scientific point of view, none of this is valuable other than well, there might be something interesting here, let’s go find out. It’s no different from the whole search for Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Yeti, that whole thing.”Directed and produced by Dan Farah, The Age of Disclosure asserts an 80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligent life and secret recovery and reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial technology. It features interviews with 34 individuals from US government, military and intelligence backgrounds.They include secretary of state and national security adviser Marco Rubio, senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota and former director of national intelligence James Clapper. Their presence has been seen as giving the film heft and helping reduce the stigma long felt by alleged UAP witnesses.In an interview last week on Fox News, Rubio was asked about his claim in the documentary that unknown entities have been operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities. He did not attack the documentary or seek to disown his remarks – but he did seek to add some context.“First of all, I’m not disavowing that,” Rubio said. “It was an interview that was done almost, like, maybe three or four years ago when I was in the senate. So it wasn’t recent. The second point I would make, I was describing the allegations that people have come forward with … I was describing what people had said to me, not things that I had firsthand knowledge of in that regard. A little bit of selective editing, but it’s okay because you’re trying to sell a show there.”Sceptics argue that UAP sightings are better explained by a combination of misidentification of mundane objects (balloons, satellites, drones), perceptual errors in low-information environments, secret terrestrial technologies and misunderstood optical and sensor phenomena.Jason Colavito, author of The Cult of Alien Gods: HP Lovecraft and Extraterrestrial Pop Culture, comments:“While I can’t possibly give a single explanation for UFOs, or categorically say that no UFO has ever been an alien spaceship, every UFO that has ever been identified has turned out to be a prosaic – either natural or human made – object, and there’s no reason to suspect that any of the objects seen in that movie are anything but that.”Colavito was left cold by The Age of Disclosure. “I found the film to basically be anAncient Aliensepisode with better lighting,” he says. “It was a rehash of material that has been used many times before. I thought that it was old stuff in a slick new package. A lot of the people that you saw interviewed have already appeared on Ancient Aliens, on NewsNation and on other platforms saying the same thing.“The only surprising thing was that they actually went into some of the more extreme and ridiculous pseudoscientific claims they make about how we can’t photograph UFOs clearly because they’re in a space time quantum bubble that distorts all the light around them so we can’t see them. That’s obviously an ex post facto explanation. These are things that people who are very smart have fooled themselves into thinking are true in order to justify a belief that they already came into the process holding.”Colavito notes that the film has had an extensive and expensive publicity campaign including a Hollywood-style premiere. He sees it as part of a sophisticated media campaign aimed at securing government funding for defence contractors and associated thinktanks.View image in fullscreenA still from The Age of Disclosure.Photograph: YouTube“One of the things that surprised me is how much of the film seemed to be an advertisement for investing in UFO-themed energy research. That’s where you have to look into the question of how many of the talking heads in that documentary have government ties, not just that they formerly worked in the government, but that they are currently profiting from the work that they’re doing promoting UFOs.“Luis Elizondo[an author and UAP disclosure activist who also serves as an executive producer on the film], for example, works for adefence contracting company, or at least did until recently, and many of the others also have current or former ties to defence contractors and other businesses and entities that make money from government contracts and government investment.”But for all the headlines and TV attention, Colavito doubts that the buzz will last. “It’s already fading from coverage,” he says. “This was the kind of thing that has a big publicity campaign leading up to it but then, once people begin to see the actual product, interest falls off rapidly because there is nothing new and nothing convincing in the film. There are a lot of stories but very few facts.”Joshua Semeter, director of Boston University’s Center for Space Physics, has only seen the trailer for The Age of Disclosure and was unimpressed. “I guess the word is disappointed to see that their primary evidence is all of these grainy infrared videos.” he says. “There’s a lot of money to be made by keeping things in the spooky category. That’s basically what’s going on here.”Semeter, who served on a Nasa team studying the origin of UAPs, believes that the film is unlikely to create a lasting cultural shift or mainstream acceptance of its claims. Instead it is the culmination of a recent period of heightened interest in UAPs.“We went through a UAP bubble over the past eight years and a lot of this evidence that’s being put forth by the aviators is very old evidence from the 2000s. We’re at the tail end. This production was an effort to grab the last little bits as we head out of the current UAP bubble.”Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsAlien lifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

This time, we have Kami (Alícia Falcó), a confident, attractive cheerleader at her local high school with a huge following on social media, and an angry jock boyfriend who is none too pleased when her attention wanders towards a couple of handsome brothers who have just begun attending the school. Younger brother Thiago (Fernando Lindez) is in the same year as Kami, while the older Taylor (Diego Vidales) joins as a coach, and immediately begins behaving in a variety of ways inappropriate to his pastoral role. It quickly emerges that Kami and the brothers have some sort of dark and contentious history, hinted at in flashbacks and gradually revealed in full across the course of the run time.Coming off like a scrambled-together mix of the love-triangle elements of Twilight with the elite social milieu of The OC, much is made of the idea that Kami is attracted to both brothers, despite Thiago being a sweet lad who is clearly into Kami, and Taylor being someone who is constantly brooding and growling and treating everybody badly. It doesn’t really seem like all that tough of a choice, though the film runs hard with the idea that Taylor’s behaviour, which contains enough red flags to supply bunting to an entire village fete, is justified by the strength of his feelings. Hmm.It’s hard to feel super invested in which brother Kami will choose: she’ll pick either the nice one or the nasty one, and a more psychologically complex drama could no doubt invest the dilemma with more penetrating insights. And speaking of penetrating insights, the film’s attitude to sex proves something of a curate’s egg: it’s spicier than most American teen movies, but falls short of offering anything more than titillation. Multiple scenes (bratty cheerleader’s phone confiscated by strict coach, horny teens get carried away in sex-ed class, etc) play like porn-film scenarios, but then peter out. That wouldn’t matter much if the standard of the writing was higher, but most of the time, it isn’t.Tell Me Softly is on Prime Video from 12 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsFilm adaptationsSpainEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

She sensed him there,Tree like with raincoat shouldered, fine large looks,A four-armed god. From this sweet honeyed snareShe turned, upspraying, Marsh Tits, Finch and Rooks,Through brushwood hills, seeing by frosted brooksHis footprints: these she retraced like a brideWith loaves and wood returned to his keen side.Born in 1909 in Buenos Aires to parents of Australian-Welsh extraction,Lynette Robertsstudied art in London, and subsequently spent much of her life in Wales, where, in 1939, she married the writer and editorKeidrich Rhys. Acclaimed as a modernist, Roberts sustained her dialogue with formal traditions, Welsh and English, historical and literary, yet her work is always an adventure in language. Her two poetry collections were published by TS Eliot at Faber, Poems (1944) and Gods with Stainless Ears: A Heroic Poem (1951). In addition, she produced essays, stories, novels, verse-drama and autobiography.Instrumental in reviving the current interest in her work, Carcanet first published her Collected Poems in 2005. More recently, the press has issued an expanded edition of the full collection, titledA Letter to the Dead. It includes further previously uncollected and/or unpublished poems. Winter Walk is one of them.It may appear to be imaginatively rooted in the countryside around the village, Llanbyri, where Rhys and Robert lived, but a note in the manuscript records that it was written at Bell’s Wood, the wood in Hertfordshire where Roberts rented a caravan for a time, post-divorce. Winter Walk creates, above all, a visionary landscape, exceptionally bright, carefully detailed, sometimes surreal. It moves through a semi-mythical world, one of strikingly diverse ecological systems, experienced in powerful, sensory gusts by the protagonist on leaving “the hut and bright log fire at noon”.Roberts’s long lines of iambic pentameter ensure she has the space for her vivid scenes. She uses a mixture of simple and complex diction: both kinds, from the seen-as-new “crisp white winter snow” to the “red trees wet, adrift with icy flow” achieve different levels of impact. Contrast is further heightened and made mysterious by the introduction of the “bloodstone” in the last line of stanza one. The stone seems to have been enlarged and filled with the veiny flow of the landscape. It connects the “red trees” with life and death, the “blood” and “stone” which combine in the word as in the icy landscape.Vision intensifies in stanza two, with the “cut prints of glinting stylised forms / Of birds not seen …” These “prints” are larger-than-life – perhaps as deep and strange as life really is. The creatures that have left their marks, decipherable or otherwise by the human protagonist, are nocturnal foragers, now invisible, and the result is a wonderful explosion of visual magic. But Roberts continues building her narrative toward a sight still more arresting than these marvellous “prints” and “keltic scrolls”. Cross-stanza suspense results from the passive use of the verb in the last line (“another track was seen”), and more than suspense: an enhanced feeling that the landscape contains observers other than the human.“A slight right turn of foot” changes the angle again. “She sensed him there.” The figure is simply but compellingly described. He emerges as powerful, charismatic, complex: partly human, partly tree, and, as a “four-armed god”, resemblingVishnu. That the protagonist dearly wants to stay with him is suggested by the metaphor, “this sweet honeyed snare”, but, instead, she makes another turn. There’s a chaotic “upspraying” around the decision, a sensation of startled birds flying in all directions. But, like the page-boy in the carol about King Wenceslas, she places her own feet in the being’s miraculous footprints. The final couplet evokes a joyous coupledom, as if myth were blossoming into ideal reality – a forthcoming marriage, sealed in a winter’s dream with the luxury of “loaves and wood”. The word, “keen”, is beautifully judged: there’s a cutting edge to it, and the image of the bloodstone is perhaps, emotionally, not far away.Winter Walk was written in December 1950 and originally published in 1954, in Poetry (Chicago).

Kevin Killian, the poet obsessed with Kylie MinogueHe wrote poems named after Kylie songs and named his collection of erotic fiction after her indie album. He even loved the B-sides. So what did the avant garde writer find so inspiring about the mini Melbourne marvel?Michael CraggMon 15 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 01.02 ESTShareKevin Killian was obsessed with stars. Not in a metaphysical sense, like the grand lineage of poets that went before him, but the celebrity kind. Some were A-listers – he kept a vast database on Julia Roberts – and some more obscure. In 2000, taken by the work of cult literary sensation JT LeRoy, andconfusion about their identity, Killian gave public readings of their work in San Francisco, where he had lived for 20 years after moving from New York. He would also turn unknown poets into local celebrities, hosting poetry events and making rapturous introductions to crowds that were occasionally outnumbered by the people on stage. “Anyone he admired was an A-lister,” says poet and friend,Evan Kennedy, “especially unknown poets. He’d enthuse about someone, and I’d say ‘Who?’ Kevin engaged the Bay Area poetry scene like Warhol didhis Factory– but unlike Warhol, it wasn’t centred around him or his work.”Killian – a figure in San Francisco’sNew Narrativemovement, alongside writers such asKathy AckerandRobert Glück– saved his biggest celebrity obsession, however, for Kylie Minogue. She ran through his work like letters in a stick of rock. In 2008, he publishedAction Kylie, a poetry collection that included works named after Kylie songs (Slow, Spinning Around, Your Disco Needs You), and more abstract scenarios, such as the lovelorn An Audience with Kylie Minogue, in which lyrics from Fever intertwine with the mundanity of Love Hearts sweets. A year later, in 2009, Killian published Impossible Princess, an award-winning collection of gay erotic fiction named after Kylie’s misunderstood 1997 opus. She’d crop up elsewhere too, reflecting Killian’s bonafides as a proper fan. Tightrope, from 2014’s Tweaky Village collection, is named after a Kylie B-side, and highlights how “All her best songs saved as B-sides or just leaked on to the internet, where they live on as fan favourites”.View image in fullscreen‘Her glamour is more achievable.’ … Kylie Minogue performing in 2002.Photograph: JMEnternational/RedfernsThese poems and more appear inPadam Padam, a new collection of Killian’s work that pays obvious homage to Kylie’s 2023 hit of the same name. Released four years after Killian died of cancer aged 66, it was chosen as the perfect title by Kennedy and fellow poet Jason Morris, who would hear the song everywhere while they were editing the book. For most Americans, Kylie had slipped off the radar after her 2001 hit Can’t Get You Out of My Head, but “Kevin wouldn’t have called Padam Padam a comeback,” says Kennedy – “though it was to everyone dancing in San Francisco that summer.”An acclaimed editor and playwright as well as a poet, whom transgressive writer Dennis Cooper called “the greatest unsung genius in contemporary American literature”, Killian’s devotion to Kylie initially baffled Kennedy and Morris. “I couldn’t see why Kevin would spend his talents on her,” says Kennedy. But slowly he started to see a connection in the way both Kylie and Killian moved through their careers, and how they interacted with others. “Maybe the reason that his obsession was Kylie and not, say, Madonna or Simone Weil, is the same reason that Kevin settled inSan Francisco, as opposed to New York,” he says. “Kylie is scrappier and less polished. Her glamour is more achievable. Kylie reaches out to her fans.”Morris initially saw Kylie, and Killian’s parallel obsession with writing Amazon product reviews (later compiled in another posthumous book, 2024’s Selected Amazon Reviews), as a curious use of the “deeply charismatic”writer’s time. But Killian seemed to revel in the New Narrative movement’s collapsing of high and low culture, with his love for Kylie speaking to his identity as a gay man. (Killian’s “sexuality was practically off the queer end of the chart,” wrote his wife of 34 years,Dodie Bellamy, in 2000 – they had a fluid approach to sexuality).“In the North American media market, to love Kylie, you probably also have to be gay,” says writerKay Gabriel, who provides Padam Padam’s introduction. “In Kevin’s exhaustive detailing of Kylie’s career and collaborators, there’s a sense that this enthusiasm will yield something like a hidden truth. Maybe what he calls the ‘empty, spooky sigh at the heart’ of her work. All that said, he clearly revered enthusiasm on its own – he had a deep ecumenical respect for the adoring relationship that anybody has with their particular diva.”View image in fullscreen‘Deeply charismatic’ … Kevin Killian in 2011.Photograph: Andrew KenowerIn her introduction, Gabriel homes in on Killian’s use of “a third term between [his poetry] and its object”, a playful style she feels Killian, who disliked being over-intellectualised, would say he used simply because it’s fun. Whether writing about the Aids crisis in 1997via the prism of the horror films of Dario Argento, or exploring the human condition in drag as Kylie, this third term defined his best work. This framework, Gabriel says, was a way for Killian and his readers to engage with trickier experiences “by bouncing our ideas off of something else, something good to think with, something with a lot of captivating material”. A move a certain Padam Padam hitmaker, whose career has been about masking reality via the shiny world of pop, would surely recognise.Padam Padam: The Collected Poemsis out on 18 December published by Nightboat Books, £17.99Explore more on these topicsBooksPoetryKylie MinoguePop and rockSan FranciscofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Each is told with a compelling immediacy and intensity, and with the quality of returning to a memory.In the story Reindeer a man is seeking a bear, which has been woken by hunger from hibernation and is now raiding livestock from the farms of a small isolated community. “There was no true sunshine. There was no gleam in the snow, but the lateness of the left daylight put a cold faint blue through the slopes.” The story’s world is one in which skill, endurance, even stubbornness might be insufficient to succeed, but are just enough to persist.Jones’s austere world of rural settings is a working countryside of risk, hard labour and isolation.In an interview in the Los Angeles Review of BooksJones said: “Much rural fiction I’ve read by contemporary writers often feels quite fake, written from the point of view of a visitor, rather than a native.” His powers of noticing are native yet neutral, bringing precise, vivid life to his stories without dictating moral responses to the reader. Jones makes the reader see and feel the scene: the “happy shock” of the just-fed lamb in Cow, or in the same story: “The calf’s upward-facing eye opened. A dark globe endlessly deep in the pure white surround.”The home in the title story is besieged by high winds and heavy rain: the storm of fate that might batter any familyIn Cow, Jones takes a collision of emergencies on a farm, culminating in the labour of a cow, and makes of them an atmospheric, near-mythic drama. “With the clap of the car doors, a cloud of starlings lifted off the adjacent pasture. As they scarfed away, the ground, with all the wet going through it, seemed to flitter with the sound of their wings.” He inhabits the fleetingness of our human moment in the larger scale of nature and time, while illuminating and latently asserting the essential value of our struggles with the physical world, each other and ourselves.In White Squares a man has received a court order judging that he should have no contact with his son. “He was angry actuallyatthe court – the physical object of it itself, as a person can be angry with a low doorframe they walk their own head into.” His wife had testified: “He never does anything, he never gets anything done.” He decides he is going to fix it so that his son will win the annual river duck race, having been humiliated the previous year. “Some people always win things. Other people never win anything.” “You can’t rely on luck,” the father observes, and the story shows that you can’t necessarily rely on action either.These stories are spaced out in very short paragraphs, many of only one sentence, and these often of just a few words. It is a device that in less skilful hands might produce a false reaching after of poetic effect; here it brings a physical rhythm that generates a maximum of force, presence and meaning. Drama arises from the freshness of witness and the flawless placing of action in the narrative.The home in the title story is besieged by high winds and heavy rain: the storm of fate that might batter any family. The residents are unprepared for the once-in-20-years assault by tempest that now comes every year. The husband bought sealant but failed to apply it to the cabin boards in time, so that water leaks into the house. He was complacent about the pines growing close to the power lines, counting on the cypress trees to block them should they fall. His wife is more insistent about the dangers and he too knows, observing: “There’s just so much force now, in the weather.”Pulse is a story about how connected living things are: trees, people, families, communities. A tree surgeon tells the couple that when one tree in a stand falls the rest are sure to follow, and the husband remembers his grandparents and how they died within weeks of each other. He thinks: “It’s the ground. We just have to hope that the ground holds.” The book as a whole makes a strong case for the centrality of the short story to the reading of fiction, and the reading of fiction as a place and a practice where sense and empathy can flourish.Pulse by Cynan Jones is published by Granta (£14.99).

Charles Monteith could tell from the dog-eared typescript that it had done the rounds, and a reader for Faber called it “absurd and uninteresting … Rubbish and dull. Pointless.” But Monteith, young and new to the job, could see the book’s potential, and suggested ways that Golding – then a Salisbury-based schoolmaster in his early 40s – might improve it. More radically cut and revised than Monteith expected, the novel became a school syllabus classic. Thus began an author-editor friendship that lasted 40 years.Their early exchanges by post were formal in the extreme: it took two years for Dear Monteith, Dear Golding to become Dear Charles, Dear Bill. But as provincial grammar school boys who both read English at Oxford, the two were attuned to each other. And after the rescue act performed on his first novel, Golding remained humbly grateful for whatever help he could get: “I’m in your hands as usual. I’ve no particular feeling of possession over the book.” Monteith’s touch was gentle for the next few years: enthusiastic, even effusive, he reassured Golding that his drafts of The Inheritors and Free Fall were the finished product. With later novels, such as The Spire and Rites of Passage, editorial feedback was tougher and more extensive. But there were no fallings out. “I’ve always had a feeling of you there, present but not breathing down my neck!” Golding said. He never seriously considered moving to another publishing house.Anxious that his work wasn’t up to scratch, he disparaged the drafts he sent inNot that he stopped worrying, whether about writing too few books (“I realise what an unsatisfactory contributor to your list I am”) or selling too few copies (“universally admired, but unread”) or, when success came, getting too rich (“your accounts dept keep sending usincrediblequantities of money”, “Am I being contaminated with commercialism”?). Anxious that his work wasn’t up to scratch, he disparaged the drafts he sent in: “this sanguinary mess”, “load of cod’s wollop”, “I seem to have written the whole thing with one arm tied behind my back”. In his draft of Free Fall he used the words “fuck” and “fucking”. Monteith didn’t object (“the silly little genteelism of f-k would, in the context, look foolish”) but pointed out that the Book Society might do so, which would damage sales. Golding relented: in the published novel “fucking liar” becomes “sodding liar”.Over time, with invitations to lecture abroad, film rights sold and two academic co-authors (“heavenly twins”) critically acclaiming him, his confidence grew. In the US he was “spoilt, lionised, made much of, entertained pleasantly to death” in an atmosphere of “pernicious Anglophilia”. Back home he was awarded a CBE, which made him feel “at once proud and shy like a girl with illegitimate triplets”. Conscious of the risks of over-praise, he accused himself of vanity and fretted about becoming “a bit embalmed if not mummified”. But rReviews terrified him (“how incredibly dependent I find myself on praise or blame – quite revoltingly so”) and he made sure to be out of the country on publication day, “when the various hatchets fall”. He hated being interviewed and turned down most approaches.Although they frequently met as friends, Monteith had his work cut out to keep up his author’s spirits, as did the other Faber colleagues to whom these letters, excellently annotated by Tim Kendall, were also sent. Book titles were a nightmare. Till Faber lit on Lord of the Flies, Golding gave it the tedious title Strangers from Within and for what became The Spire he half-jokingly suggested An Erection at Barchester. Though Monteith’s tone was desperate not to offend, he pushed to see new work and speed it along. He’d a dream early run, till Golding hit a mid-patch when, distracted by travel, lecture tours and heavy drinking, he couldn’t write fiction. Then came the triumphant late phase that includes his sea trilogy. Golding dismissed the first instalment, Rites of Passage, as a “load of old rope” but it won the Booker prize.The author’s heavy drinking isn’t much mentioned in the letters, nor his son’s mental health problems, two sailing catastrophes, his wife Ann’s mastectomy and the Nobel prize. Nor are the agonies he suffered when Monteith was slow (as long as a week!) at getting back to him about new work he’d sent in: “My heart is not so much in my boots as down below them and buried” goes one journal entry, quoted here in the introduction. It’s a close and rewarding friendship (“There is a way in which I am as a writer at least partly your creation,” he tells Monteith) but the letters aren’t as intimate as his journal. Towards the end, when he’s writing to other editors, including Matthew Evans and John Bodley, they’re shorter and more businesslike. All credit to Faber’s loyalty in bringing out a book that, at 600 pages, can’t hope to reach a wide market. You just wish for a little more malicious wit and deadly gossip among the to-and-fro of correspondence.Monteith was also the publisher of Larkin, Hughes and Heaney, and his work in bringing Lord of the Flies into being is on a par with Maxwell Perkins’s on The Great Gatsby, Edward Garnett’s on Sons and Lovers and Ezra Pound’s on The Waste Land. In later years, Kendall points out, he would travel down to Cornwall to stay with Golding for several days, editing his work over bottles of wine; even when retired, he kept up the role of mentor and enabler. The book reveals the minutiae of the job: the coaxing, contracts, deadlines and prizes. It’s good to see all the quirks too, such as Golding’s complaints about being pestered by schoolboys who claim that Piggy’s spectacles in Lord of the Flies could not have been used to make fire, or his discomfort about a publicity photo in Vogue, reproduced with other photos here, that “makes me look as though I were seated in a police station trying ingratiatingly to explain away my possession of a packet of dirty postcards”. It’s a lost publishing world – boozy lunches and dinners rather than rushed sandwiches at a desk; scrawled letters rather than emails – but fascinating all the same.William Golding: The Faber Letters edited by Tim Kendall is published by Faber (£60).

They will know that the rivalry between supercilious director Chris and bombastic actor Robert, fond of essaying the classics in the nude, will result in crazed feats of sabotage when the production gets under way. And they can be sure that dim-witted Dennis, who thinks he is auditioning for the role of “Frog Cratchit” after seeing the Muppets’ musical as research, will well and truly cook everyone’s goose.“We’re not muppets are we?” disparages Chris, before one blissfully silly routine after another proves otherwise. How to choose even a favourite ghost from all these mix-ups? There’s the inexhaustibly hilarious Henry Lewis, as Robert, playing the Ghost of Christmas Present wearing a giant gift-wrapped box. Or Nancy Zamit, as Annie, zanily gyrating – with limbs launched in all directions – in the role of the Ghost of Christmas Past. And when Trevor (Chris Leask) performs as the Ghost of Christmas Future – or the one who, ahem, hasn’t come yet – it’s a tricky piece of physical comedy done inside a 10ft tall costume. Some of Roberto Surace’s outfits are as outlandishly amusing as Libby Todd’s set designs.View image in fullscreenComedic harmony … Jonathan Sayer, Sasha Frost and Nancy Zamit in Christmas Carol Goes Wrong.Photograph: Mark SeniorAmong Mischief’s other old hands are Jonathan Sayer who returns as Dennis and co-writes, with Lewis and Henry Shields, a script that goes in different directions to their 2017 BBC TV comedy of the same name. Greg Tannahill is given a nice in-joke that his last leading role (in Peter Pan Goes Wrong, also done for TV and stage) has left him with such a fear of heights he needs to avoid the upper register when singing.

Without the dismemberment and murder and purple carpets.” Lifschitz is talking about his latest production forCirca, the acclaimed Australian contemporary circus group. Is it a Greek epic? A state-of-the-nation drama? A searing emotional journey? Nope, none of those. It’s a fun, family circus show based on that cheeky cartoon character Shaun the Sheep.You might not think the antics of an anthropomorphic flock of farm animals can be compared to Aeschylus, but Lifschitz sees characters bound together as family with different personalities, friends and enemies, having to work out how to live together. Shaun the Sheep has been a huge success since the character originated in Wallace & Gromit: A Close Shave in 1995. The stop-motion series launched in 2007 has been broadcast in more than 50 countries, and had multiple spin-offs including two feature films and another one in the pipeline.A scene where a sheep shears herself like a stripper was dialled back because it was too sexyStill, a kids’ cartoon is not obvious subject matter for Circa, who over the last 20 years have become known for highly skilled, atmospheric shows, a “stripped back and edgy” aesthetic, as Lifschitz puts it. They do awe-inspiring acrobatics with a classy choreographic sensibility – at this year’s Edinburgh festival, for example, they performed in Gluck’s opera Orpheus and Eurydice, to much acclaim.But when artistic director Lifschitz caught wind of the possibility of working with Shaun the Sheep creators Aardman Animations, something about it made sense. “We found we were like-minded spirits,” he says, over video call from Australia. “We’re people that are a bit left of centre. They’re from Bristol, we’re from Brisbane, and they both have a similar offbeat weirdness about them,” he says. “They were a little company that could, and did. And we’re a little company that could. And did.”Lifschitz has made shows for children before, an audience he thinks is not always well served. “I think a lot of theatre for children is frankly pretty bad,” he says. “It’s got a bow around it; it tells nice stories that end really beautifully and in no way reflect the real world.” You’re not going to find much tragedy in Shaun the Sheep, but Lifschitz loves the mischief and anarchy of it, the characterful flock at Mossy Bottom Farm, plus sheepdog Bitzer, and the antagonist gang of pigs, who get up to various high jinks, all the time pulling the wool over the farmer’s eyes. “It’s no different to Kafka in some ways: the absurdity and the rules of being in a society,” he says.Anyone who’s seen the cartoon will know that there’s a lot of physical humour in it already, the sheep balancing on each other’s shoulders, attempting daring escapes, catapulting one another over fences, that sort of thing. So there was plenty to work with. Lifschitz and his team got deeply into the animated series. He shows me a spreadsheet with every episode listed, hundreds of them, and good jokes and scenarios pulled out. They have turned that into a full-length show, the first half like a series of episodes, the second a more full-blown circus performance. It uses some clips from the TV series, alongside impressive tumbling, juggling and aerial skills. In the 80-minute show, the mood is a bit dreamier than a tight seven-minute episode, but it has plenty of gags.Making this show was the first time Circa had dealt with the licensing and IP of a well-known brand, and all the specifications that go with it. An example: each sheep character has their distinctively googly eyes on the headpiece of their costume. “There are 48 eyes, and each one of them gets individually approved for size and position of the pupil,” says Lifschitz. “Which is brilliant, you know, because they care about their work.” But it did mean there were some “robust” conversations, he says. (A scene where a sheep shears herself like a stripper was dialled back because it was too sexy.) Aardman care about rigour in their storytelling, which Lifschitz admits, “is not really my thing”. Lifschitz’s work is generally more abstract. “I think circus can get away with a lot of looseness, because the show is pretty exciting as a default setting,” he says.He’s tackled narrative before, but found himself watching things in “double focus”. “I was trying to convince myself that I believed this was about Peter Pan, or climate change or whatever, as I was watching someone do something skilful and cool, and I thought, ‘Couldn’t we just build our art from “skilful and cool”?’ I had this kind of Heideggerian phenomenological experience,” he says. “I just want the actual experience, the feeling of this thing, not what it’s ‘about’.”On this show, however, Lifschitz appreciated how exacting Aardman were about the art of storytelling. “They were punctilious in how things were set up and explained in a way I didn’t need,” he says. “But it was a really good lesson for me that dramaturgical rigour can be a good thing.” So there you go: Greek drama, Kafka and rigorous dramaturgy. And you thought it was just a funny cartoon about a clever young sheep.Shaun the Sheep’s Circus Show is at Aviva Studios, Manchester, until 4 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsStageCircusCircaDanceTheatreChildren's theatreChristmas showsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Since 1945, this waif with no mother or father has rarely been out of the bestseller lists and continues to inspire musicals and movies. Heyday Films, the outfit behind Paddington and James Bond, is now developing an English-language adaptation of her stories.What isn’t generally known outside her native Sweden are the circumstances in which author Astrid Lindgren created Pippi during the darkest period of the second world war, under the shadow of Hitler and Stalin.“After I have worked so many years making the film, I am totally clear that Pippi is a child of the war. She never would have existed if there were not these terrible times,” Wilfried Hauke, the veteran German director behind new docudrama A World Gone Mad – The War Diaries of Astrid Lindgren (which will have its international premiere early next year) tells me.View image in fullscreen‘She asked interesting child questions’ … a drawing seen in A World Gone Mad – The War Diaries of Astrid Lindgren.His film features three generations of the Lindgren family – the author’s daughter,Karin Nyman, granddaughter, Annika Lindgren, and great-grandson, Johan Palmberg. It also has reconstructions in which leading Swedish stage actor Sofia Pekkari plays the author but her executors have made sure that every word she utters is taken exactly from what Lindgren actually wrote or said.In 1939, Lindgren was living a quiet middle-class life in Stockholm. She was a housewife in her early 30s with two young children. Her husband, Sture, had a well-paid job at the Swedish National Association of Motorists, and didn’t spend much time at home.Sweden may have been one of the few European nations to remain politically neutral during the second world war, but Lindgren was an ardent anti-Nazi and a news junkie. She scoured the papers, looking for accounts of the war, which she cut out and stuck in her notebooks. An excellent typist, she soon landed a secret wartime job at the postal control centre, steaming open and reading private and military letters.From her letter reading, Lindgren realised that Jews were being sent to death camps. In the diaries she started keeping in this period, she frequently referred to the plight of wartime refugees.Like many Swedes, Lindgren had grown up with a reverence for German literature, culture and philosophy – but now she was vetting private correspondence detailing Nazi atrocities. In May 1941, she writes that she has learned that 1,000 Jews a day are being “forcibly transported to Poland in the most shocking conditions … it is apparently Hitler’s intention to make Poland into one big ghetto where the poor Jews are to perish from hunger and squalor.”“As long as you’re only reading about it in the paper you can sort of avoid believing it but when you read it in a letter … it suddenly brings it home, quite terrifyingly,” she added.View image in fullscreenAstrid Lindgren, 1977.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesHauke says: “You can see that the diary became more and more emotional. She felt this was now the beginning of the end of this old idea of European culture.”Lindgren’s diaries consisted of 17 small handwritten schoolbooks. These were discovered in the Stockholm flat in which the author spent much of her life – and were published in 2015, more than a decade after her death. Hauke sees them as the forerunner to her children’s stories, which would not have existed without them.The name “Pippi Longstocking” was coined by the author’s daughter, Karin. Lindgren invented tales about the character to distract Karin during her frequent wartime illnesses. Then, in 1944, when she hurt her ankle after a fall and was bedridden for three weeks, she began to work in earnest on writing and editing the first Pippi stories.The creation of Pippi Longstocking was her way of dealing with the darkness seeping into her life. Her marriage was breaking down. Sture, she discovered, was seeing another woman and wanted a divorce. This was the “landslide that engulfed her existence”.View image in fullscreenKarin Nyman next to her mother’s desk in 2015.Photograph: Jessica Gow/AFP/Getty Images“But then she felt she had something of her own which was her writing. This made her strong again and helped her go through this crisis,” Hauke suggests.One of her obsessions even then was children’s education – how, as the film-maker puts it, kids could be brought up “not to be psychopaths like Hitler or authoritarians, dictators and so on”. Bringing Pippi to life was part of this mission. The film-maker believes that “there was a lot of herself” in the character. Like her most famous fictional creation, she was a free-thinking individualist with endless resources of resilience and humour.View image in fullscreenFree-thinking, kind … Inger Nilsson as Pippi in the 1968 film version.Photograph: Jacob Forsell/AFP/Getty ImagesLindgren’s great-grandson, Johan Palmberg, rights manager at the family company Astrid Lindgren Aktiebolag, was 11 years old when the author died aged 94 in 2002. He has very fond memories of her and tells me he still marvels at her instinctive way of communicating with children.“She was very unique in that sense. It’s related to the reason why she was such a good children’s book author. She had this ability to go back in her own way to what things felt like as a child – and she could communicate with children on their own terms. She didn’t ask boring grownup questions. She asked interesting child questions.”He believes that Pippi’s commercial appeal in 1945 lay in her cheery individualism. “The world had been in this terrible situation for many years and she comes as this fresh breath of air. She’s the antidote to the authoritarian regimes of Germany and the Soviets. She has all these characteristics of independence, free-thinking and kindness which is the antithesis to the Nazi ideology.”Pippi’s 80th anniversary is now being marked with all the fanfare you might expect. “We’ve had birthday parties all year, more or less, and I think we are going to keep celebrating her because she is such an important character, especially with the world looking how it does,” the author’s great-grandson states. “Her independence, kindness and generosity are needed more than ever.”A World Gone Mad – The War Diaries of Astrid Lindgren is streaming on SVT in Sweden until 18 December, in German cinemas from 22 January and showing at theCopenhagen international documentary festival CPH:DOX from 13 to 22 MarchExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsDocumentary filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ahead of its festive special, the stars open up about the show’s poignant comebackLibby BrooksMon 15 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 06.40 ESTShareWhen taxi drivers in London started shouting punchlines at him – that’s when Jonathan Watson knew that Two Doors Down, the BBC Scotland sitcom set in a Glasgow suburb, had gone from slow-burn to blazing.The yelling is appropriate in itself, since Watson’s character, Colin, is congenitally unfiltered. Whether it’s telling his neighbours they needn’t worry about a spate of burglaries because “nobody’ll target your place – they’ll want stuff they can actually sell”, or sharing the secrets of his Tinder success: “You have a chat: ‘How are you? I just put on a wash,’ and the next thing she’s in my bed, well more on top of it with a towel down …”Created by Gregor Sharp and the lateSimon Carlyle, Two Doors Down hops between living rooms on the fictional Latimer Crescent, where a mismatched group of neighbours can’t seem to resist popping in on each other again and again and again. Now, the cast returns for a one-off Christmas special where Beth and Eric cause consternation when they put up their Christmas tree earlier than usual, prompting demands for bespoke mince pies and a heated debate about the song Fairytale of New York.View image in fullscreenIt must be Christmas … Weir and Norton in the Christmas special.Photograph: Graeme Hunter/BBC Studios ScotlandHaving completed seven series, most recently for BBC One, this month’s Christmas special comes just after the announcement that the show willtransfer to the stagenext year, playing 10 showsat the 12,000-seater Glasgow Hydro. It’s testament to the appeal of a show where, at a cursory glance, very little happens.The show’s moral centre – even if she doesn’t want to be – is Beth. Along with her husband Eric, their hospitality is most regularly abused by neighbours such as Colin and Cathy – his eye-wateringly competitive, tipple-chasing wife (played byDoon Mackichan) who puts the petty into bourgeois. Or miserabilist Christine, who outstays her welcome while trading sofa-bound micro-aggressions.Beth is played byArabella Weir, who can communicate anger, discomfort or desperation in the lift of an eyebrow or twitch of a lip. “Simon and Gregor did something so hard,” she says, “to write comedy that is relatable and real. Writing ordinary people who don’t do weird things – it’s really difficult to make that work.”Watson agrees: “The characters are so clearly defined that you can be anywhere in the UK and you can identify with them. Everybody knows a Cathy, a Christine, a Colin. And that’s all down to the writing.”View image in fullscreenParty hard … the neighboours celebrate in series six of Two Doors Down, 2023.Photograph: Anne Binckebanck/BBC StudiosEven though cabbies love to shout out the show’s punchlines, they are just one part of its appeal. With acute observations and finely tuned performances, it’s as far from boom-tish delivery as can be. A classic one-room comedy in the tradition of The Royle Family, the storylines are reassuringly mundane; an entire episode can be based round the purchase of an extra-large box of doughnuts. But the drama is layered through with warmth and recognition. Moments of tenderness sit alongside the outrageous rudeness.What’s glaringly apparent is that Two Doors down is now comfortably ensconced in the nation’s hearts. But how did it get there?“Nobody’s more surprised than me,” says Alex Norton, who plays Eric. “It was supposed to be a one-off, but the script was really fresh and unusual and it seemed to go really well. Next thing was the phone call saying: ‘Would you be interested in doing the series?’”The pilot aired on Hogmanay in 2013 and was commissioned, but the first series only began three years later, on BBC Two. “It began to grow and grow,” Watson recalls, as subsequent series were commissioned.“And then Covid hit,” he says, “and all of a sudden younger folk discovered it on iPlayer, so our audience really expanded.”The booming fanbase was clearly recognised by BBC bosses, and the show moved to BBC One for its seventh series in 2023. (Let’s take a second to appreciate how rare it is for a series to be recommissioned six-plus times.)Both the writing and the filming of the show are rooted in collaboration, explains Sharp: “It’s never felt like overnight success and the process of making the show has remained exactly the same.”By sticking with many of the same cast and crew since the early days, the team have developed a shorthand for working together: “They understand what the world of the show is and what we’re looking to achieve.”Speaking to cast members on set in Glasgow for the Christmas special, the sheer heft of comic – and dramatic – experience in the studio is clear. Cast CVs range from the work of Bill Forsyth, Chris Morris and Michael Winterbottom through landmark shows including Naked Video, The Fast Show, Smack the Pony, Rab C Nesbitt, Still Game and Prince Andrew: The Musical. But what’s also evident from the warm greetings and easy chat is how well the ensemble gel. Currently tThey all plan to appear on stage next September. And when Carlyle died in August 2023 at the age of 48, just weeks after filming on the seventh series concluded, it was a tragedy that is still deeply felt.View image in fullscreenTwo Doors Down co-creator Simon Carlyle.Photograph: BBC“When Simon passed away it was such a loss, and emotionally the thought of walking back on that set without him was just awful,” says Elaine C Smith, who plays Christine, always ready with a dire warning or suspect consumer tip (“You know who does a good paracetamol? Morrisons.”) Both this Christmas special and next year’s live show will be “a farewell and a thank you” to Carlyle, she adds.“As Elaine said, we’re honouring the memory,” says Norton. “I don’t believe in a lot of superstitious nonsense, but I feel his presence [on set]. I think he’d like it because the script is very good and it does honour his legacy.”“We all feel his absence,” says Sharp, who had to develop an entirely new writing process for the show,having spent yearssitting at the same laptop with his writing partner, sharing life stories and “feeling like pulling your brain inside out, trying to solve the puzzles of an episode”.The challenge of writing alone, and while grieving, must have been immense. “Every idea and every line in the script I would filter it through a sense of ‘Is this true to the show’? And as long as you’re being true to the show, then you’re being true to Simon.”Two Doors Down isn’t clunkily issue-based, nor does it exist in some sitcom limbo. Instead, it gently navigates the quotidian politics of family, friendships and generations with an unassuming radicalism.Take the women – the absolute precision of Carlyle and Sharp’s writing combined with the mighty talents of Weir, Mackichan and Smith mean that characters who might in other hands be monstrous are allowed their shadow side, be that Cathy’s inability to have children or Christine’s loneliness.“Here are three women over 50 who you don’t see on television without them being caricatured, and acting one of them is unbelievably joyful and liberating,” says Weir.“The women could easily be the doormat, the whinge and the alcoholic,” says Mackichan. “But the writing is brilliant and we just have to constantly find ways to thread in vulnerability and softness.”She is struck by how many people claim to have a Cathy in their own lives – and see beyond her outrageous behaviour. “There’s one Christmas episode when I’d been drinking way too much, Beth finally mentioned it, and then I got really upset. If she didn’t have that vulnerability, she wouldn’t be as funny. That’s where true humour is: when it’s dark but it’s real.”View image in fullscreenThe way we were … Doon Mackichan as Cathy, Elaine C Smith as Christine, Joy McAvoy as Michelle and Arabella Weir as Beth, the cast in series five, 2022.Photograph: Alan Peebles/BBC StudiosSmith recalls the “incredibly detailed notes” the cast were given during the early series, which emphasised the importance of “not pushing it”. Two Doors Down, she says, is not so much a comedy of action as one of reaction.“They’ve got to be believable. Christine is a monster but she’s not cartoonish. There’s a vulnerability and loneliness: she’s got no one and no life while pretending that she does.” She mentions another festive episode, when Christine is left alone in a coffee shop contemplating an empty Christmas Day. “People were in tears on the set.”The show applies the same gentle curiosity to queer relationships. Eric and Beth’s son Ian, played by Jamie Quinn, is gay and his long-term boyfriend Gordon is played by standup Kieran Hodgson. “We tend not to have major breakthroughs in the show,” Hodgson says, “but year after year, the members of the street – who might not interact with queer culture that much – are given this little window through Ian and Gordon and are slowly coming to a very robust acceptance of it all.”While Gordon spends more time than he might like dodging Cathy’s salacious overtures, his partnership with Ian is comfortably humdrum. “I really enjoy their lack of aspirational sexiness,” says Hodgson. “Often gay people are portrayed as being far too exciting, too dramatic in their lives. Ian and Gordon are just people up the road who happen to have that romantic element in their life, but beyond that they’re actually quite dull.” He beams. “That’s the final liberation.”Two Doors Down Christmas Special is on BBC One on Christmas Eve at 10pm.This article was amended on 15 December 2025. A previous version said that Two Doors Down was playing “three nights” at Glasgow’s Hydro arena in 2026. In fact, there are 10 shows scheduled over six days.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Or, to put it more accurately, all the straight women who have developed a crush on her when she’s dressed as a second world war naval intelligence officer and speaking in a silly voice. But is it really Hodgson these woman have fallen for? Or is it Ewen Montagu, the bombastic, braces-wearing war hero she plays in the hit musical Operation Mincemeat?“The confusion is real,” says Hodgson. “These women come to the show believing themselves to be straight, then they have a total identity crisis. But hey – if that’s not what musical theatre is for, I don’t know what is!”If a fan now asks us to sign their arm, we have to ask: ‘Is this going to be a tattoo?’Challenging the sexuality of audience members is not the only thing that testifies to the power of Operation Mincemeat. Since it was first performed in 2019, the show has grown from quirky fringe comedy into an unadulterated smash hit both in the West End (sold out for three years and counting) and on Broadway (now on its fifth extension). It has garnered rave reviews and counts Robert De Niro, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Colin Firth, Samuel L Jackson, Steven Spielberg and Queen Camilla among its fans. One “Mincefluencer” (as superfans are called) loves it so much, they have been to see it a staggering 201 times at the time of writing.Next year, this heartwarming British success story will reach another milestone – embarking on a world tour, travelling to China, Australia and Mexico, as well as up and down the UK. And how it all happened is, well, a bit of a miracle. Because while Operation Mincemeat is undoubtedly brilliant, hilarious, moving and astonishing, sometimes all in the space of one dance routine, the story it’s based on doesn’t exactly scream: “Hit stage musical!”View image in fullscreenThe stickler and the maverick … real-life heroes Charles Cholmondeley, left, and Ewen Montagu transport the body in 1943.Photograph: Pictorial Press/AlamyThe actual Operation Mincemeat – which also inspired a much more traditional type of war thriller film in 2021 – was a crack piece of second world war deception. MI5 took the body of homeless Welsh labourer Glyndwr Michael, who had died after eating rat poison, gave him a new name (Major William Martin), armed him with fake plans about an allied invasion of Sardinia and Greece (Sicily was the real target), and deposited his uniformed body on a beach in Huelva, Spain, hoping it would reach German spies.When I meet SpitLip – AKA Hodgson, David Cumming, Zoë Roberts and composer Felix Hagan – I don’t need to ask how they turned such unlikely material into comedy: these old friends from Warwick University have such a warm, buzzy energy, they could make any story funny. Cumming remembers the show’s first writing sessions, when they were so poor they would be “literally cycling on Tash’s mum’s old exercise bike to keep warm because we couldn’t afford heating!”“All our friends were getting mortgages and having babies and we were existing on Pret sandwiches and anxiety attacks,” says Hodgson. “Pret sandwiches?” says Cumming. “More like Tesco!”It even has a rap about the Third Reich: ‘Goosestep to the left, jump to the far right!’After reading everything they could on Operation Mincemeat, the group realised the opportunities were enormous. The Man Who Never Was, the 1953 book by the operation’s co-leader, Montagu, gave the impression that, at least for some of Britain’s top brass, the second world war could be quite fun, chaps. Then there was the dynamic between Montagu and the true brains of the operation, Charles Cholmondeley. The latter’s shy, nerdy persona and adherence to the rulebook offered a perfect contrast to Montagu’s swashbuckling disregard.This didn’t just have to be a story about war, they realised. It could be a topical satire on Britain’s public school elites as well. As opening number Born to Lead puts it: “For fortune favours bravery / And a fortune’s what I’ve got!” There was also room to explore grief, longing and feminism, with jokes about a newt’s penis and a rap about the Third Reich. “Goosestep to the left, jump to the far right!”Weaving all of this into three hours of song and dance was, of course, challenging. “We’d think, ‘Maybe this verse isn’t as exciting as it could be’,” says Hagan, “but then realise that, because we’d changed it, the entire play now cancels itself out. So we’d have to start all over again.”View image in fullscreenStarting small … Operation Mincemeat at the 80-seat New Diorama theatre, London.Photograph: Alex Harvey-BrownWhen it came to performing the show, luxuries such as a director, producer or choreographer were clearly out of the question. In fact, they didn’t even have a rehearsal mirror – Roberts remembers practising one dance routine in the reflection of a framed poster on Cumming’s kitchen wall. Casting was done over Twitter: Jak Malone and Claire-Marie Hall were recruited, which meant that – alongside Hodgson, Roberts and Cumming – they had five actors. The only problem was that their script had, um, 82 characters.No problem – they’d just take dozens of roles each! Gendered casting went out the window. “Our main rule was, ‘Who is doing it the funniest?’” says Roberts. “Who’s doing the silliest voice? Who will look the stupidest in the wig?”They soon realised that swapping a character’s gender helped in interesting ways. “Montagu,” says Roberts, “is such an amazing combination of the terrible, terrible things about men at the top of the food chain, but also all of the brilliant things as well – the charisma, the gung-ho energy. We realised that if we cast a guy for that role, it would be hard to get people on his side. But by casting a woman [Hodgson], we get to poke fun.”The same applied to Malone’s portrayal of Hester Leggatt, the demanding, matronly woman who runs a tight ship as head of the secretaries. The real-life Leggatt was tasked with writing a letter to Martin, supposedly from his fiancee, that was placed in his pocket. The musical draws on lines from the actual letter for Dear Bill, a tearjerker about wartime separation. Malone would go on to win a Tony and Olivier for his showstopping performance.Consequently, the show acquired a “quietly queer” subtext, delighting (and evidently confusing) audiences along the way. A strong bond between cast and fans formed as the musical started to take off. After successful runs at small and very small venues, the show made its West End debut, taking over fromThe Womanin Black at the Fortunetheatre.The fandom intensified.“We’ve learned from the West End run,” says Cumming, “that if someone asks you to sign their arm you must ask, ‘Is this going to be a tattoo?’” “That way we know to write it nicely,” says Roberts, “and spell it correctly.” “My favourite,” says Hodgson, “was being sent some fan fiction set in ‘70s Week’ of The Great British Bake Off, Charles is trying to get his upside-down pineapple cake right when Monty joins him at midnight in the tent and … sex occurs.”Well, there’s the idea for your next musical!View image in fullscreenMuch more traditional war thriller … Colin Firth in the 2021 film.Photograph: Giles Keyte/Courtesy of See-Saw Films“It brings families closer together,” continues Hodgson. “We’ve had letters from people saying, ‘Me and my dad weren’t really connecting. Then we went to see the show – and now we’ve planned a trip to Huelva.’”The most astounding act of fandom, however, came when keen musical-goers tracked down Leggatt. For various reasons, including a misspelling on MI5 files, this woman who played such a decisive role in the war had gone unrecognised. Then, in 2023, Leggatt’s great-nephew Will received an email from a mincefluencer and all the dots were swiftly joined. A book, Finding Hester, followed and now the Fortune theatre has a plaque in Leggatt’s honour.“That was just amazing,” says Hodgson. “History inspiring art inspiring history.”Cumming: “By far the craziest thing the fans have done.”Hagan: “They had to speak to MI5!”“And then,” says Cumming, “they were able to let the family members know, like, ‘This was your auntie!’”Hearteningly, the cast have met relatives of the characters they portray. Hodgson evenhangs outwith descendants of Montagu. What on earth do they think of her, er, somewhat mixed portrayal? “They love it!” says Hodgson. “Bafflingly!” adds Cumming. “They’ve even given me one of his hats,” says Hodgson. “They were like, ‘You’re one of the family now.’ They’re just so proud of the story. And also, they have a great sense of humour, as you would imagine, from descendants of this man.”View image in fullscreen‘We make them cartoony but capture their essence’ … the cast in full flight.Photograph: Matt Crockett“We were always very aware that these are real people,” says Cumming. “We can’t just lie about what they did. We can make them cartoony. But we can’t change who they were in their soul. And I think we’ve captured their essence – which is why the family members haven’t sued us!”As the fanbase grew, so the musical shape-shifted. During Boris Johnson’s premiership, the writers found themselves adding in references “to whatever mad shit he’d said that day” which kept things fresh. “Then,” says Roberts with a laugh, “people started saying to us, ‘You know, there are over 50 people working on this now. You can’t just keep changing things.”“It’s really quite incredible that we are on Broadway but our script still says things like, ‘Hester enters somehow’,” says Hodgson. “Huge apologies to our directors and our actors.”The line about fascists winning gets a hmmm in London and a roar in New YorkBack when they were rehearsing using a poster for reflections, it’s safe to say no members of SpitLip were thinking of Mincemeat making it to Broadway. So when it happened earlier this year they went along, relocating to New York to perform there. Some critics wondered if American audiences would get the very British humour – but that proved unfounded.“In fact,” says Hodgson, “we have a line that is basically, ‘If people like us just blindly follow orders, then the fascists won’t need to bash down the door. They’ll have already won.’ InLondon, the audiences go, ‘Hmmm.’ Whereas in New York, there are huge roars of applause.”Snappily ever after: Sondheim’s fairytale musical Into the Woods – in picturesRead moreMoving to America did, of course, mean they had to recruit a whole new West End cast of mini versions of themselves. “That’s what we call them!” says Hodgson. This brought its own challenges. “You’ve got to make sure that these people can completely transform into 30 characters,” says Roberts. “The audition pack we send out to these poor people is huge, because they could be an amazing Jean Leslie [the talented young woman from the secretarial department], but if they can’t transform into an 80-year-old man in Huelva, clowning around with a phone, then it won’t work.”Christian Andrews, who has played various Operation Mincemeat parts during the West End run, can attest to this. “It was quite scary,” he says. “The clownier roles felt very much in my wheelhouse, but the quiet Hester stuff really challenged me. It was nice to be able to work that out for myself.”Performing night after night is, inevitably, exhausting. Ideas for a new show are “sort of percolating”, says Roberts, and at some point they will need to turn to those. But whatever happens with the Mincemeat juggernaut, the existing shows, the UK tour and the global expansion, she believes SpitLip will remain essentially unchanged. “We’ll always be these four nerds with a box of hats and a dream,” she says, “putting on a little show for people and hoping it goes well.”Show and tour detailsExplore more on these topicsMusicalsTheatreLondonSecond world warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These dress up the sad paper beautifully and can be reused, even ironed if necessary. Sometimes I decorate the paper using paints, stickers or marker pens.”View image in fullscreenThe bags of joy ‘come out every Christmas’.Photograph: Hannah/The GuardianReaderHannahsays her homemade fabric gift bags are not only eco-friendly, but also “the fastest way to wrap anything – pop the gift in the bag, pull the ribbon and job done!” She made them more than 10 years ago, and “they come out every Christmas”.AndSue Sunderlandhas a handy tip for making gift tags. “I take crimping shears and cut out portions of cards from previous years. It may be a donkey, a robin, a Christmas tree, whatever, and then I use a punch to make a hole and thread through some ribbons,” she said.Reducing wasteView image in fullscreenYou’d be crackers not to try napkin crackers.Photograph: Tamsin Lewis/The Guardian“I made Christmas cracker napkins to avoid single-use crackers or napkins,”Tamsin Lewistold us. Meanwhile,Paulinehas a delicious and savvy way to reduce food waste: “I put all the leftovers from the Christmas dinner (including sprouts, stuffing, cranberry sauce and lots of gravy) in a large pie dish. When it’s cool I cover it and put it in the freezer. Sometime in February or March I defrost it and cover with a pastry top. It’s absolutely delicious.”To reduce the impact of gift-buying,Maxinesays, “All children get book tokens for £12, and I haunt charity shops during the year.” Another reader said they make everyone in their family a box of treats they know they like. “Not a pre-designed hamper – containing things they might not like, and usually in a basket that will not get used – but a collection of what we’re sure will not be wasted.”And finally,Sue Collinssays to reduce waste at Christmas: “It’s simple. Don’t spend at all.” Her friends and relations have decided to ditch the “senseless gift-giving ideology … without the shopping for presents burden, I look forward to celebrating simple get-togethers with my friends.

You don’t have to be related to Hudson to consider her a joyous proposition – a great performer who hasn’t yet made a great film. It was a quarter-century ago in Almost Famous, her breakthrough picture, that she first proved she could hoist a movie out of the doldrums while making the task appear as effortless as blow-drying her hair. Without her performance as Penny Lane, the rock’n’roll muse who describes herself as a “band-aid” rather than a groupie, Cameron Crowe’s dopey valentine to the 1970s of his youth would have been Almost Forgettable.Her vitality propelled that film, and her face alone drove its marketing campaign, so it was only right that Hudson, then just 21, received an Oscar nomination. The years that followed brought a confetti-like flurry of romcoms, including How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and Bride Wars, both smash hits despite their mood of seething bitterness. There were overlooked dramatic gambles (The Killer Inside Me, The Reluctant Fundamentalist), maximum-cringe misfires (the cancer weepie A Little Bit of Heaven, Sia’scrass autism drama Music) and the odd effervescent comeback, includingGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, in which Hudson was superb as a dim-bulb fashion designer prone to facepalm moments.View image in fullscreenUnderdog story … Hugh Jackman as Mike and Kate Hudson as Claire in Song Sung Blue.Photograph: Focus FeaturesNow 46, she has just received a Golden Globe nomination and likely has another Oscar nomination on the way. Once again, it is for a movie steeped in music: Song Sung Blue, a real-life underdogs’ love story based on the 2008 documentary of the same name. Hudson is Claire Sardina, AKA Thunder, who forms a Neil Diamond tribute outfit with her husband, Mike (Hugh Jackman), the Lightning part of the duo. The opening half, in which Claire meets Mike and pushes their collaboration from musical to romantic, is pleasantly nutty. The remainder has more tragic twists than a doom-laden country and western standard. Through it all, Hudson is a beacon of resilience, humanity and tenderness.Dressed all in black today, with straight, glossy blond hair, she is relaxed, if easily distracted. “Should I eat this if it was already open?” she wonders aloud, inspecting the sachet that came with her tea. “Do you think someone did something to this?” She tips the contents into the cup all the same. “Cut to the end of the interview and I’m, like, on the floor…”Hudson also has one eye on what she and her son are doing later this evening. “We’re going to see Radiohead. I’m so excited!” The last time she saw them live, she was Ryder’s age: it was October 2000, Almost Famous had just opened in the US, and the Oxfordshire avant-gardists were the musical guests on Saturday Night Live, which she was hosting. Hudson threw off her clothes to reveal the words “Radiohead is here” daubed on her bikini-clad body along with flowers and peace symbols. To the sound of frantically groovy music, she bopped and shimmied while the camera zoomed in and out at high speed.View image in fullscreen‘It’s awesome that I was conceived in London’ … Goldie Hawn with son Oliver Hudson and daughter Kate at Heathrow in 1982.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesThe entire spectacle was a reference to Rowan and Martin’s Laugh-In, the giddy late-1960s comedy show that made a star of her mother, Goldie Hawn, who was typically seen cavorting in swimwear and body paint. That SNL moment was also an early acknowledgment, as if any were needed, that Hudson would have her work cut out trying to escape her mother’s shadow.Hawn is an invisible presence in this London hotel room. It is her 80th birthday, and Hudson is missing the celebrations back home in favour of promoting Song Sung Blue. At least she can feel symbolically close to her mother by being in the city where it all began. “It’s so awesome that I was conceived in London,” she says, ignoring the teatime rain clattering against the window. Conception occurred in Regent’s Park, about a mile from where we are sitting. “Notinthe actual park. That would have been a way cooler story. It was in an apartment my mom was renting. I bet she’ll remember which one.”Her parents – Hawn was married to the musician Bill Hudson – split when she was 18 months old and her brother Oliver was four. Their stepfather, the actor Kurt Russell, whom their mother has been with for more than 40 years, is the man they call “Pa”. Asked last year about her relationship with her biological father, who blasted her as “spoiled” in his memoir but was largely absent from her life, Hudson said: “I don’t really have one.” She then modified her statement: “It’s warming up.”Music has been the connective tissue throughout her life and work. Bill Hudson was a member of the Hudson Brothers, who spent much of the 1970s as teen idols signed to Elton John’s record label. Hawn released a country-tinged album, Goldie, in 1972. All three of Hudson’s children have musician dads: Ryder’s father, and Hudson’s first and only husband so far, is the Black Crowes singer, Chris Robinson; she had her second son Bingham, who is 14, with Matt Bellamy of Muse; and her current fiance, Danny Fujikawa, formerly of the LA band Chief, is the father of her daughter Rani, who is seven.Hudson has sung on screen plenty of times before, including a boozy duet with Matthew McConaughey of Carly Simon’s You’re So Vain in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, and the showstopping sequence in Nine in which she belts out Cinema Italiano while trooping up and down a catwalk in silver boots. “WHY hasn’t a musical been written for Kate Hudson?” demanded one YouTube commenter, not unreasonably.Song Sung Blue is different. The Neil Diamond numbers are all wrapped up in Hudson’s performance: she’s singing in character, expressing Sardina’s pain, yearning and indefatigability through music. “In the studio, I’d find these harmonies myself and do my own vocal riffs,” she says proudly. The director, Craig Brewer, encouraged her. “I’d be saying, ‘But Craig, is it really Claire?’ And he’d go, ‘It is now!’” That latitude may not have been possible had she modelled herself too closely on the real Sardina, whom she only met when shooting was under way. “By that point, my version of Claire was in my body. But it was good to have her there to ask, ‘Did this bitreallyhappen like this?’”View image in fullscreenWith Anne Hathaway in Bride Wars, 2009.Photograph: Pictorial Press/AlamyHudson’s singing in the film has more authentic gusto than anything heard on her own rent-a-rocker debut album, Glorious, released last year. It was while promoting the album on US television that she caught Hugh Jackman’s eye. “Hugh saw me being interviewed, where I’m talking about how I simplyhadto be singing and writing music, and he was like: ‘Well, she obviously needs to be Claire.’” You can see his point. It’s the urge to perform that sustains Sardina as fate dishes out one flabbergasting blow after another. “I understand what it’s like to love something so much that you can’t face losing it,” says Hudson.She might not have recorded Glorious in the first place if it weren’t for Paul McCartney. “It was Paul’s 80th birthday and I was sitting at the side of the stage watching him headline Glastonbury.” The story ends in an epiphany. “I woke up the next morning and felt so emotional. I was, like, ‘I amnothappy with my output!’ I mean, I have so much gratitude. But I am not just an actor. I’ve been a musician my whole life and I never had the courage to do anything with it. I decided I want to take more chances. I want to fail more.” Perhaps she won’t be too hurt, then, that the Times described Glorious as “the very essence of a vanity project”.Watching McCartney made her think “about those who compromise and those who don’t. I thought about being a woman in the industry and all the compromising you do for other people. About doing comedies and being successful in them but still feeling like you’re constantly having to compromise.”Not that she’s dissing romcoms. “You know what? They’re my favourite. I love them and I will never stop making them. I just think they need to be better. When you’re trying to make a great one, you’re fighting a lot of algorithms. I think they’ve dumbed down the romcom. The ones I loved were written and directed by the best talent. Nora Ephron, Jim [James L] Brooks: those are the great ones that last for ever. They’re like comfort blankets.”View image in fullscreen‘I didn’t get into acting to only do one thing’ … Hudson in The Killer Inside Me, 2010.Photograph: Album/AlamyOther films are more like hair shirts. Take The Killer Inside Me, a necessarily repulsive adaptation of Jim Thompson’s noir novel about a psychopathic deputy sheriff, played by Hudson’s old pal Casey Affleck. It was Affleck and the picture’s British director, Michael Winterbottom, who persuaded her to take the role of the killer’s fiance, who is shown being spanked. For real, as she confirmed in 2010: “There were a couple [of slaps] in there when I thought: God, Casey! He got a bit of power behind it.” Before being murdered by him, she is spat on and punched in the stomach.It’s a contentious filmbut hardly the work of a compromiser.“That stretched different muscles,” she says now. “I didn’t get into acting to only do one thing.” Affleck intimated at the time that his then wife was no fan of the film. What feedback did Hudson receive? “Oh, it was fine. It was such a small movie.” Meaning, presumably, that no one saw it anyway. I tell her I admire it, but I never want to watch it again. “That’s how I felt,” she says.She claims not to pay any attention to what is said about her, good or bad. “It all falls into the category of what Kurt calls ‘noise’. His thing is always: just do great work.” Presumably, that goes for all the Oscar chatter, too. “That’snicenoise,” she concedes. I ask how often she has been checking Variety magazine’s regularly updated Oscar predictions. Should I get them up for her on my phone? “No, don’t!” she squeals in horror. “It freaks me out. I can’t even.” I refrain from telling her that Jessie Buckley is the current favourite totake the prize for Hamnet. Where Buckley’s performance as Shakespeare’s wife, grieving the death of their young son, is studied and self-consciously elemental, Hudson’s work in Song Sung Blue has an undemonstrative fluidity. It feels like life, rather than acting.Nomination or not, she has plenty to keep her busy, including Sibling Revelry, the family-dynamics podcast she co-hosts with her brother Oliver. Guests have ranged from A-list (Michelle Obama and the occasional Kardashian) to niche, such as the “psychic medium” John Edward. He was credulously indulged across two hour-long episodes, egged on by Hawn, who is no stranger to psychics; and Oliver, a garrulous sometime actor who claims to consult oracles before choosing whether to accept a role. Let’s just say this doesn’t reflect well on the oracles.View image in fullscreen‘Just do great work’ … Hudson and Hugh Jackman in Song Sung Blue.Photograph: Focus FeaturesHudson is not quite so woo-woo. “Psychic readings are fun,” she says. “But I take them with a grain of salt.” On a recent episode, the siblings were diagnosed with ADHD live on air by a doctor who didn’t seem entirely sure who he was speaking to; at one point, he mistook Oliver for Hudson’s partner. Was it an official diagnosis? “Oh yeah, it was real.” She says she found it “validating. I’ve spent for ever trying to figure out how to organise my life and now I feel I have the tools.” She distinguishes their diagnosis from what she calls the general ADHD of the world: “the kind that’s due to phones. What we have is the real deal.”Her next goal for the podcast is to quiz more directors. Turning the tables on me, she asks: “What kind of interviews do you like best? Who’s been your favourite?” Then a comical flutter of the eyelashes. “Apart from me, obviously.” But the experience of being interviewed by Hudson is over before it has begun. Time’s up, and Radiohead are waiting. As for her career: here’s hoping for more alarms and more surprises, please.Song Sung Blue is in UK cinemas from 1 JanuaryThis article was amended on 15 December 2025.

But leaving her a voice note every day has increased my productivity, and deepened our friendshipHannah MarriottMon 15 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTShareWhen my friend Rosamund suggested we try a productivity technique of leaving each other a voice note every day, I immediately said yes – even if I suspected, deep down, that we might not keep it up for long. I was circumspect because we both lead busy lives, 3,500 miles apart. She lives in London and I’m based in Brooklyn. It is hard to keep in touch sometimes. Even talking on the phone feels tough, what with the time difference and our schedules. Adding another thing to do every day, even a small, two-minute task, felt like a challenge.The technique is simple enough. You send a friend a voice note in the morning saying what you “did” that day. You always speak in the past tense for accountability. The theory is that once you tell a friend you have “done” something, you will be more likely to follow it through.There is a manifesting element, too. Because, while making the recordings, we are also talking to ourselves. As a freelance journalist who works from home I’ve told Rosamund that I “went” for a walk even though I was on deadline, and felt so much better afterwards, and that I “wrote” a complex feature efficiently, without changing the intro 17 times. Once I have verbalised such saintly behaviours, I have discovered that I’m more likely to carry them out.View image in fullscreenHannah Marriott’s children, out and about in New York City.Photograph: Courtesy of Hannah MarriottWhat has surprised me is that, for six months, it has stuck. For me, the technique works much better than a traditional to-do list, because I am forced to consider what is possible to achieve in one day before I express that to another human. It also encourages me to stick to my goals. When I explain each “completed” task with a few words about why I “made” the time, I remind myself why I should. I’ve sent messages saying that I “took” my kids for a walk even though it was freezing because I know how important exercise is. And that I “did” an interview and “found” a charming way to ask an awkward question. More often than not, I later get those tasks done.For us, the technique has another big benefit: we get to keep in touch about the small, boring stuff. Because when you emigrate, as I did in 2022, you tend to miss out on your friends’ micro-news. Now I know all about Rosamund’s daily life. The new cafe on her street where she goes to work; the yoga class she really likes. Her excitement at taking her preteen son to the cinema in the evening, for the first time.

They’ve made us a bit healthier, a bit more productive. I now go to a weekly pilates class without fail and meditate more, having explained to Rosamund, so many times by this point, why I “went”. I have found myself completing complex tasks far more efficiently, having boasted about doing just that in my morning voice note.It has proved quietly, modestly, life-changing.

My family, bar one sweet-toothed aunt, avoids dried fruit-based offerings, so classic Christmas cakes and puddings are a hard no. Over the years, I have tried variations on yule logs, pavlovas and sherry trifles, but the biggest crowdpleaser is easily sticky toffee pudding (or something along those lines). This year, I’m making this warming, simple but decadent pear, sticky ginger and pecan pudding, which feels festive and fancy, and can happily make an appearance whenever.Pear, sticky ginger and pecan puddingThis can be made the day before and reheated before serving. Feel free to serve it with your favourite brandy butter or cream for maximum festiveness.Prep10 minCook1 hrServes8-102 pears(about 275g)185g room-temperature unsalted butter375g light muscovado sugar3 large eggs2 tbsp honey225g self-raising flour75g ground almonds1 tsp baking powder1 tsp mixed spice½ tsp fine sea salt150ml whole milk4 ballsstem ginger, finely chopped50g pecans, roughly chopped300ml double cream1 tsp vanilla extractFlaky sea salt(optional)Creme fraiche or vanilla ice-cream, to serveHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and grease a 30cm x 20cm roasting tin. Peel the pears, cut them into quarters, and remove and discard the cores. Finely chop the fruit into 1cm pieces.In a large bowl or free-standing mixer, beat 110g butter with 200g sugar for two minutes, until pale and creamy, then beat in the eggs and honey.In a second bowl, mix the self-raising flour, ground almonds, baking powder, mixed spice and fine sea salt, then fold this and the milk into the butter mix. Fold in the chopped pears and stem ginger, then pour into the greased tin. Scatter the pecans over the top, then bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a skewer inserted comes out clean. Remove and leave to cool slightly.Meanwhile, put the remaining 75g butter in a small saucepan with the remaining 175g sugar, the double cream and vanilla. Bring to a boil over a medium heat, leave to simmer for a few minutes, then take off the heat and stir in a pinch of flaky sea salt, if you like.I like to serve squares of the warm cake drenched in the hot caramel sauce with a spoonful of something cold and creamy to cut through, ideally creme fraiche or a good vanilla ice-cream.Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkDessertFoodFruitChristmasCakeNuts and seedsrecipesShareReuse this content"

But what about the recipients who are experiencing ‘voice note fatigue’?Mon 15 Dec 2025 11.15 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 12.32 ESTShareName:Voice notes.Age:About 14.Appearance:Everywhere, all at once.I think you’ll find people have been leaving each other messages for decades.That’s voicemail. This is different.How is it different?A voicemail is a response to someone not answering their phone; essentially a plea for you to call them back.I’m never going to call them back.Exactly. A voice note, on the other hand, is an audio recording you post to someone in lieu of a text message.It doesn’t sound that different.Here’s the main difference: voicemail is dead, voice notes are hugely popular.Really?And also hugely unpopular.Quite a paradox you’ve set up.In a survey earlier this year for Sky Mobile, 73% of respondents said they loved recording voice notes, while a new poll suggests that Britons now send an average of 58 hours’ worth of voice notes each per year.Sounds like the best loved form of communication ever devised.Except people hate getting them – 62% of recipients admit to suffering from “voice note fatigue”.Why?The new poll found people typically send six voice notes every day, each lasting about 95 seconds.Ninety five seconds? That’s a bit of an imposition on the listener, isn’t it?One in 20 respondents said they had received a voice note longer than 10 minutes.That’s not a voice note; that’s an audition monologue.There does seem to be something about the medium that encourages prolixity.Perhaps there’s no established etiquette yet.According to Debrett’s, the authority on etiquette, voice notes should be under two minutes. “Think about what you’re going to say before you press ‘record’ and stick to your subject.”Funny, I don’t even know how to send a voice note.Just press the little microphone button to the right of the text window.I didn’t say I wanted to know how.It’s a bit of a gen Z thing – voice notes are said to be a symptom of that generation’s rising narcissism and general fear of interaction.Huh, typical.The poll was commissioned by Heineken as part of a campaign aimed at getting people to swap the exchange of voice notes with in-person, one-to-one communication.Whoa, let’s not be too hasty.Most people, after all, are seeking some kind of human connection.Speak for yourself. I just want to be left alone. What’s in it for Heineken?Real life meetings provide opportunities for people to drink beer.Do say:“Just wanted you to know I’m thinking of you, while simultaneously not wishing to speak to you.”Don’t say:“Chapter 3, in which I find myself on a crowded platform awaiting the 17.54 train to Derby, currently expected at 18.03.

Your mother, you said, was distressed because she was unable to make her daily calls to her 91-year-old sister.TalkTalk told me that the problems began in August 2024, when your father requested an upgrade to a full-fibre data-only package, which does not include a landline. Your father, who has Parkinson’s, has no memory of applying for the upgrade, andTalkTalkadmitted that the loss of a landline may not have been made clear enough.Because of a “technical error”, the landline service was only terminated in August, 12 months late. TalkTalk, energised by media attention, managed to restore the landline with a new number three days after my contact. It promised to retrieve the original number and offered £100 in apology. That was early October.Instead, three weeks later, the line cut out again. A customer service agent claimed your parents would have to cancel the latest contract – which includes both landline and internet – and take out yet another one. This, it turned out, would scupper any chance of getting their old number back.Back I went to TalkTalk, which discovered that it had, for reasons unknown, requested a disconnection of the newly restored line. Once again it reconnected the line and upped its goodwill offer to £150.By now it was early November. Within three days the line had cut out and your parents were told they’d exceeded their credit limit. They don’t have a credit limit.You, meanwhile, found they had been charged £75 for calls during the weeks they were without a landline. This time TalkTalk blamed the mistake on its previous errors, the sum total of which had got everyone confused and your parents cut off again.TalkTalk once again restored the line and the number and upped its contrition to £200. And so far, it’s working. “We understand how crucial a landline service can be, and we’re disappointed that our usual processes weren’t followed,” a spokesperson said.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

Try to stay in the room, and in the moment. You’ll be glad you didMoya SarnerMon 15 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTShareThis is my last column for you. I am shocked and delighted that I’ve been allowed to carry on for almost two years, saying such controversial and true things as: theoedipal complex is realand all of us have one;psychodynamic psychotherapyis an effective and vital mental health treatment and we must fight for it in the NHS; andMidnight Run is the best film of all time. It has been a joy and an honour, and, now we are here, I’ve been thinking about the significance of endings.Because they are significant. Sometimes, having no time left can make it possible to feel and say what was impossible before. They can invite an intimacy and truthfulness and grief that some find overwhelming. It’s not unusual for patients to talk of dropping out, or to skip the final session – to call it a waste of time, to want to leave the room before the end.But the ending is one of the most crucial experiences of good psychotherapy; an opportunity to suffer the loss and to mourn. A chance to feel the disappointment and rage of wishes not granted and needs met and unmet. To put into words the true feelings of abandonment and gratitude and not knowing and despair that come with the ending of something that has been important, that we want to hold on to. When we have been struggling with these feelings since infancy, spending our adulthood unconsciously killing them off with addictions or repeating them in dissatisfying relationship dynamics or scrolling them away, a therapy ending offers different possibilities. When you skip the end, you rob yourself. I know all this – but I also understand that wish to leave the room.My father died when my daughter was nine weeks old. I’ve been wondering if I would write a column about this, but I’ve always shied away from doing so. Now, perhaps because it is my last, I’m ready.My psychoanalyst spoke the reality that everyone could see apart from me, because I couldn’t bear to turn towards itIn hospital, when we knew he didn’t have long, my dad told me that he was sorry for wasting everyone’s time. It was an electric moment for me. I said we mustn’t waste this time. That what I had learned through writing my book, about growing up over the course of a lifetime, was that this very last chapter of his might well be one of the most meaningful. That we were extremely fortunate to have this time and that he needed to think about how he wanted to use it, the conversations he needed to have.The reason we were able to have this talk, the reason I was able to be by his bedside, was because of something my psychoanalyst said. I didn’t want to go to the hospital. I just wanted to be at home with my baby, feeding, changing nappies, napping. I didn’t want to leave the house – never mind for a ward where infants were not allowed. But my psychoanalyst spoke the reality that everyone could see apart from me, because I couldn’t bear to turn towards it: “Your father is dying.” It was unbearable until it was said, and it was what I needed to hear to get in the room.After that, it was possible, somehow, for my dad’s bed to be wheeled out of the ward, where babies were not allowed, into the courtyard, where I could take my newborn to be with her grandfather. She wailed, he sang to her. He made his last phone calls. I fed her on a bench next to his bed. The sun shone and the air was cool and fresh, dappled shadow on his blankets. We didn’t say much; it was a different kind of conversation. This memory is painful and beautiful and it is one of my most treasured moments with my dad. It was a gift.We were lucky; my dad had a good death. He had moved to a hospice and I was standing by his bed with my daughter and my mother and our rabbi. As the rabbi spoke her soft prayers, the familiar Hebrew words seemed to calm my father’s harsh breathing to a gentle, easy rhythm, and to lull my girl to sleep in my arms. I knew that death was near, and fear blew into my mind: “Is it going to harm my child, to be so close to death so early in her life? Should I leave the room?”Gratitude can be truly healing – but you need more than a checklistRead moreIn response, I felt a deep emotional understanding that I think had grown inside me through years of desperately running from my feelings, followed by years spent recognising this in psychoanalysis. The understanding was: no, it won’t harm her or me, this is happening to all of us, now, and we need to stay in the room. I knew this was going to be a peaceful death, an important moment in our lives, and that being present might shape her in profound ways that we would never know. I didn’t need to protect her from this ending or the feelings that came with it – it would all become a part of her – and of me.Staying in that room helped me to realise that as difficult a start to motherhood as this has been, it is mine. My ending – and my beginning. This is what I needed to write in my final column, and I’m only able to do so because I know my time is limited and I want to say what matters most. Don’t leave the room. That is why I keep fighting for sustained psychodynamic psychotherapy in the NHS. Because I know it can help us to stay in the room, whether that room is a psychotherapy consulting room, or your mind, or your own life.This series was calledHow to build a better life, but I think what I have been writing about, which is also what I’ve been learning as a patient in psychoanalysis, and as a psychotherapist to patients, and through losing my dad and becoming a mother and through writing for you, is not so much how to build a better life. It’s about how to truly come alive in the life we’re in, so that our time will not be wasted.Moya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and the author ofWhen I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of AdulthoodDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Butviewing 3D scansthat show how people’s feet look while standing in their shoes changed his mind completely.He took two scans of a person’s feet – one barefoot and one in high heels – and the difference was striking. In the high heels, the toes were crowded together, the big toe showed a bunion, and the smaller toes were clawed, gripping for balance.Try doing simple daily foot exercises, such as picking up objects with your toes, to keep the feet flexible and the muscles strong“You can imagine that after a few hours your feet ache, and once you take the shoes off, your toes go back to normal,” he says. “But if you wear heels eight hours a day, every day, for years, things start to stick in that position.” Over time, the strain causes stretching of soft tissues, bunions, hammer toes – where the toes remain clawed – and, eventually, wear-and-tear arthritis.Is it true that … you get shorter as you get older?Read moreAll shoes, Goldberg says, influence foot shape to some degree, gradually steering the toes closer together and narrowing the foot profile. Tight or pointed shoes make this worse, and many people wear shoes that are too small for them.If you’re a high-heel wearer, Goldberg recommends doing simple daily foot exercises, such as picking up objects with your toes or walking around barefoot on your tiptoes for a minute, to keep the feet flexible and the muscles strong.Ultimately, he says, moderation is key: “If you wear heels for a dinner party, no problem. But don’t wear them all day, every day. The pain that you get at the end of an evening wearing heels is no wonder, because you’re causing a lot of stress to your poor foot.”Explore more on these topicsFashionIs it true that …Women's shoesHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not escapingforChristmas, but avoiding it altogether – the stressful buildup, consumer chaos, panic buying, the enforced jollity and parties. When the first festive gifts start appearing in the shops in September, it’s time to confirm my travel plans, ideally to include New Year’s Eve as well.Sometimes I travel independently, but more often in a group, and while it’s not always possible to avoid the tinsel and baubles – even in non-Christian countries thousands of miles away – I just relish not being at home at this time of year.It’s not that I crave a week in the sun, although the Canaries or Madeira always appeal. My favourite Spanish city of Granada is a regular escape for Christmas, for despite the surprisingly cold temperatures compared with the Costa del Sol, the skies are always a dazzling blue, so I never tire of a stroll up to the Alhambra. I always stay high up in the Albaicín, the old Moorish quarter, where a walk along the winding, narrow, cobbled streets feels as it might have during the middle ages. I like the fact that even on Christmas Eve the squares are full of locals eating and drinking, wrapped up well in blankets and coats. The Spanish do love eating outside in all weathers.View image in fullscreenGranada in Andalucía, Spain, is a particular winter favourite for Kitty.Photograph: Allard Schager/AlamyNor is it a case of bah humbug! I still send 80-plus Christmas cards by post and enjoy buying gifts for family and friends. When my parents were alive, I would always travel over to see them in Northern Ireland just before or just after the festivities. But everything changed in 1990 when my brother Brian, whose birthday was on Christmas Day, tragically died aged 45 the month before. Getting away appealed more than ever.In Myanmar, after Aung San Suu Kyi had been released and encouraged tourism, I came down for breakfast on Christmas Day to find the receptionists wearing Santa hatsOver the years I’ve had some very memorable times. Travelling with a group of friends in Myanmar, after Aung San Suu Kyi had been released and encouraged tourism, I came down for breakfast on Christmas Day to find the receptionists wearing Santa hats, a fake tree in the lobby, and cotton wool for snow on greenery in the garden. The temperature was 30C.That was the start of three days sailing down the Irrawaddy River, before exploring the Buddhist temples at Bagan, many held together by thick jungle vines. These cover 67 sq km (26 sq miles) and were built over a period of 230 years, until the city was overrun by Kublai Khan and the Mongols in 1287 and many were destroyed. For a bird’s-eye view, I went up in a hot-air balloon at sunrise on New Year’s Day and descended to a champagne breakfast.View image in fullscreenThe writer, right, in India with a friend.As a vegetarian, turkey and all the trimmings are not for me, and while I’m very happy with the local diet wherever I am, somehow it’s assumed that, being far away from home, I long for a traditional British meal. After travelling by boat through the Sundarbans of Bangladesh, watching boatmen send otters on a leash into the water to corral fish into nets, we arrived at our next port of call to find the table laid for Christmas dinner – in my case, cauliflower cheese with yorkshire pudding, followed by tinned fruit salad and custard.The family I stayed with in Prague followed the Czech tradition of buying a live carp from a barrel in the street and keeping it in the bath until Christmas EveOther unusual festive dinners have included a packed lunch of pakora with cold chips, a cheese sandwich and a boiled egg (India); “warthog on spit” in Eswatini (I opted for rice and beans); and soggy pizza in Cuba – but then you don’t go there for the food; Cubans have to queue for basics such as rice, oil, sugar and eggs. Hunger pangs were forgotten when we scrambled up the hills to explore Fidel Castro’s hideout.In Europe, many countries celebrate on the 24th, so Christmas Day is thankfully quiet and relatively normal. In Prague one year, under communism, the family I stayed with followed the Czech tradition of buying a live carp from a barrel in the street and keeping it in the bath until Christmas Eve, when they prepared breaded fillets, served with potato salad, for their meat-free dish in reverence to Christ. (I don’t remember how the bathtub fish was dispatched.) New Year’s Day required lentils for prosperity, and pig’s knuckles. I ate a lot of lentils on that visit in the 1980s, before the Velvet Revolution, when the only other vegetarian food I could find was Olomouccheese (aroma of sweaty socks) andknedlíky(dumplings) with sauerkraut, when not doused in goose fat.During a walking week on the Greek island of Evia on a group tour, it was a joy to find all the tavernas in the town of Karystos open over Christmas, despite it being the low season. We dined in a different one each day with “real people” then returned to a family-run hotel, our base for the duration. Our guide went the second (or seventh) mile after our day’s hike on the 25th by showering us with gifts, which were local and thoughtful; definitely worth taking home.View image in fullscreenThis Christmas the writer is heading to Gran Canaria.Photograph: Marek Slusarczyk/AlamyI like small group tours – fewer than 12 or you never remember their names – and I always pay for a single room. I’ll join the group dinners, but often head off alone to dine and discover something new (there is always one annoying person in the group – if you think there isn’t, it’s probably you). I like the fact I am only responsible for myself and don’t have to worry if my friend is having a good time. You can dip in and out of company but also have time to yourself, and privacy. The organised trips are usually a mix of couples, friends and solos like me.The nearest I have experienced to a firework-free New Year was in 1999 in the mountain kingdom of Bhutan, a Buddhist country with a Buddhist calendar – there it was already 2542. The turn of the millennium was another reason to get away that year. I spent 31 December hiking up to Tiger’s Nest Monastery, one of the holiest sites in the Himalaya, on a cliff above the Paro Valley at an altitude of about 3,000 metres. This was followed by a restorative stone bath, with large stones heated for four hours and rolled into a wooden tub fragranced with lavender and herbs. It’s a ritual that beats any expensive spa treatment back home.So this year, on 18 December, I’ll be hanging my age-old recycled wreath on the front door and heading off to Gran Canaria, hoping for like-minded escapers with walking boots and definitely no Santa hats.

The Caribbean nation said the radar was being used to combat local crime and would not serve as a launchpad for attacks on any other country.The Venezuelan statement, posted on Telegram in the name of the vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, accused T&T prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, of turning the Caribbean nation “into an aircraft carrier of the American empire against Venezuela” in an “act of vassalage”.View image in fullscreenPersad-Bissessar speaking to media in Port of Spain in September.Photograph: Andrea de Silva/ReutersWithout specifying what role T&T was alleged to have played in the oil tanker seizure, the Maduro regime announced the immediate termination of any “agreement, contract or negotiation” on natural gas supply between the two countries.In October, the US granted T&T permission to negotiate a gas deal with Venezuela without facing US sanctions. The two countries have long discussed developing the Dragon field, in Venezuelan waters near Tobago, which holds an estimated 4.2tn cubic feet of gas.A few days later, however, Maduro for the first time ordered the “immediate suspension” of the deal when a US warship docked in Trinidad’s capital.Radar revelation stokes fears Caribbean could be drawn into US-Venezuela crisisRead moreIn Monday’s statement, the Maduro regime said Persad-Bissessar “has revealed a hostile agenda against Venezuela since taking office, including the installation of US military radars to target vessels transporting Venezuelan oil … Venezuela demands respect! And it will not allow any colonial entity or its vassals to threaten the country’s sacred sovereignty and its right to development.”Persad-Bissessar has not yet addressed Venezuela’s latest move, but during the previous dispute she said the country’s future “does not depend on Venezuela and never has”.Earlier on Monday, T&T announced that the US would use its airports for activities “logistical in nature, facilitating supply replenishment and routine personnel rotations”, according to a statement from its foreign ministry. It did not provide further details.Domestic critics of the T&T government had already warned that the country risked being drawn into Trump’s campaign against Maduro. Amery Browne, an opposition senator and T&T’s former foreign minister, accused the government on Monday of being deceptive in its announcement.Browne said that T&T has become “complicit facilitators of extrajudicial killings, cross-border tension and belligerence”. He added: “There is nothing routine about this. It has nothing to do with the usual cooperation and friendly collaborations that we have enjoyed with the US and all of our neighbours for decades.”Persad-Bissessar has praised US strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific that have killed at least 87 people, including several Trinidadian citizens.She initially said a US C-17 aircraft that landed in Tobago was carrying marines to assist with a road construction project. But after images of the radar installation emerged, she admitted at least 100 marines were in the country, along with a military-grade radar unit – believed to be a long-range, high-performance AN/TPS-80 G/ATOR, which the US defence company Northrop Grumman says is used for air surveillance, air defence and counter-fire.Only seven miles (11km) separate Venezuela from the twin-island nation at their closest point.US lawmakers have questioned the legality of the strikes on vessels in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific and recently announced a congressional review.Explore more on these topicsTrinidad and TobagoUS militaryTrump administrationVenezuelaNicolás MaduroUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Among the many tributes he has paid to Pinochet, Kast said during the 2017 presidential campaign: “If [Pinochet] were alive, he would vote for me.”His election “is bad news for Chile’s democratic system”, said Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser, a populism researcher and professor at the Institute of Political Science at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.“What we are seeing with Kast is a return to the origins of a right that clearly did not have democratic credentials,” said Kaltwasser.Like many rightwing leaders across the region, Kast describes himself as an admirer of El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele, who has imprisoned at least 2% of his country’s adult population as part of a controversial crackdown on gangs.“My fear is not that Chilean democracy will collapse in four years, but that the conventional right will shift ever further to the right and democratic rightwing forces will therefore disappear,” said Kaltwasser, adding that there is no evidence to support Kast’s claim that rising migration is responsible for the increase in crime.Many analysts and political leaders see Kast’s election as part of a rightwing wave sweeping Latin America, with victories this year in Ecuador, Bolivia, Argentina and – according to the latest data from a vote count that has dragged on for three weeks – Honduras.Colombia’s leftist president, Gustavo Petro, acknowledged the trend, tweeting: “From the south and from the north come the winds of death … Fascism advances.”Alongside the rightward shift, there is also a regional swing towards “hardline security measures,” said Sandra Pellegrini, a senior analyst for Latin America and the Caribbean at the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED).She attributes this wave largely to a widespread public belief that Bukele’s measures have been successful in El Salvador. “What people are not seeing, or seem not to worry about, is the trade-off behind such a decrease – which has been a striking surge in state-perpetrated violence and human rights violations.”Under Bukele’s state of emergency imposed, hundreds of indiscriminate raids particularly in low-income neighbourhoods have led to the arrest of more than 81,000 people, drawing widespreadcondemnationfrom human rights groups.Pellegrini recently published areportarguing that the US military buildup on Venezuela’s doorstep and its deadly strikes on alleged drug boats – which have already killed more than 80 people – “may be more about pressuring governments to align with its foreign policy goals”.Trump has justified the operations as part of a “war on drugs” and has threatened similar action in Colombia, accusing the country of not being tough enough in curbing its cocaine production.But many in the region see the threat of a US invasion or strike on Venezuela is intended to force regime change and the removal of dictator Nicolás Maduro,According to the ACLED report, pressure from the White House for governments to be “tougher” is aimed at “reasserting the US as the dominant economic player in the Western Hemisphere and securing access to the region’s resources, staving off Chinese influence by promoting the emergence of US-aligned governments”.Pellegrini added: “Conducting strikes – or extrajudicial killings, as the UN has called them – is clearly sending a message to governments across the region that human rights are no longer a priority for the US and that the cost of committing human rights violations is much lower.“There is a real risk that we could see more of this in the coming years, not only in Chile, but across the other governments that have embarked on the path of militarisation,” she said.Explore more on these topicsChileThe far rightAmericasAugusto PinochetanalysisShareReuse this content"

It follows UK deals with India and the US, and the free tradeagreement with the EUclinched this year.Existing trade between the UK and South Korea is worth more than £15bn a year under a 2019 post-Brexit arrangement. The new deal covers the exports of services, automotive, pharmaceutical and food and drink, and would bring an extra £400m a year to the British economy, the UK government said.Significantly, the deal also lowers the threshold on the quantity of parts in a car that must be British or from the EU to qualify for zero tariffs from January.Under the current rules, 55% of a car must be made in the UK or the EU to qualify for duty-free sales. This has been dropped to 25% under the new deal, enabling carmakers to buy batteries or battery components from China and still qualify for zero-tariff exports to South Korea.View image in fullscreenThe trade minister Chris Bryant tries a racing simulation at Samsung in London to mark the end of negotiations on the UK-South Korea deal.Photograph: Lisa O’Carroll/The GuardianRichard Molyneux, the chief finance officer at Jaguar Land Rover, welcomed the deal, while Frank-Steffen Walliser, the chief executive of Bentley Motors, described continued access to a key market for the luxury brand as “great news”.Nik Jhangiani, the interim chief executive ofDiageo, said the new trade arrangement would “support export growth for Guinness”, which although made in Dublin, is canned in Runcorn and Belfast.Announced by the UK trade minister, Chris Bryant, and his South Korean counterpart, Yeo Han-koo, at the Samsung superstore in King’s Cross, London, the deal also offers British companies the opportunity to tender for public procurement contracts in Seoul, to offer legal services and the chance to do business via e-contracts for the first time.“Today’s agreement secures the UK as a global leader in digital trade and innovation while boosting our world-class services sector, supporting iconic brands, and giving cast-iron protections to our key industries to speed up economic growth as part of our plan for change,” Bryant said.Yeo said the deal would “strengthen the free-market system” at a time of “heightened uncertainty” and allowed allies to continue operating in the rule-based trading environment that Donald Trump disrupted with hisUS tariff push this year.The deal also gives British exporters tariff-free trade on 98% of goods, aligning it with the EU’s trade deal with Seoul.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeSouth KoreaAutomotive industryFood & drink industryPharmaceuticals industryServices sectorTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

His name appears on an online page of ICE detainees.“I just want my child to be well. He’s still young, and has a long life ahead,” said Guan’s mother.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The charges were brought under the city’spunitive national security law, introduced in 2020, and a British colonial-era sedition law that has been used in recent years by authorities.Lai faces spending the rest of his life in prison,amid increasing fears about his physical condition. A diabetes sufferer, he is thought to have lost about 10kg in the past year.Yvette Cooper, the British foreign secretary, said: “The UK condemns the politically motivated prosecution of Jimmy Lai that has resulted in today’s guilty verdict. Jimmy Lai has been targeted by the Chinese and Hong Kong governments for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression … We continue to call for Mr Lai’s immediate release.”She later told parliament the Chinese ambassador to the UK had been summoned over Lai’s conviction.The Australian government said it was “deeply concerned by the guilty verdict” while the EU said the outcome was “emblematic of the erosion of democracy and fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong”. Taiwan’s mainland affair’s council said the conviction had caused “profound sorrow” in Taiwan.1:34Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai convicted of national security offences – videoOn Monday US president Donald Trump said he feels “so badly” about Lai’s conviction and has asked China’s leader Xi Jinping to consider his release. Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, also called onChinato release him.Lai is the founder of Apple Daily, a hugely popular pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong that was forced to close in 2021.He was arrested in 2020and has spent more than five years behind bars during a lengthy trial that has been delayed several times.Lai was accused of using Apple Daily and political connections, particularly in the US, to lobby for foreign governments to impose sanctions on China and Hong Kong after the crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 2019 and 2020. Lai pleaded not guilty to all charges.There has been particular criticism over the fact that the prosecution case used messages and meetings from before the national security law was in effect as part of its evidence. The law cannot be applied retroactively and Lai said he never called for sanctions after it had taken effect, as “it would be suicidal to do so”.But in their 855-page judgment, the judges, who are picked by the government for national security cases, said the evidence was “clear”.Sarah Brooks, the China director for Amnesty International, said: “The conviction ofJimmy Laifeels like the death knell for press freedom in Hong Kong. This verdict shows that Hong Kong’s so-called national security laws are not in place to protect people, but to silence them. It should also serve as a warning to all people doing business in Hong Kong: that pursuing opportunities in the city comes with severe legal risks.”Speaking to reporters in London on Monday, Lai’s son Sebastien Lai said while the guilty verdict was not a surprise, it was “still painful”. “It signifies a Hong Kong that has completely changed,” he said.View image in fullscreenSebastien Lai said the guilty verdict showed Hong Kong ‘has completely changed’.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianSebastien Lai and his father’s international legal team called on the UK government to make his release a precondition for closer relations between London and Beijing.Keir Starmerhas called for Lai’s release and has raised the case directly with China’s president, Xi Jinping. The UK prime minister is expected to visit Beijing in January.Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, the head of the international legal team, said there was “no use shouting into the wind” and statements in support of Lai needed to be backed up by concrete action. “China needs to see there are real consequences” for Lai’s prosecution, Gallagher said.Thibaut Bruttin, the director of Reporters Without Borders, said: “We are outraged that Jimmy Lai, Hong Kong’s symbol of press freedom, has been found guilty on trumped-up national security charges. This unlawful conviction only demonstrates the alarming deterioration of media freedom in the territory.”The rise and fall of Jimmy Lai, whose trajectory mirrored that of Hong Kong itselfRead moreCooper also called for Lai, who has been kept in solitary confinement for more than 1,800 days, to be given full access to independent medical professionals. Earlier this month, his familysaidLai had lost a significant amount of weight, his nails were becoming discoloured and falling off, and his teeth were rotting. The closing arguments in Lai’s trial were delayed at one point because he was suffering fromheart palpitations.Lai’s daughter Claire Lai said: “Having spent the last few years in Hong Kong, I have personally witnessed my father’s rapidly failing health. He is 78 and has spent five years in terrible conditions, we are worried about how much more he can bear.”Sebastien Lai said on Monday that his father, who has a British passport, “could have left at any point” but that he stayed to give “everything that he has for the freedom of others”.He said that if Lai was allowed to die in jail Hong Kong would die “with my father”. The government would have “arbitrarily and vindictively killed a man for his journalism, for his criticism”, he said, describing his father as “a man who lives with no regrets”.Earlier in December, the Hong Kong government said Lai’s medical provision in prison was “adequate and comprehensive”.China’s foreign ministry said: “We urge the relevant countries to … not make irresponsible remarks on the trial of judicial cases in Hong Kong and not to interfere in Hong Kong’s judiciary or China’s internal affairs in any form.”The Chinese embassy in London criticised the UK government’s statement. The embassy said Cooper’s comment “blatantly interferes in China’s internal affairs and tramples on the rule of law, and seriously violates the basic norms governing international relations”.Explore more on these topicsJimmy LaiHong KongChinaAsia PacificPress freedomYvette CooperKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Lai’s conviction comes just weeks before an expected visit to Beijing by the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer.The rise and fall of Jimmy Lai, whose trajectory mirrored that of Hong Kong itselfRead moreLai, 78, has been in jail since late 2020 on remand and serving several protest-related sentences totalling almost 10 years. Monday’s conviction, in which judges called him a “mastermind” of conspiracies designed to destabilise the Chinese government, came after a controversial trial that stretched for more than two years.Lai appeared in the West Kowloon district court on Monday, in a grey jacket, flanked by armed guards as he sat in the glass-walled dock, as his family sat nearby. Crowds of supporters and onlookers, some of whom had queued overnight, had packed the main courtroom and several spillover rooms to see the highly anticipated – but widely predicted – verdict delivered.View image in fullscreenA prison van believed to be carrying Jimmy Lai leaving the West Kowloon magistrates courts building after the verdict.Photograph: Lam Yik/ReutersLai had been charged with one count of conspiracy to publish seditious publications and two counts of conspiracy to foreign collusion, under the city’spunitive national security law(NSL), introduced in 2020, and a British colonial-era sedition law that has seen renewed use in recent years by authorities.Prosecutors had accused Lai of using his media outlet, Apple Daily, and foreign political connections to lobby for governments to impose sanctions and other punitive measures on Chinese andHong Kongauthorities.He had pleaded not guilty to all charges, but in their 855-page judgment the judges, who are picked by the government for national security cases, said the evidence was “clear”.Hong Kong’s last major opposition party disbands amid Chinese pressureRead more“There is no doubt in our mind that the first defendant never wavered in his intention to destabilise the governance of the CCP [Chinese Communist party], and despite the enactment of the national security law, he was intent on continuing, though in a less explicit way,” the high court judge Esther Toh told the court on Monday, reading out a written judgment.The next court date is 12 January, and Lai has an opportunity to appeal.The ruling was welcomed by Hong Kong’s chief executive, John Lee, and its security police chief, Steve Li, who said the judges were “professional”. In Beijing aforeign ministry spokesperson said the Chinese government supported Hong Kong authorities’ efforts “punishing criminal acts that endanger national security”.View image in fullscreenA Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, speaking about Lai’s trial verdict on Monday.Photograph: Jessica Lee/EPARights groups condemned the verdict, with the Committee to Protect Journalists calling it a “sham conviction” and “a disgraceful act of persecution”.“The ruling underscores Hong Kong’s utter contempt for press freedom, which is supposed to be protected under the city’s mini-constitution, the Basic Law,” said the Asia-Pacific director of the committee, Beh Lih Yi.“Jimmy Lai’s only crime is running a newspaper and defending democracy. The risk of him dying from ill health in prison increases as each day passes – he must be reunited with his family immediately.”Amnesty International’sChinadirector, Sarah Brooks, said the verdict’s predictability didn not make it “any less dismaying”. Elaine Pearson, the Asia director at Human Rights Watch, called the conviction cruel and a travesty of justice. “The Chinese government’s mistreatment of Jimmy Lai aims to silence everyone who dares to criticise the Communist party,” Pearson said.Taiwan’s mainland affairs council, the government department in charge of China policy, also called for Lai’s release. “This ruling serves as a declaration to the world that Hong Kong’s freedoms, democracy and judicial independence have been systematically eroded,” it said.Three Apply Daily entities – Apple Daily Limited, Apple Daily Printing Limited and AD Internet Limited – which were co-accused with Lai, were also found guilty of the two foreign collusion charges.View image in fullscreenPeople waiting outside the West Kowloon law courts on Sunday night.Photograph: Leung Man Hei/AFP/Getty ImagesLai had pleaded not guilty to all charges,telling the courthe had “hoped against hope” that the US president, Donald Trump, would stop Beijing imposing its national security law on the city, but that he had never tried to influence foreign policy or ask foreign officials to take concrete action on Hong Kong.A frequent criticism of theHong Kongauthorities’ national security prosecutions is that they at times appear to apply it retrospectively, even though it is not supposed to be applied that way. Messages and meetings from before the law was imposed formed a major part of the prosecution against Lai.In its judgment the court said it was “very clear” to them that Lai “had harboured his hatred and resentment for the [People’s Republic of China] for many of his adult years”, and had been thinking about how the US could apply leverage towards China from long before the national security law was introduced.“The only reasonable inference we can draw from the preponderance of the evidence, is that the first defendant’s intention – pre or post NSL – was to seek the downfall of the CCP, even though the ultimate cost was the sacrifice of the people of the PRC [People’s Republic of China] and HKSAR [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region].”Samuel Chu, the head of the US-based Campaign for Hong Kong, said the case was a grave miscarriage of justice, tried “under a legal architecture fundamentally remade to ensure conviction”.“For anyone who has engaged Hong Kong’s legal system in good faith – as lawyers, advocates, or observers – this represents a decisive rupture with the city’s common-law tradition,” he said.On Monday, there was a large police presence – uniformed and in plainclothes – outside the West Kowloon district court, as well as a large media gathering. The queue for the public appeared smaller than on previous key moments, such as the day Lai gave testimony, and big days for other cases such as that of the Hong Kong 47, which drew hundreds of people.View image in fullscreenCrowds outside the court on Monday.Photograph: Nexpher/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockLai’s national security trial had lasted more than two years. During that time the Hong Kong government had laws rewritten to limit bail rights and restrict foreign lawyers from defending Lai. Final argumentswere delivered in August.Lai’s family have repeatedlyraised concerns about his ailing health, as he languished in solitary confinement, allegedly subjected to “petty” efforts designed to demoralise him. Hong Kong authorities repeatedly rejected the accusations.Supporters and observers had queued outside the court on Monday, some arriving the previous nightto gain entry to the court complex. Passersby noted widespread allegations that some people were often paid by pro-Beijing groups to reserve seats that might otherwise be taken by supporters and international observers. But none of those in the queue would speak to the Guardian.Simon, an older Hong Kong man, said he wanted to support Lai and his wife, Teresa, by being here. He and a friend were holding bright red apples, to represent the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper which Lai founded and which stands as his co-accused.Explore more on these topicsHong KongJimmy LaiChinaAsia PacificPress freedomJournalist safetyNewspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

A GoFundMe page set up to support his family has already raised more than $1.3m.The ABC reported on Monday that Naveed Akram, the younger man, had been investigated by domestic intelligence agency Asio over possible links to an Islamic State terror cell in Sydney. Albanese said on Monday that he came to the attention of authorities in 2019, “on the basis of being associated with others”, but did not specifically confirm the Islamic State connection.Federal government sources also declined to comment on this issue. On Tuesday morning, speaking on the ABC, Albanese expanded further on Asio’s 2019 investigation.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“The advice that we’ve received, though, is that Asio investigated him, found that he wasn’t subject to ongoing monitoring. They interviewed him, they interviewed his family members, they interviewed people around him,” he said.“He was drawn to their attention because of his association with others. Two of the people he was associated with were charged and went to jail, but he was not seen at that time to be a person of interest.“Whether he was radicalised further after that, what the circumstances are, that’s the subject of further investigation.”Albanese did not specifically draw links between Akram and IS, but in a later part of the ABC interview in response to a separate question, he said: “Antisemitism, of course, has been around for a very long period of time … Islamic State is an ideology that tragically over the last decade, particularly since 2015, has led to a radicalisation of some people to this extreme position, and it is a hateful action.”On the ABC’s 7.30 on Monday, Albanese said there was “no evidence that these people were part of a cell”.But, he said: “Clearly, they were motivated by this extremist ideology, and further detail, of course, will be released when the police go through their work.”The prime minister said he was “absolutely ready for the fight” to pursue major reform on gun laws,as proposed at national cabinet on Monday.One of the alleged gunmen, 24-year-old Naveed Akram, remains in hospital. TheNew South Walespolice commissioner, Mal Lanyon, said he expected to bring charges against Akram in the coming days.The other alleged gunman, Naveed’s father Sajid Akram, was shot dead by police at the scene.More thana thousand people gathered at the Bondi Pavilionto mark 24 hours since Sunday’s deadly attack. Rabbi Yossi Shuchat lit the candles of a five-foot-high menorah, telling those gathered: “Lightness will always persevere, darkness cannot continue where there is light.”Among the crowd were the NSW premier,Chris Minns, and opposition leader, Kellie Sloane.Hundreds also attended a prayer vigil at the Chabad of Bondi synagogue, the place of worship for many of those caught up in Sunday’s attack and whereone of those killed, Eli Schlanger, was assistant rabbi.In the Melbourne suburb of Caulfield, the heart of the largest Jewish community in Australia, more than 2,000 people including the deputy premier, Richard Marles, Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, and state opposition leader, Jess Wilson, gathered at the Caulfield Shule.Rabbi Effy Block from the Chabad of St Kilda said his congregation were reeling from “broken hearts, deep shock, and profound pain”.“Yes, our hearts are heavy. Yes, we are grieving ... but we will not be broken,” he said.“We will not be silenced and we will not give in to fear.”A multicultural celebration of Hanukah in Melbourne’s Federation Square, for the Pillars of Light festival, also went ahead. Addressing the crowd, Rabbi Gabi Kaltmann thanked everyone “for showing up and being here in solidarity”.Shock, grief and political reaction: Bondi terror attack aftermath – podcastRead more“We gather not in fear, but in strength,” he said. “We will light up our hearts and shine away this darkness by lighting the menorah.”A crowd also gathered outside the Australian High Commission in London for a vigil on Sunday evening, and vigils were held in Israel.The men are believed to have used legally obtained firearms to commit the massacre. Sajid Akram, who was a member of a gun club, had six weapons registered to him, which have all been recovered, police said.Four of these weapons, thought to include a rifle and shotgun, were seized at the scene in Bondi, with other weapons also found during a police raid at the house in Campsie.Naveed was an Australian-born citizen. His father had arrived in the country on a student visa in 1998, transferred in 2001 to a partner visa and had since been on resident return visas.Restricting the number of firearms a single person can ownand only issuing gun licenses to Australian citizens are among the changes to gun laws being considered in the wake of the attack.Antisemitic incidents, including assaults, vandalism, threats and intimidation, surged more than threefold in the country during the year after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, and Israel launched a war on Hamas in Gaza in response, the government’s special envoy to combat antisemitism, Jillian Segal, reported in July.Last year, there were antisemitic attacks in Sydney and Melbourne. Synagogues and cars have been torched, businesses and homes vandalised with graffiti, and Jews attacked in cities where 85% of the nation’s Jewish population lives.Visual explainer: how a night of terror unfolded in BondiRead moreBenjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, said he warned Australia’s leaders months ago about the dangers of failing to take action against antisemitism. He claimed Australia’s recent decision to recognise a Palestinian state “pours fuel on the antisemitic fire”.At a press briefing,Albanese rejected the accusationsand listed actions his government had taken, including criminalising hate speech and incitement to violence and a ban on the Nazi salute.Funding for physical security for Jewish community groupswould also be extended, he said.Segal, who was appointed by the Australian government last year to tackle a spate of graffiti and arson attacks on synagogues and Jewish businesses, said Sunday’s terrorist attack “did not come without warning”.“The writing has been on the wall,” Segal said in a radio interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Monday.Jewish community leaders echoed the call for more action. “There has been a shocking level of antisemitism that has been rearing its head in this country as it has in other countries. When antisemitism goes unchecked from the top, these are the things that happen,” said Levi Wolff, the lead rabbi at Sydney’s Central Synagogue.Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackAustralian police and policingAustralian politicsNew South WalesAnthony AlbaneseChris MinnsAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

But they added that significant differences remained over the future status of the Ukrainian territories occupied byRussia.Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday he had “very long and very good” talks with Ukrainian counterpartVolodymyr Zelenskyyand European and Nato leaders, adding: “We had numerous conversations with President Putin of Russia, and I think we’re closer now than we have been ever, and we’ll see what we can do.”Asked if he had recently spoken directly toVladimir Putin, Trump replied “yeah, I have,” but did not give any details.But Trump appeared to suggest that in exchange for security guarantees, Ukraine must agree to give Russia the parts of the eastern Donbas region that Kyiv still holds – something Zelenskyy has previously ruled out.“Well, they’ve already lost the territory, to be honest,” he said when asked what incentive Ukraine would have to give up land.Zelenskyy said talks with Trump’s envoys were “not easy” but brought “real progress” on the question of security guarantees. However, differences remained on the question of what territory. “There has been sufficient dialogue on the territory, and I think that, frankly speaking, we still have different positions,” Zelenskyy told reporters.Under the proposal, Ukraine would have western support to maintain a standing army of 800,000 troops, the US would lead a “ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism” to provide early warning of any future attack, and the European countries would also sign a “legally binding commitment, subject to national procedures, to take measures to restore peace and security in the case of a future armed attack”. Europe would also back Ukraine’s accession to theEuropean Union.The deal would effectively provide “article five-like” guarantees to Ukraine, according to two US officials briefed on the negotiations, comparing the security guarantees to those provided toNatoallies from foreign attacks.The US presented the new package at talks in Berlin this week with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as senior diplomats and security officials from European allies. The US officials said that they believed Russia would accept the security guarantees presented at the talks, which would mark a significant relaxation in the Kremlin’s demands for limitations on the size of Ukraine’s army and opposition to troops from Nato countries operating in Ukraine.The American delegation, which was led by the US envoy Steve Witkoff and Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, said Zelenskyy and European leaders had responded positively to the White House’s latest proposal for security guarantees resembling those given to Nato allies, and intended to prevent Russia from resuming its invasion if a peace agreement is reached.Any Russia-Ukraine deal is doomed without security guarantees, says StarmerRead more“I think the Ukrainians would tell you, as would the Europeans, that this is the most robust set of security protocols they have ever seen,” said one US official briefed on the negotiations. “It is a very, very strong package. I think hopefully the Russians are going to look at it and say to themselves: ‘That’s OK, because we have no intention [of restarting the war].’ We’re going to take them at their word.”US officials declined to give specific details of what that security package would include and who would defend Ukraine if Russia resumed its invasion after a peace deal was reached. They confirmed the US would not put boots on the ground in Ukraine as part of the deal.Nonetheless, the German chancellor,Friedrich Merz, told a news conference on Monday he believed the two sides were the closest to a real peace process since Russia’s large-scale invasion began in 2022.View image in fullscreenFriedrich Merz greets Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the chancellery in Berlin.Photograph: Action Press/Shutterstock“What the US has placed on the table here in Berlin in terms of legal and material guarantees is really considerable,” Merz said during a joint press conference with Zelenskyy.The Ukrainian president said he welcomed the “productive” discussions, as Kyiv’s top peace negotiator hailed “real progress” in the second round of talks in Berlin.The security guarantees are considered a key factor of a potential peace deal. Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, hadsaid earlierthat a deal between Russia and Ukraine would fail if it did not include “robust” security guarantees from the west.“It’s really important we attend to this in detail,” he said. “[Vladimir] Putin has shown time and again that he will keep coming back for more if he sees the chance.”Any Russia-Ukraine deal is doomed without security guarantees, says StarmerRead moreUS officials said on Monday they were still “brainstorming” the future status of the occupied territories of Ukraine under a peace deal, adding that they were considering these areas becoming an “economic free zone”. But they said there remained significant differences on the control and status of theterritories taken by Russia.“Ultimately, if we can get that defined, then it will really get to [Russia and Ukraine] to work out the final issues of sovereignty and to see if there’s a deal that can be done between them,” said a US official briefed on the talks.The two sides were also not in agreement on the future operations of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is located in Ukraine but is under Russian control. US officials said they wanted the two sides to split the power produced by the plant “50/50”. US negotiators claimed they had resolved “90%” of the disputes between the Russian and Ukrainian sides.Zelenskyy described the talks with the US side as “not easy” but said they had made headway. He said Russia was using its relentless strikes as leverage in negotiations and noted that not a single power station inUkrainehad been spared attack.Rustem Umerov, the secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, also struck an upbeat note on the discussions: “Over the past two days, Ukrainian-US negotiations have been constructive and productive, with real progress achieved,” he said.Umerov wrote on X that Witkoff and Kushner were “working extremely constructively to help Ukraine find a way to a peace agreement that lasts”.View image in fullscreenVolodymyr Zelenskyy (left) with the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, at Bellevue Palace in Berlin on Monday.A German government spokesperson said earlier that Witkoff and Kushner had also been invited to the working dinner.

Zelenskyy has said the US leader istargeting Christmas as a deadlinefor a “full understanding” on a peace plan.The search for viable terms for an end to the war has run into major obstacles, including a dispute over control of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, which is occupied mostly by Russian forces.Zelenskyy on Sunday expressed readiness to drop his country’s bid to join Nato if the US and other western nations gave Kyiv legally binding security guarantees similar to those offered to alliance members.View image in fullscreenZelenskyy departs the chancellery after talks with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersHe also said he hoped Washington would accept freezing the frontline where it was, rather than Ukraine ceding the entire Donbas region, which comprises Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.Putin has described Ukraine’s drive to join Nato as a major threat to Moscow’s security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. “Naturally this issue is one of the cornerstones and, of course, it is subject to special discussion,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Monday, adding that Moscow was expecting a US briefing on the Berlin discussions when they were over.European leaders stressed that the outcome of the talks on Ukraine would affect their own countries’ security for decades to come. Merz said at the weekend that Putin’s goal was “a fundamental change to the borders in Europe, the restoration of the old Soviet Union within its borders”.“If Ukraine falls, he won’t stop,” the German chancellor told a conference of fellow conservatives in Munich.Russia has denied it intends to attack Nato members.View image in fullscreenSteve Witkoff, the US special envoy, leaves the Adlon hotel in Berlin on Monday.Photograph: Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty ImagesIn London, meanwhile, the head of Britain’s foreign spy service, MI6,has warned that Russia poses an “aggressive, expansionist” threatin her first speech since taking office.Blaise Metreweli took over from Richard Moore in October, becoming the first woman to leadMI6.She said Putin was not serious about trying to end the war in Ukraine, describing him as “dragging out negotiations” and shifting the burden of the conflict on to his own population.The EU, meanwhile, is scrambling this week to agree a plan on financing Ukraine in the coming years by using frozen Russian assets. A leaders’ meeting is scheduled to begin on Thursday and a deal still appears elusive.European leaders including Zelenskyy will also meet in The Hague on Tuesday to launch an International Claims Commission to compensate Kyiv for hundreds of billions of dollars in damage from Russian attacks and alleged war crimes.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropean UnionKeir StarmerEmmanuel MacronFriedrich MerzVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

He said the pass, which will cost €30 a month for those under 26, would allow people to “travel anywhere in the country” on middle-distance and suburban trains, and on national bus services.According to Sánchez, the scheme could help some workers cut their monthly travel costs by as much as 60%.Spain’s ruling socialist party accused of failing to act on sexual misconduct by senior menRead more“We’re talking about 2 million people who will be paying less each month to get to work, to get home or to do their day-to-day stuff,” he said. “That’s what governing is about: making the important things easier for ordinary people.”The Spanish scheme followsa similar initiative in Germany, which introduced a €49-a-month ticket covering regional rail, metro, trams and bus travel across the country in 2023.As well as announcing the scheme and defending his government’s stewardship of Spain’s growing economy, Sánchez addressed the corruption and sexual harassment allegations that have proliferated over recent weeks and months.He said his government and his party had acted with “forcefulness and not connivance” when confronted with instances of alleged corruption, adding they were “absolutely committed to feminism” and to tackling sexual abuse and harassment.Opposition calls for an early general election were backed over the weekendby the head of Spain’s Episcopal Conference, who said the time had come to give Spanish voters their say.The intervention received short shrift from Sánchez, who said: “The time when bishops meddled in politics ended when this country’s democracy began.”Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropePedro SáncheznewsShareReuse this content"

And that is why it’s really important we attend to this in detail. Putin has shown time and again that he will keep coming back for more if he sees the chance.”‘The frontline is everywhere’: new MI6 head to warn of growing Russian threatRead moreHe added: “Peace agreements fail, in my view, predominantly because there aren’t sufficiently robust security guarantees behind them – which is why the French president and I set up the coalition of the willing … to put in place guarantees from the coalition-of-the-willing countries in accordance with and alongside the US.”In a separatespeech on Monday, Blaise Metreweli, the head of the UK’s Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, said Vladimir Putin was “dragging out negotiations” over Ukraine, in keeping with the spy agency’s long-standing assessment that the Russian leader was not serious about ending the war, except on very favourable terms to the Kremlin.She accused Putin of engaging in “historical distortions” while insisting that the UK’s support for Ukraine would be enduring, because “it is fundamental not just to European sovereignty and security but to global stability”.Starmer was speaking to parliament’s liaison committee hours before he was due to board a flight to Berlin for dinner with the leaders of eight European countries, as well as those of the European Commission, the EU Council and Nato.The prime minister is one of a handful of western leaders who has offeredVolodymyr Zelenskyyadvice and support as talks between the US, Russia and Ukraine gather pace.Starmerhosted the Ukrainian presidentalong with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, at Downing Street last week in a coordinated show of support.Zelenskyy spent Monday in Berlin, where Ukrainian officialshave been lockedin talks with their US counterparts for two days. He said on Monday that the talks were “not easy” but had been productive.Over the weekendhe offeredto drop Ukraine’s ambition to join Nato for the first time in an attempt to show his willingness to reach an agreement. In return Zelenskyy and his European allies are pushing for “article-5-like” security guarantees from Europe and the US, referring to Nato’s founding principle that an attack on one member country should be seen as an attack on all.Starmerhas saidthe UK is willing to commit troops to defend Ukrainian sovereignty as part of a multinational force. Doing so, however, would require logistical support from Washington, the status of which remains unclear.European officials have been scrambling to respond to the national security strategylaunched by Trumplast week, which claimed Europe was facing “civilisational erasure” and called for US backing for far-right parties across the continent.Starmer on Monday reiterated his calls for Europe to spend more on its own defence, arguing: “I will always believe in the Euro-Atlantic security mechanisms, but I do think it is time for European countries to step up, step into the breach on spend, capability, coordination.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineKeir StarmerForeign policyVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

She said information was becoming “increasingly weaponised”.The order of world institutions “designed in the ashes of the second world war” was, she said, being deliberately contested “from sea to space, from the battlefield to the boardroom” and “even our brains” through the deliberate spread of disinformation online.She said Britain and the world were “operating in a space between peace and war” – which the spy agency, traditionally focused on running agents and working with human sources, had to contend with. She said MI6 had to become “fluent in technology” and anticipate the impact of future advances.Metreweli, 48, took over as the head of MI6, the UK’s international spy agency, in September,becoming the first woman to hold the post. As its chief, or C, she is the only member of the organisation to be publicly named.An Arabic speaker, her early career included running agents in the Middle East as well as deployments in easternEurope. She was appointed to the top job by the prime minister after running MI6’s technology department, or Q branch.Metreweli said she would “break with tradition” and not “give you a global threat tour”. This allowed her to sidestep any direct analysis of China, which has been accused of trying to run espionage and hacking campaigns against the UK.Outgoing MI6 chief says Putin has ‘bitten off more than he can chew’ in UkraineRead moreIn the autumn, a row broke outafter the collapse of an espionage prosecutionagainst two Britons, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, accused of spying for Beijing. A trial had not been able to go ahead under now-repealed Official Secrets Act legislation because a government witness would not describe China as an enemy of the UK.China “will be a central part of the global transformation taking place this century”, she said, devoting a single paragraph to the country in her remarks. She added that “it is essential that we, as MI6, continue to inform the government’s understanding of China’s rise”, without describing Beijing as posing a challenge.Ministers have yet to decide whether to grant planning permission toChina’s proposed new super-embassy at London’s Royal Mint Court, while Starmer hopes to visit the country in January. MI6 emphasised that Metreweli’s aim was to focus on one or two issues, not to touch on the full range of topics within the agency’s remit.Russia,the focus of remarks trailed in advance, was described as “aggressive, expansionist and revisionist, seeking to subjugate Ukraine and harass Nato”. She said Putin was not serious about trying to end the war in Ukraine, describing him as “dragging out negotiations” and shifting the burden of the conflict on to his own population.Meanwhile, the head of Britain’s armed forces said on Monday that Britain needed to develop “a whole of nation response” to deal with the growing military threat posed by Russia.Richard Knighton, the chief of the defence staff, said that while there was a “remote chance” of a direct attack on the UK, the invasion of a Nato ally in eastern Europe by Russia’s 1.1 million-strong army was more likely.“We should be under no illusions that Russia has a massive, increasingly technically sophisticated, and now, highly combat-experienced, military,” he said, and that it has inUkrainegradually shown greater tactical awareness and increased its proficiency in the use of drones.He stopped short of hinting at a return to conscription, but noted that Germany and France had reintroduced limited forms of military service. Instead he argued that the UK needed “more people being ready to fight for their country” through increases in the size of the armed forces.Explore more on these topicsUK security and counter-terrorismMI6UkraineDefence policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The leader of the Middle East’s last Ba’athist regime now sits in the classroom, taking ophthalmology lessons, according to a well-placed source.‘It’s a breach of trust’: fear and frustration over countries’ push to return Syrians homeRead more“He’s studying Russian and brushing up on his ophthalmology again,” said a friend of the Assad family who has kept in touch with them. “It’s a passion of his, he obviously doesn’t need the money. Even before the war in Syria began, he used to regularly practice his ophthalmology in Damascus,” they continued, suggesting the wealthy elite in Moscow could be his target clientele.A year after his regime wastoppledin Syria, the Assad family are living an isolated, quiet life of luxury in Moscow and the UAE. A friend of the family, sources in Russia and Syria, as well as leaked data, helped give rare insight into the lives of the now reclusive family who once ruled over Syria with an iron fist.The family are likely to reside in the prestigious Rublyovka, a gated community of Moscow’s elite, according to two sources with knowledge of the situation. There they would rub shoulders with the likes of the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, who fled Kyiv in 2014 and is believed to live in the area.The Assads are not wanting for money. After being cut off from much of the world’s financial system by western sanctions in 2011 after Assad’s bloody crackdown on protesters, the family put much of their wealth in Moscow, where western regulators could not touch it.Despite their cushy abode, the family are cut off from the elite Syrian and Russian circles they once enjoyed.

He’s only in touch with a couple of people who were in his palace, like Mansour Azzam [former Syrian minister of presidency affairs] and Yassar Ibrahim [Assad’s top economic crony].”A source close to the Kremlin said Assad was also largely “irrelevant” to Putin and Russia’s political elite. “Putin has little patience for leaders who lose their grip on power, and Assad is no longer seen as a figure of influence or even an interesting guest to invite to dinner,” the source said.Assad fled with his sons out of Damascus in the early hours of 8 December 2024, as Syrian rebels approached the capital from the north and the south. They were met by a Russian military escort and were taken to the Russian Khmeimim airbase, where they were flown out of the country.Assad did not warn his extended family or close regime allies of the impending collapse, instead leaving them to fend for themselves.A friend of Maher al-Assad, Bashar’s brother and a top military official, who knows many former members of the palace said: “Maher had been calling Bashar for days but he wouldn’t pick up. He stayed in the palace until the last second, rebels found his shisha coals still warm. It was Maher, not Bashar, who helped others escape. Bashar only cared about himself.”The lawyer of Bashar’s uncle Rifaat al-Assad recalled how his clients called him in a panic, unsure of how to escape Syria after Bashar fled. “When they arrived to Khmeimim, they told the Russian soldiers that they were Assads, but they didn’t speak English or Arabic. So eight of them had to sleep in their cars in front of the base,” Elie Hatem, Rifaat’s lawyer said. It was only after the intervention of a senior Russian official that the family managed to escape to Oman.In the first months after the Assads’ escape, his former regime allies were not on Bashar’s mind. The family gathered in Moscow to support Asma, the British-born former first lady of Syria, who had had leukaemia for years and whose condition had become critical. She had been receiving treatment in Moscow before the fall of the Assad regime.View image in fullscreenBashar and Asma Assad on their wedding dayPhotograph: social mediaAccording to a source familiar with the details of Asma’s health, the former first lady has recovered after experimental therapy under the supervision of Russia’s security servicesWith Asma’s health stabilised, the former dictator is keen to get his side of the story out. He has lined up interviews with RT and a popular rightwing American podcaster, but is waiting for approval from Russian authorities to make a media appearance.Russia appears to have blocked Assad from any public appearance. In a rare Novemberinterviewwith Iraqi media about Assad’s life in Moscow, Russia’s ambassador to Iraq, Elbrus Kutrashev, confirmed that the toppled dictator was barred from any public activity.“Assad may live here but cannot engage in political activities … He has no right to engage in any media or political activity. Have you heard anything from him? You haven’t, because he is not allowed to – but he is safe and alive,” Kutrashev said.Life for the Assad children in contrast seems to continue with relatively little disruption, as they adjust to a new life as Moscow elite.The family friend, who met some of the children a few months ago, said: “They’re kind of dazed. I think they’re still in a bit of a shock. They’re just kind of getting used to life without being the first family.”The only time the Assad family – without Bashar – have been seen together in public since the end of their regime was at his daughter Zein al-Assad’s graduation on 30 June, where she received a degree in international relations from MGIMO, the elite Moscow university attended by much of Russia’s ruling class.View image in fullscreenZein al-Assad, in white dress, on graduating from universityA photograph on MGIMO’s officialwebsiteshows the 22-year-old Zein standing with other graduates. In a blurry separate video from the event, members of the Assad family, including Asma and her two sons Hafez, 24, and Karim, 21, can be seen in the audience.Two of Zein’s classmates who attended the ceremony confirmed that parts of the Assad family were present, but said they kept a low profile. “The family did not stay long and did not take any pictures with Zein on stage like other families,” said one of the former classmates, speaking on condition of anonymity.Hafez, once groomed as Bashar’s potential successor, has largely withdrawn from public view since posting a Telegramvideoin February in which he offered his own account of the family’s flight from Damascus, denying they had abandoned their allies and claiming it was Moscow that ordered them to leave Syria.View image in fullscreenHafez al-Assad.Photograph: Telegram @HafezBAIAssadSyrians quickly geolocated Hafez, who took the video while walking the streets of Moscow.Hafez has closed most of his social media, instead registering accounts under a pseudonym taken from an American children’s series about a young detective with dyslexia, according to leaked data. The children and their mother spend much of their time shopping, filling their new Russian home with luxury goods, according to the source close to the family.Zein al-Assad regularly shops for high-end clothing, has registered at an upmarket pedicure salon and is a member an elite gym in Moscow, leaked Russian data shows.The Assad children also frequently visit the UAE, with Asma joining them on their trip on at least one occasion. Leaked flight records seen by the Guardian from 2017-23 suggest the UAE had long become a favourite destination for the Assad family even when they were in power. Karim and Hafez made repeated trips between Abu Dhabi, Moscow and Syria, including flights in November 2022 and September 2023.Originally, the Assad family were hoping to relocate from Moscow to the UAE. The UAE was a much more familiar location for them. They did not speak Russian and struggled to locate themselves within Russian social circles, according to the family friend. However, the family now realise that permanently relocating will not happen for a while, as even the UAE, which houses many of the world’s shady elite, is uncomfortable hosting Assad.As rebels swept across Syria, they shared pictures they found in Assad’s estates. Social media was flooded with images of a young Bashar in underwear, Bashar swimming – a far cry from the autocratic self-portrait that stared out at Syrians from every corner.View image in fullscreenBashar al-Assad.Photograph: social mediaIt was the first crack in a steely image of a dictator whose rule, until a year ago, was seen as impregnable.

Safety was never compromised, and we are working with policing to ensure nobody is incorrectly prosecuted in future.“Enforcement is still in place, and the public can remain confident that only motorists who break the rules will be penalised.”A spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs’ Council said police forces were working to identify and contact “a very limited number of motorists”.They added: “Policing enforces a range of offences, including speeding, on the strategic road network through a number of tactics including mobile camera deployments, roads policing patrols and average speed sites.“This remains unchanged. If you are affected by this issue, you will be contacted and details of the compensation scheme will be shared in due course.”Explore more on these topicsMotoringEnglandTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

He said the weapon used in the shooting was a 9mm handgun.The FBI announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to the case being solved. The video clips were recorded before the shooting, the authorities said, on Saturday afternoon.The police do not have an identity of the person of interest or clear images of the person’s face. The new clips and stills unveiled on Monday evening appeared to showed the person wearing a hat or winter head covering that came down over their ears and covered the lower part of their face. The person was not visibly carrying anything in their hands.The individual is considered likely to be armed and dangerous, the Rhode Island attorney general, Peter Neronha, earlier told a reporter for CNN on Monday afternoon.This followedthe releasefrom custody by the authorities of a previous person of interest who had initially been detained in the case.The atmosphere on campus and in the New England city remained one of fear and intense vigilance on Monday.The two students who died in Saturday’s tragedy at the elite Ivy League university in Rhode Island were being remembered.Ella Cook, a second-year student from Alabama, was “an incredible, grounded, faithful, bright light”, according to the Cathedral Church of the Advent, Birmingham, which paid tribute to her at a service on Sunday.Cook was vice-president of Brown’s chapter of College Republicans of America,the group said. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, alsopostedcondolences to X, saying in part: “There are no words. Thinking of her family and friends, especially her parents.”Ella Cook.Photograph: GoFundMeThe other person killed was MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, an Uzbek national in his first year of studies at the university, family members said.Umurzokov’s identity was confirmed by Uzbekistan’s foreign ministry.“He was incredibly kind, funny, and smart. He had big dreams of becoming a neurosurgeon and helping people,” his sister, Samira Umurzokova, said in a tribute on a GoFundMe campaign meant to support his family.Nine other people were hurt in Saturday’s attack in the engineering building of Brown’s campus in Providence, during the school’s final exam period.Authorities said late Sunday that a 24-year-man arrested in a raid at a Hampton Inn about 17 miles from the campus earlier in the day was being released.“We have a murderer out there,” Neronha said at a press conference.“Sometimes you head in one direction, and then you have to regroup and go in another, and that’s exactly what has happened over the last 24 hours or so.”View image in fullscreenMukhammadAziz Umurzokov.Photograph: GoFundMeBrett Smiley, Providence’s mayor, acknowledged: “We know that this is likely to cause fresh anxiety for our community”.The gunman opened fire inside a classroom in the engineering building on Saturday afternoon, firing more than 40 rounds from a 9mm handgun, a law enforcement official told the Associated Press.Law enforcement that raided the hotel recovered two handguns and two loaded 30-round magazines when the initial person of interest was taken into custody, the news agency reported.Of the nine hurt, one student was released from the hospital, said Christina Paxson, Brown’s president. Seven others were in critical but stable condition, and one was in critical condition, police said on Sunday.Durham Academy, a private K-12 school in Durham, North Carolina, said Kendall Turner, a recent graduate, was among those critically wounded.“Our school community is rallying around Kendall, her classmates, and her loved ones, and we will continue to offer our full support in the days ahead,” the school said in a statement, adding that her parents were with her at the hospital.Cook was rememberedat a church servicein Birmingham on Sunday. “She was an incredible, grounded, faithful bright light not only here growing up here at the advent in the myriad ways in which she served faithfully, and the ways in which she encouraged and lift up those around her, but at Brown University she was an incredible light in that particular place as well,” said the Rev R Craig Smalley.Martin Bertao, president of College Republicans of America, posted a statement from the group to X. “Ella was known for her bold, brave, and kind heart as she served her chapter and fellow classmates,” he said.“Our prayers are with her family, our Brown [College Republicans], and the entirety of the campus as they heal from this tragedy.”Jonathan Henick, US ambassador to Uzbekistan, said he was “deeply saddened” by Umurzokov’s death ina tributeposted to his embassy’s website.“We extend our sincere condolences to Mr Umurzokov’s family, friends, and fellow students and mourn the loss of his bright future,” he wrote, adding the Uzbek words “marhumni Xudo rahmat qilsin”, which meansmay God have mercy on the deceased.“He always lent a helping hand to anyone in need without hesitation, and was the most kind-hearted person our family knew. Our family is incredibly devastated by this loss,” Umurzokov’s sister said in a statement accompanying the GoFundMe appeal.Saturday’s killings at Brown, the nation’s seventh-oldest higher education institution with about 7,300 undergraduate and 3,000 graduate students, occurred during one of at least 392 mass shootings reported in the US so far in 2025, according to theGun Violence Archive. Monday was the 349th day of the year.The Gun Violence Archive, a non-partisan resource, defines mass shootings as ones in which four or more victims are wounded or killed.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsBrown University shootingUS school shootingsUS crimeRhode IslandnewsShareReuse this content"

We will need something big and new to spread money around if some super-human intelligence comes for all the jobs. But a UBI, as contemplated by its current cheerleaders, does not start to address the real challenges of an economy that has moved past human labor.Ask a truck driver (Yang was worried about truck drivers) to live on $1,000 a month. A two-parent, two-kid family on the “Freedom Dividend” would be pretty deep under water, living on 25% less than needed to poke through the poverty line.The bill to provide every adult a guaranteed income worth, say, $53,000 per year, equivalent to the median earnings of American workers, would add up to over $14tn, about 45% of the United States’ gross domestic product (GDP). Good luck to the politician running on a platform to fund this brave new world.To put it in perspective, since 1980, the first year for which the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmentpublishes that data, public social spending in the United States – covering health, pensions, disability, unemployment insurance and all that – has never hit 25% of the GDP. Indeed, since the 1960s, the aggregate tax revenue raised by all levels of government has never reached 30% of GDP.And this doesn’t even consider how challenging redistribution will become once AI kills all labor income, which today generates most tax revenue.Yang suggested funding his “Freedom Dividend” with a value added tax. This is a tax on consumption that the US does not use but funds a big chunk of Europe’s welfare states. It has merits: It can raise a lot of money, because it is easy to collect at the store checkout, and it does not sap incentives to work and invest, as income taxes do. But it seems a bit ridiculous to propose a world without work in which the livelihoods of most people are funded with a tax on what they buy.If it meets its investors’ lofty expectations, the AI-powered economy will be radically different from what we know, driving the cost of machines that substitute for human labor below the cost of human subsistence. Nobel economist Wassily Leontief’s observation about horses comes to mind: “the role of humans as the most important factor of production is bound to diminish in the same way that the role of horses in agricultural production was first diminished and then eliminated by the introduction of tractors.”Maybe we can keep humanity alive via redistribution. Machines that don’t require workers could produce enormous amounts of output, so it might be easy to raise the money for the UBIs of the future.Given there would be no workers, taxes would have to be raised on something else: carbon emissions, perhaps, or other stuff producing bad externalities, or land, which can be taxed without discouraging production. But this world would likely require substantial taxation of the owners of the robots.And this would raise new questions about power: Who would determine how much everybody gets? More than likely it would be the select gang of tech oligarchs who own the machines. In an economy in which the labor share of income has gone to zero, the owners of capital end up reaping it all.To quote economist Erik Brynjolfsson, who runs the digital economy lab at Stanford University: In this world, most of us “would depend precariously on the decisions of those in control of the technology.” Society would risk “being trapped in an equilibrium where those without power have no way to improve their outcomes”.UBI has features that would prove valuable in an AI-driven future. It does away with the work requirements that often come with welfare, a desirable feature when human work makes no sense. But it fails to address key challenges, notably the enormous built-in inequality that the AI economy would bring about, which might demand redistributing not income but capital ownership in the robots themselves.Problematically, UBI does not meet the challenge of the present either. America’s current quandary is not zero employment but a large footprint of service jobs that do not provide a living wage. A universal benefit is an extraordinarily expensive tool to fix that, though. A wage subsidy would do much better. How about we improve the design of the earned income tax credit, signed into law by president, Gerald Ford, in 1975?Less work – as in fewer working hours – does not necessarily require a new paradigm. Australians work 20% less than Americans already; Danes and Finns work 24% less. Spaniards work two-thirds as many hours per day as Americans, on average; the French only 62% as much; Italians about half. These countries don’t rely on UBI, just on a halfway decent social safety net. Before the US tries to reconfigure its welfare state, it might just try that.Explore more on these topicsUS economyEconomicsUniversal basic incomeArtificial intelligence (AI)analysisShareReuse this content"

The company expects its global mix of hybrids, extended-range EVs and pure EVs to reach 50% by 2030, from 17% today.Ford will spread out the writedown, taken primarily in the fourth quarter and continuing through next year and into 2027, the company said. About $8.5bn is related to cancelling planned EV models. Around $6bn is tied to the dissolution of a battery joint venture with South Korea’s SK On, and $5bn on what Ford called “program-related expenses”.Ford’s shift reflects the auto industry’s response to waning demand for battery-powered models, after car companies plowed hundreds of billions of dollars into EV investments early this decade. The outlook for electrics dimmed significantly this year as Donald Trump’s policies yanked federal support for EVs and eased tailpipe-emissions rules, which could encourage carmakers to sell more gas-powered cars.US sales of electric vehicles fell about 40% in November, following the September 30 expiration of a $7,500 consumer tax credit, which had been in place for more than 15 years to stoke demand. The Trump administration also included in the massive tax and spending bill that passed in July a freeze on fines that automakers pay for violating fuel-economy regulations.“Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas,” said Andrew Frick, head of Ford’s gas and electric-vehicle operations.The F-150 Lightning rolled off assembly lines starting in 2022 with much fanfare Comedian Jimmy Fallon wrote a song about the truck. Ford increased production of the model to meet an influx of 200,000 orders, but sales haven’t kept pace.The company sold 25,583 Lightnings through November of this year, a 10% decrease from the prior-year period.The successor to the F-150 Lightning, the T3 truck, was supposed to be built ground-up for production at a new complex in Tennessee, and be a core part of Ford’s second-generation EV lineup. Ford is now replacing production of the EV pickup with new gas-powered trucks starting in 2029 at the Tennessee factory.Ford effectively killed the entirety of its announced second-generation of EV models with Monday’s announcement.For its future EV lineup, the company is shifting focus to more affordable EV models, conceived by a so-called skunkworks team in California. The first model from that team is slated to be priced at about $30,000 and go on sale in 2027. This midsize EV truck is being built at Ford’s Louisville plant.Explore more on these topicsFordAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

In the midst of harvest season this year,Hurricane Melissa, a record-breaking category 5 hurricane, made landfall in Jamaica.“It was terrifying,” said Salmon, whose wife and two children were at home near Black River, a town on the country’s south-western coast. “For days, I couldn’t hear from them. When I finally did, I heard my roof was completely gone. My wife and kids had to run for their lives, but thank God they’re alive.”Anestimated90,000 households and 360,000 people have been affected by the damage wrought by Hurricane Melissa in Jamaica. Salmon is one ofroughly 5,000Jamaican workers who come to the US each year on an H-2A visa.The H-2A guest worker visa program allows US farms and agricultural firms to hire foreign workers for temporary jobs. It plays a significant role in the US’s agriculture industry, which remains reliant on overseas labor at crucial points on the calendar: last year,more than 380,000 workerswere authorized for H-2A visas, about 15% of the US agricultural workforce.“Our boss, he would tell us he likes the H-2A program because you can be there this year and next year he doesn’t have to bring us back,” said Salmon, who works at Wafler Farms in Wolcott, New York. “He threatened us if we didn’t work fast, and there was nobody to stop him.”“Dozens of workers” who “did nothing wrong” have not been able to return from one year to the next, Salmon claimed. Wafler Farms denied this, claiming they have never not recalled workers but are “required to actively recruit US workers and are required to offer any positions to them before we hire a worker through the H-2A program”.Salmon is one of several New York farm workers represented by the United Farm Workers, which haslaunched a fundraiserto rebuild their homes, and those of other union workers hit by the hurricane.“I came home to see what was going on, and everything was gone. No house, nothing,” said Damian, a H-2A farm worker fromJamaicawho has worked at Cahoon Farms in Wolcott, New York. Apprehensive about his US work status, he declined to provide his surname. “It’s something that took 20 to 30 years to build, and in just a few hours, it’s gone now.”A week before the storm, Damian’s wife had a baby. He said he has struggled to care for his family since flying home in the aftermath of the hurricane. “Here, if you don’t have a job, what are you supposed to do? I’m just hoping for the best,” he said. “It’s terrible.”Marley, who also declined to provide his surname, has worked at Cahoon Farms in New York since 2018, alongside Damian. He was there when the storm hit Jamaica, where his mother and children live.“I was just hoping and praying that I could reach home before the storm,” said Marley. “When I heard my home was destroyed, I was devastated.”He has since made it back to Jamaica, but has been unable to get in touch with dozens of friends and co-workers.Reports ofprice gouginghave materialized since the hurricane. Marley said his family has grappled with price hikes on food, with several staples such as flour still unavailable.“It’s not easy,” he said. “Most of my friends, I can’t get in touch with them, and I still feel for them. And I’m not going to be comfortable till I hear from all of those guys.”Most of the roofs on homes in Salmon’s community in the Black River area of Jamaica are gone, Salmon said. Building materials are expensive – and have soared in cost since the hurricane.Every year, he said, farm workers from Jamaica leave their homes and families to work on US farms, often for low wages and in poor working conditions.In 2022, Salmon and his co-workers unionized. A Wayne county judgerecently upheldthe New York state labor board decision to certify the union, as the employer had argued that H-2A guest workers couldn’t unionize while refusing to recognize the union.Following the ruling, Wafler Farms has “begun coordinating with the UFW to move forward with the implementation of the bargaining agreement”, a spokesperson said.“Regarding Hurricane Melissa, we recognize the devastating impact it had on Jamaica and its people, with widespread damage to homes across the island,” they added. “In the aftermath of the storm, Wafler Farms made donations to several reputable humanitarian organizations actively involved in housing recovery and community support.“We also shared information about these organizations with our workers so they could access support if they or their families were affected. We understand that some workers created a GoFundMe campaign upon returning to Jamaica to further assist with rebuilding efforts. We encourage anyone who wishes to contribute to do so through the avenue they feel will best support the recovery process.”Cahoon Farms did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationFarmingJamaicaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Washington has paused the implementation of the agreement, citing a lack of progress from the UK in lowering trade barriers in other areas.British officials sought to downplay the development, which wasfirst reportedby the New York Times. The newspaper said Trump’s administration was unhappy about the UK continuing to levy a digital services tax on American tech companies and its food safety rules, which bar the export of certain agricultural products.One British government source said it was “the usual bit of hardball negotiations by the Americans” and said that thedeal to allow tariff-free British pharmaceutical exports to the USwas on and off before it was finalised.“[The US commerce secretary] Howard Lutnick is a tough guy. We understand that the Americans negotiate incredibly hard but we’ll stand our ground. They want what’s best for their country, we want what’s best for ours,” the source said.A second government source said the development was “part of the shape of the negotiations” with Washington.The prosperity deal included the creation of an artificial intelligence “growth zone” in the north-east of England, which UK officials said could bring in up to £30bn and create 5,000 jobs.Starmer to pick new US ambassador as relations with Trump testedRead moreBut the text of the agreement stated that it only “becomes operative alongside substantive progress being made to formalise and implement” it.The decision to put it on hold is a blow to the UK government, which touted the agreement as a prize of its intensive year-long engagement with the US to avoid punitive tariffs on British exports. As part of his diplomatic charm offensive, Starmer hosted Trump for a second state visit at Windsor Castle in September, an unprecedented honour for a US president.Starmer has resisted US pressure to scrap or amend the digital services tax, a 2% levy on the revenues of tech companies including Amazon, Google and Apple that raises about £800m a year. Trumphas repeatedly threatened to retaliateagainst countries with digital taxes, including the UK.The Guardian revealedthat during trade negotiations in the spring, the government drew up proposals to reduce the amount paid by US tech companies and by applying the tax to a wider range of companies without reducing its total take. But so far the tax has remained unchanged.The US has also exerted pressure over the UK’s online safety rules, with officials promising to review their enforcement during the talks.A third area of contention has been the UK’s food safety regime, with ministers admitting that the US has raised objections to it. As part of the trade deal the government agreed to lower tariffs on some US agricultural products including beef, but it has stood by its manifesto commitment not to water down farming standards.Any decision to weaken these could open the door to Americanchlorine-washed chickenor hormone-treated beef being sold in Britain, a prospect that has long been highly controversial with farmers and consumer groups.At a press conference at Chequers in September, where he unveiled the tech prosperity deal, Starmer said it had “the power to change lives” and “renewed the special relationship for a new era”.“It’s our chance to ensure that technologies like AI, quantum and others amplify human potential, solve problems, cure diseases, make us richer and freer, strengthen democracy not tyranny,” the prime minister said. “This is the territory on which the future will be won.”Trump at the time said the deal would help the US and UK “dominate” in the world ofartificial intelligenceand “ensure our countries lead the next great technological revolution side by side”.Peter Kyle, the business and trade secretary, was in the US last week for negotiations with Lutnick, the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, and the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. Their discussions touched on whisky and steel tariffs and collaboration on critical minerals. Kyle’s department said talks were due to continue in January.A UK government spokesperson said: “Our special relationship with the US remains strong and the UK is firmly committed to ensuring the tech prosperity deal delivers opportunity for hard-working people in both countries.”The Guardian reportedat the weekend that Starmer was poised to choose his new ambassador to Washington after interviewing the three finalists last week. The three shortlisted candidates are the prime minister’s business adviser, Varun Chandra, who was central to negotiating the prosperity deal; Christian Turner, the incoming ambassador to the UN; and Nigel Casey, the ambassador to Russia.Explore more on these topicsTrade policyForeign policyTechnology sectorArtificial intelligence (AI)Donald TrumpKeir StarmerInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

The company warned earlier this month that it could face bankruptcy.The iRobot chief executive, Gary Cohen, said the deal with Picea would strengthen the company’s financial position.“By combining iRobot’s innovation, consumer-driven design, and research and development with Picea’s history of innovation, manufacturing and technical expertise, we believe iRobot will be well-equipped to shape the next era of smart home robotics,” he said.The deal with Picea comes three years after Amazon first offered to buy iRobot at a valuation of $1.4bn (£1.1bn), as part of an effort to bolster its portfolio of consumer technology products such as its Alexa smart speakers and Ring doorbells.However, thedeal ultimately fell throughover a clash with competition authorities in the EU.iRobot received $94m in compensation for the collapse of the deal, but part of this was used to pay advisory fees and repay a portion of a loan from the private equity group Carlyle. Last month, Picea’s Hong Kong subsidiary acquired the remainder of the debt.The company’s acquisition by a Chinese company could reignite concerns over surveillance. Amazon’s attempt to buy iRobotraised fears among privacy campaignersthat the tech company would have access to floor plans of users’ homes using the vacuum cleaner’s mapping features.The bankruptcy plan will allow iRobot to remain as a going concern and continue to meet its commitments to employees, make payments in full to vendors and other creditors, the company said in a statement.iRobot, which was founded in 1990 by three roboticists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, helped pioneer robotic products for consumers.Many recent versions of the Roomba have included features that are controlled through the brand’s app. The company said the bankruptcy filing was not expected to disrupt its app, supply chains or product support.iRobot, which made a net loss of $145.5m last year, was valued at more than $3bn in 2021 thanks to strong demand for household cleaning products during the pandemic. It is now valued at about $137m.On Friday, iRobot shares fell by more than 13% in New York. It has lost about 45% of its market value in the year to date.Explore more on these topicsManufacturing sectorRobotsnewsShareReuse this content"

But then, yet more horrific defending allowed Eli Junior Kroupi, on as a substitute, to score Bournemouth’s third equaliser and the points were shared.Fernandes’s strike was a pinpoint curled free-kick and Cunha’s finish came 120 seconds later when Benjamin Sesko’s cross from the left hit Adrien Truffert and diverted into the Brazilian’s path.Manchester United 4-4 Bournemouth: Premier League – as it happenedRead moreBefore this, United were heading for Aston Villa on Sunday in a foul mood and staring at a miserable Christmas Day if another defeat followed. Instead, despite Kroupi’s intervention, a single defeat in 10 games is a run that speaks of United’s upward trajectory under Ruben Amorim, though their defending is amateurish.His side havescored the same 30goals as Arsenal yet conceded 26, the same as Fulham who are 14th, eight places lower.This game’s charge sheet featured silly errors from Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot, questionable Senne Lammens goalkeeping, and leaden-footed positioning by Ayden Heaven and Leny Yoro. Amorim claimed he does not need to bolster the defensive ranks so the onus is on him to improve the current ones. The plus is United’s forward play. Twelve minutes in and Amad Diallo began and finished a move.Along the right he pinged the ball to Casemiro who relayed it to Dalot along the left. A diagonal pass was dropped into Bournemouth’s area, Cunha missed a header and the ball hit Djordje Petrovic, leaving the goalkeeper helpless to prevent the Ivorian nodding in from under the bar.The strike was the culmination of a bright United phase. Now, the first bit of dubious backline work. Antoine Semenyo hurled a long throw high into United’s area that needed Casemiro’s aerial acumen to clear. Then, when Justin Kluivert popped up on the right, a delivery picked out Marcus Tavernier whose close-range header was beaten out by Lammens before the ball went to safety.View image in fullscreenBruno Fernandes curls in Manchester United’s third goal from a free-kick.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAAmorim’s setup was interesting, considering the hue and cry over his 3-4-3. Intrigue came in the warm-up when United had a quartet of defenders in luminous bibs. Was the head coach finally to send out a back four of Dalot, Leny Yoro, Ayden Heaven, and Shaw? The answer was no as Diallo then donned a bib. Yet while United defended in a five, when attacking, the No 16 pushed ahead to leave a four.Diallo enjoyed himself before jetting off to join up with Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco. A zigzag run took him into the area, before being thwarted by Adam Smith. And, next, a moment of fantasy that was a throwback to the great United sides. A no-look Cunha cross swerved on to the boot of a flying Bryan Mbeumo, whose volley came agonisingly close to thundering home.United were pummelling Bournemouth and still they conceded. Shaw was bullied by Kluivert on United’s left touchline. Smith fed Semenyo and, 40 yards out, he dashed in and beat Lammens, shooting across the keeper, into the corner. Shaw was as furious with himself as Amorim surely was.Then came a Dalot-Semenyo flareup. The former shoved the latter over, backing in when the Ghana international was mid-air – so the forward grabbed his throat. Each was booked for their pains. The half ended sweetly for United. Fernandes’s corner from the left was headed in by Casemiro, past Petrovic’s powder-puff hands – and Shaw had an equal in the culprit stakes.Bournemouth’s second equaliser was due, in part, to Yoro and Heaven whose defending was lax, plus a killer Tavernier pass that split the youngsters, and a cool Evanilson finish, who rolled the ball beyond the stationary Lammens – to his left.View image in fullscreenAntoine Semenyo fires home Bournemouth’s equaliser in the 40th minute at Old Trafford.Photograph: Phil Duncan/Every Second Media/ShutterstockIf this left Amorim visibly stunned, further uncertain play – from Dalot – ceded possession and presaged Tavernier’s goal. The defender lost the ball and United were turned as he raced at goal, so Casemiro felled him. The Englishman’s free-kick was drilled past a United wall that had Cunha and Fernandes to the side and this error was compounded by Lammens, who allowed the ball to pass him down low.United needed to locate some of the backbone Amorim likes to say they have. His team had allowed their grip to be loosened far too easily and on the hour, to a raucous cheer, the manager introduced Kobbie Mainoo for Casemiro. Could the 20-year-old, barely trusted by Amorim, help pull the contest from the fire? United did revive, Mbeumo, Mason Mount, Cunha and Fernandes all threatening.Amorim sent for Sesko and the No 9 from Slovenia, who has had an injury-hit season, wished the ball fell to him when Mbeumo blasted over. Now came the helter-skelter ending.The bottom line for United is a need for defensive solidity. Amorim’s system is supposed to give this but is just not doing so. Time for a rethink, Ruben? Of the injured Tyler Adams, Andoni Iraola said: “Its a twisted knee – we have to see.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester UnitedBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The team confirmed his ACL tear a few hours after the game.A source told the Associated Press on Monday that another of the league’s stars, Green Bay pass rusher Micah Parsons, also tore his ACL on Sunday, during his team’s loss to the Broncos.Philip Rivers: how a 44-year-old grandpa nearly pulled off one of the NFL’s greatest comebacksRead more“I may be sidelined, but I am not defeated,” Parsons said on Monday in a social media post. “This injury is my greatest test – a moment God allowed to strengthen my testimony. I believe HE walks with me through this storm and chose me for this fight because He knew my heart could carry it. I’m deeply grateful to the Packers organization and my teammates for their unwavering support, love and belief in me during this season. I trust His timing, His plan and His purpose. I will rise again. I love y’all!”The defeat to the Chargers means the Chiefs will miss the playoffs for the first time since 2014.Mahomes is scheduled to see Dr Dan Cooper, a highly regarded orthopedist and the team physician of the Dallas Cowboys, before the procedure to repair the ligament. The decision to seek a second opinion is merely to confirm the next steps in the quarterback’s recovery process.“I’ve had a good visit with him, a couple of different times. He’s in a good place,” Reid said on a Zoom call Monday. “You know, he always feels like he let people down, but he comes back and he’s ready for the challenge ahead, which is what is real right now. He’s just got to get through surgery, whenever it might be, and then move on from there.”There are a number of factors that go into how long the recovery time will be, including the severity of the ACL tear and whether any other damage occurred within the knee. Most players are able to return to the field in six to 12 months.“I think he’ll attack it, just like he does everything else,” Reid said. “There have been some pretty good quarterbacks that have had the same injury and done pretty well after they came back. He’ll get after it, and he’s got good people here to rehab him.”Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow toe the ACL and MCL in his left knee in November 2020 but returned to play the following season, and he was voted the NFL’s Comeback Player of the Year. Colts quarterback Daniel Jones tore his right ACL in November 2023 when he was with the Giants, and he came back to start Week 1 the following season.The Chiefs do not have another quarterback besides Mahomes signed for next season, so the last three weeks of this season could be an audition for veteran backup Gardner Minshew, who finished out the loss to the Chargers on Sunday.He completed three straight passes before an interception on a throw intended for Travis Kelce effectively ended the game.“I’ve got a ton of confidence in Gardner,” Reid said. “I’ve watched him play with these other teams. He’s started in the league. Our guys have confidence in him, and Chris Oladokun behind him will work, and he’s been with us a while. Those are two guys we trust.”Explore more on these topicsPatrick MahomesKansas City ChiefsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

And he showed brains are almost important as brawn at his positionDoug FarrarMon 15 Dec 2025 03.15 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 09.43 ESTShareIs quarterbackthe most demanding position in sports? It’s close enough to make no difference: players must memorize a complicated playbook, orchestrate an entire offense, scan for open receivers while 280lb opponents sprint toward them with violent intent, and then thread a pass to a target who could be 30 yards downfield amid a crowd of defenders. Now try doing all that as a 44-year-old grandfather, exactly 1,800 days since you last started an NFL game.Philip Rivers broke a historic streak for theIndianapolis Coltson Sunday. The longest layoff between games before then belonged to another 44-year-old quarterback who returned to action after years out of the game, and some time in coaching – Steve DeBerg for the Atlanta Falcons in 1998.After injuries suffered by starting quarterback Daniel Jones and rookie backup Riley Leonard, the primary reason that the Colts invested in this seeming impossibility in the first place is Rivers’ familiarity with head coach Shane Steichen’s passing game. Steichen had several years of working closely with Rivers at the Chargers, where the quarterback played most of his 16-season career before his first retirement, so at least the offensive designs and play calls would be familiar.NFL roundup: Mahomes tears ACL as Chiefs miss playoff for first time since 2014Read moreAt St Michael Catholic High School in Fairhope, Alabama, where Rivers had been the head coach since 2021, Rivers’ players were excited, and swore that the offense run there was similar to what Steichen had run with Rivers, and a familiar iteration to what Steichen runs now with the Colts. Without that previous Rivers-Steichen connection, asking the old man to come back and face any NFL defense, never mind a Seahawks defense that came into this game ranked first overall in DVOA, would have been the ultimate fool’s errand.And Sunday’s game went about as well as you’d expect at first.Rivers had a bit of the old Sonny Jurgensen gut going on, and as far as the velocity of his throws … well, my Guardian colleague Ollie Connollyhad jokes.But as the game progressed, Rivers’ immense football smarts – which have not diminished at the same rate as his body – showed up just enough to give the Seahawks’ top-ranked defense some trouble in their own stadium. In the end, Rivers completed 18 of 26 passes for 120 yards, a touchdown, one interception, and a passer rating of 91.8,and it was his 16-yard third-and-seven conversionon a backside fade ball to receiver Alec Pierce that helped set up what looked like Blake Grupe’s game-winning 60-yard field goal with 47 seconds remaining.However … Seahawks kicker Jason Myers, who made six field goals overall in Seattle’s 18-16 win, booted theactualgame-winner with 22 seconds on the clock. Rivers’ subsequent deep interception to safety Coby Bryant with 11 seconds left brought the curtain down.Regardless of the result, what Rivers did after such a long time off was remarkable, and unprecedented inNFLhistory. To travel over 2,000 miles to the NFL’s toughest home stadium and put on this performance shows the power of the football mind, if the football body is able to do just enough. The 8-6 Colts have the San Francisco 49ers, the Jacksonville Jaguars, and the Houston Texans to finish the regular season, a brutal final slate. It will be fascinating to see what Rivers can accomplish with more reps in the upcoming weeks. One thing he’s not worried about is the physical side of the game.“I never minded that part of it,” Rivers said on Sunday. “My wife always tells me I’m crazy because there’s been times in the last three or four years I said, ‘I wish I could just throw one and get hit – hard.’”View image in fullscreenPatrick Mahomes’s season came to an abrupt end on Sunday.Photograph: Reed Hoffmann/APVideo of the weekIf one video can speak a thousand words, it would be the clip of what happened to Patrick Mahomes with two minutes left in the Kansas City Chiefs’ 16-13 loss to the Chargers. Mahomes was trying to drive his team to field-goal range when he suffered a torn ACL, an injury that ends his season.Patrick Mahomes is down with an injury.pic.twitter.com/FxbvdRc1yn— Henry McKenna (@henrycmckenna)December 14, 2025The result means the 6-8 Chiefs will miss the postseason for the first time since 2014. During that span they won three Super Bowls and reached the AFC Championship Game seven times, and much of that success was down to Mahomes’s brilliance. The Chiefs, whohave a litany of issues to solvethis offseason, may not have the face of their franchise ready to go when the 2026 season begins.View image in fullscreenTrevor Lawrence has plenty of reasons to be cheerful at the moment.Photograph: John Raoux/APMVP of the weekTrevor Lawrence, QB, Jacksonville Jaguars.Sometimes, it takes a quarterback a while to get the hang of a new offense. This was the case for Lawrence this season, and his ability to get new head coach Liam Coen’s system under his belt. Coen was hired to turn Lawrence into the “generational” talent that was promised when the franchise selected him with the first overall pick in the 2021 draft. Lawrence has faced all kinds of barriers, from subpar players around him, to havingUrban Meyer as his head coachin his rookie campaign, to dealing with three different offensive coordinators in five years, to his own mechanical issues.Coen had built his equity on his time in Sean McVay’s coaching staff with the Los Angeles Rams, and the fabulous job he did as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ offensive coordinator with Baker Mayfield in 2024. Still, this initially looked like a rough partnership. In Weeks 1-12, Lawrence completed 220 of 368 passes for 2,407 yards, 14 touchdowns, 11 interceptions, and a passer rating of 79.4, which ranked him 27th among NFL quarterbacks. But from Week 13 though Sunday’s 48-20 win over the New York Jets, Lawrence has been a completely different player, completing 53 of 89 passes for 803 yards, nine touchdowns, no interceptions, and a quarterback rating of 123.0.On Sunday, Lawrence accounted for six touchdowns –five through the air, and one on the ground. The Jaguars are 10-4, and they’ll have opponents wondering how to stop this suddenly marvelous offense once the postseason comes around.Stat of the week120.That’s how many consecutive gamesthe New England Patriots had wonin which they led by 21 or more points. That NFL-best run came to an end on Sunday, as the Buffalo Bills came back from a 21-0 second-quarter deficit to win 35-31, and keep their AFC East hopes alive. Early on, the now 11-3 Patriots looked like an unstoppable machine, while the 10-4 Bills couldn’t stop tripping over themselves.The Bills needed to do something to turn this around, and they did. In the second half, Allen completed 13 of 20 passes for 158 yards and two touchdowns. Buffalo’s sketchy defense also stepped up in the run game, while James Cook had two touchdowns on the ground.Buffalo, who had won the division in each of the last five seasons, and New England, who had won itevery single yearfrom 2009 through 2019, have split their 2025 series. The Bills have the Cleveland Browns, Philadelphia Eagles, and Jets left on their regular-season schedule, while the Patriots have the Jets, the Baltimore Ravens and the Miami Dolphins. Right now, it seems that the AFC East could belong to either team.View image in fullscreenJoe Burrow has had another tough season with the Bengals.Photograph: Carolyn Kaster/APElsewhere around the league– Since the Cincinnati Bengals took him with the first overall pick in the 2020 draft, Joe Burrow has been one of the NFL’s best quarterbacks … when he’s been allowed to be. Burrow has been hurt by horrible defenses and struggling offensive lines of late, and though he has one of the NFL’s best receiver duos in Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, the Bengals’ 4-10 record this season isn’t what Burrow – who missed much of the season with turf toe – or anybody else had in their hopes.Perhaps more disconcerting were the comments Burrow made leading up to Cincinnati’s 24-0 Sunday loss to the Baltimore Ravens. “If I want to keep doing this, I have to have fun doing it,”the quarterback said. “I’ve been through a lot, and if it’s not fun, then what am I doing it for? So, that’s the mindset I’m trying to bring to the table.”This is not to imply that Burrow is on the edge of a surprise retirement as Andrew Luck was in 2019 – and the man himselfhas said he is committed to the team– but as the Bengals limp to the end of the regular season and start to formulate their plans for the future, it does bear a bit of watching.– Say hello to the Denver Broncos, who now own the NFL’s best record at 12-2, and became one of two teams to clinch a postseason berth on Sunday. Denver did so by beating the Green Bay Packers, 34-26, and the 9-4-1 Packers may well have lost more than the game. Receiver Christian Watson, possibly the team’s most important offensive player not named Jordan Love, sufferedwhat looked to be a serious chest injury, and edge rusher Micah Parsons, without question the team’s most important defensive player,is believed to have torn his ACL, which would end his season. The Parsons injury is particularly brutal for the Packers, who gave up first-round picks in 2026 and 2027, along with defensive tackle Kenny Clark, for the four-time Pro Bowler. Parsons had been great for Green Bay, and without him, the Packers’ pressure possibilities do not remotely resemble what they were with him.- Back on the Denver side, second-year quarterback Bo Nix threw four touchdowns against Jeff Hafley’s complicated defense. Nix is a primary reason, along with Denver’s monstrous defense, that nobody should want to come anywhere near the Mile High City in the playoffs.– The Seahawks may have (barely) escaped embarrassment against the Colts on Sunday, but they have very little time to enjoy it. On Thursday, they welcome the Los Angeles Rams to Lumen Field, and the Rams are fresh off their 41-34 defense-optional win over the Detroit Lions. At 11-3, the Rams became the first team to clinch a playoff berth, and if they beat the Seahawks (also 11-3) at home, they’ll sweep the season series, and the NFC West will basically be theirs.In the first meeting between these two teams, Seattle nearly won despite Sam Darnold’s four interceptions, and the Rams have been Darnold’s bete noire over the last two seasons. Darnold got off to a rollicking start this season, his first with the Seahawks, but the offense has been a bit stuck since that Week 11 loss. Now is the time for Darnold to tell those old ghosts to go away.Explore more on these topicsIndianapolis ColtsNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So why does the Ally Pally crowd enjoy goading him?Jonathan Liewat Alexandra PalaceMon 15 Dec 2025 16.34 ESTFirst published on Mon 15 Dec 2025 15.20 ESTShareBy the time Cameron Menzies finally leaves the arena, theblood gushing from the gash on his right handhas trickled its way down the whole hand, down his wrist, part of his forearm and – somehow – up to his face. Smeared in crimson and regret, and already mouthing sheepish apologies to the crowd, he disappears down the steps, pursued by a stern-looking Matt Porter, the chief executive of the Professional Darts Corporation.The physical scars from Menzies’s encounter with the Alexandra Palace drinks table after his 3-2 defeat against Charlie Manby will be gone within a few weeks. Most probably there will be a fine of some sort. What about the rest? Man loses game of darts, punches table three times in fury, goes to hospital, repents at leisure: simple cause and effect. But of course this is not, and this is never, the whole story. In a way this tale is a kind of parable for elite darts itself, a pub game elevated to the level of a prize-fight, even – very occasionally – a bloodsport.Title hopeful Bunting survives huge scare at PDC World ChampionshipRead moreCredit, first of all, where due. The 20-year-old Manby is clearly going to be some talent: a star of the Modus Super Series who this year posted a mind-bending average of 130.7 on the Development Tour, smashing the previous record held by Luke Littler. This was his debut on the big stage, and he owned it thoroughly.Twelve months ago, Menzies was on this same stage, playing his first-round game against Leonard Gates of the US. The crowd didn’t need an excuse to goad him, but in the likable Texan they had one anyway. As Gates edged into the lead, boisterous support for the underdog spilled into something a little nastier. Menzies was jeered every time he missed a double. Before long they were jeering the missed doubles and missed singles too.A skittish and anxious player even at the best of times, Menzies started to choke up. From a distance, he appeared to be displaying the classic signs of a panic attack. He lost 3-1, left the stage in tears, pursued by a chorus of “Scotland get battered, everywhere they go”. Unbeknown to everyone, his father was in hospital recovering from a triple heart bypass. Menzies would later describe it as one of the darkest times of his life.Of course pantomime villains have been part of the Palace liturgy since way back. Gerwyn Price used to get it, and Peter Manley before him. But Menzies is nobody’s idea of a hard-bitten, shit-talking heel. He’s a wry, funny, slightly daft ex-plumber who wears his heart on his sleeve. So why do the Ally Pally crowd take such pleasure in tearing strips off him?Being Scottish is a factor, but Gary Anderson and Peter Wright get nothing like the same treatment. Maybe some find his histrionics a distraction. Chris Dobey has named him as one of the most irritating players on tour because of that sense of constant theatre, the emotions and the contortions, a player teetering on the edge of a precipice, whose toughest opponent has often seemed to be himself.View image in fullscreenCameron Menzies rues missing a double in his match against Charlie Manby.Photograph: Godfrey Pitt/Action Plus/ShutterstockBut ultimately the reason the Alexandra Palace crowd get at Menzies is they know he can be got at. If you’ve ever fancied influencing the outcome of a darts game, the world No 26 gives you maximum bang for your bark. He suffers. He miscounts. He misses. You will get under his skin, and you will know you’ve got under his skin, and so you will keep trying. If his ex-partner Fallon Sherrock was Queen of the Palace, Menzies is more akin to its whipping boy.The irony is that for long periods Menzies was successfully hushing the crowd. He led 2-1 in sets, grabbing the third with a sublime 11-dart leg, and despite a little queasiness on the doubles looked fully in control. But as Manby rallied, levelling at 2-2 and then breaking the Menzies throw in the deciding set, the volume began to swell, a kind of madness rolling in at the edges, a dark fog of chaos and doom.By the time Menzies had fatally miscounted in a leg he had to win, throwing treble-20 on 66, his good sense had departed him entirely. Manby missed a dart for the match. Menzies returned with six required. He missed. Then hit a single-3. Flung his last dart aimlessly at the bull to bust his score, only for the referee, Kirk Bevins, to inform him that it was invalid, as he had already stepped past the oche.Finally, Manby finally claimed victory on double-1. Reeled across the stage in triumph. Sought out Menzies to offer his commiserations, only to discover that the hand he was expecting to shake was drenched in blood.Afterwards, Menzies issued a statement apologising for his behaviour. His uncle Gary had passed away last month, and it was on his mind, but he didn’t want anyone to think he was making excuses. And for all the spite and condemnation that will be flung his way, ultimately nobody will be harder on Menzies than Menzies himself: a man constantly trying and failing to balance his feelings for the sport, a man who you hope is getting the help he needs.He will be back next year, and so will the crowds, and he knows it will be 10 times worse next year, and he knows the PDC will do nothing. This is the pact, the dark side of darts’s golden age. Take a man with a history of mental health problems, throw him on stage in front of people who have seen him bleed on the television, chuck in some morning pints and a little petty English nationalism, and see what happens. The good news is that Menzies is a good enough player to conquer this stage eventually. The bad news is that he’ll need to be.In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or emailjo@samaritans.org.

Pavia posted a photo of him with his linemen at the ceremony with a message to voters for the trophy.Philip Rivers: how a 44-year-old grandpa nearly pulled off one of the NFL’s greatest comebacksRead more“F-All THE VOTERS,” Pavia wrote in all capital letters on his Instagram story with a thumbs-down emoji, “BUT.....FAMILY FOR LIFE.”The post went viral on social media. Pavia issued an apology on X.“Being a part of the Heisman ceremony last night as a finalist was such an honor,” Pavia wrote. “As a competitor, just like in everything I do I wanted to win. To be so close to my dream and come up short was painful. I didn’t handle those emotions well at all and did not represent myself the way I wanted to. I have much love and respect for the Heisman voters and the selection process, and I apologize for being disrespectful. It was a mistake, and I am sorry.”Mendoza received 643 of the 930 first-place votes, finishing with 2,362 points, well ahead of Pavia, who received 189 first-place votes and 1,435 points. Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love had 46 first-place votes and finished in third place (719 points), and Ohio State quarterback Justin Sayin finished in fourth with 432 points and eight first-place votes.“Fernando Mendoza is an elite competitor and a deserving winner of the award,” Pavia wrote on X. “I have nothing but respect for his accomplishments as well as the success that Jeremiyah and Julian had this season. I’ve been doubted my whole life. Every step of my journey I’ve had to break down doors and fight for myself, because I’ve learned that nothing would be handed to me.”Pavia, like Mendoza, engineered a turnaround for a football program that historically has known little success. It was Pavia‘s second season for the Commodores after starting his career at New Mexico State. He threw for 3,192 yards, 27 touchdowns and eight interceptions and rushed for 826 yards and nine TDs in 2025.“My family has always been in my corner, and my teammates, coaches and staff have my six,” Pavia wrote on X. “I love them – I am grateful for them – and I wouldn’t want anything to distract from that. I look forward to competing in front of my family and with my team one more time in the ReliaQuest Bowl.”Vanderbilt (10-2), who finished No 14 in the College Football Playoff final rankings, play No 23 Iowa (8-4) in the ReliaQuest Bowl on 31 December in Tampa, Florida.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Brooks bumped James on the way back down the court, earning his second technical foul and an ejection.‘I want them angry’: Dillon Brooks and the birth of a Canadian villainRead moreMore importantly, it gave the Lakers a free throw, but James missed the shot. On the ensuing possession, James was fouled on a three-point attempt by Devin Booker with 3.9 seconds left. The 40-year-old James – who finished with 26 points – missed the first free throw but made the final two to give the Lakers a 115-114 lead. Phoenix’s Grayson Allen got up an awkward shot at the buzzer, but it was blocked by James.Brooks and James have clashedever since the 2023 playoffs, when Brookscalled James “old”and said “I poke bears”. Each man had earned a technical foul earlier on Sunday after physical play between the pair. Asked about the incidents after the game, James appeared to relish his meetings with Brooks, who is 11 years his junior.“I just like to compete,” James said. “He’s going to compete. I’m going to compete. We’re going to get up in each other’s face. Try not to go borderline with it. I don’t really take it there. But we’re just competing and did that almost all the way to the end of the game.”Booker said he also enjoyed seeing James and Brooks compete. “Yeah, I mean there’s history there,” Booker said. “I love to see it.

How will the club respond in the post-Daniel Levy era?Sign up for Soccer with Jonathan Wilson hereJonathan WilsonMon 15 Dec 2025 10.40 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 11.52 ESTShareTottenham Hotspur, Thomas Frank said after Sunday’s3-0 defeat to Nottingham Forest, are “not a quick fix”. That’s been true for probably 40 years, since they lurched into financial crisis amid boardroom shenanigans in the 1980s, becoming the first soccer club to list on the stock exchange and embarking on a disastrous programme of diversification (the highlight perhaps being becoming Hummel’s distributor in the UK, a role they performed so badly that Southampton took a page of their own programme to blame Spurs for the fact that their shirts were not being delivered).Right now, Spurs would probably settle for even a little bit of a fix, a slow hint of progress, a flicker of hope, anything to break them out of the current grim spiral. They have won just one of their last seven league games. When they beat Everton on 26 October, they were third, five points behind the leaders. Sunday’s defeatleaves them 11th, 14 points behind Arsenal. Given that Spurs finished 17th last season, perhaps that is not so unexpected – and the compacted nature of the table means they are only four points off fifth and probable Champions League qualification. But, equally, 22 points represents their lowest Premier League tally after 16 games since 2008.It’s not just the results; it’s the manner of them. Only twice in their last 11 games have Spurs registered an xG of 1 or above. This season they’ve had four games when they’ve registered an xG of 0.3 or below: against Arsenal, Chelsea, Brentford and then at Nottingham Forest. A generous interpretation of Sunday’s defeat would be to say that the first goal was a shambolic defensive mix-up, the sort of thing that can happen when you try to play out from the back, particularly when players are low on confidence, that the second goal was possibly a brilliant strike or possibly a mis-hit cross, and that the third was an extraordinary drive from 22 yards. Goals like that will not fly in every week.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreExcept … both of Forest duo Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ibrahim Sangaré were given time to measure their shots, and those were far from the only three chances Forest created. Perhaps Spurs have become one of those sides to whom unfortunate things happen – think of the two goals they conceded in the first six minutes against Fulham, which were also the result of a long-range strike and the cheap concession of possession in a dangerous area – but they bear significant responsibility for that.The decline since the opening weeks of the season, when Spurs pushed Paris Saint-Germain to the limit in the Super Cup before losing on penalties and then won away at Manchester City, is striking. The lack of creativity is the obvious problem and it must be acknowledged that Spurs are without the injured Dominic Solanke, James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski. But at the same time they bought Xavi Simons, Mohammed Kudus and Mathys Tel at a combined price of £140m ($187m) in the summer, and brought in Randal Kolo Muani on loan; it’s not the barest of bones.Perhaps Frank prioritised sorting out the defence, which probably was the area most in need of improvement after the Ange Postecoglou era. But as results have deteriorated, confidence has waned and that is now affecting the back of the team as well. Or perhaps, coming from Brentford, Frank is less familiar with facing teams who habitually sit in a low block against his side and is struggling to find a way to break them down. At least until Sunday, home form had been the big concern: just two wins in eight league games at theTottenham HotspurStadium this season. Nothing is more likely to enrage a fanbase that was already protesting about ticket prices.Frank began slowly at both Brøndby and Brentford, but this is different. The scrutiny at a topPremier Leagueclub is of a different magnitude. There have been visible demonstrations of dissatisfaction from players – with the manager from Djed Spence and Micky van de Ven after the defeat to Chelsea, and from Spence on being substituted on Sunday; and with the fans – particularly after the Fulham defeat, when a frustrated Pedro Porro seemed to signal to his teammates not to applaud the stands in response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario.‘I kept a shotgun next to the bed’: when a Racing Santander duo stood up to FrancoRead moreHow does this play out? It’s very difficult to tell, given thedeparturein September of the chair Daniel Levy as the Lewis family who own the club took a more hands-on role. The summer signings and Frank’s appointment were all Levy’s doing. What the Lewis family and the new directors brought in this year think of those deals is open to question. Already, though, Frank is beginning to come under pressure; it’s just as well the Champions League draw has been relatively gentle, so they lie 11th in that table.The situation not quite irretrievable yet, but there are a lot of worrying signs.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

The Arsenal manager was even teed up to do so with a generous question in the press conference that followed his side’s 2-1 win against Wolves on Saturday. Had his team shown the toughness of champions by recovering from a 90th-minute concession to steal all three points? “That’s something very positive but I don’t put it down to resilience,” Arteta replied. It was of a piece with him essentially reading the riot act to his players. They had not turned up at the start, he suggested, and the less said about the closing stages, the better – apart from the last-gasp winner. It is rare to hear Arteta be so critical but he knew his team had got away with one and he wanted them to know, too. Arsenal have a rare blank midweek before they go to Everton for another 8pm kick-off next Saturday. The standards must be higher.David HytnerMatch report:Arsenal 2-1 Wolves2Glasner praises Palace’s performanceOliver Glasner rated Crystal Palace’s performance on Sunday as their best under him against Manchester City, even though it ended in a 3-0 defeat. Palace famously defeated Pep Guardiola’s side in the FA Cup final in May to win their first major trophy, but they could not follow that up with another victory at Selhurst Park despite an impressive performance in the first half. Glasner was happy with the application shown by his team after yet another hectic week, but he admitted they needed a more clinical edge to get past a team of City’s quality. “We were the most competitive but the result doesn’t show it,” he said. “We’re always talking about our performances, about our progress, many parts of the game I watched were excellent. We kept them to two finishes in the first half, one was a direct free-kick, but we were one down. It means the whole team must have defended really well and also created three or four big chances. It was excellent, but again, if you want to win, you need to take them in the right moments.”Ed AaronsMatch report:Crystal Palace 0-3 Manchester City3Woltemade woe settles derby dayFor any player, scoring an own goal is a horrible feeling. But scoring one as a striker, in a contest as fierce as the Wear-Tyne derby, must be extra hard to take. The Newcastle frontman Nick Woltemade cut a heartbroken figure at full time on the Stadium of Light pitch as he applauded the travelling fans. His second-half own goal, which would have been a brilliant header had he hit the back of therightnet, proved to be the difference as Newcastle endured defeat against Sunderland, handing their bitter rivals bragging rights in their first top-flight meeting since 2016. The Newcastle manager, Eddie Howe, said: “The goal came at a really bad time – Nick has not meant to do it but it has decided the game. I thought we had defended pretty well.” Woltemade has scored seven goals for Newcastle since arriving this summer, but the one at the wrong end may be the most significant to date.Emillia HawkinsMatch report:Sunderland 1-0 Newcastle4Ekitiké offers a versatile threatHugo Ekitiké was probably a bit miffed when his arrival at Liverpool was overshadowed by the record-breaking deal to acquire Alexander Isak. The Frenchmandid not come cheap at £79mand might have expected to be the focal point of the Liverpool attack this season. Against Brighton, Ekitiké offered evidence of his sharp movement and clinical finishing. Prior to Mohamed Salah replacing Joe Gomez and the radical reconfiguration that came with the substitution, he was playing as a versatile forward, popping up anywhere across the frontline. This flexibility could allow him to stand out from Isak, showing he can offer greater variety, and would potentially allow the two to play alongside each other more often as they did against Inter. In addition to quality, Ekitiké showed pure endeavour on Saturday, eventually needing to be substituted because of cramp. He came off looking exhausted, but his work ethic is a fine addition to natural talent.Will UnwinMatch report:Liverpool 2-0 Brighton5Nuno needs to Hammer home messageWest Ham were minutes away from beating Brighton last week and were 2-1 up at half-time against Aston Villa on Sunday. However, Nuno Espírito Santo’s team are finding it hard to hold on to winning positions. They drew with Brighton after dropping deep and lost 3-2 against Villa after relinquishing control during the second half. “We conceded from a ball that was ours,” Nuno said as he reflected on Lucas Paquetá being dispossessed before Morgan Rogers made it 2-2. “We conceded three goals that really punished us. We have to rectify the mistakes that we keep making on our defensive organisation. There is a long way to go and it is up to us to take care of that and get out of this situation.” Nuno is a manager who prides himself on defensive rigour. West Ham, who remain in the bottom three, have not kept a clean sheet since his appointment.Jacob SteinbergView image in fullscreenNuno Espirito Santo, the West Ham manager.Photograph: Simon Dael/ShutterstockMatch report:West Ham 2-3 Aston Villa6Palmer shows signs of his best formThis has been a frustrating few months for Cole Palmer, who made just his fourth league start in Chelsea’s win against Everton on Saturday. Having managed 58 minutes at Bournemouth last week, he lasted until the 58th minute again here. Nobody would suggest this was his best game for the club but, operating on the right of the midfield three, Palmer looked fleetingly dangerous and took his goal with extreme composure – just his second league strike of the season. He is a player capable of creating something from nothing, giving Chelsea not only an edge against deep-lying defences but the ability to snatch goals even when they are not playing well. Palmer faces a battle to get back in the England team given how well they have played without him of late. It might not be the worst thing for Thomas Tuchel, though, to have a creative player available at the World Cup who has effectively played only two-thirds of a season.Jonathan WilsonMatch report:Chelsea 2-0 EvertonView image in fullscreenHarry Wilson of Fulham celebrates after he scored against Burnley.Photograph: Shaun Brooks/CameraSport/Getty Images7Wilson leads Silva’s box-office starsBurnley v Fulham is not the kind of fixture that TV executives dream about when they’re signing the multibillion-pound rights deals. Slotted in at 5.30pm on one of the last weekends before Christmas, the viewing figures will not be troubling the record books. It’s a shame, because right now Fulham might be the Premier League’s box-office team. The Cottagers’ past four games have produced 20 goals and Harry Wilson is arguably the league’s in-form player, with three goals and three assists in his past four appearances. Wilson is now 28 and while his talent has always been apparent, it has never been demonstrated consistently at the highest level. This may well prove to be just another purple patch, but the Welshman should be approaching his peak and has already started more games this season than last. With five goals in 15 games already, a double-digit total is in reach. That would exceed most Fulham fans’ expectations for Wilson this season, and could change the perception of a nice player to watch into one feared by opponents.Tom BassamMatch report:Burnley 2-3 Fulham8Forest sign up to Dyche’s style council“Framework and freedom,” Sean Dyche said, revealing the snappy masterplan behind Nottingham Forest’s 3-0 victory against Tottenham. As theolesrang around the City Ground with full time approaching and a breezy Forest going for the jugular, it was another performance that provided compelling evidence of Forest’s groove under Dyche. In the past five weeks, Forest have put three goals past Liverpool, Leeds, Malmö and now Spurs. At times Ibrahim Sangaré, Elliot Anderson, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Morgan Gibbs-White and Igor Jesus dovetailed beautifully. It is all rather at odds with his wider perception as a safety-first, uber-diplomatic, defensive manager. Sangaré’s strike at the end of a slick team move typified Dyche’s underreported, stylish side. “I prefer the boring one-nils, you know that, it’s far too exciting when they start passing it around, knocking goals in like that, a fantastic finish,” Dyche said, tongue firmly in cheek.Ben FisherMatch report:Nottingham Forest 3-0 Tottenham9Calvert-Lewin goals vital for LeedsDominic Calvert-Lewin and Leeds appeared a marriage of convenience when the former Everton striker was signed on a free transfer in mid-August. A player who is still just 28, and has scored five goals in 13 Premier League matches for his new club, carries the tag of being a former England striker, having last played for his country when England beat Ukraine 4-0 at Euro 2020. In west Yorkshire, there is a huge appreciation for his old-fashioned centre-forward skills. At Everton, where his career was hampered too often by injury, he was known for possessing all the tools to play his position save for being the dead-eyed goalscorer the No 9 shirt demands. At Leeds, he has been able to redefine himself by scoring goals. “Harry Kane is playing in the Bundesliga, but he’s one of the best English strikers in the Premier League,” said his manager Daniel Farke, a confirmed admirer.John BrewinMatch report:Brentford 1-1 Leeds10Hürzeler in need of festive cheerA big pat on the back to whoever included Fabian Hürzeler’s terrible December record in the stat pack for the Seagulls’ 2-0 defeat at Anfield. After their latest loss, the Brighton manager’s record in the Premier League’s busiest month reads P9 L4 D5 W0. It is now officially past the anomaly stage. Losing against Liverpool at Anfield should not be considered a cause for concern, even if the Seagulls were desperately wasteful in front of goal. The draw against West Ham and a 4-3 defeat against Aston Villa having led 2-0 – both fixtures at home – are more troubling. There is an opportunity at the Amex Stadium next weekend against a Sunderland team who will be missing several key players at the Africa Cup of Nations. The return of Kaoru Mitoma from injury should offer a boost to Brighton’s chances of changing the narrative, and giving the home fans an overdue bit of Christmas cheer.TBPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal1620362Man City1622343Aston Villa168334Chelsea1612285Crystal Palace165266Liverpool162267Sunderland162268Man Utd154259Everton16-12410Brighton1622311Tottenham Hotspur1642212Newcastle1612213Fulham16-32014Brentford16-32015AFC Bournemouth15-32016Nottm Forest16-81817Leeds16-101618West Ham16-131319Burnley16-151020Wolverhampton16-262Explore more on these topicsPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

All of them, that was, except two. The broad-shouldered centre-forward Aitor Aguirre and the winger Sergio Manzanera lingered furtively.“We said that if we could do something to damage this military regime, we should,” recalls Aguirre on the terrace of the restaurant he ran for many years after his retirement. “But it had to be subtle, or they wouldn’t let us out on the field. So, we slipped into the toilets with a pair of bootlaces. I tied one onto Sergio, and he tied one onto me, so they looked like armbands.”They swiftly rejoined their teammates, leaving an empty changing room behind. A very different scene would greet them on their return at half-time – the narrow corridors packed with armed police after their protest had been noted and repercussions began. Judicial proceedings, death threats and public condemnation soon followed. Yet the experience would only serve to forge an emerging friendship into a lifelong bond.By 1975, Francisco Franco’s failing health and the regime’s deepening vulnerability had encouraged a swell of civil unrest. With Spain increasingly isolated internationally, authorities became ever more reactive in their attempts to suppress dissent. That August, Franco signed a decree that hastily enshrined new anti-terror powers, compelling military courts to impose death penalties for attacks on state officials. Applied retrospectively, the laws led to four tribunals in which 11 members of ETA and the Revolutionary Antifascist Patriotic Front (FRAP) were convicted of murder and condemned to death.View image in fullscreenRacing Santander’s Aitor Aguirre: ‘I’m almost certain I’d do it again. It was an important milestone.’Photograph: Fundación Real Racing ClubThe sentences sparked an international outcry with demonstrations besieging Spanish embassies, Pope Paul VI calling for clemency, and Nicolás Franco urging his younger brother to show mercy. But a Franco-led cabinet meeting confirmed five of the sentences. The regime’s only concession to foreign pressure was to abandon its preferred method of execution – the garrotte.On the morning of Saturday 27 September 1975 five men were executed – the final time the death penalty was used in Spain. Àngel Otaegui, in Burgos at 8.30am, followed by fellow ETA member Juan Paredes Manot in Barcelona at 8.35am. In Madrid, Ramón Garcia Sanz faced the firing squad at 9.20am, followed by José Luis Sánchez Bravo at 9.40am. Finally, José Humberto Baena was shot dead at 10.15am.That night, the Racing players gathered at the Hotel Rhin on Santander’s seafront ahead of their match against Elche the following day. Sharing a room were Aguirre, a Basque raised amid the repression of his region’s language and identity, and Manzanera, from a Republican family in Valencia whose father had been vindictively stripped of his job as a postmaster due to his beliefs. They took their news from the Radio España Independiente, a station founded by the exiled Spanish Communist Party to broadcast unfiltered to Spaniards at home and abroad.“When we heard the details of the executions, my heart was pounding,” remembers Manzanera. “We had to do something. I don’t know which of us suggested wearing black armbands, but that’s what we agreed.”The following afternoon, the plan was quietly put into action. After crouching together, armbands visible, alongside their teammates for a pre-match photo, it was business as usual in the first half, with Manzanera crossing for Aguirre to head Racing ahead. It seemed the gesture had gone unnoticed. But on their return to the dressing rooms, the tunnel was stuffed with the grey uniforms of the fearedPolicía Armada.“There they were,” says Aguirre, “there must have been about 20 officers there, maybe more.” The pair were given an ultimatum: take off the armbands or be arrested immediately. “Sergio and I agreed we had already achieved what we wanted. This would be in all the newspapers the next day.”After a delay to the second half as rumours swirled around the ground, the pair were allowed to take the field. Elche found an equaliser, but Aguirre settled the game with a late winner.Sergio Manzanera: ‘It gives me great satisfaction to know that I’ve contributed my tiny grain of sand to democracy.’Photograph: Fundación Real Racing ClubOrdered to report to the police station the following morning, the two were interrogated in different rooms and had distinct experiences. Aguirre was met with immediate hostility on account of his Basque identity, while officers found Manzanera’s motives harder to fathom and questioned him with a puzzled politeness. In the afternoon, they were taken to court, where prosecutors motioned for a custodial sentence of five years and a day. Manzanera recalls the nervous wait: “We were sitting outside. Then the club’s lawyer came out and told us that since there was no public disturbance – no objects thrown onto the field, no assaults or anything – the judge had decided to impose a very large fine. But we could go home.”Though home offered little sanctuary in a city that traditionally leaned to the right. There were confrontations in the street, their mail was tampered with and danger escalated alarmingly when a convention of the far-right paramilitary group, theGuerrilleros de Cristo Rey(Warriors of Christ the King), sentenced them to death.“We had to live cautiously, checking under our cars to see if they’d planted a bomb or something,” says Aguirre. “I had two small children. My wife had to leave and take them to her mother’s in Sestao”. Manzanera remembers the sleepless nights: “I lived alone in a top-floor apartment. Every night I would listen to the elevator coming up in the early hours of the morning. I kept a shotgun next to the bed.”Some relief came when the trembling voice of prime minister Carlos Arias Navarro announced Franco’s death on 20 November. After almost four decades of dictatorial stranglehold, Spain began its precarious transition to democracy.Fifty years on, despite the hundreds of miles that separate them, a connection between Aguirre and Manzanera endures, born from that humble act in a changing room one Sunday afternoon in a very different Spain. “It gives me great satisfaction to know that I’ve contributed my tiny grain of sand to democracy, to trying to change something,” Manzanera reflects.“I’m almost certain I’d do it again,” says Aguirre. “It was an important milestone. A significant moment in my life, and I’ll carry that with me until they take me to the cemetery.”Once Upon a Time in La Liga is published by Pitch Publishing and availablehere.Sid Lowe’s regularLa Ligacolumn will be back next weekExplore more on these topicsRacing SantanderLa LigaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead the Italian made no attempt to clear up a situation entirely of his own making.He rebuffed questions about hiscryptic response to beating Everton on Saturdayand even reacted with exasperation when he was asked if he regretted saying a lack of support from unspecified people had put him through his “worst 48 hours” since joining the club.Maresca’s cryptic comments spark confusion after Chelsea sink EvertonRead moreWhat did Maresca expect? It was unclear why he decided that a standard home win over Everton, who have a dismal record at Stamford Bridge, was the time to air frustration with the criticism that followed last week’sdefeat against Atalanta in the Champions League. He did not single anyone out, but he was not talking about supporters and he gives no indication that he cares about the media, so he can not complain about outsiders assuming there are issues either with Chelsea’s owners or their sporting directors, Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley.When that was put to him before the Carabao Cup trip to Cardiff on Tuesday, though, Maresca offered little. Saying repeatedly he had nothing to add, he mused that “we are in an era where everyone can say what they want”. An insistence his comments were “quite clear” was laughable. It continued with Maresca refusing to reveal whether he has spoken to his bosses since Saturday.After much prompting, he later relented and said:“It’s OK, it’s good,” when asked about his relationship with the ownership. He added that owners are the most important figures at any club as they “put the money in”. While the 45-year-old said he remains happy at Chelsea, he declined to retract his comments about those 48 hours.It had been a tough fortnight for Chelsea, who followed fine performances againstArsenalandBarcelonabylosing at Leedsanddrawing at Bournemouthbefore the reverse in Bergamo. One theory is that Maresca had bristled at being given more feedback than usual by the sporting directors after his substitutions backfired against Atalanta. Another is that he expected public backing from the club after three games without a win.Chelsea, though, have repeatedly stood by Maresca this season. Backing does not have to follow every setback. Chelsea’s plan is to review his position next summer. The danger is that this episode will go down badly. Chelsea are baffled.Some have attributed the outburst to inexperience and the hope is that the dust will settle, but Maresca has taken a risk. He was not speaking from a position of strength and it will be awkward if Chelsea lose at Newcastle on Saturday. It also feels unnecessary. Chelsea have not put pressure on Maresca to win the title this season. They just want evidence of progress.View image in fullscreenChelsea won the Club World Cup, but long-term injuries to important players such as Cole Palmer (centre) have hindered their campaign.Photograph: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty ImagesThe strategy implemented by Behdad Eghbali, the co-controlling owner, and carried out by the recruitment team is starting to work. Chelsea have built a talented young squad, are fourth in the league and remain in every cup competition. They are nowhere near crisis territory.It is true some of Maresca’s recent selection and tactical decisions have not been received well. Overall, though, he has done a fine job since replacing Mauricio Pochettino. Chelsea qualified for the Champions League,won the Conference Leaguelast season and destroyedParis Saint-Germain in the Club World Cupfinal in the summer. Maresca has maintained their progress this season, even though he has had to deal with a disrupted pre-season and long-term injuries to Cole Palmer, Liam Delap and Levi Colwill.Cardiff’s Brian Barry-Murphy: ‘If we rocked up with tiki-taka, the locals wouldn’t be having it’Read moreEven then, though, it would be a grave miscalculation from Maresca to assume his achievements would earn him more power. Managers who want to work at Chelsea have to exist within the club’s collaborative structure. Their voice carries weight, but it is never going to be a one-man show. Stability comes from the sporting leadership team. Maresca would be naive to start a civil war.It is hard tell which way this goes. There was tension when Maresca’s request for a new centre-back after Colwill ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament in August was dismissed. A key dilemma is that Chelsea are a match for anyone when they field their strongest side. However, some of their most important players are unable to play three games a week. Wesley Fofana falls into that category, but the alternatives to the centre-back are unconvincing.Chelsea are supportive of Maresca managing his team’s workload. The problem is that standards fall when he makes changes. Maresca has said Andrey Santos is a downgrade on Moisés Caicedo in midfield and has shown little faith in Jorrel Hato since the 19-year-old defender’s nightmare against Qarabag last month. Facundo Buonanotte, the Argentina forward on loan from Brighton, has not been in the squad for a league game since October.Maresca has often spoken glowingly of the Chelsea project. The problem now is that he has left it open for outsiders to question his true feelings. He talked himself into a hole on Saturday and should have made more of an effort to dig himself out of it. Any more hints of discontent will do nothing for his chances of being at Chelsea next season.Explore more on these topicsChelseaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The manager wants to know Barnes is ­sufficientlykeen on swapping international allegiance– he has a single cap for England – before con­sidering the Newcastle player for a potential World Cup berth.Scotland’sWorld Cup return after a 28-year waithas put Barnes’s inter­national future back on the agenda. The feeling within the Scottish ­Football Association has thus far been that Barnes believes he can play for England again, but the player left the door open on a switch during an interview last month.Scotland to face Brazil and Morocco in World Cup group stage in repeat of France 1998Read more“They have to be committed, they have to want to play forScotland,” Clarke said on Monday. “It is 26 [in a squad] again so there are some spaces there, but not too many.”Clarke denied introducing a player such as Barnes to the squad so close to aWorld Cupcould disrupt team harmony. “Football players are quite selfish,” he said. “They like to think that if someone is going to help them be better and the team to be better … like I said, as long as they come and they are ­committed then I am pretty sure anyone who comes into this group of players will enjoy it.”Clarke has raised the possibility of staying on as the Scotland manager beyond the World Cup. The 62‑year‑old’s contract ends when his team exit the tournament and the widespread belief has always been he will call time on his tenure at that point. Yet Clarke is open to an extension. He will hold talks with the ­Scottish FA in the early part of next year.View image in fullscreenSteve Clarke has led Scotland to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA“It would need to be right for me and I would need to find out whether it’s right for them,” he said. “I want to wait until the turn of the year, get the training camp and the bases sorted and get the [World Cup] programme sorted first. Hopefully, that will give me a little bit of time before the March games to sit down and just go through everything.“I’ve got a few questions for them in terms of how we move forward and how we make sure it’s not over 20 years before we qualify for another World Cup.“This group of players can ­definitely do 2028. Not all of them, but most of them. There is a lot to discuss moving forward beyond whether I try to make another tournament and carry on for another two years.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandWorld Cup 2026World CupnewsShareReuse this content"

It wasn’t just the loss but the manner of it, and who it came against. “We lost at Lorient, a team that should be relegated. We’re rubbish, we know it,” said a visibly-emotional Sofiane Diop as the midfielder pleaded with the travelling fans after the 3-1 defeat on 30 November.It wouldn’t be the Nice players’ only hostile interaction of the night. As they pulled in front of their training ground, they were greeted by approximately 400 fans, who made their displeasure at the ongoing situation known. Three individuals in particular were targeted: Terem Moffi, Jérémie Boga, and Florian Maurice.Moffi was guilty of having smiled on camera during an interaction with his former president, Loïc Fery, after Nice’s defeat to Lorient; Boga was guilty of inviting Marseille fans into the Allianz Riviera last month during their 5-1 “spanking”, in Diop’s words, at the hands of their rivals; and Maurice, the sporting director, is, alongside president Fabrice Bocquet, who was not present at the ambush, seen as one of the main reasons for Nice’s fall from Champions League qualification last season to a relegation battle this time around.Moffi and Boga were hit and spat at when alighting the team bus, while the manager, Franck Haise, revealed that some fans came in balaclavas armed with pétanque balls. “Did they bring them to play pétanque?” he asked.View image in fullscreenTerem Moffi was one of the players targeted during the attack on Nice’s team bus and has been on sick leave since the incident.Photograph: Jose Salgueiro/DPPI/ShutterstockBoth players have been on sick leave since the incident, which was condemned by the club, the players (via a joint communique), the players’ union (the UNFP) and governing authority LFP, who announced that “it will join as a civil party in the complaints filed by the players”. An investigation has since been opened by the public prosecutor’s office.But support for the alleged victims has not been unanimous, and Haise has had to publicly reaffirm the gravity of the incident. “We can’t deny what happened. When I hear that it wasn’t anything much … Maurice was spat on and hit. Don’t tell me it didn’t happen,” he toldL’Équipe.Nice’s mayor, Christian Estrosi, leaning on the prefecture’s report which did not cite any “physical violence”, has sought to downplay the incident. “It is important not to add fuel to the fire or fuel a controversy that far exceeds the reality of the facts,” he said on X. But the former OGC Nice president Jean-Pierre Rivère, who left the club this summer and has since allied himself with the far-right candidate for the Nice mayorship, Éric Ciotti, bit back. “It is pointless to minimise [the events]: what happened does not match the club’s image,” said Rivère, who added that he “trusts” those at the club to “work to reopen dialogue and bring back unity”.But it is a club, as well as a city, that is divided. There is a lingering feeling of anger and ambivalence from the Nice fans. The Allianz Riviera almost rang hollow during last weekend’s defeat against Angers but those in attendance made their thoughts felt, booing the players out on to the pitch and their every touch of the ball thereafter. It was the same story on Thursday night with fewer than 4,000 fans attending a 1-0 loss to SC Braga, their sixth defeat in six in this season’s Europa League, which saw them crash out of the competition; they are now 18 games without a win in European competition, the longest run of any French club in history.Even internally, there are signs of discord. Haise had already offered to be the “shock to the system” after the defeat against OM, offering to leave but not to resign. He was then on the verge of resigning after the incident on 30 November before changing his mind. “I am staying so that everyone assumes their responsibilities,” he said.He cuts an isolated figure at a divided club. Before Sunday’s defeat to Lens [2-0], a ninth defeat in succession in all competitions, he appeared in front of the media alone with his squad opting to boycott their media duties. “We all have to assume [our responsibilities]. It is their decision not come before you today. I would have preferred to be at home, too,” he said on Saturday.View image in fullscreenMohamed-Ali Cho and Tom Louchet, after Nice crash out of the Europa League.Photograph: Alexandre Dimou/ReutersHaise has been critical of his players but also of the club’s leadership. We understand that, since the start of the season, Nice have sought a public statement of commitment to the club from the owners, Ineos. It was only after the violence at the end of last month that a measly statement was finally coaxed. “I reaffirm Ineos’s strong commitment to the club, express my support for the President of OGC Nice, and renew my confidence in all of the club’s services as well as its sporting and administrative teams,” said the CEO of Ineos Sport, Jean-Claude Blanc.Quick GuideLigue 1 resultsShowLyon 1-0 Le HavreAuxerre 3-4 LilleLens 2-0 NiceStrasbourg 0-0 LorientMarseille 1-0 MonacoRennes 3-1 BrestMetz 2-3 PSGParis FC 0-3 ToulouseAngers 4-1 NantesWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But that statement came after Haise had already made his unhappiness at the radio silence known, stating that he only heard from Blanc three days after the incident outside the training ground. Blanc subtly struck back: “It is now required that all communications from the club’s various spokespersons be guided by the best interests of the OGC Nice institution, with consistent attention paid to maintaining unity and cohesion across all parts of the club.”Nice, on the longest losing streak in their history, are an image of disunity from top to bottom, and there is an increasing feeling that it is only by tearing everything up that the pieces can fit together again.Talking points“It was a mad match. I don’t think I’ve experienced anything like that in my career,” said Nabil Bentaleb after Auxerre and Lille shared seven goals and four red cards in one of the games of theLigue 1season so far. The latter took an early lead but then went down to 10 men before half-time when Nathan Ngoy was sent off. Auxerre made the most of their man advantage and equalised through Lassine Sinayoko, only for Clément Akpa’s red card to restore numerical parity. But Auxerre, unbeaten in their last three heading into the game, kept pushing and took the lead, only for a stunning Bentaleb strike and then a curled effort from Soriba Diaoune to restore Lille’s lead late on. It set up a frantic finish. Sinayoko scored from the spot to bring the game back to 3-3, but just three minutes later, Benjamin André’s goal, a fourth in the space of just nine minutes, settled it for Lille. It wouldn’t be the end of the drama, however, as Romain Perraud and Oussama El Azzouzi would then be sent off for butting heads. And breathe …Five defeats in the last six Ligue 1 games leave Monaco cut adrift from the leaders. Sébastien Pocognoli said his side “objectively deserved to beat” Marseille on Sunday. He will point to Lamine Camara’s controversially-disallowed goal for a Folarin Balogun offside in the buildup. Balogun had the ball in the back of the net later in the game, too, only for that too to be disallowed. Mason Greenwood scored the game’s sole goal two minutes later as OM kept touch with PSG and Lens. Monaco, however, go into the winter break nine points away from Lille, who occupy the final Champions League qualification spot. “Will we use [this performance] to rebel and continue putting in good performances, or will we look for excuses?” asked Pocognoli. The answer will determine their season.PosTeamPGDPts1Lens1615372PSG1621363Marseille1621324Lille1613325Lyon166276Rennes163277Strasbourg165238Toulouse165239Monaco16-12310Angers16-12211Brest16-61912Lorient16-91813Nice16-101714Paris FC16-81615Le Havre16-91516Auxerre16-111217Nantes16-141118Metz16-2011This is an article byGet French Football NewsExplore more on these topicsNiceGuardian Sport NetworkLigue 1European club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up now!Barry GlendenningMon 15 Dec 2025 11.03 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 11.48 ESTShareGOING IN TWO-FOOTEDIn keeping with pretty much everything else you’ve read, seen or heard about the Scottish League Cup final, you’d be forgiven for presuming today’s Football Daily will almost entirely be devoted to the factCelticis run by an incompetent bunch of cheapskates who appear to consider their paying customers an entitled rabble of insubordinate plebs, with only a cursory mention of plucky little St Mirren’s actual triumph at the end. Except that’s not how this daily football email rolls and by sneering at everyone else’s coverage of the Buddies’ not-entirely-surprising Hampden Park triumph, we’ve now mentioned their win twice already, which means we can exclusively devote what remains of this section to going in two-footed with our views on the Scottish champions.While the rivalry between Celtic and Rangers is rooted in deep-seated, historically complex social, political, and sectarian divisions that make even the most trivial slight feel like a declaration of war, Football Daily has been highly amused to note that it is fuelled by even more absurd levels of pettiness than even grizzled cynics like us thought possible. Not content with seeing Rangers descend into the status of bona fide bin-fire at the beginning of this season, the Celtic board couldn’t just revel in their rival’s misfortune but instead felt compelled to shout “Haud ma bevvy!” and try to out-do them in the utterly avoidable self-harm stakes.Where to start? There was that miserliness in the transfer window. Theembarrassingly early exitfrom Bigger Cup. The resignation of Brendan Rodgers and subsequentdivisive and self-serving statementfrom majority shareholder Dermot Desmond accusing the recently departed head coach of being “divisive” and “self-serving”. There was the AGM,abandonedshortly after it started due in no small part to the fact both Desmond’s son, Ross, and the Celtic chief suit, Peter Lawwell, treated their audience with such condescending disdain, it’s small wonder the fans present didn’t raze Celtic Park to the ground in righteous anger, rather than just shout a few entirely justified unpleasantries at assorted members of their club’s breathtakingly arrogant hierarchy.Upon realising they’d dropped a massive b0llock by treating the customers who keep the club’s vast reservoir of cash topped up, Celtic set about trying to appease them but obviously couldn’t even get that right. Having welcomed back the popular Martin O’Neill as interim head coach until they found somebody the fans were inevitably going to consider a downgrade, the Celtic board will have been pleased this elderly but safe pair of hands managed to steady the ship on and off the field. However, rather than hang on to their favourite Martin, Desmond, Lawell and chums elected to bid him farewell in order to appoint somebody new ahead of a trio of big games against the league leaders, a team of Serie A grandees and a rabble of comparative church mice in a major cup final.And this morning, after Celtic were subjected to back-to-back-to-back trimmings by Hearts, Roma and St Mirren, the club’s top brass will have listened in mounting horror as O’Neill sat in the TalkSport radio studio, trying his best to sound more diplomatic than smug as he revealed he would have happily stayed at the club for longer and fielded a succession of calls from distraught Glaswegians all begging him to return immediately if not sooner. We can’t help but feel genuinely sorry for Wilfried Nancy; through no great fault of his own, Celtic’s new boss already looks like a dead man walking just eight days and three matches into his reign because the geniuses in the boardroom couldn’t wait an extra week to stick a contract under his nose.

The England captain was brought on to replace Steph Catley as an 82nd-minute substitute at Goodison Park, drawing a roaring reception from the 1,200 travelling supporters. It was the 28-year-old’s first match since July’s Euros final against Spain in Basel. Arsenal are managing Williamson’s return carefully but she could feature again against the Belgian side Leuven in the Champions League on Wednesday.TGSpurs let three-goal lead slip at UnitedTottenham were three goals up against Manchester United and on course for a first win over Marc Skinner’s side before a late fightback turned it into a 3-3 draw. Goals from Bethany England, Eveliina Summanen and Martha Thomas had the visitors on track to secure history, but Fridolina Rolfö’s late double denied Spurs. Martin Ho can take great encouragement from how his team performed, however, with their compact, organised shape and ambition in possession impressing at Leigh Sports Village. “Massively disappointed,” said Olivia Holdt. “Leading 3-0 and then ending up with a draw is tough.” The frustration of the Danish winger reflects Spurs’ rising ambition.MSView image in fullscreenFridolina Rolfö scored twice to deny Tottenham a historic first win at Manchester United.Photograph: Poppy Townson/MUFC/Manchester United/Getty ImagesShaw makes City history with century of goalsKhadija Shaw marked her 120th match for Manchester City by scoring her 100th goal for the club – and then added three more. The striker was sensational in City’s 6-1 victory over Aston Villa at the Joie Stadium and she has become the first women’s player to hit the century milestone for City in the professional era. “It’s a really good feeling,” said Shaw. “I said from the first day I got here this was a special club, and the players I have around me – it’s a testament to them and a credit to them. They make me look good.”EHWSL: Shaw hits four in Manchester City rout, United roar back to deny SpursRead moreChelsea bounce back in style at BrightonThe danger in facing a wounded animal is underestimating their ability to fight back. This is precisely what happened to Brighton on Sunday as Chelsea bounced back from their shock defeat to Everton the previous weekend with a 3-0 victory. The Seagulls defended resolutely but as soon as Sandy Baltimore’s stunning opener hit the back of the net, the game was only heading in one direction. The return of Erin Cuthbert was a welcome one for Sonia Bompastor given the stability she provided alongside Keira Walsh. Alyssa Thompson’s goal will have been particularly pleasing for the Chelsea manager given the involvement of Sam Kerr who is improving with every minute that she plays.SDView image in fullscreenSandy Baltimore’s goal sparked Chelsea’s win at Brighton after a disappointing defeat last week.Photograph: Jeff Mood/ProSports/ShutterstockWinless Liverpool find positives in third drawLiverpool may have headed into the winter break with only three points courtesy of three draws but there is reason to be optimistic for all associated with the club. Mia Enderby’s reply two minutes after West Ham had opened the scoring through Riko Ueki and Beata Olsson’s injury-time equaliser after Anna Csiki had restored the home team’s lead ensured the margin between the bottom-of-the-table sides remains at two points. It was a particularly impressive showing by Liverpool given they had been reduced to 10 players after only 19 minutes following the red card shown to Gemma Bonner. This is the type of fight Gareth Taylor’s side need to show in the new year.SWO’Brien’s form dazzles for comfortable LeicesterShannon O’Brien has had to be patient this season but her form since early November has helped Leicester head into the winter break with a comfortable cushion over bottom-place Liverpool. They sit ninth with a respectable nine points, and with three goals in her last five games, O’Brien is proving to be the clinical finisher that is needed by a team who play in the way Leicester do – compact, resilient, expecting to strike on the counter. AgainstLondon City Lionesseson Sunday, Leicester had 29.1% possession but equalled their opponents’ total shots on target (five). O’Brien’s 59th-minute winner was far from pretty but the 24-year-old displayed great composure to bundle the ball home.SDPosTeamPGDPts1Man City Women1122302Chelsea Women1113243Arsenal Women1113224Man Utd Women1111215Tottenham Hotspur Women110206London City Lionesses11-7157Brighton & Hove Albion Women111148Aston Villa Women11-4139Leicester Women11-13910Everton Women11-8811West Ham Women11-15512Liverpool FC Women11-133Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueManchester City WomenChelsea WomenArsenal WomenManchester United WomenTottenham Hotspur WomenLondon City LionessesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now came Fernandes’s goal before Matheus Cunha put United 4-3 ahead of the substitute Eli Junior Kroup’s leveller.Mistakes by Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot led to goals, while questionable ­positioning by two more United defenders – Ayden Heaven and Leny Yoro – allowed Evalinson’s finish. Tavernier’s free-kick also benefited from a faulty wall and Senne Lammens not being able to save despite the low shot coming on his side.“We have talent at the back and quality players, we just have to have better defending,” the head coach said. “We took care of the offence. We have the characteristics, we just need to work together.“You think we lost the two points in the second half, but I think we lost the two points in the first half. We should have more goals.”Amorim pointed to naivety regarding losing the lead three times. “It is understanding the moments of the game,” he said. “We need to start the second half in a different way.”View image in fullscreenKobbie Mainoo’s half-brother, Jordan Kwadwo Osei Mainoo-Hames sends out a message at Old Trafford.Photograph: Jordan Kwadwo Osei Mainoo-Hames/InstagramKobbie Mainoo’s half-brother, Jordan Kwadwo Osei Mainoo-Hames, wore a “Free Kobbie Mainoo” T-shirt to the game and posted the image on his Instagram stories.While Mainoo came on after 60 minutes for Casemiro, Amorim is yet to start the midfielder in any of United’s 16 Premier League games.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedBournemouthRuben AmorimnewsShareReuse this content"

I am sorry that I reacted in the manner that I did,” Menzies said in a statement issued to Sky Sports. “It’s not an excuse, but I have had a lot of things on my mind recently and I suppose it all just became too much at the end.“It has not been an easy time for me with my uncle Gary passing away recently.

The 52-year-old is yet to address Desmond’s sentiment, but is known to have been attractive to Saudi clubs for some time. He turned down a move to the kingdom after leaving Leicester in 2023.St Mirren stun Celtic to win Scottish League Cup as Nancy’s nightmare goes onRead moreAl-Qadsiah, who sacked their Spanish manager Michel at the ­weekend, have stolen a march on their domestic rivals by moving for Rodgers, who has been keen for a swift return to the dugout. He is expected to sign a long-term contract in the coming days at a club owned byAramco, the state-owned Saudi oil company.The former Liverpool manager won back-to-back Scottish titles ­during a second spell atCeltic, with matters subsequently turning sour due to troubles in the transfer market.Rodgers’s permanent replacement at Celtic,Wilfried Nancy, has lost his first three matchesin office. Nancy’s struggles have fuelled the theory that Celtic should have retained ­Martin O’Neill, who took caretaker charge after Rodgers left, for a longer period.O’Neill said on Monday he would have remained in charge had Celtic wanted him to stay. “If they had asked me to stay on, I would’ve done so, but the ­minute that they said, ‘No, that’s your time’, that was fine by me,” he told Talksport.O’Neill called for Nancy to be shown patience. The Frenchman has endured a grim losing run, the most recent beingSunday’s League Cup final against St Mirren,and that has led to doubts about his suitability to the role.“You’ve got to give managers chances,” O’Neill said. “I think back to my own time at Leicester City, where I eventually enjoyed nice ­success. Can’t win a game to save my life, crowd baying for blood and after 10 games. How lucky I was to win a ­couple of matches of real importance at a stage.“There’s some excellent ­players at the club. There’s some boys who have won big time as well. Lean on some of the senior players. Lean on them and get them on your side.“It is recoverable, of course.

The view within the hierarchy is that Mainoo’s youth and potential mean his ceiling remains high and that he could convince Amorim – or a future United head coach – he is worth a regular place.Preparing for Monday’s game against Bournemouth at Old Trafford Amorim said Mainoo could “in the future” be used as a holding player after previously indicating the academy product was vying solely for the No 8 position occupied by the captain, Bruno Fernandes.United are on the best run of Amorim’s 13-month tenure, with one defeat in nine league matches, a sequence that vindicates his selection and tactics. Sir Jim Ratcliffe said in October that Amorim would begiven three yearsto demonstrate his capabilities.Amorim has said any out-of-favour player can win a place through performances in training and United do not wish to make a hasty decision to sell Mainoo. Amorim was asked whether he rated Mainoo as a top-class footballer.“Of course, like everyone else,” he said. “Casemiro is the biggest example [of him changing his mind]. He was behind Toby [Collyer, now on loan at West Brom] and now he’s a star.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

This included a reminder of the timewasting row with India at Lord’s in July that triggered a spate of running verbals and, in the end,a 22-run win.“What needed to be said has been said,” Stokes said, when asked if that message about weakness had been reiterated in the past week. “­Everyone is very switched on for what needs to be done this week. ­Everyone has responded incredibly well to it … what other option do we have?“It’s trying to fight in every situation that you find yourself in, understanding the situation and what you feel is required. And yeah, just look at your opposition every single time and show a bit of dog. That is fight to me.“[Lord’s] has been brought up. That is exactly what I’m on about – a moment where we all did that. You saw the way that team came out on that final day. We had to be absolutely perfect to win that game and we were. Attitude and mentality towards that situation is what gave us the best chance of winning.”England have made one change to their XI. Josh Tongue has come in for Gus Atkinson – fresh legs into the pace attack – while Shoaib Bashir has again been overlooked for the all-rounder Will Jacks, despiteStokes describing the 22-year-old Bashir as his first‑choice spinnera fortnight ago.View image in fullscreenJosh Tongue is the only change to England’s XI for the third Test, replacing Gus Atkinson in the pace attack.Photograph: Philip Brown/Getty ImagesOf the 12 players England have used in this series, just five had played in Australia previously. Asked if the intensity of the cricket – not least two hostile crowds in Perth and Brisbane – was the reason for this supposed lack of fight from his team, Stokes replied: “Honestly, I think so.I remember my first tour here. You try to imagine what it’s going to be like and you hear people talk. But when it does come around it’s like ‘wow’. Now I feel everyone has experienced that and probably at its highest level, so we all know what it’s going to be like.“So for the next three games there isn’t going to be any ‘I didn’t expect this’ or ‘it’s the first time I’ve had this’. Even the likes of Jamie Smith. He dropped that catch [at the Gabba] and then the whole crowd was then wailing at him every time he caught the ball. He now knows it.”Asked if he had a message for ­supporters doubtless deflated by England’s performances so far, Stokes said: “It’s completely under­standable. But there are no deflated feelings whatsoever in this team right now.“There obviously were after the first two games because that’s what the game does to you. But sitting here right now there’s none of that with me and none of that with the team. If we were, what would be the point in turning up?“So hopefully in Adelaide, after everything that’s been said, there’ll be a different feel and a different look. We just need people to stand up.”Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26The AshesBen StokesEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The recipes were not all that intelligent. TheAIhad taken elements of similar recipes from multiple creators and Frankensteined them into something barely recognizable. Inone memorable case, the Google AI failed to distinguish the satirical website the Onion from legitimate recipe sites and advised users to cook with non-toxic glue.Over the past few years, bloggers who have not secured their sites behind a paywall have seen their carefully developed and tested recipes show up, often without attribution and in a bastardized form, in ChatGPT replies. They have seen dumbed-down versions of their recipes in AI-assembled cookbooks available for digital downloads on Etsy or on AI-built websites that bear a superficial resemblance to an old-school human-written blog. Their photos and videos, meanwhile, are repurposed in Facebook posts and Pinterest pins that link back to this digital slop.Recipe writers have no legal recourse becauserecipes generally are not copyrightable. Although copyright protects published or recorded work, they do not cover sets of instructions (although it can apply to the particular wording of those instructions).‘One of the most disgusting meals I’ve ever eaten’: AI recipes testedRead moreWithout this essential IP, many food bloggers earn their living by offering their work for free while using ads to make money. But now they fear that casual users who rely on search engines or social media to find a recipe for dinner will conflate their work with AI slop and stop trusting online recipe sites altogether.“There are a lot of people that are scared to even talk about what’s going on because it is their livelihood,” says Jim Delmage who, with his wife, Tara, runs the blog and YouTube channelSip and Feast.Matt Rodbard, the founder and editor-in-chief of the websiteTaste, is even more pessimistic. Taste used to publish recipes more frequently, but now it mostly focuses on journalism and a podcast (which Rodbard hosts). “For websites that depend on the advertising model,” he says, “I think this is an extinction event in many ways.”The holiday season is traditionally when food bloggers earn most of their ad revenue. For many, this year has been slower than usual. One blogger, Carrie Forrest ofClean Eating Kitchen,told Bloombergthat in the past two years, she has lost 80% of her traffic.[People are] absolutely trusting in the [search] results that are getting thrown in their facesKaren TedescoOthers, like Delmage and Karen Tedesco, the author of the blogFamilystyle Food, say their numbers, and ad revenue, have remained steady – so far. They attribute this to focusing their energies less on trying to game the search engines than on the long-term goal of attracting regular followers – and, in Delmage’s case, viewers.Tedesco’s strategy has been to create recipes that rely on her experience and technical knowhow honed by years in restaurant kitchens and as a personal chef. HerItalian meatball recipe, for example, based on her mother’s, includes advice about which meat to use, an explanation of why milk-soaked breadcrumbs are essential for texture, and a dozen process photos and a video.But she is still worried about the potential impact of AI. When she recently did aGooglesearch for “Italian meatballs”, Familystyle Food appeared as the top result. Then she switched to AI Mode. There, she found the recipe had been Frankensteined – or “synthesized” as Gemini put it – into a new recipe with nine other sources (including Sip and Feast and a Washington Post recipe for Greek meatballs). The AI-generated recipe was little more than a list of ingredients and six basic steps with none of the details that make Tedesco’s recipe unique.AI Mode linked to all 10 recipes, including Tedesco’s, but, she says, “I don’t think many people are actually clicking on the source links. At this point, they’re absolutely trusting in the results that are getting thrown in their faces.”Other bloggers have seen a more definite impact on their viewership. Adam Gallagher, who runsInspired Tastewith his wife, Joanne, and who has become an outspoken critic of AI on social media,toldthe podcast Marketing O’Clock that since spring, he has noticed that while the number of times viewers saw links to the site on Google has increased, the number of actual site visitors has decreased. This indicates, to him, that users are satisfied with the search engine’s AI interpretation of Inspired Taste’s recipes.[With] so many pop-up windows and so much crashing, we kind of lost as publishersMatt RodbardAfter the Gallaghers posted about the discrepancy on X and Instagram, a number of readers replied to say they had not realized there was a difference between the recipes on the blog and the version that showed up in Google searches. Perhaps they had also appreciated the convenience of not having to click on another website, especially when Google’s page design was so clean and uncluttered.Rodbard acknowledges that many food blogs have gotten ugly and overloaded with ads, which has exacerbated the problem. “Ad tech on these recipe blogs has gotten so bad, so many pop-up windows and so much crashing, we kind of lost as publishers,” he says.According to Tom Critchlow, the EVP of audience growth at Raptive, a media company that works with many food bloggers to find advertisers, it isn’t ads that are driving viewers away. It’s Google itself, with its changes to the algorithm and now with AI Mode, that’s making the sites harder to find.There is some hope though: a survey of 3,000 US adults commissioned by Raptive showed that the more interaction people had with AI, the less they wanted to engage with it, and nearly half the respondents rated AI content less trustworthy than content made by a human.View image in fullscreenFood bloggers are now feeling the pressure to move to a subscription model to stay afloat; ‘If I were to give up my website or even try to go over to Substack, I would be broke,’ says Karen Tedesco.Photograph: Maskot/Getty ImagesBut unless the public rebels against AI Mode, there is only so much bloggers can do. They can block OpenAI’s training crawler, which gathers information that ChatGPT uses to create content, including its ownrecipe generator, but theyare not necessarily willing to make themselves invisible to web searches; as Delmage puts it: “You can’t bite the hand that feeds you.”There is also the option of moving over to a subscription model, such as Substack or Patreon, and keeping the recipes behind a paywall, but both Tedesco and Delmage point out that the most successful Substackers, like Caroline Chambers or David Lebovitz, came to the platform with much more substantial followings than they have. “If I were to give up my website or even try to go over to Substack, I would be broke,” Tedesco says.Rodbard suggests that the analog version of the recipe blog, the cookbook, might be due for a comeback. Cookbooks, after all, offer the same experience of spending time and learning from a trusted source, and it’s likely the recipes have been tested. As a bonus, unlike phones or laptops, they don’t go dark when you neglect them for too long and you can splash tomato sauce on them without inflicting permanent damage. According to the market research firm Circana (formerly BookScan), sales of baking cookbooks are up 80% this year, but other areas have been relatively flat.‘Eat the future, pay with your face’: my dystopian trip to an AI burger jointRead moreBut AI bots are stealing from published cookbooks, too. When Meta was training its own AI, itcompiled thousands of booksinto a dataset called Library Genesis (LibGen). Now unscrupulous publishers have raided LibGen and repackaged some of the books into dupes, which they aresellingon Amazon.As more people become aware of the amount of AI slop on the internet and how to identify it, Critchlow believes they will develop a greater appreciation for content produced by humans. “People will ultimately place a higher premium on being able to know that these recipes have been tested and made by somebody that I follow or somebody I respect or somebody that I like,” he says.The recipe creators themselves are not so sure. “I’m putting my faith in that there’s always going to be a segment of people who really want to learn something,” Tedesco says. But as for the business of blogging itself, “it’s like a rolling tide. It’s always up and down and you have to roll with it and adapt.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But time has been unusually unkind to the US supreme court decision that upheld the law banningTikTok, the short-form video platform. The court issued its ruling less than a year ago, but it is already obvious that the deference the court gave to the government’s national security arguments was spectacularly misplaced. The principal effect of the court’s ruling has been to give our own government enormous power over the policies of a speech platform used by tens of millions of Americans every day – a result that is an affront to the first amendment and a national security risk in its own right.Congress passed theTikTokban in 2023 citing concerns that the Chinese government might be able to access information about TikTok’s American users or covertly manipulate content on the platform in ways that threatened US interests. The ban was designed to prevent Americans from using TikTok starting in January 2025 unless TikTok’s China-based corporate owner, ByteDance Inc, sold its US subsidiary before then.Many first amendment advocates and scholars – including the twoofus– expected the court to be intensely suspicious of the law. After all, TikTok is one of the most popular speech platforms in the country, and banning foreign media is a practice usually associated with the world’s most repressive regimes. Even more damningly, a long list of legislators forthrightly acknowledged that their support for the ban stemmed not only from general concerns about what users might see on the app but from a desire to suppress specific kinds of content – especially videos showing the devastation caused by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza and other content deemed to be sympathetic to Palestinians. For laws that affect speech, motivations like that are usually fatal.But the justices upheld the ban – unanimously – in a thin and credulousopinionissued just a week after oral argument. Apparently untroubled by legislators’ censorial motivations, the court said the law could be justified by privacy concerns, and it accepted without serious scrutiny the government’s argument that the ban was necessary to protect users’ data.Privacy and security experts had told the court that banning TikTok would not in fact meaningfully constrain China’s ability to collect Americans’ data, and that if the government wanted to address legitimate privacy concerns online it could do so without so dramatically curtailing Americans’ free speech rights. But the court said that it was not the court’s job to second-guess the executive branch’s decisions about national security and foreign affairs.This is not how the first amendment is supposed to work. For one thing, courts are not supposed to close their eyes when the government says it wants to control what people can say or hear. A law motivated by a desire to suppress particular categories of content – to suppress “misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda”, as theHouse committee reporton the bill put it – should at the very least be subject to stringent review.And courts are not supposed to allow the government to side-step that review simply by declaring that national security requires censorship. That is the central lesson of the last hundred years of first amendment doctrine.During the first Red Scare, courts allowed the government to use the Espionage Act to imprison hundreds of activists for nothing more than opposing the war. The cases from that time are regarded as stains on first amendment history, and modern first amendment doctrine evolved as a reaction against these mistakes. Courts are supposed to have learned that it is their job to protect the democratic process by being skeptical of purported national security justifications for suppressing speech.Events since the Supreme Court upheld the TikTok ban have only underscored why the justices were wrong to defer to the government’s arguments. The court issued its ruling on 17 January because the ban was meant to go into effect two days later. But even after the court rushed to judgment,Donald Trumpissued an order saying he would suspend enforcement of the law for 75 days.Since then, he has extended this suspension four more times without any legal basis—and he may extend it again. Meanwhile, TikTok remains freely available. Legislators who were insistent that TikTok poses an urgent threat to American security cannot be reached for comment. All of this makes a mockery of the government’s earlier claims that TikTok was an urgent national security risk – and of the court that deferred to those claims.Even worse, the court’s decision means that TikTok nowoperates under the threat that it could be forced offline with a stroke of the president’s pen. Conservatives and liberals alike have expressed concerns for years about government officials using threats to “jawbone” social media companies into changing their content-moderation policies, but no previous administration has enjoyed the power to extinguish a platform simply by enforcing existing law.Whether TikTok is already conforming its policies to Trump’s preferences – as many American universities, media companies and law firms have been doing – is difficult to know. Even if the platform is not conforming now, though, it may well in the future, because Trumphas been brokeringa deal to have the platform transferred to his ideological allies.Plainly, the court cannot be blamed for all of this. It could not have predicted that President Trump would simply refuse to enforce the law. Still, we could have avoided this ending if the court had not bungled the beginning. If the court had carefully scrutinized the government’s national security arguments, it would have seen that the TikTok ban, for all of its novelty, is actually just a familiar example of the government exploiting national security fears to intimidate courts into giving it power that the constitution puts off limits.The court would have understood that the ban itself created a serious national security risk – the kind of risk the modern first amendment was intended to prevent – by giving the government far-reaching influence over public discourse online.Over the coming months, the supreme court will confront other cases in which the government invokes national security to justify the suppression of speech. The court’s analysis of those cases should be haunted by the TikTok case and its embarrassing, scandalous coda. We need the court to play its constitutionally appointed role – and not simply defer credulously to political actors deploying the rhetoric of national security in the service of censorship.Evelyn Douek is an assistant professor at Stanford Law SchoolJameel Jaffer is inaugural director of the Knight first amendment institute at Columbia UniversityExplore more on these topicsTikTokOpinionFreedom of speechUS supreme courtUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationLaw (US)commentShareReuse this content"

We will need something big and new to spread money around if some super-human intelligence comes for all the jobs. But a UBI, as contemplated by its current cheerleaders, does not start to address the real challenges of an economy that has moved past human labor.Ask a truck driver (Yang was worried about truck drivers) to live on $1,000 a month. A two-parent, two-kid family on the “Freedom Dividend” would be pretty deep under water, living on 25% less than needed to poke through the poverty line.The bill to provide every adult a guaranteed income worth, say, $53,000 per year, equivalent to the median earnings of American workers, would add up to over $14tn, about 45% of the United States’ gross domestic product (GDP). Good luck to the politician running on a platform to fund this brave new world.To put it in perspective, since 1980, the first year for which the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmentpublishes that data, public social spending in the United States – covering health, pensions, disability, unemployment insurance and all that – has never hit 25% of the GDP. Indeed, since the 1960s, the aggregate tax revenue raised by all levels of government has never reached 30% of GDP.And this doesn’t even consider how challenging redistribution will become once AI kills all labor income, which today generates most tax revenue.Yang suggested funding his “Freedom Dividend” with a value added tax. This is a tax on consumption that the US does not use but funds a big chunk of Europe’s welfare states. It has merits: It can raise a lot of money, because it is easy to collect at the store checkout, and it does not sap incentives to work and invest, as income taxes do. But it seems a bit ridiculous to propose a world without work in which the livelihoods of most people are funded with a tax on what they buy.If it meets its investors’ lofty expectations, the AI-powered economy will be radically different from what we know, driving the cost of machines that substitute for human labor below the cost of human subsistence. Nobel economist Wassily Leontief’s observation about horses comes to mind: “the role of humans as the most important factor of production is bound to diminish in the same way that the role of horses in agricultural production was first diminished and then eliminated by the introduction of tractors.”Maybe we can keep humanity alive via redistribution. Machines that don’t require workers could produce enormous amounts of output, so it might be easy to raise the money for the UBIs of the future.Given there would be no workers, taxes would have to be raised on something else: carbon emissions, perhaps, or other stuff producing bad externalities, or land, which can be taxed without discouraging production. But this world would likely require substantial taxation of the owners of the robots.And this would raise new questions about power: Who would determine how much everybody gets? More than likely it would be the select gang of tech oligarchs who own the machines. In an economy in which the labor share of income has gone to zero, the owners of capital end up reaping it all.To quote economist Erik Brynjolfsson, who runs the digital economy lab at Stanford University: In this world, most of us “would depend precariously on the decisions of those in control of the technology.” Society would risk “being trapped in an equilibrium where those without power have no way to improve their outcomes”.UBI has features that would prove valuable in an AI-driven future. It does away with the work requirements that often come with welfare, a desirable feature when human work makes no sense. But it fails to address key challenges, notably the enormous built-in inequality that the AI economy would bring about, which might demand redistributing not income but capital ownership in the robots themselves.Problematically, UBI does not meet the challenge of the present either. America’s current quandary is not zero employment but a large footprint of service jobs that do not provide a living wage. A universal benefit is an extraordinarily expensive tool to fix that, though. A wage subsidy would do much better. How about we improve the design of the earned income tax credit, signed into law by president, Gerald Ford, in 1975?Less work – as in fewer working hours – does not necessarily require a new paradigm. Australians work 20% less than Americans already; Danes and Finns work 24% less. Spaniards work two-thirds as many hours per day as Americans, on average; the French only 62% as much; Italians about half. These countries don’t rely on UBI, just on a halfway decent social safety net. Before the US tries to reconfigure its welfare state, it might just try that.Explore more on these topicsUS economyEconomicsUniversal basic incomeArtificial intelligence (AI)analysisShareReuse this content"

Now Dan Houser is back with a storytelling-focused studio to take on AI-obsessed tech bros and Mexican beauty queensMon 15 Dec 2025 07.35 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 10.07 ESTShareThere are only a handful of video game makers who have had as profound an effect on the industry as Dan Houser. The co-founder of Rockstar Games, and its lead writer, worked on all the GTA titles since the groundbreaking third instalment, as well as both Red Dead Redemption adventures. But then, in 2019, he took an extended break from the company which ended with his official departure. Now he’s back with a new studio and a range of projects, and12 years after we last interviewed him, he’s ready to talk about what comes next.“Finishing those big projects and thinking about doing another one is really intense,” he says about his decision to go. “I’d been in full production mode every single day from the very start of each project to the very end, for 20 years. I stayed so long because I loved the games. It was a real privilege to be there, but it was probably the right time to leave. I turned 45 just after Red Dead 2 came out. I thought, well, it’s probably a good time to try working on some other stuff.”At first, he looked into film or TV writing, but didn’t like what he found. “That world was not overly excited by me and I was not overly excited by them,” he says. “I’ve spent 20 years talking about how games are the coming medium and now theyarethe medium […] you look at TV and the budgets and the amount of money they can generate, but the creative ambition is so small at times”. It seemed to Houser that it would be easier to come at the industry with IP that had already been generated. So he moved to Santa Monica and formed Absurd Ventures, bringing in Greg Borrud (founder of SeismicGamesand Pandemic Studios) as head of games and, as COO, Wendy Smith, previously at the New Yorker and Ralph Lauren, and a White House special assistant during Bill Clinton’s presidency.View image in fullscreen‘It was a privilege to be there’… Red Dead Redemption 2.Photograph: Rockstar GamesIt was clear from the start it wouldn’t just be a video games studio. In 2024, the company released the 12-part story podcast A Better Paradise, a dystopian thriller about an ambitious online game world overseen by a powerful AI presence that begins to become sentient – with devastating consequences. Its creator is the mysterious tech billionaire Dr Mark Tyburn, a British inventor who intends the game as a digital utopia, then abandons it when things go awry. In some ways it is a satire on our current digital oligarchy, in which billionaire tech bros wield astronomical influence over society.“All of these tech companies start out with grandiose ambitions, this ‘we are going to save the world through togetherness’-type gibberish,” he says. “We’ve created some of the most powerful people in history in terms of reach and mind control. Those people end up living with far more money than anyone’s ever had. And it feels, as someone who lives in the society that they have helped create, that there are moments in those journeys when they must have felt their product was not quite what they intended it to be and was doing unforeseen harm, and … they went out of their way to ensure that was not regulated. That Faustian moment I find fascinating, and that’s not to say I wouldn’t make the same choice or judge them for it, I just find it interesting.”We’ve created some of the most powerful people in history in terms of reach and mind controlTellingly perhaps, the company at the centre of A Better Paradise, Tyburn Industria, feels much more like a games studio than a social media mega-corp. Also, the lead protagonist is a writer who finds himself at the centre of the game’s development. Is there an element of autobiography here?“Yeah, of course – at that level,” says Houser. “But I also wanted to write about games and tech in a way that felt authentic. To lean slightly more into the games side in terms of the office environment was really easy for me. I know what it’s like to work in a games company obviously. I wanted to try and bring that to life in a way that felt real and to capture some of the micro dramas.”Having turned A Better Paradise into a novel, Houser’s Santa Monica studio is now working on an open-world video game version. He’s not saying how it will fit in with the podcast, just that Mark Tyburn and the AI at the heart of his game, NigelDave (a wildly intelligent program, fixated by humans but with no understanding of how they function), will both figure in the action.Also in development at the company’s second studio in San Rafael, is the Absurdaverse, a comedy universe populated by a menagerie of weird characters, from a skeletal warrior to an ageing hippy. The company is planning a series of animated TV shows and/or movies for the concept, but also another open world game, which Houser has described as, “a living sitcom”. Again, he’s vague on the details, but it looks to be a more story-driven take on The Sims, possibly utilising AI to create emergent narratives around the characters and their lives. “We’re trying to use the memories of NPCs in a fun way,” he says. “Just trying to make it a bit more alive. You’ll see when we talk about it more, but it is shaping up really well. It’s a completely gamey game – very mechanics driven. With both games, we’re trying to make them really strong on mechanics, really fun to play, accessible, but plenty of depth.”View image in fullscreen‘A living sitcom’ … Absurdaverse.Photograph: Absurd VenturesHouser is also planning a game around the company’s third IP, the comic book series American Caper, co-written with fellow Rockstar alumnus, Lazlow. With its cast of escaped convicts, crooked lawyers and Mexican beauty queens, it is perhaps the closest out of all his new projects toGrand Theft Auto. Which is perhaps why the interactive version is going in a different direction. “I’m not making an open-world game for that,” says Houser. “We’re actually looking at maybe doing more of a story game. We’re still kind of exploring it.”We talk a little bit about the current prevalence of forever games such as Minecraft, Fortnite and Roblox and how they’re sucking up a lot of the world’s playtime. But Houser is adamant that there’s still a vast audience for mature single-player narrative experiences – and that’s what he’s aiming at.‘Our industry has been strip-mined’: video game workers protest at The Game AwardsRead more“We’re trying to be ambitious, to make new stuff,” he says. “At some level [our projects] are traditional console games, accessible, but action-oriented story-driven open world console games – but then at the same time, we’re doing it a slightly different way or with slightly different subject matter. Three years ago we were watching one of those PlayStation showcases, and if you blinked and missed the credit sequences, you couldn’t tell where one game ended and the other began. Everything was sort of dark purple and about space ninjas. They were about this apocalypse or that apocalypse but always felt the same.”“That’s fine. Some of them are amazing games. But we were like, well, we’ve got limited money and we are starting from scratch. We have to have good stories and fun dialogue, and make sure our gameplay is amazing and accessible, and our art direction has to be fresh – at all points, it has to feel different. We have to make stuff where people go, ‘Well, I’ve never played a game aboutthat’, and then treat the audience, not just as gamers, but as human beings.”So he’s not worried about the industry’s current obsession with live-service multiplayer mega-games? “I still think there is enough of an audience who want new stuff and single player-led stuff,” he says. And then in his characteristically self-deprecating way he adds: “I hope so. Or we’re in a little bit of trouble.”Explore more on these topicsDan HouserGrand Theft AutoGamesinterviewsShareReuse this content"

In the shadow of the Peacock theater in Los Angeles and next to a giant, demonic statue promoting new game Divinity, which would be announced on stage later that evening, stands a collection of people in bright red shirts. Many are holding signs: a tombstone honouring the “death” of The Game Awards’Future Class talent development programme; a bold, black-and-red graphic that reads “We’re Done Playing”; and “wanted” posters for Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick and Microsoft CEO Phil Spencer. This is a protest.The protesters, who were almost denied entry to the public space outside the Peacock theater (“they knew we were coming,” one jokes), are from United Videogame Workers (UVW), an industry-wide, direct-join union for North America that is part of the Communications Workers of America. “We are out here today to raise awareness of the plight of the game worker,” says Anna C Webster, chair of the freelancing committee, in the hot Los Angeles sun. “Our industry has been strip-mined for resources by these corporate overlords, and we figured the best place to raise awareness of what’s happening in the games industry is at the culmination, the final boss, as it were: The Game Awards.”Webster is referencing several things here. More than 40,000 layoffs have decimated the industry over the past few years; just last month, Grand Theft Auto developer RockstarGames wasaccused of union-bustingafter firing more than 30 staff (the studiodenies this, saying the employees were leaking confidential information), and AI is being rapidlyinjected into game development processes. The industry seems unwilling to reckon with these issues.View image in fullscreen‘They never seem to acknowledge the layofffs’… United Videogame Workers members protest outside LA’s Peacock TheatrePhotograph: Colton “Anarche99” Childrey“I recently read that a three-minute trailer at The Game Awardscosts more than $1m,” says the union’s local secretary, Kaitlin “KB” Bonfiglio. “[Despite] the pomp and circumstance of all of this, they never seem to acknowledge the historic amount of layoffs that have happened in the industry.”For the UVW, there is a core issue here. “It’s all about greed,” Webster insists. “Anyone who works in the games industry can identify that our art form is being sold for parts to make a few people a lot of money. And they don’t care about the games. They don’t care about the art. They just want their money.”For those working in games, the problems plaguing the industry are obvious. But how can UVW make it clear that the issues industry workers face affect players, too? “If you’re someone who loves video games, if you are frustrated by games that launch buggy and are delayed messes, if you’re frustrated by games you’re excited about getting cancelled without warning, all of that ties back to what we’re doing here,” treasurer Sherveen Uduwana says. “Giving us layoff protections, making sure bosses can’t take away our healthcare, making sure they can’t replace us with AI – that is going to lead to better games for players and more ambitious, interesting, creative projects. It’s really a win-win for players and a win-win for workers.”There’s a clear love for the industry permeating through this group, a desire to make the medium and the work they cherish even better. The Game Awards is a major night, one that can help prop up smaller independent studios and highlight incredible voice actors. The UVW team recognises that.“Have a good time today, and tomorrow, let’s wake up and start organising for better workers’ rights and a better games industry,” Uduwana says.Explore more on these topicsGamesGaming awardsAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

That means a new economic approachMon 15 Dec 2025 14.23 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 17.49 ESTShareMore than a year after the election that handed Donald Trump a decisive comeback victory, the Democratic party has still not released its postmortem analysis. But last week, an influential progressive lobby grouppublishedits own. Kamala Harris’s campaign, its authors argued, failed to connect with core constituencies because it did not focus enough on addressing basic economic anxieties. By prioritising the menace to democracy that Maga authoritarianism represented, progressives neglected the bread-and-butter issues that were uppermost in many people’s minds.As the EU braces for a tumultuous period of politics between now and the end of the decade, that is a lesson that needs to be fully absorbed in Brussels, Paris and Berlin. The White House, as its recently published national security strategy makes clear, is hopeful that “patriotic” partiesin Europe will soon replicate Mr Trump’s success. In the EU’s Franco-German engine room, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) and Alternative für Deutschland (AfD)leadthe polls, backed by large swaths of blue-collar voters. But among mainstream leaders and parties, it is hard to discern a response that is adequate to troubling times.The challenges Europe faces are expensive and era-defining. They include the war in Ukraine, maintaining the momentum of the green transition, addressing demographic change and developing economies that are less vulnerable to bullying by Mr Trump and China. According to the Brussels-based Breugel thinktank, the new age of geopolitical insecurity couldrequirean additional €250bn in annual EU defence spending. Mario Draghi’sreportlast year on European economic competitiveness demanded massive investment in public goods and infrastructure, to be partly funded by jointly held EU debt.Such a fiscal paradigm shift would boost growth figures that have flatlined for years. But at both the pan-European and national levels, there continues to be a lack of boldness when it comes to revenue raising. The EU’s so-called “frugal” nationsopposethe idea of collective borrowing, and Brussels’ budget proposals for the next seven years are deeplyunambitious. In France, the idea of a wealth tax on the super-rich is overwhelmingly popular with voters. But Emmanuel Macron’s beleaguered centrist government – though desperate to cut its budget deficit – refuses to contemplate such a move.The reality is that in the absence of such measures, the less well-off will pay the price of financial adjustment through austerity budgets and greater inequality. Bitter recentdisputesover pension cutbacks in both France and Germany testify to a developing struggle over the future of the European social model – a phenomenon that the RN and the AfD have happily exploited to promote a politics ofwelfare chauvinism. Ms Le Pen’s party, for example, has opposed moves to raise the retirement age and has said that it would target any benefit cuts at non-French nationals.In the US, Mr Trump’s pledges to protect blue‑collar interests were deeply disingenuous, as subsequent Medicaid cuts andtax breaksfor the wealthy underlined. But in the absence of a convincing progressive counteroffer from the Harris campaign, they worked on the campaign trail. Without a fundamental change in economic approach, social contracts across the continent risk being ripped up. Governments must avoid handing this political gift to the Trumpian forces already on the march in Europe.Explore more on these topicsEuropeOpinionEuropean UnionDonald TrumpUS politicsRepublicansKamala HarrisDemocratseditorialsShareReuse this content"

But time has been unusually unkind to the US supreme court decision that upheld the law banningTikTok, the short-form video platform. The court issued its ruling less than a year ago, but it is already obvious that the deference the court gave to the government’s national security arguments was spectacularly misplaced. The principal effect of the court’s ruling has been to give our own government enormous power over the policies of a speech platform used by tens of millions of Americans every day – a result that is an affront to the first amendment and a national security risk in its own right.Congress passed theTikTokban in 2023 citing concerns that the Chinese government might be able to access information about TikTok’s American users or covertly manipulate content on the platform in ways that threatened US interests. The ban was designed to prevent Americans from using TikTok starting in January 2025 unless TikTok’s China-based corporate owner, ByteDance Inc, sold its US subsidiary before then.Many first amendment advocates and scholars – including the twoofus– expected the court to be intensely suspicious of the law. After all, TikTok is one of the most popular speech platforms in the country, and banning foreign media is a practice usually associated with the world’s most repressive regimes. Even more damningly, a long list of legislators forthrightly acknowledged that their support for the ban stemmed not only from general concerns about what users might see on the app but from a desire to suppress specific kinds of content – especially videos showing the devastation caused by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza and other content deemed to be sympathetic to Palestinians. For laws that affect speech, motivations like that are usually fatal.But the justices upheld the ban – unanimously – in a thin and credulousopinionissued just a week after oral argument. Apparently untroubled by legislators’ censorial motivations, the court said the law could be justified by privacy concerns, and it accepted without serious scrutiny the government’s argument that the ban was necessary to protect users’ data.Privacy and security experts had told the court that banning TikTok would not in fact meaningfully constrain China’s ability to collect Americans’ data, and that if the government wanted to address legitimate privacy concerns online it could do so without so dramatically curtailing Americans’ free speech rights. But the court said that it was not the court’s job to second-guess the executive branch’s decisions about national security and foreign affairs.This is not how the first amendment is supposed to work. For one thing, courts are not supposed to close their eyes when the government says it wants to control what people can say or hear. A law motivated by a desire to suppress particular categories of content – to suppress “misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda”, as theHouse committee reporton the bill put it – should at the very least be subject to stringent review.And courts are not supposed to allow the government to side-step that review simply by declaring that national security requires censorship. That is the central lesson of the last hundred years of first amendment doctrine.During the first Red Scare, courts allowed the government to use the Espionage Act to imprison hundreds of activists for nothing more than opposing the war. The cases from that time are regarded as stains on first amendment history, and modern first amendment doctrine evolved as a reaction against these mistakes. Courts are supposed to have learned that it is their job to protect the democratic process by being skeptical of purported national security justifications for suppressing speech.Events since the Supreme Court upheld the TikTok ban have only underscored why the justices were wrong to defer to the government’s arguments. The court issued its ruling on 17 January because the ban was meant to go into effect two days later. But even after the court rushed to judgment,Donald Trumpissued an order saying he would suspend enforcement of the law for 75 days.Since then, he has extended this suspension four more times without any legal basis—and he may extend it again. Meanwhile, TikTok remains freely available. Legislators who were insistent that TikTok poses an urgent threat to American security cannot be reached for comment. All of this makes a mockery of the government’s earlier claims that TikTok was an urgent national security risk – and of the court that deferred to those claims.Even worse, the court’s decision means that TikTok nowoperates under the threat that it could be forced offline with a stroke of the president’s pen. Conservatives and liberals alike have expressed concerns for years about government officials using threats to “jawbone” social media companies into changing their content-moderation policies, but no previous administration has enjoyed the power to extinguish a platform simply by enforcing existing law.Whether TikTok is already conforming its policies to Trump’s preferences – as many American universities, media companies and law firms have been doing – is difficult to know. Even if the platform is not conforming now, though, it may well in the future, because Trumphas been brokeringa deal to have the platform transferred to his ideological allies.Plainly, the court cannot be blamed for all of this. It could not have predicted that President Trump would simply refuse to enforce the law. Still, we could have avoided this ending if the court had not bungled the beginning. If the court had carefully scrutinized the government’s national security arguments, it would have seen that the TikTok ban, for all of its novelty, is actually just a familiar example of the government exploiting national security fears to intimidate courts into giving it power that the constitution puts off limits.The court would have understood that the ban itself created a serious national security risk – the kind of risk the modern first amendment was intended to prevent – by giving the government far-reaching influence over public discourse online.Over the coming months, the supreme court will confront other cases in which the government invokes national security to justify the suppression of speech. The court’s analysis of those cases should be haunted by the TikTok case and its embarrassing, scandalous coda. We need the court to play its constitutionally appointed role – and not simply defer credulously to political actors deploying the rhetoric of national security in the service of censorship.Evelyn Douek is an assistant professor at Stanford Law SchoolJameel Jaffer is inaugural director of the Knight first amendment institute at Columbia UniversityExplore more on these topicsTikTokOpinionFreedom of speechUS supreme courtUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationLaw (US)commentShareReuse this content"

He has deployed a massive military arsenal in and around the Caribbean Sea and taken a series of provocative actions off the Venezuelan coast, justifying it as necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the United States.The Council on Foreign Relationssays that deployment includesan “aircraft carrier, destroyers, cruisers, amphibious assault ships, and a special forces support ship. A variety of aircraft have also been active in the region, including bombers, fighters, drones, patrol planes, and support aircraft.” Thisis the largest displayof American military might in the western hemisphere since we invaded Panama in 1989.The president has refused to rule out a ground invasion of Venezuela. But so far, the administration has used its military assets to target boats allegedly carrying drugs, sought to close Venezuelan airspace, and, on 10 December,seized an oil tanker. How the seizure of an oil tanker helps stem the flow of drugs into the US is not obvious.The Guardian view on Trump and Venezuela: a return to seeking regime change | EditorialRead moreIn fact, Pam Bondi, the attorney general,claimed the shipwas involved “in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations”.Beyond these explanations, it is unclear why Trump has targeted Venezuela in the ways he has. The presidentmay want to punishthe country’s dictatorial president, Nicolás Maduro, for allowing hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans to migrate to this country.Or he may be seeking to control the country’s vast oil resources.Whatever his motivation, the peace president is saber-rattling in the Caribbean, much like a bully picks on weaker opponents. AndVenezuelais not his only target.In an interview with Politico, hesuggestedhe would be willing to take military action in Mexico and Colombia to stop the flow of drugs coming from those countries. What he oncesaid about the way he likes to deal with protesters at home seems now to describethe way he thinks about the United States’ relations with nations in the western hemisphere: “You have to dominate. If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time.”We’veseen this act before, and it generally did not end well for this country or for its neighbors to the south. It is time for Congress to assert itself and try to stop the president from leading us further into a South American quagmire, what one senatorcalled“sleepwalking us into a war with Venezuela”.It is also time for the Organization of American States (OAS)to break its silence and condemn what the Trump administration is doing. The International Federation on Human Rightsis right: “The erosion of the democratic system and human rights violations … in Venezuela … do not authorise any State to intervene as the United States is doing … In doing so, it violates the central right on which the architecture of the world order is based, which is the self-determination of peoples.”It is clear that respect for that principle has not animated the administration’s foreign policy. Examples are legion, including the way it has treated Palestinians and has seemed to accept Russia’s territorial claims in Ukraine.In language reminiscent of the 19th century, the recently released US national security strategyindicatesthat “the outsized influence of larger, richer, and stronger nations is a timeless truth of international relations”. The document comes close to envisioning a world less dominated by the United States, one where stronger powers recognize and respect each other’s spheres of influence. That would involve other powers respecting each other’s efforts to interfere in the affairs of weaker states within their sphere.This idea dates back to the sixth century BCE. Then, Professor Andrew Lathamargues, “Rome and Carthage concluded a treaty prohibiting Roman ships from sailing near Carthaginian waters and Carthaginian forces from attacking towns friendly to Rome.”Fast forward to the 19th century, and we see examples where nations would assure their competitors that they would respect their right to play a dominant role in a particular region. Trump clearly wants to establish dominance in the western hemisphere.As the national security strategy puts it, “The United States must be preeminent in the Western Hemisphere as a condition of our security and prosperity—a condition that allows us to assert ourselves confidently where and when we need to in the region.”This is clearly a step back from what Latham refers to as “the universalization of the US-led liberal international order” that has been the pillar of international relations since the fall of the Soviet Union.But Trump’s 19th and early 20th-century predecessors, William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, would be proud. McKinleylaunched an era of American imperialismand a war against Spain to ward off its interference in Cuba. Following him, Roosevelt made so-called“gunboat diplomacy” a central tool of American foreign policy.That involved the conspicuous display of military, especially naval, power to intimidate other nations and secure their cooperation in the pursuit of American national interests.Sound familiar?Earlier examplesincludethe 1903 deployment of an American warship to deter Colombian intervention in Panama, the use of the American military to seize the Mexican port of Veracruz in 1914, and the deployment of the marines more than 20 times in Central and South American nations during the first part of the 20th century.Throughout the cold war, the USregularly intervened in those nations. We used covert operations and military force to undermine governments that were in any way sympathetic to the Soviet Union, including in Guatemala in 1954, Ecuador nine years later, and several times in Chile.The results were not good.Gunboat diplomacy and efforts at regime changefed anti-American sentimentsthroughout the region, exposing the US to charges of hypocrisy for talking about the importance of respect for national sovereignty in the international order, but not respecting it when we didn’t like the governments of other countries.A study of the aftermath of CIA efforts to overthrow governments in the western hemispherefoundthat they caused a whole host of damage to their economies and political and social systems, leaving them less free, democratic and prosperous. For example, weintervened in Guatemala to deposea democratically elected president and left the country in the hands of a dictator. That led to a bloody and prolonged civil war. And our efforts in the early 1970sto undermineChile’s Salvador Allende, a Marxist president,destabilizedthat country’s economy.I’m afraid we are on that course again. Unless dissuaded, the president’s actions in South America will leave the United States less secure and the region more unsettled.Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyOpinionVenezuelaTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

To further the appreciation of culture among all the people, to increase respect for the creative individual, to widen participation by allthe processes and fulfillments of art – this is one of the fascinating challenges of these days.” Those are the words of John F Kennedy, after whom the US’s national performing arts centre is named. The impulse to build it came from Dwight D Eisenhower; it was given JFK’s name after his assassination; and it opened in 1971, to the music of Leonard Bernstein and the choreography of Alvin Ailey, in the presidency of Richard Nixon. The Kennedy Centre, in short, was designed to be bipartisan, a place of gathering for Democrats and Republicans alike, a proud showcase of the best of America’s dance, opera and music.For 50 years it carefully trod that line, its board balanced by members of Congress from both sides of the political divide. But it turns out it can take just months to unravel half a century of high-minded purpose.I have visited the Kennedy Center twice this year – once in the early spring, once in the late autumn. In March, patrons were adjusting to the shock of Donald Trump’s insertion of himself over the organisation – a few weeks earlier he had sacked its Republican chair and had a new, compliant set of trusteesvote him in instead. The night I attended, the audiencebooedthe vice-president, JD Vance, at a National Symphony Orchestra concert, which he was attending with his wife Usha, a trustee. The experienced president of the centre had just been replaced with Richard Grenell, an ambassador to Germany under Trump’s first term, a man without any experience in arts administration. Trump and Grenell committed themselves to eradicating the “woke” programming that they claimed had captured this home of Stravinsky orchestral suites and Mozart operas. Eight months on, the performance I attended of Aida by the Washington National Opera was as spectacular and impressive as one might expect. But the place was quieter and more subdued. Now, from the wall opposite the stage door, gazed down portraits of the first and second couples. There was no doubt about who was meant to be in charge.By this time, ticket sales had, according toa Washington Post analysis, plummeted. Formally loyal patrons were staying away from what many now regarded as a toxic and politicised institution. Productions – notably, themusical Hamilton– had pulled out of the venue. An entire season of classical concerts, run byWashington Performing Arts(tagline, “championing the arts as a unifying force”), had absented itself from the building, having taken a swift decision to stage its recitals and concerts in alternative venues across DC.Multiple staff members had resigned or been laid off. Sudden terminations included that of thedance programming staffthis summer, when an experienced team was replaced by a former ballet dancer who hadwrittento Grenell and Trump offering to help wipe out “leftist ideologies in the arts”. Being a Maga loyalist, or staying silent and toeing the line, appear to be requirements for those associated with the centre. The National Symphony Orchestra now plays the national anthem before its concerts – something that might be done from time to time in Ukraine, a country actually at war, but has an entirely different significance when the arts are being positioned as props in a nakedly nationalist agenda. (See also: the Trump-authorised plans for marking the 250th anniversary of the foundation of the US, which include asculpture gardenof statues of approved “great” Americans.)The Kennedy Center now regularly feels like a “mortuary”, according to one person who works there, because performances and visitors are so thinned out. The management claims victory by announcing fundraising wins – from what one might call unusual sources, such as a substantialdonationfrom the Kazakh government. Even so, the Washington National Opera, its artistic directortold me, is considering leaving the centre because its loyal patrons are unwilling to come and donors are reluctant to offer financial support. Audiences are at times artificially swelled through ticket giveaways: one staff member told me of an all-company email this week offering free tickets to employees for this week’sperformances of Handel’s Messiah, a seasonal favourite that ought to be a no-brainer sellout.The past fortnight has been particularly florid in terms of the Trumpification of the centre. First there was the palaver of the Fifa World Cup draw, an event (offered to the federationwithout a hire fee) that required the hurried rescheduling of various long-programmed performances, and at which Trump was awarded, absurdly, with the “Fifa peace prize”. Then, a few days later, came the Kennedy Center Honors, the conferring of lifetime-achievement awards on distinguished artists. Previously, honorees have been proposed by an expert committee. This year, though, the presidentsaidhe had been “98% involved” in the selection, had turned down various “woke” names, and even emceed the event himself, joking as he did so that the place might be renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center. Why stop there, one might ask – why not eradicate JFK altogether? Surely it would be easy enough to erase Kennedy’s high-minded inscriptions from its walls as part of the building’s much-vauntedrenovation?A pushback has begun. A Democrat senator, Sheldon Whitehouse, haswrittento Grenell outlining concerns about spending, questioning outlandish-seeming hotel costs, “lavish meals and entertainment”, the deal done with Fifa, contracts offered to personal friends, and discounted rentals for political allies, including a conference titled “The Christian Persecution Summit”. (Grenellwrote backdenying what he called false accusations.) But pushback or not, there will be a lasting effect on this once great palace of the arts, whatever happens at the next presidential election. It is quick and easy to unravel something, and hard to nurture it back to health – the same goes for so many of the US’s institutions, and for the country itself.For those in the UK who are tempted to imagine, “It couldn’t happen here,” they should not kid themselves. Nigel Farage and others on the British hard right are already intensifying their pound-shop Trumpism – a new Trumpism that takes inspiration from Viktor Orbán’s reshaping and repression of broadcasting, the media and cultural institutions in Hungary. What has been done at the Kennedy Center should be seen not as a spectacle, but as a warning.Charlotte Higgins is the Guardian’s chief culture writerExplore more on these topicsCultureOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationArts policycommentShareReuse this content"

We need the condemnation, and the solidarity, but we also need actionMon 15 Dec 2025 18.12 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 18.14 ESTShareBeing Jewish in Australia today feels very different to when I was a child.Growing up, it was about family, community, culture. It was about our customs, cuisine, our shared history and connectedness.I learned about antisemitism, but it was mostly historic. Centuries of the persecution, expulsion and mass murder of Jews around the world – not least during the Holocaust, recent enough that there were living survivors to tell their stories first-hand.But I grew up in a country with no real history of antisemitism, in a small, tight-knit community that was deeply embedded in the nation around it.Antisemitism was not an obviously immediate threat to Jewish Australians. There were incidents, but they were relatively minor by historical or global standards. Deadly attacks on synagogues, Jewish businesses and community centres were things that happened overseas, not here.Man who tackled alleged Bondi gunman ‘couldn’t bear to see people dying’, cousin saysRead moreWe knew there were threats. We passed the armed guards and fences every time we went to a synagogue or Jewish school. But mostly we felt safe. This was the lucky country – a safe, diverse, welcoming and tolerant nation. There was scarcely a safer place or time in history to be Jewish than this Australia.It doesn’t feel like that any more.Antisemitism has increased over the past 26 months. Synagogues, Jewish businesses, homes and vehicles have been defaced and firebombed. Jewish people have been doxed and ostracised from communities. It has been soul crushing and heartbreaking. It has caused anger and distress. It has cast a long and dark shadow over our lives.In recent times, antisemitism has dominated the national political debate. It has been exhaustively partisan. As a former Labor adviser – including to Anthony Albanese – I have found this personally challenging.There have been many announcements and denouncements, but the attacks have continued. Now, I’m writing in the aftermath of the worst terrorist attack on Australia’s soil – targeted at Jewish people celebrating a Jewish festival.There have been deadly attacks on Jewish communities around the world over the past few years. This is not unique to Australia. We have seen it in Manchester, in Washington, in Berlin and in Rouen.This attack could have happened anywhere – but it happened in Australia. And it is Australia’s job to make sure it never happens again.The massacre at Bondi beach sits heavily on us all. The entire nation has been shocked. Many are speaking about antisemitism for the first time.I have experienced many emotions over the past 24 hours. Anger is not one of them. I don’t have the energy for it. I have cried many times – both from devastation and from kindness. I have been inundated with messages and calls from non-Jewish friends and colleagues, past and present. Many have moved me to tears.But what I also know is that condemning a terrorist attack is easy. We need the condemnation, and the solidarity, but we also need action.Antisemitism requires practical leadership from governments and the agencies who keep us safe, but it also needs action from all of us.We must all call it out whenever we see it. We must not diminish or deny it. We must acknowledge it is a real and persistent threat to Jewish Australians.We also need to recognise that if Jewish people aren’t safe in Australia, none of us are. Modern Australia has been built on migration and multiculturalism. I hold my commitment to these values dearly. They are the reason I am here – the reason my family could flee the horrors of antisemitism in Europe and find safe refuge here.We must understand that the fraying of our social cohesion is a threat to every multicultural community in this country. We are seeing public support for multiculturalism decrease in Australia. It will be a disaster if the forces of rightwing populism succeed here as they increasingly are in Europe and the United States.‘Everyone should play our part’: 20,000 Australians heed the call to give blood after Bondi beach terrorRead moreJewish people are on the frontline of this fight but, if we are the first to succumb to it, we won’t be the last.On Sunday, every Jewish person’s worst nightmare came true. Many feared and warned this day would come, yet it is still more shocking and horrifying than we could imagine.Attending Jewish events will never feel as safe as they did before. Our usual response in these times is proud defiance – but how can we be proudly Jewish if there is a risk we might be killed for being so?Jewish people are questioning their future in Australia. They are considering leaving. I’m not, but I’m devastated that so many others are. This is our home, where we belong, or at least where so many once felt that they belonged.This fight carries no quick fix. If there was one, it would have been fixed long ago.I know that most Australians are not antisemitic. We are all horrified by what happened at Bondi. If that horror can be turned into unity and action, I truly believe we can restore the Australia I grew up in.Dean Sherr is a Jewish Australian writer and consultant who previously worked as an adviser to Anthony Albanese, as well as federal and state Labor MPs, and with Jewish community organisationsExplore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackOpinionSydneyAntisemitismcommentShareReuse this content"

It makes a start, but the proposed increase of specialty training posts over the next three years, from the 1,000 extra announcedin the 10-year health planto 4,000, simplyrepurposes“locally employed doctors”, rather than increasing capacity. It will not mean more doctors on the shop floor of our A&E departments – it’s just shuffling the deck chairs on a sinking ship.This year it is estimated thatnearly 40,000 doctorswill apply for about 10,000 specialty training places. These are doctors who have completed years of training and who stand ready and waiting to care for patients, yet they will be denied opportunities because the posts do not exist. Even with the proposed legislation, without further measures we will still be turning those doctors away. Many more will join the training bottleneck queue. A lot will leave the NHS entirely.Patients already feel the consequences of these shortages. In some regions, including my own in the north-east, some lifesaving treatments are available only during office hours because there are not enough specialists to deliver them. A&E departments are overwhelmed. Yet, we continue to turn thousands of aspiring A&E doctors away because of the lack of training places in emergency medicine. These problems are the result of political choices, and they are unravelling in real time.Alongside this jobs crisis is the well-established fact that resident doctors havefaced a significant fallin the value of their wages over more than a decade. We asked for a fair multiyear process to begin repairing that loss. We made clear that we did not expect an instant reversal and that we were prepared to negotiate constructively. Yet the government’s last-minute offer did nothing on pay at all. Meanwhile, the government is quietly pushing real-terms pay cuts on to doctors in early 2026 through abelow-inflationuplift.Resident doctors in England vote to go ahead with strikeRead moreWhat has made this situation even harder to accept is the health secretary’s rhetoric in recent weeks. The very professionals whose union he accused of “juvenile delinquency” will be holding overstretched services together at the peak of this flu season. Thousands of us, myself included, will be caring for patients over the busy festive period instead of spending time with loved ones. We knew we’d be working Christmases when we signed up, but the disrespectful language being used, and lack of meaningful engagement with the problems we raise, shows a worrying disconnect with both the workforce and the public we care for.Accepting the current offer would mean accepting further decline. It would mean continued shortages of jobs. It would mean more real-terms pay cuts that push more doctors out of the profession and theNHS.There is still a constructive way forward. The government can choose to work with us to develop a workforce plan based on evidence, create the training posts required and enter serious negotiations on pay to retain doctors. These steps are essential for an NHS that depends on resident doctors who want to stay, to progress and to care for patients.I remain ready to negotiate and to call strike action off. But we need the secretary of state to recognise the reality we’re in, to treat the profession with respect, and work with us towards a credible deal – even at this late hour.Dr Jack Fletcher is an acute medicine doctor working in the north-east of England and chair of the British Medical Association’s UK resident doctors committeeDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Amid all the noise, it’s difficult to know how bad this flu really is – and how much is political spin. I should start by saying “super flu” is not a scientific term or one used by any academics or clinicians I work with. It’s a colloquial phrase that’s been used by various NHS England bosses and taken up by Wes Streeting, the health secretary, andKeir Starmer.This year, a couple of factors have come together to make it a harder flu season for hospitals to manage. First, flu has arrived earlier than previous years. This isn’t unique to the UK: it’s the same picture across the US, Canada, Japan, Germany – basically the northern hemisphere going into winter. This is in the context of multiple viruses circulating such as Covid and rhinoviruses, which means patients could be fighting one or more viruses at the same time and are more susceptible to getting sicker from influenza.The current level of hospitalisations usually occurs in January, but it’s happening a month earlier. According to recentNHS England data, flu-related hospital admissions have risen sharply in December 2025, with figures showing an average of around 2,660 flu patients in hospital per day, the highest level recorded for this time of year, and a 55% rise in admissions in just one week. A&E attendances for flu and respiratory illness overall have also reached record levels, compounding pressure on emergency services.View image in fullscreenA sign encouraging people to get their flu jab in the window of a pharmacy in Langley, Berkshire, on 12 December 2025.Photograph: Maureen McLean/ShutterstockWhen we refer to seasonal flu, the predominant circulating strains are H1N1 and H3N2 (both influenza A) and influenza B. All three are included in this year’s influenza vaccine. H3N2 is more severe as a “flu” than the other strains, especially among those who are elderly or young children. This winter, a new variant of H3N2 has emerged, called K. This strain emerged (through mutation) too late to be included in the update for this year’s seasonal vaccine. This means that the vaccine offers less-than-ideal protection. This is not unusual for seasonal flu vaccines, given how quickly the influenza virus mutates.Does this mean this year’s flu vaccine doesn’t work? No, not at all. While not perfect, it still offers partial protection against H3N2, and against the two other strains circulating. Real-world vaccine effectiveness data from theUK Health Security Agencyshows that even with the subclade K H3N2 dominating cases, the 2025–26 seasonal vaccine still provides typical protection: around 72–75% effectiveness against emergency department attendance and hospital admission in children and adolescents, and 32–39% effectiveness in adults. That means vaccinated people are significantly less likely to be hospitalised compared with unvaccinated people, even if infection isn’t completely prevented.But there’s another problem this winter in the UK: both the take-up and the provision of the flu vaccine. Among those at-risk groups covered by the NHS,data from last yearindicates around only 40% of people under 65 in clinical risk groups and roughly 42.6% of two- to three-year-olds were vaccinated, while uptake in those aged 65 or over was higher at around 74.9%. We, the public health community, haven’t done a good enough job explaining to people how serious a disease flu can be and the benefits of vaccination, or making it easy to get jabbed.But what about if you’re not in an NHS-covered group, and just don’t want to get severely ill with flu this year? Unfortunately, theUK currently has vaccine shortagesin the private market, meaning many pharmacies have low or no stock. It’s a bizarre situation. The cost to get vaccinated (prevention) falls on individuals who need to take time off from work, potentially visit multiple pharmacies to find a jab, and pay £18-20. This is time and money that many people would struggle to find, given other pressing demands.But if someone goes unvaccinated and is admitted to hospital, the cost falls on theNHSand taxpayers into tens of thousands of pounds for admissions, plus adds to the huge patient load. These are the opposite incentives to what we should have for individuals.Coming to hospitals, the UK government is correct in saying that they are in a critical state, but this is because there is little surge capacity. As one clinician told me: “Both primary care and secondary care run close to or at capacity all the time, so any increase in illness tips the system over capacity and into ‘crisis’.” Hospital bosses are worried because if December already looks this bad (like a typical January would), what will January and February be like? The million-dollar question is: have we hit the peak already for flu (and just had an earlier season), or is the entire baseline going to be higher for the coming months, which would be very worrying? I don’t think anyone knows the answer.I do worry that we need to be careful of crying wolf, and calling it “super flu”. This is not a novel pathogen (like SARS-CoV-2) which made many people critically ill, and where we had no vaccine, no diagnostics and no treatments, plus no prior immunity in the global population. Overstating also carries that risk that if we do get a step-change in a virus – likeH5N1 avian flu– causing human-to-human transmission with a high fatality rate, that people are desensitised to public health information. Covid was a once-in-a-century pandemic. I don’t think you can compare what’s happening now to that at all.The NHS is struggling and in crisis, but not because of a “super flu”. It is struggling because flu season has come early, vaccines are offering partial protection from a mutated circulating strain, there has been poor take-up and inaccessibility of the seasonal flu vaccine, and it is a health service that hits a critical state every single winter. As a final aside, is it too late to get vaccinated? Not at all – I’d strongly encourage you to find a local pharmacy with stock and get protected going into the festive period.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghFit Forever: Wellness for midlife and beyondOn Wednesday 28 January 2026, join Annie Kelly, Devi Sridhar, Joel Snape and Mariella Frostrup, as they discuss how to enjoy longer and healthier lives, with expert advice and practical tips.

And we have good reason to beDave Rich is director of policy at the Community Security TrustMon 15 Dec 2025 06.30 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 13.44 ESTShareHeaton Park, Boulder, Washington DC – and now Bondi beach. Add the murders ofRabbi Zvi Koganin the UAE andZiv Kipper, an Israeli-Canadian businessman, in Egypt, and Jews have been killed on five continents since the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas upended the Middle East and unleashed a wave of antisemitism around the world. Anti-Jewish terrorism is now a global problem, as is the hateful extremism that drives it.The death toll from the appalling atrocity in Sydney is shocking enough: at the time of writing,15 people killed, including a child, and many more injured. Awful images circulate, as they always do. The mobile phone footage of two gunmen calmly taking aim at families enjoying a Hanukah party is utterly chilling. It takes a special kind of dehumanisation, an ideology of pure hatred and self-righteous conviction, to do that.The sheer randomness of these sites of anti-Jewish murder adds to the terror. Places that used to feel like safe, cosy corners of the Jewish world are now suddenly on the frontline. In Manchester, it was the solemn occasion of Yom Kippur that was targeted. In Sydney, it was the happy, lighthearted joy of Hanukah. If you are Jewish today, wherever you are, the decision about whether to celebrate Jewish festivals anywhere other than in your own home may be a matter of life and death.Nobody should have to live like this. More to the point, our societies cannot continue to function if this becomes the norm. The whole basis of western liberal democracy, the belief in shared values within a diverse society, is endangered by these attacks.We are yet to discover the detailed motivations of the Bondi attackers, but it looks for all the world like a product of the same Islamist extremism that struck in Manchester. And nobody doubts that it will strike again.Some people react as if this terrorism is akin to a natural disaster or unforeseen tragedy: blind hatred with no cause or purpose, and therefore no deeper explanation needed. But terrorism does not emerge from a vacuum. It is merely the most violent, lethal expression of a set of attitudes and beliefs that are much more widely held than just by those who wield the gun or the knife.When it comes to antisemitic terror, the ideas that some take as justification for murder are popularised and normalised through the language of much of the anti-Israel movement that has marched up and down our city streets and through our university campuses these past two years. That might be uncomfortable for some to accept. But violent words lead to violent actions, especially when left unchallenged by fellow marchers and unchecked by the law.Just this weekend in Birmingham, “One Solution Intifada Revolution” was brandished on a huge banner across the front of a pro-Palestine march. Elias Rodriguez, the man accused ofshooting deadSarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinskyoutside the Jewish Museum in Washington DC in May, wassaid by witnessesto have shouted “There is only one solution, intifada revolution” afterwards. There is no shyness about this support for violence: the Birmingham banner even included the upside-down red triangle that has become the symbol of the Hamas military wing, used in propaganda videos to mark out their targets ever since 7 October 2023.After rapper Bobby Vylan, one half of the group Bob Vylan, chanted “Death, death to the IDF”during a setat the Glastonbury festival in June, it became the rallying cry of anti-Israel protesters everywhere. It got Bob Vylan invited to theIrish parliamentand Bobby Vylan on to Louis Theroux’s podcast. Far from a call for death putting the rapper beyond the pale, it made him a celebrity.Is there a connection between this embrace of a call for death in the name of Palestinian rights, and people inflicting actual death apparently in the name of the same cause? As soon as you ask the question, the answer seems obvious.Perhaps this speculation sounds unfair. The devastation in Gaza is real and lots of people involved in pro-Palestinian activism do not support antisemitic violence against Jews, whether in Britain or Australia. But like it or not, it seems this movement has generated and sustained a political culture in which violence is both conceivable and enacted.Shooting Jews celebrating Hanukah is the most extreme manifestation of this hatred. But in sentiment, in the message it sends Jews, it is little different from the “Free Palestine” graffiti scrawled on a Hanukah menorah in north London on Friday that was reported to the Community Security Trust. None of this brings Palestinian freedom any closer, but antisemites have other priorities.The upshot is that yet again, Jews around the world are grieving. They will probably flock to Hanukah events in even greater numbers now, to show their resilience and solidarity. Jewish life will go on. Beneath that defiance, everyone is asking: will this country be safe for our children? Yet as the massacre at Bondi beach shows, even if you go to the furthest corners of the Earth, there is no escape.This is now a global emergency of antisemitism, and it is the consequence of two years of turning a blind eye, taking the easy path and ignoring the warnings. Make no mistake: alongside the grief and the defiance, Jews are angry. And they have every right to be.Dave Rich is director of policy at the Community Security Trust and the author of Everyday Hate: How Antisemitism is Built into Our World – and How You Can Change itDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Why am I doing it?Imogen West-KnightsWhen I see those final House credits roll, I won’t even feel any sense of achievement – I will just be deciding on my next joylessly sisyphean taskMon 15 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 11.30 ESTShareThere are 177 episodes of House, the 00s hospital drama starringHugh Laurieas a brilliant but cantankerous doctor. What this means, to my dismay, is that I spent five entire days, fivehours and 15 minutes of this autumn watching this series. In my defence, when I embarked on this rewatch, I was going through quite a trying time in my life. But I would find it difficult to excuse the fact that I didn’t just watchsomeHouse to take the edge off things, but attempted every single episode.It’s a derangedtelevision programme. It’s a tall order to select only a top 10 of the most bonkers plotlines – but here’s a representative handful.Housekidnaps the star of his favourite medical soap opera because he has diagnosed him with a brain tumour just by watching him on TV. House pays an actor to pretend to die so that he can freak out his staff by bringing her “back to life” in the morgue. House performs surgery on his own leg in his bathtub to excise the tumours he got from taking medicine only approved for use on rats. A member of House’s team spends a whole episode trying to convince a suicidal patient that he deserves to live and is not a bad person, before it is revealed that the patient is a serial killer who has eaten at least 13 people.And yet, despite these baffling scenarios, the episodes are all broadly the same in their structure: illness, diagnosis, misdiagnosis, brilliant and unlikely insight from House himself; cure; fin. I am so, so done with House.And yet I cannot be done with House, because I haven’t actually finished watching it. At the time of writing, I have 10 episodes left of its final season. I am not enjoying it any more. But I cannot and will not stop. I have begun to think about it in the same terms as I am thinking about my remaining work commitments before Christmas. Just got to get that done, so I can relax and enjoy the holiday.I have a problem, and this scenario with House is far from the first time it has reared its head. I can’t stop until a thing is done in its entirety. This, of course, does not apply to things I actuallyneedto do. I mean leisure activities. I will force myself to read a 400-page book that I decided in the first hour of reading I did not like. The only book I have ever left unfinished is Catch-22, because I lost the copy 12 years ago, but, late at night at least once a month, I think about how I need to finish reading Catch-22. I’m a keen video gamer – I make them as well as play them – but I have to strictly ration what I am allowed to buy. Sometimes I slip, with disastrous consequences. I found and completed every quest, side-quest and shrine in the open-world game The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. I don’t want to discuss how long that took. It was social and professional suicide. I quietly pray that Nintendo goes bankrupt so that it will never release another instalment.What’s going on here? What is behind this drive to the finish line? What is wrong with me? What outre psychological condition might the good doctor himself be able to diagnose me with, in the triumphant final six minutes of an episode? It strikes me as similar enough to the way addictive behaviour functions. Start watching House in order to distract from the horrors, keep watching House to avoid sitting with the horrors, persist in watching even more House despite the fact that House is now actively keeping me away from other, better things, and no longer even producing the enjoyment that drew me to watch House as a coping mechanism in the first place.But what, exactly, am I addicted to? The satisfaction of having seen something through, even if that thing is as useless as a TV show where Hugh Laurie limps around abusing people while being a genius? Is it about control? Am I trying to control this one tiny, unbelievably stupid and pointless area of my life? When you finish a task, the brain releases dopamine. Dopamine feels good. We know this. There is also, apparently, a psychological concept called the Zeigarnik effect, which posits that unfinished tasksweigh heavier on uscognitively and take greater precedence in our memory than completed ones. And the Ovsiankina effect, which says that once we’ve started a task, even if there is no tangible reward for finishing it, we would rather get it finished. So in some ways, it is only natural I want to complete things. We all do, it seems. But if you suffer from this same affliction, you will recognise the sick, self-loathing feeling that accompanies doggedly pursuing something that should be fun long, long past the point of it being fun any more. I will not experience any dopamine release when I see those final House credits roll. I will feel as if I dug my way out of prison with a spoon, only to surface in the exercise yard of a new prison, comprised of the next programme that comes my way.Turn off your TV, I hear you say. Go outside. Take up knitting! You do not understand. I would find a way to make “going outside” a completable task. I would suffocate in a sea of yarn. The only solution I can see, other than suddenly developing the type of self-control that has eluded me my entire life thus far, is to be careful in selecting which things I start doing. But I suspect I won’t. One day I will disappear from public life altogether – and when that happens, it will be because I started watching Grey’s Anatomy: 454 episodes (and counting) await.Imogen West-Knights is a writer and journalistExplore more on these topicsTelevisionOpinionPsychologyHouseHugh LaurieDramaUS televisioncommentShareReuse this content"

Here are some things to keep in mindMon 15 Dec 2025 03.09 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 16.37 ESTShareAs the community begins to grapple with the horror and tragedy of theBondi shootingson Sunday, children will probably have questions. Parents may also be wondering how to talk to their young kids and teenagers about what happened.I am a clinical psychologist and researcher with a focus on children, anxiety and post-traumatic stress. Here are some things to keep in mind when talking to children about the tragedy in Bondi (though many of these apply to any bad thing happening in the world).Answer truthfullyWhen your child asks you a question, it’s better to be honest, even if the answer is hard or you’re worried about their reaction.There is a lot of misinformation swirling around. Children need to feel they can trust what their parents say.It’s also possible kids will have ideas about what happened that are worse than the reality. So, it’s important to find out what they think they already know and gently correct any misinformation.Give children your full attentionIn a situation like this, we are all distressed. Unless you are listening carefully, you might miss the bit your child is actually worried about.Avoid providing unnecessary informationThe information you know or might be interested in knowing is going to be different to the information your child wants to know. Followtheir lead.You will need to use your expert knowledge of your own child to know how to best “pitch” the information you provide. Here are examples of the sort of words you might use.Forpreschool and very early school-age children, you could say:Some bad men used guns to shoot some people near the beach in Sydney. The police and doctors are helping the people who were hurt and the men who did the shooting have been taken away so they can’t hurt anyone else.Forprimaryschool children, you could say:Two men went to Bondi beach in Sydney and shot at people who were celebrating a religious festival. One of the shooters was killed and the other is under police guard. Some people were killed and some more were badly hurt. They are in hospital where medical staff are working as hard as they can to make sure they are OK. The police are also working really hard to understand why and how this happened and to try to make sure it doesn’t happen again.Forhighschool children, you can add more detail:Two men went to a Jewish religious celebration at Bondi beach in Sydney and shot guns at the crowds of people there. Sixteen people have been killed and more people have been injured and are in hospital. One of the shooters has been killed and the other one is under police guard. The police and security agencies are investigating why and how this happened. There’s also a political debate now about gun control in Australia.At the moment, while we are still waiting for a lot of information, it’s OK to say, “I don’t know, but as we learn more, I can get back to you on that”.Validate their feelingsThis isalways really important, but especially at a time like this. For example, “Yes, I understand you’re scared. What happened is really scary.”While you don’t want to frighten kids, something horrendous has happened – we don’t want to dismiss it. If it is on kids’ minds, it’s important they have the chance to talk about and make sense of what has happened.Start the conversation if needs beUnless your kids are very small and you’re very confident they won’t have heard about the shootings at daycare or preschool, it may be worth asking your child what they know: “Have you heard anything about what happened in Sydney?”Then kids can ask what they need and parents can figure out what their child thinks they know. A good alternative to talking, especially for young kids, might be drawing.If they don’t need to talk though, that’s OK. It’s possible they might need to next week. It’s also possible it’s not really on their radar. Again, follow their lead.Focus on the good and brave peopleEncourage your children to think about the many helpful and brave things people did and continue to do around this tragedy. Police, paramedics, doctors, nurses and bystanders all stepped in and did incredible things to help.We don’t want kids to come away thinking all people are bad and want to hurt each other. The truth is, most people would not choose to hurt each other and instead would chose to help.It’s OK for kids to see you are sadThis tragedy is devastating – even if you haven’t been directly affected. It’s absolutely OK for parents toshow they are distressed– as long as kids are also seeing their parents manage their distress constructively. For example, going for a walk or talking to friends.Put it in contextWe know, tragically, at least one child has died. So it is quite reasonable for kids to be worried about their own safety. Could this happen to me? Or near me?You can point out, “the world is a place where sometimes dangerous things happen. But the world is not always a dangerous place”.You could also say, “part of the reason we are all so devastated is it’s an incredibly unusual event. This is not something that happens every week or even every year.”And you can come back to how the community is uniting against these shootings. Our emergency responders are helping and police are trying to make sure it does not happen again.Don’t have the news on a loopSome families may find it helpful to watch the news together. That way you can ask questions and discuss things.But its also importantto take a breakand not consume large amounts of media on an endless loop, as this is not good for wellbeing.Keep in mind,for younger children, if they keep seeing the footage, they may think this is happening in real time and happening repeatedly. Make sure younger children understand that the shooting is over, and – where appropriate – where it happened in relation to where they live.Is there anything we can do?Consider is there anything you can usefully do, either individually or as a family. Do you have Jewish friends you can check in with? Can you show your support and your care in some other way? If you are eligible to donate blood, this is one of the most useful things you could do, and it’s a great example to your kids.This is a moment to provide our kids with a model of unity. We are all devastated in the face of an horrific act of divisiveness and hatred – this is not the country we want to be. Australia is united in supporting the Jewish community.Vanessa Cobham isprofessor of clinical psychology at the University of Queensland.

And our political establishment is allowing itMon 15 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 11.41 ESTShareJust as I was starting to write this column, an email alert popped up on my screen. “Punters back Nigel for prime minister after Keir Starmer,” it read, placing the Reform leader second in the odds market after Wes Streeting. What a weird, dissonant duality this is.Nigel Farageis in his fourth week of revelations about alleged racist behaviour at school, and yet, here we are. This is one of those twilight-zone moments in British politics, where it seems something is going to “cut through” any minute now. For a moment it seems as if it absolutely will. And then, there’s a loss of momentum and a return to the status quo. In my mind it manifests like a battle of physical forces, acting on one another. Journalistic investigations, testimonies, whistleblowers, all as a sort of storm that blows on a political actor who may be knocked off his feet, but still manages to cling on by his fingernails, until the gale blows over.Up scrambles Farage, a few pieces and more than a fewpolling pointsknocked off him, but still in place. This is, so far, what he is managing to survive – thetestimoniesof some 28 of Farage’s contemporaries at Dulwich college who have told the Guardian that they experienced or witnessed racist or antisemitic behaviour when he was a teenager. Jewish students were taunted; “gas them,” Farage said, “Hitler was right”. A black student, much younger than the then 17-year-old Farage, wastold: “That’s the way back to Africa.” The allegations amount, in my reading, to a sort of obsessive campaign against minority students, pursued with the kind of bewildering commitment that anyone who has ever been bullied will feel in their bones.Farage’s response to the painful and, in the circumstances, consideredreflectionsof those who say they experienced or witnessed his behaviour, is to heap salt into the wound. He is a man clearly shaken by the allegations and scrutiny, and has gone on the attack. He has denied claims, refused to apologise,attackedthe BBC for airing the allegations, cycled through every insulting excuse in the book about it being just the sort of thing people said in those days, nothing more than “banter”, and, his most humble defence to date, “never directly, really tried to go and hurt anybody”. I guess we’ll just have to swallow the risible notion that when he apparently waited for the black student by the lower school gates “to repeat the vulgarity” it wasn’t meant as directly hurtful, more the sort of thing that casually happens in one’s youth. Let those among us who have not made their way to an entirely different part of the school to show a student in a lower year the way back to Africa cast the first stone.But you know what, maybe it will be swallowed. Because the only action that is appropriate and proportionate to not only the allegations, but his response to them, is that Farage’s entire role in public life, let alone as possible next prime minister, be called into question. If that sounds dramatic to you, then perhaps that is because of the novelty of the notion. Because if anything, the opposite of that has happened. Calls for Farage’s resignation or for him to consider his position are broadly absent. Kemi Badenoch, Keir Starmer and a group of Holocaust survivors have madedemands for apology. But even that entirely reasonable demand has not been picked up and repeated by either his party members or, most notably, large swathes of the press. Parts of the rightwing media actually appear to beexcitedthat he has come out swinging, venting his “fury” on the BBC, and how he has “destroyed” the broadcaster and “demands” an apology.One reason for that, of course, is the nature of Reform and Farage. Both can be seen as vehicles for the sort of xenophobia that sets the bar for outrage at allegations of racism much higher. But another reason is just how much the discourse on race and immigration has both evolved and become intertwined. The allegations about him come at a time when the gap between Farage as extremist aberration and mainstream politics is closing. The Tories, Labour and Reform engage in a deportation numbers bidding war. Labour boasts that it hasdeported 50,000people so far. Reformpledgesto deport 600,000. We raise you750,000, the Tories say. Labourblames illegal immigrants“tearing the country apart” for the rise in racism, rather than being troubled by the racism itself; it talks about the country as an “island of strangers”; relentlessly focuses on deportations and turns the screws on asylum seekers and others who come to the country to work. Against that backdrop, Farage’s alleged actions land in a more hospitable climate, one in which he is at one end of a continuum, rather than an outlier.And more broadly, Farage now operates in a country wherehistorically largefar-right rallies are taking place, politicians such as Robert Jenrick are emboldened tocomplainabout “not seeing another white face” in a neighbourhood, and anti-immigrant rhetoric takes on the language of racism while using concerns about immigration as an alibi. In a moment of chilling convergence of the two, Badenoch said that the country needs to bekept safefrom murderers and sexual predators, and that those deported should “go back to where they came from”.Farage has become the embodiment of the success of such dog-whistle politics. That constant vilification of minorities – non-white faces on a “breaking point”poster; kids who don’t speak English as a first language as a sign of the “cultural smashing” of the UK; claims that immigration has left Britain “unrecognisable” – all are claims plausibly rooted in not racism or xenophobia, but simply a worry about social cohesion and what we can afford. That is why the school claims are so rattling for him: there is no way they can be slipped disingenuously behind an innocent mask of “legitimate concerns”, they are racism pure and nasty.It has all taken on nightmarish proportions. Farage feels more sinister and malevolent than ever, an expression not just of his own politics, but the enabling of prejudices that cannot be named because they now hide under all sorts of ducks and dives – security, taxes, integration! – that come as a result of hanging it all on immigration. He draws his power not from the sheer force of his arguments and personality, but increasingly just how recklessly the immigration issue has been handled by the political establishment. If he survives, it will be a colossally tragic let-down to those who have come forward. And it will be because there is now a little bit of his poison everywhere.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNigel FarageOpinionRaceImmigration and asylumReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

Not because the world needed permission to enjoy pizza – it clearly didn’t – but because the news soothed a longstanding national irritation: France and Japan, recognised in 2010 and 2013, had beaten us to it. For Italy’s culinary patriots, this had become a psychological pebble in the shoe: a tiny, persistent reminder that someone else had been validated first.Yet the strength of Italian cuisine has never rested on an ancient, coherent culinary canon. Most of what passes for ancient “regional tradition” was assembled in the late 20th century, largely for tourism and domestic reassurance. The real history of Italian food is turbulent: a saga of hunger, improvisation, migration, industrialisation and sheer survival instinct. It is not a serene lineage of grandmothers, sunlit tables and recipes carved in marble. It is closer to a national long-distance sprint from starvation – not quite the imagery Italy chose to present toUnesco.To make matters worse (or better, depending on your sense of humour), the “Italian” cuisine thatconquered the worldwas not the one Italians carried with them when they emigrated. They had no such cuisine to carry. Those who left Italy did so because they were hungry. If they’d had daily access to tortellini, lasagne and bowls of spaghetti as later imagined, they would not have boarded ships for New York, Buenos Aires or São Paulo to face discrimination, exploitation and the occasional lynching. They arrived abroad with a handful of memories and a deep desire to never eat bad polenta again.And then something miraculous happened: they encountered abundance. Meat, cheese, wheat and tomatoes in quantities unimaginable in the villages they had fled. Presented with ingredients they’d never seen together in one place, they invented new dishes. These creations – not ancient recipes – are what later returned toItalyas “tradition”. In short: Italian cuisine did not migrate. It was invented abroad by people who had finally found something to eat – a truth that fits awkwardly with Unesco’s love of millennium-old continuity.But the most decisive transformation came not abroad but at home, during Italy’s astonishing economic boom between 1955 and 1965. In that decade, the country underwent the culinary equivalent of a religious conversion. Refrigerators appeared in kitchens, supermarkets replaced corner shops, meat ceased to be a luxury. Families who had long measured cheese by the gram discovered, with a mix of disbelief and guilt, that it could be bought whenever one wished. What the world interprets as Italy’s eternal culinary self-confidence is, in reality, the afterglow of that moment. Italians did not inherit abundance. They walked into it, slightly dazed, like people entering the wrong cinema screen and deciding to stay.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Getty Images/iStockphotoThis context makes Italy’s current wave of culinary sovereigntism particularly surreal. We hear stern warnings against “globalist contamination” from politicians who grew up eating industrial panettone and Kraft slices in school sandwiches. We are told that Italian cuisine must remain pure, fixed and inviolable – as if purity had anything to do with our past. Italian food is a champion of adaptation. It has always survived by stealing, assimilating and reinventing. The Darwinian logic is embarrassingly simple: the cuisines that change are the ones that survive. Yet sovereigntist rhetoric insists on freezing everything in place, as if the national menu were a snow globe.Of course, the British have helped. Britain has cultivated its own affectionate fantasy of Italy: eternal sunshine, tomatoes that taste like childhood holidays, families who spend hours eating together as if they were auditioning for a commercial. Television personalitiessuch as Stanley Tuccihave perfected this fantasy into a polished export brand – the loud, lovable Italian bursting into your kitchen to rescue you from beige British food. It’s fun, it sells and it has about as much to do with Italian history as Mamma Mia! has to do with the Greek economy.This British fantasy intersects perfectly with Italy’s own mythmaking instinct. For centuries, Italians were hungry – not poetically, not metaphorically, but literally hungry. Pellagra, starvation, malnutrition: these were the foundations of Italian “tradition”. And it is precisely because the past was so bleak that modern Italians felt compelled to build a golden myth of themselves. A myth in which the grandmother is an oracle, the tomato a sacred relic and “tradition” a serene and ancient truth rather than a post-1960s reconstruction.So what did Italy actually submit to Unesco? The real story of our cuisine, shaped by hunger, migration, innovation and sudden prosperity? The glossy tourist-brochure version, the one lit like a Netflix travel programme? Or – stranger still – what some promoters called “the relationship Italians have with food”, described in the breezy vocabulary of airport psychology? A heritage not of recipes, but of feelings; conveniently vague, pleasantly flattering and not entirely falsifiable.The first version would deserve recognition. The second trivialises it. The third turns heritage into national therapy.Italy did not need Unesco to feel important. It needed to shed the insecurity that a cuisine is only valuable when validated by an external referee. Instead, the country reached for the certificate, not the substance. And so we embalmed a living cuisine, fixing it into a museum frame just as it continues – thankfully – to evolve in real homes, restaurants and workplaces.This is the paradox worth remembering. The world already loves Italian food, but often loves a version shaped by television, tourism and decades of gentle mythmaking. Italians rarely resist the myth – it is flattering and profitable – but myths are fragile foundations for a Unesco bid. Because in the end, what Italy submitted was not its history but a postcard: beautifully composed, carefully lit, designed to please.And like all postcards, it risks being forgotten in a drawer, while the real story of Italian cuisine – restless, inventive and gloriously impure – carries on elsewhere.Alberto Grandi is the author of La Cucina Italiana Non Esiste and a professor of food history at the University of ParmaExplore more on these topicsItalyOpinionUnescoFoodEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

He was impossible to predict, at least during his golden years. How could one man make the most inspired mockumentary of all time, a handful of zinging romcoms, a coming-of-age yarn, a knowing fairytale comedy, a gruesome yet screamingly camp thrilleranda hokey-but-fun courtroom drama? Well, he did – and all in the first decade of his directing career.US audiences loved him first as an actor: he was the liberal son-in-law known as Meathead in nearly 200 episodes of the late-1970s sitcom All in the Family, based on the UK favourite Till Death Us Do Part. He remained in front of the camera for his 1984 directorial debut This IsSpinal Tap, which chronicled an entire band of meatheads. In fact, his face is the very first thing we see: he plays the ingratiating documentary-maker Marty DiBergi, an affectionate parody of Martin Scorsese as glimpsed in the off-stage scenes of The Last Waltz, his concert film about the Band. Spinal Tap’s chief target, though, was the speed with which fame can turn you dumb – or make idiots believe themselves to be geniuses. The heavy metal band, played by Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer, put it best: “It’s such a fine line between stupid and clever.”View image in fullscreenPart of a gallery of self-portraits … Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Jerry O’Connell and Corey Feldman in Stand By Me.Photograph: Cinetext/Columbia/AllstarPart of the joy of This Is Spinal Tap was that it trickled out into the world without much success or fanfare, so that the home-video audiences who stumbled upon it had the sensation of having discovered the film entirely by themselves. Reiner’s achievement was striking: he was co-creating and shaping improvisatory material in an innovative way, but still insisting on the kind of rigour typical of precision-engineered screwball. There’s not a second of dead or wasted time in the movie, which clocks in at under 85 minutes.He proved himself adept at old-fashioned odd-couple comedy in his next film, The Sure Thing, which re-tooled Frank Capra’s It Happened One Night for the Brat Pack generation. An early showcase for the unruly charm of John Cusack, it wasn’t a hit either, but it did show that Reiner could make slick but distinctive Hollywood product, and it established the rhythm that would mark that first decade of work: make them quick, make them good, and move on.His next film, Stand By Me, adapted from Stephen King’s short story The Body, about four teenage pals trekking into the woods to find a corpse, was drenched in sentimental indulgence: “I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was 12. Jesus, does anyone?” (Um, yes.) But if ever there were an antidote to such banality, it lies in Reiner’s glorious direction of his young cast, including Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix, both painfully raw as boys undervalued or neglected by their fathers.View image in fullscreenInstant bull’s-eye … Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal in When Harry Met Sally.Photograph: AA Film Archive/AlamyReiner freely admitted that these were part of a gallery of self-portraits, also including Tom Cruise as the military lawyer daunted by his late father’s reputation in A Few Good Men. These expressed the insecurities he felt around his own father, Carl Reiner, who had initially doubted his son’s talents. Reiner Sr happened also to be a widely adored actor turned director, but one whose popularity threatened to overwhelm his son before he’d had the chance to forge his own career. “There was a time when getting out from Carl’s shadow was important to Rob,” observed Reiner Jr’s friend,Billy Crystal.Crystal had a cameo as a mime waiter in This Is Spinal Tap (“Mime is money”) and formed part of the ensemble in The Princess Bride, Reiner’s zany fairytale follow-up to Stand By Me, which continued the Reiner pattern of overlooked gems, future cult favourites and sleeper hits.That pattern was broken by his next three pictures, all of which were box-office bullseyes straight out of the gate.When Harry Met Sally, sparklingly written by Nora Ephron, was performed by Crystal and Meg Ryan with a vitality that suggested they were the first ever “will they/won’t they?” couple in romcom history. (A shout-out is due, too, to Reiner’s mother Estelle, whose deadpan line reading – “I’ll have what she’s having” – is the punchline to Ryan’s fake-orgasm deli scene.) He then went back to Stephen King, with greater success this time, for Misery, a ridiculously enjoyable thriller, far camper than I think Reiner intended it to be, about an incapacitated novelist (James Caan) held prisoner by an adoring but unhinged fan, played by Kathy Bates, who won an Oscar.View image in fullscreenOscar nom … Reiner on the set of A Few Good Men with Tom Cruise Demi Moore and Kevin Bacon.Photograph: COLUMBIA/AllstarReiner, on the other hand, didn’t. He was never nominated, not even for A Few Good Men, his next hit, which pitted Cruise memorably against Jack Nicholson, and was nominated for best picture. It didn’t seem to matter, since he was shaping up to be, in the words of his second movie, a sure thing. In terms of quality, if not box office, he was correct to say in 1994 that he had made seven pictures with “not a stinker” among them. With Spinal Tap-esque hubris, that boast came on the eve of the release of North, a wacky picaresque, another study of a forsaken son, and his first outright failure. In 2024, Rolling Stone ranked North second on a list of 50 Terrible Movies by Great Directors, beaten only by Francis Ford Coppola’s Jack.For the next 30 years, there wasn’t much to write home about. The American President, Reiner’s wound-licking follow-up to North, featured winning performances from Annette Bening and Michael Douglas, and returned Reiner to his Capra-esque comfort zone. Thereafter, it was all awards-bait (the civil rights drama Ghosts of Mississippi), undistinguished romcoms (The Story of Us, Rumour Has It), whimsy (The Magic of Belle Isle) and even a needless, so-so sequel to his one masterpiece (Spinal Tap II: The End Continues). Documentary – he produced God & Country, about the rise of Christian nationalism, and directed Albert Brooks: Defending My Life – was one area where he seemed still to be experimenting fruitfully.The afterglow from those early pictures, though, was always strong enough to carry him through. For that first decade at least, he really delivered the goods.Explore more on these topicsRob ReinerSpinal TapWhen Harry Met SallyComedy filmsRomance filmsBilly CrystalComedycommentShareReuse this content"

As the show hits China, Australia and Mexico, its ‘nerd’ creators explain how they went global with a box of hats and a dreamTim JonzeMon 15 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 03.37 ESTShareNatasha Hodgson is wondering what to make of all the straight women who have developed a crush on her. Or, to put it more accurately, all the straight women who have developed a crush on her when she’s dressed as a second world war naval intelligence officer and speaking in a silly voice. But is it really Hodgson these woman have fallen for? Or is it Ewen Montagu, the bombastic, braces-wearing war hero she plays in the hit musical Operation Mincemeat?“The confusion is real,” says Hodgson. “These women come to the show believing themselves to be straight, then they have a total identity crisis. But hey – if that’s not what musical theatre is for, I don’t know what is!”If a fan now asks us to sign their arm, we have to ask: ‘Is this going to be a tattoo?’Challenging the sexuality of audience members is not the only thing that testifies to the power of Operation Mincemeat. Since it was first performed in 2019, the show has grown from quirky fringe comedy into an unadulterated smash hit both in the West End (sold out for three years and counting) and on Broadway (now on its fifth extension). It has garnered rave reviews and counts Robert De Niro, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Colin Firth, Samuel L Jackson, Steven Spielberg and Queen Camilla among its fans. One “Mincefluencer” (as superfans are called) loves it so much, they have been to see it a staggering 201 times at the time of writing.Next year, this heartwarming British success story will reach another milestone – embarking on a world tour, travelling to China, Australia and Mexico, as well as up and down the UK. And how it all happened is, well, a bit of a miracle. Because while Operation Mincemeat is undoubtedly brilliant, hilarious, moving and astonishing, sometimes all in the space of one dance routine, the story it’s based on doesn’t exactly scream: “Hit stage musical!”View image in fullscreenThe stickler and the maverick … real-life heroes Charles Cholmondeley, left, and Ewen Montagu transport the body in 1943.Photograph: Pictorial Press/AlamyThe actual Operation Mincemeat – which also inspired a much more traditional type of war thriller film in 2021 – was a crack piece of second world war deception. MI5 took the body of homeless Welsh labourer Glyndwr Michael, who had died after eating rat poison, gave him a new name (Major William Martin), armed him with fake plans about an allied invasion of Sardinia and Greece (Sicily was the real target), and deposited his uniformed body on a beach in Huelva, Spain, hoping it would reach German spies.When I meet SpitLip – AKA Hodgson, David Cumming, Zoë Roberts and composer Felix Hagan – I don’t need to ask how they turned such unlikely material into comedy: these old friends from Warwick University have such a warm, buzzy energy, they could make any story funny. Cumming remembers the show’s first writing sessions, when they were so poor they would be “literally cycling on Tash’s mum’s old exercise bike to keep warm because we couldn’t afford heating!”“All our friends were getting mortgages and having babies and we were existing on Pret sandwiches and anxiety attacks,” says Hodgson. “Pret sandwiches?” says Cumming. “More like Tesco!”It even has a rap about the Third Reich: ‘Goosestep to the left, jump to the far right!’After reading everything they could on Operation Mincemeat, the group realised the opportunities were enormous. The Man Who Never Was, the 1953 book by the operation’s co-leader, Montagu, gave the impression that, at least for some of Britain’s top brass, the second world war could be quite fun, chaps. Then there was the dynamic between Montagu and the true brains of the operation, Charles Cholmondeley. The latter’s shy, nerdy persona and adherence to the rulebook offered a perfect contrast to Montagu’s swashbuckling disregard.This didn’t just have to be a story about war, they realised. It could be a topical satire on Britain’s public school elites as well. As opening number Born to Lead puts it: “For fortune favours bravery / And a fortune’s what I’ve got!” There was also room to explore grief, longing and feminism, with jokes about a newt’s penis and a rap about the Third Reich. “Goosestep to the left, jump to the far right!”Weaving all of this into three hours of song and dance was, of course, challenging. “We’d think, ‘Maybe this verse isn’t as exciting as it could be’,” says Hagan, “but then realise that, because we’d changed it, the entire play now cancels itself out. So we’d have to start all over again.”View image in fullscreenStarting small … Operation Mincemeat at the 80-seat New Diorama theatre, London.Photograph: Alex Harvey-BrownWhen it came to performing the show, luxuries such as a director, producer or choreographer were clearly out of the question. In fact, they didn’t even have a rehearsal mirror – Roberts remembers practising one dance routine in the reflection of a framed poster on Cumming’s kitchen wall. Casting was done over Twitter: Jak Malone and Claire-Marie Hall were recruited, which meant that – alongside Hodgson, Roberts and Cumming – they had five actors. The only problem was that their script had, um, 82 characters.No problem – they’d just take dozens of roles each! Gendered casting went out the window. “Our main rule was, ‘Who is doing it the funniest?’” says Roberts. “Who’s doing the silliest voice? Who will look the stupidest in the wig?”They soon realised that swapping a character’s gender helped in interesting ways. “Montagu,” says Roberts, “is such an amazing combination of the terrible, terrible things about men at the top of the food chain, but also all of the brilliant things as well – the charisma, the gung-ho energy. We realised that if we cast a guy for that role, it would be hard to get people on his side. But by casting a woman [Hodgson], we get to poke fun.”The same applied to Malone’s portrayal of Hester Leggatt, the demanding, matronly woman who runs a tight ship as head of the secretaries. The real-life Leggatt was tasked with writing a letter to Martin, supposedly from his fiancee, that was placed in his pocket. The musical draws on lines from the actual letter for Dear Bill, a tearjerker about wartime separation. Malone would go on to win a Tony and Olivier for his showstopping performance.Consequently, the show acquired a “quietly queer” subtext, delighting (and evidently confusing) audiences along the way. A strong bond between cast and fans formed as the musical started to take off. After successful runs at small and very small venues, the show made its West End debut, taking over fromThe Womanin Black at the Fortunetheatre.The fandom intensified.“We’ve learned from the West End run,” says Cumming, “that if someone asks you to sign their arm you must ask, ‘Is this going to be a tattoo?’” “That way we know to write it nicely,” says Roberts, “and spell it correctly.” “My favourite,” says Hodgson, “was being sent some fan fiction set in ‘70s Week’ of The Great British Bake Off, Charles is trying to get his upside-down pineapple cake right when Monty joins him at midnight in the tent and … sex occurs.”Well, there’s the idea for your next musical!View image in fullscreenMuch more traditional war thriller … Colin Firth in the 2021 film.Photograph: Giles Keyte/Courtesy of See-Saw Films“It brings families closer together,” continues Hodgson. “We’ve had letters from people saying, ‘Me and my dad weren’t really connecting. Then we went to see the show – and now we’ve planned a trip to Huelva.’”The most astounding act of fandom, however, came when keen musical-goers tracked down Leggatt. For various reasons, including a misspelling on MI5 files, this woman who played such a decisive role in the war had gone unrecognised. Then, in 2023, Leggatt’s great-nephew Will received an email from a mincefluencer and all the dots were swiftly joined. A book, Finding Hester, followed and now the Fortune theatre has a plaque in Leggatt’s honour.“That was just amazing,” says Hodgson. “History inspiring art inspiring history.”Cumming: “By far the craziest thing the fans have done.”Hagan: “They had to speak to MI5!”“And then,” says Cumming, “they were able to let the family members know, like, ‘This was your auntie!’”Hearteningly, the cast have met relatives of the characters they portray. Hodgson evenhangs outwith descendants of Montagu. What on earth do they think of her, er, somewhat mixed portrayal? “They love it!” says Hodgson. “Bafflingly!” adds Cumming. “They’ve even given me one of his hats,” says Hodgson. “They were like, ‘You’re one of the family now.’ They’re just so proud of the story. And also, they have a great sense of humour, as you would imagine, from descendants of this man.”View image in fullscreen‘We make them cartoony but capture their essence’ … the cast in full flight.Photograph: Matt Crockett“We were always very aware that these are real people,” says Cumming. “We can’t just lie about what they did. We can make them cartoony. But we can’t change who they were in their soul. And I think we’ve captured their essence – which is why the family members haven’t sued us!”As the fanbase grew, so the musical shape-shifted. During Boris Johnson’s premiership, the writers found themselves adding in references “to whatever mad shit he’d said that day” which kept things fresh. “Then,” says Roberts with a laugh, “people started saying to us, ‘You know, there are over 50 people working on this now. You can’t just keep changing things.”“It’s really quite incredible that we are on Broadway but our script still says things like, ‘Hester enters somehow’,” says Hodgson. “Huge apologies to our directors and our actors.”The line about fascists winning gets a hmmm in London and a roar in New YorkBack when they were rehearsing using a poster for reflections, it’s safe to say no members of SpitLip were thinking of Mincemeat making it to Broadway. So when it happened earlier this year they went along, relocating to New York to perform there. Some critics wondered if American audiences would get the very British humour – but that proved unfounded.“In fact,” says Hodgson, “we have a line that is basically, ‘If people like us just blindly follow orders, then the fascists won’t need to bash down the door. They’ll have already won.’ InLondon, the audiences go, ‘Hmmm.’ Whereas in New York, there are huge roars of applause.”Snappily ever after: Sondheim’s fairytale musical Into the Woods – in picturesRead moreMoving to America did, of course, mean they had to recruit a whole new West End cast of mini versions of themselves. “That’s what we call them!” says Hodgson. This brought its own challenges. “You’ve got to make sure that these people can completely transform into 30 characters,” says Roberts. “The audition pack we send out to these poor people is huge, because they could be an amazing Jean Leslie [the talented young woman from the secretarial department], but if they can’t transform into an 80-year-old man in Huelva, clowning around with a phone, then it won’t work.”Christian Andrews, who has played various Operation Mincemeat parts during the West End run, can attest to this. “It was quite scary,” he says. “The clownier roles felt very much in my wheelhouse, but the quiet Hester stuff really challenged me. It was nice to be able to work that out for myself.”Performing night after night is, inevitably, exhausting. Ideas for a new show are “sort of percolating”, says Roberts, and at some point they will need to turn to those. But whatever happens with the Mincemeat juggernaut, the existing shows, the UK tour and the global expansion, she believes SpitLip will remain essentially unchanged. “We’ll always be these four nerds with a box of hats and a dream,” she says, “putting on a little show for people and hoping it goes well.”Show and tour detailsExplore more on these topicsMusicalsTheatreLondonSecond world warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But afterGyllene Tider[Golden Times] collapsed, I was depressed for two years. At first, Roxette only got together whenMarie Fredriksson, our singer, wasn’t busy with solo stuff. To keep her in the band, I needed to make it successful, so I was very motivated.Back then, apart from Abba, Sweden were pop underdogs. Our aim was just to get into other Scandinavian countries, or even Germany. But EMI Germany couldn’t get us on the radio, so they suggested I write a Christmas song. I wrote It Must Have Been Love (Christmas for the Broken Hearted), as it was originally titled, on the grand piano at home in Halmstad. I’d already started it as a love song: “It must have been love, but it’s over now.” But after the German label’s request, I added in asolitary reference to Christmasin the second verse. It was spring and I wasn’t feeling very Christmassy.I got 4,000 cards for my birthday. Today, the song is approaching a billion streamsThe demo I made had terrible vocals, because it’s a really tricky song to sing, but Marie was up for the challenge. We recorded it in time for Christmas 1987 and inSwedenit went Top 5. But EMI Germany hated it and didn’t want it.A couple of years later, after we’d had other hits, EMI called from Los Angeles asking me to write a song for Pretty Woman, starring Richard Gere Julia Roberts. The soundtrack already had David Bowie and Robert Palmer, but we were just about to fly to New Zealand so I told them I was too busy. Then I remembered “the Christmas song”.We dashed back into the studio, changed the “Christmas Day” lyric to “a winter’s day”, and added a new guitar melody at the beginning. Not long after, the director Garry Marshall called to say: “I wanted to let you know that when your song plays in the film, there’s no dialogue. It’s just 55 seconds of your music driving the whole movie.” The rest is history.One time after we became huge, we had 2,000 people outside our hotel room in Buenos Aires singing our songs all night long. David Coulthard later told me that all the Formula One drivers were staying there the same evening and were really annoyed because they couldn’t sleep. I got 4,000 cards for my birthday. I had people sleeping in my garden, stealing my underwear, even the aerial on my car!Today, the song is approaching a billion streams.People think it’s a power ballad, but it isn’t. The production is sparse. It doesn’t need power chords or big orchestrations: all the power is in Marie’s voice. She had the ability to pour her heart out.After she became ill, she came to one of my solo shows in Amsterdam and I asked if she wanted to join me on stage. She hadn’t sung in public for eight years but came on for the encore and sang It Must Have Been Love. I’ve never in my life seen so many people crying. Marie got so much energy from that that she wanted to make another album and go on tour, which we did. I think that gave her a couple more years.ClarenceÖfwerman, producerA friend of our engineer had just bought a studio in Stockholm that had a Synclavier, one of the first digital-sampling synthesisers, so a lot of It Must Have Been Love was made by programming. Then we added drums and guitar in the EMI studios. I improvised the piano solo, the only time I’ve ever done that. Just after the solo, there’s a big key change where Marie suddenly sings much higher. It’s really difficult to sing like that, but she gave such a great vocal performance.Marie Fredriksson obituaryRead moreIt wasn’t a party tune, so we didn’t try to make it Christmassy, with bells or anything. For the second version, Marie came in again to sing the changed line “a winter’s day”. Otherwise, the two versions aren’t that different. For the second one, though, the mixing engineer in LA put a load of gated reverb on the snare drum that he called his “lucky snare”, because it had already been on about 10 No 1 singles.Before the film came out, we’d almost forgotten about the song and weren’t playing it live. Then suddenly it was a monster hit. I never got to meet Richard Gere or Julia Roberts, but I’ll always remember that first day in the studio together. Per made us T-shirts saying: “Today Sweden, tomorrow the world.” We all laughed and said: “It happened to Abba but it’ll never happen again.” And then it did.Don’t Bore Us – Get to the Chorus!

But his music is quite different: a slippery layer cake of samples, multitudinous keys and lo-fi pop production, with Brown singing of a world where “the ebb and flow isn’t ebbing right”, be it in love or civic life. There is still room for an instant-classic R&B ballad though, in Tossed Away.Ben Beaumont-Thomas49Rochelle Jordan – Through the WallEverything isjust soon the British Canadian producer’s sixth album: expensively plush deep house suggesting club lights low, gleaming mirrors, potent looks igniting across the dancefloor. As much as the cold beat and ballroom flow of Ladida or the slapping “body, body, body” incantations of On 2 Something suggest a steadfast commitment to abandon, Jordan maintains impeccable poise and control throughout, whether in diva mode on Words 2 Say, breaking hearts on Bite the Bait, standing up for her needs on Doing It Too (“I’m not too much / You just give too little”) or patiently waiting for a frustrated lover to see the light on Ladida. Commanding, wise and committed to atmospheric excellence, party hosts don’t come better.Laura Snapes48Jerskin Fendrix– Once Upon a Time … in ShropshireView image in fullscreenHarebrained prog cabaret … Jerskin Fendrix.Photograph: Tim GuttJerskin Fendrix’s high-profile scores for the last three Yorgos Lanthimos films can’t really help prime you for the Midlands composer’s eccentrically beautiful second album, which pairs pristine musical theatre with the harebrained prog cabaret of Faith No More and (particularly) the under-sung Morphine. At first, Once Upon a Time … casts the rural bliss of growing up in 00s Shropshire in a golden light, a haven of getting ratted on Baileys and listening to Kanye on a farm, then having a lovely hungover group breakfast in someone’s kitchen. But the unexpected deaths he has experienced in recent years intrude to spoil paradise, eliciting feverish, absurdist expressions of grief – Jerskin Fendrix Freestyle is a bravura wig-out – and fathomless devastation from his camp, craggy voice. It demands a full theatrical production.LS47Clipping– Dead Channel SkyClipping frontman Daveed Diggs is best known for being in the original cast of Hamilton, and for all that this album is filled with noisy industrial rap, you can easily imagine it being successfully adapted for the Broadway stage. Dead Channel Sky is set in a cyberpunk dystopia not dissimilar to the scorched-sun “real world” of the Matrix, humming with janky tech and populated with fascists and freaky hedonists. Producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes render it in acid squiggles and revving breakbeats, while Diggs delivers his mutoid poetry like a prophet jacked up on some amphetamine he’s synthesised in a backstreet lab.BBTTell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more46The Tubs – Cotton CrownIn different hands,the Tubs’ second album might be a crushing listen, and understandably so. In 2014, frontman Owen Williams’ mother, the songwriter and author Charlotte Greig,died by suicide. Grief, as these songs detail, made him a rubbish boyfriend. But Cotton Crown is often funny and ardent, and especially self-aware about how new love might feel like a life raft to a depressed mind ill-equipped to reciprocate: “Know it’s all in my brain / Caught in the middle of loving you and being insane,” Williams sings on Fair Enough. His striking voice, somewhere between Richard Thompson and Bob Mould, bolts through the band’s joyful jangle-pop. Clear students of the form, they’re virtuosos with zero patience for perfection, their riffs hurtling and plundering like seagulls going at a spilled catch as they vigorously rough you up with profundity.LS45Smerz – Big City LifeView image in fullscreenAn album of stilted beauty … Smerz.Photograph: Alva Le FebvreCatharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt feel like the pop girlies of the incredibly prolific and off-kilterCopenhagen Rhythmic Music Conservatory scene, making music that’s more outward-facing and arch than some of their insular and traditional (and equally great) classmates. Their second album lurches between throwing yourself at life – “you’re a girl in the city and you shouldn’t think twice”, they chant in deadpan harmony on Roll the Dice – and actually thinking twice quite a lot in existential spirals about purpose and desire. The dissonance between confidence and anxiety comes through in the album’s stilted beauty: one minute, their whorls of prepared piano carry you along like clouds amid perfectly turned pop-R&B and balladry; then they stab and stutter, like cracks in the pavement destined to trap your heels. In 2023, K-pop’s brightest hopes NewJeans hired them as co-writers: more pop bearing their imprint can only be a good thing.LS44Sabrina Carpenter – Man’s Best FriendReleased almost exactly a year after her superstar-minting breakthrough Short n’ Sweet, and using a palette of soft rock, 80s pop, light disco and yearning country melodies, Carpenter added rich colour to one of pop’s most distinctive self-portraits. Her blatant sexuality is offset by an ironising sense of camp and a deep streak of cynicism, as she wonders whether to wrap her little finger round a series of hot but useless men. But whether dialling her exes while hopped up on “go-go juice” or being toxic for the sport of it (“you think that I’m gonna fuck with your head / well, you’re absolutely right”), Carpenter knows she’s part of the problem. Her fake helplessness at her own worst impulses is just one part of a formidable screwball comedy arsenal – she’s a Rosalind Russell for the dating app era.BBT43Jennifer Walton – DaughtersView image in fullscreenBolt from the blue … Jennifer Walton.Photograph: Liam CosfordThis Sunderland producer’s previous work included one EP of power electronics, one of antic club tracks, collabs with Aya and 96 Back as Microplastics, gigging with Kero Kero Bonito and a smattering of other credits. So her staggering, fully formed songwriterly debut was a total bolt from the blue. A swarming orchestral epic with shades of Julia Holter and Phil Elverum, it addressed her grief for her late father in serenely surrealist images – hitting a deer with a car in the middle of the night – and the painfully mundane realism of sitting in hospital corridors together. The standout Miss America combined both to stunning effect, a numbed incantation of everything Walton had seen on the US trip where she learned of her father’s diagnosis, the familiar now remade horribly mythic.LS42Erika de Casier– LifetimeErika de Casier’s fourth album updates the Y2K R&B template that fought for body-to-body sensuality in the face of rising digital creep. The old-school dial tones that pierce Lifetime’s rapt, liquid atmosphere work both as Janet homage and ironic sigh at how good those forebears had it when emotional warfare could only be conducted via pager: “Took a screenshot so / I could look at your pretty face all the time now / Without a sign that I’m online,” de Casier sings on earworm Delusional, a low-slung anthem for contemporary dating anxiety. “Hit midnight / Not even a text to hold me warm,” she rues on The Chase. That’s one of the most inviting things about Lifetime: its seductively cool surfaces conceal de Casier frantically kicking her feet below the surface, just like the rest of us.LS41Danny Brown – StardustThe Detroit rapper’s first post-rehab record totally disprovedhis fearsthat sobriety makes artists boring. On Stardust, Brown is still hard-wired with cartoonish verve, coupled with a genuinely touching sense of gratitude: “Sleeping real good at night ’cos I’m proud of myself,” he raps on Book of Daniel. While you probably wouldn’t describe someone who ponders “going bonkers and knocking out your chompers” as a wise elder, his hunger for life, opportunity and unmediated sensation blares through in how evidently gagged he is to centre younger producers from the digicore and hyperpop undergrounds: his unruly kids 8485, Jane Remover, Underscores, Frost Children and more make Stardust trip with glitch, rave, squealing riffs and overdriven noise. The rare record that makes you want to riot and shed a smiling single tear emoji.LS40-3140YHWH Nailgun – 45 PoundsView image in fullscreenChews you up … YHWH Nailgun.Photograph: Steve GullickIn 21 minutes, the New York band’s debut chews you up and spits you out the other side in a tentacular whirr of rototoms, guitars that shriek and whine like neglected machinery, erratic tempos and frontman Zack Borzone’s choked-out vocals. The way the record lurches and reels brings to mind the classic horror film scene in which a human undergoes a violent, magnificent transformation into some sort of beast: much like Gilla Band’s Most Normal, 45 Pounds is a font of mutant rock pleasures.LS39Sudan Archives – The BPMThe title refers to the beats per minute of dance music, but for an album that is so totally alive, it surely also refers to a pounding heart. Sudan Archives (AKA Angeleno producer-singer-songwriter-violinist Brittney Parks) announces that “life’s a game and I got VR goggles” as she revels in the epicurean joys of sex, dancing, travel and music itself with an almost superhuman appetite: “The rest are cowards / They choose to eat and we devour.” It’s all done with breezy good humour but there’s something inspiring, even quietly political about this mindful rejection of the straight life. Her backings – full of pop-R&B and ethereal electro – also dart away from obvious mainstream paths.BBT38Ethel Cain – Willoughby Tucker, I’ll Always Love YouView image in fullscreenRomantic slowcore … Ethel Cain.Photograph: Dollie KyarnIt’s easy to see why US singer-songwriter Cain has become so adored. This album further sketches out the kind of storytelling universe that attracts footnote-writing fandoms: it’s a prequel to the events of her debut album Preacher’s Daughter, deepening the tale of Ethel and a cast of young peers as they fumble towards connection and understanding. Her moody, romantic slowcore is also perfect music for listening to on headphones as you walk around boring suburban streets wishing you could leave for bigger things. It’s also great for road trips: songs between five and 15 minutes that seem to make a long, slow blur of the pell-mell world outside.BBT37Olivia Dean – The Art of LovingThe British breakthrough of the year, as Dean – already doing decent business with her pleasant but rather neat debut Messy – reached a completely new level of songcraft. Bossa nova, folk and soul (classic and neo) are warmed together with beautiful production, evaporating any sense of pastiche to make a sound that’s both easy on the ear but distinctly Dean’s. Every song has a superb top line, Dean stretching them into loose jazzy shapes (Let Alone the One You Love, Lady Lady) or tightening them into brisk pop (Man I Need, Something Inbetween). But it’s the lyrics that make these songs so red-blooded: every stage of love, from the first flutter of flirtation to the adrenal shock of rejection, is made so true to life.BBT36Anna von Hausswolff – IconoclastsView image in fullscreenSense of awe … Anna von Hausswolff.Photograph: Philip SvenssonAnna von Hausswolff is no stranger to a monumental statement: her primary instrument is the pipe organ,a towering edifice of tin and arsenicthat offers her an ever-renewing sense of awe. But the Swedish composer’s sixth album goes bigger than ever, grappling with mortality, transcendence and evil in a series of stormy epics that also lash a little pop structure to her prow. “Oh, I’m breaking up with language / Oh, in search of something bigger than this,” she screams on Stardust, an exhilarating co-pilot on the path to absolution.LS35Bon Iver – Sable, FableIf, as Justin Vernon recently suggested, this is the last ever Bon Iver album, it’s a beautiful redemption arc: a loving send-up of his anxious, myopic sad-sack self blossoms into a radiant appreciation of possibility, sensuality, risk. Everything Is Peaceful Love has one of the year’s best refrains: “Damn if I’m not climbing up a tree right now!”, giddy with thrill and absolutely no idea of what to do when you get up there other than enjoy the view. And while there are gorgeously passionate songs here, it’s the ones about gracefully letting go of an unviable love that really underscore the admirable humility in Vernon’s bowing out.LS34Snocaps – SnocapsKatie Crutchfield’s full-throated transformation into country doyenne on her last couple of albums as Waxahatchee almost makes it easy to forget her indie-rock origins. Fourteen years since she and twin sister Allison wound down their teen band PS Eliot, the DIY stalwarts got back together – with a little help from MJ Lenderman and producer Brad Cook – and went back to brass tacks for their surprise album as Snocaps. What a treat it was: full of punchy indignation – “I could never just …coast!” they exclaim on Coast – crunchy ruminations and sing-songy contemplations of what it means to depend on and grow alongside one another. You’d follow them anywhere.LS33Amaarae – Black StarView image in fullscreenIrrepressible … Amaarae.Photograph: Salomé Gomis-TreziseWe all need an Amaarae in our lives: the person who, when you weakly protest that you’re a bit tired to go out, will soon have you holding a bottle of decanted rum in the back of an Uber, while alongside you she looks quizzically at a series of resealable plastic bags. “Ketamine, coke and molly,” she chants on Starkilla; “I spiked this drink so please open your mouth,” she tells her lover on Fineshyt. And this club-ready album from the irrepressible Ghanaian-American pop star ends up being a sensual body high, as she chases sex and glamour into the ends of the night.BBT32Perfume Genius – GloryWith typical grace and humour Mike Hadreas sends up his self-defeating tendencies on his seventh album, and wonders how old you have to be to escape those lifelong patterns: like the contradiction of struggling to face the world while also fantasising about violence and romanticising “all the poems I’ll get out” of it. It feels apt that Glory starts with the western twang of It’s a Mirror, suggesting a fixed, brawny masculine archetype – then breaks it down over the course of the record, a gothic, celestial voyage into the interior, and the latest addition to a uniquely beautiful American songbook.LS31Horsegirl – Phonetics On and OnView image in fullscreenFinely tuned … Horsegirl.Photograph: Ruby FayeSpindly rock à la the Velvets and the Raincoats is as spartan in its constituent parts as it is high on reward, and Chicago trio Horsegirl demonstrated the inexhaustible pleasures of this 60-year-old form on their second album. With production from Cate Le Bon, they wove magic from just a few thrumming guitar and bass notes and Nora Cheng’s nonchalant, near-spoken vocals, as well as a knack for melodic hooks as finely turned as intricate woodwork: the bittersweet, skipping chorus of Information Content is an all-timer.LS30-2130Oklou – Choke EnoughTrance, medieval polyphony and Y2K pop may seem like odd bedfellows, but French singer-producer Oklou cast them all in a dawn-like haze on her gorgeous debut album, flowing these distinct disciplines together until they swooped and soared like a flock of starlings. Choke Enough was no academic exercise, either, with standout pop moments including Take Me By the Hand with Bladee – a winsome conjuring of how Alice Deejay might sound in collaboration with a piping minstrel.LS29Jacob Alon – In LimerenceView image in fullscreenRustling with life … Jacob Alon performing at the ZYN Rolling Stone UK Awards, in London’s Roundhouse.Photograph: Sue Moore/Hogan Media/ShutterstockOne of the star-making moments of the year was at the Mercury prize, as Scottish singer-songwriter Jacob Alon reduced the arena audience to a hush with just a voice and an acoustic guitar (though there were delighted whoops when a call of “free Palestine” was folded into their rendition of Fairy in a Bottle). It hopefully brought a broader audience to their debut album In Limerence, which has shades of Adrianne Lenker, Jeff Buckley and even Paul McCartney’s cadences to its unguarded indie-folk. It would have been easy to make this music blandly beautiful, but Alon and producer Dan Carey keep it rustling with life, as they reach for a burbling synth, trumpet improvisation or dusty-sounding drum kit.BBT28KeiyaA – Hooke’s LawThe title of the Chicago producer’s second album references the law of physics that reflects how stretch is proportional to load, how a spring always bounces back when tested within its elastic limit. The whistlestop Hooke’s Law expands and contracts accordingly as KeiyaA’s trifles with loss and romantic disappointment find their embodiment in racing breakbeats and collagist chaos one minute, gorgeous, soul-weary stillness – as with the liquid Stupid Prizes – the next. Listening can feel like being pleasurably blitzed with sensation, with each repeat revealing new details: an invitation to submit to KeiyaA’s masterful grip.LS27Wet Leg – MoisturizerIn 2022 they released one of the 21st century’s biggest indie debuts, which scored a UK No 1 and Grammy and Brit awards. The pressure was there for the follow-up, but not only did it top the charts again and earn another couple of Grammy noms, it had even more swagger and heart. “You wanna fuck me, I know, most people do,” Rhian Teasdale shrugs on Mangetout, and she actively intimidates a lustful bloke on Catch These Fists – but much of the album is given over to her wonderment at falling in love. “I’ll be your Davina, I’m coming to get you … I’ll be your Shakira, whenever, wherever”, she sings: great new vows for millennial weddings.BBT26Wolf Alice – The ClearingView image in fullscreenSomething symphonic … Ellie Rowsell of Wolf Alice performing at Manchester Arena.Photograph: Andy Von Pip/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock“English bands are so hesitant to ever admit ambition, but I am ambitious with this record,” Wolf Alice’s drummerJoel Amey saidas The Clearing was announced – and sure enough, this was a huge step up and out for a band who were already one of British indie’s biggest. There’s something symphonic about the heft of it and not just because of the string sections, thanks to superb production by Greg Kurstin: the bass and toms are heavy yet warm, the piano pounding yet not overbearing. Ellie Rowsell sings about suitably big themes, too, from universe-bending love on Leaning Against the Wall (“it really, really made the room sing, the way you said my name”), invaluable friendship on Just Two Girls, and The Sofa’s uplifting manifesto for being wild and indolent instead of toeing the line.BBT25Wednesday – BleedsThe North Carolina band’s sixth album is littered with endings, some violent – the title of Carolina Murder Suicide tells you all you need to know – some devastatingly mundane, as Karly Hartzman examined the cracks that led to a long relationship’s end. Her unique gaze unites both, noticing the details and dynamics that other songwriters might write off as inconsequential: like the “mounted antlers in the kitchen on a crooked nail” at a wake in Wound Up Here (By Holdin On). Full of screaming noise and riffs that evoke knee-sliding through the mud, as well as moments of unexpected sweetness, Bleeds shows the fullest picture of her band yet.LS24Titanic – HagenView image in fullscreenUncontainable euphoria … Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta of Titanic.Photograph: Janet ChauThere can be few faster-evolving ensembles than that of Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta, who in just two albums have leapt from sparkling cabaret jazz to … whatever the uncontainable euphoria of Hagen is. It’s a record that vaults from blast beats to choral beauty, eerie splendour to nervy cacophonies, like nothing else you’ve heard. Despite these bold stylistic clashes, it hangs together beautifully, thanks also to Fratti’s spectacular voice, as capable of cirrus-like delicacy as parched sharpness.LS23Cate Le Bon – Michelangelo DyingWhere two of this year’s most prominent breakup albums were savage (Lily Allen) or spectacular (Rosalía), Welsh innovator Cate Le Bon’s hypnotically murky seventh album reflected the circular sadness of love faltering – the catch-22 of wanting to escape heartbreak while knowing that letting go means relinquishing something that was once profound. Michelangelo Dying contains some of her very best choruses and melodies, powerful enough to penetrate the album’s billowing haze of guitar, sax and synths, like a hand reaching out in the dark.LS22Little Simz – LotusView image in fullscreenWider reckoning … Little Simz performing at the Co-op Live arena in Manchester.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianSimz’s sixth album came amid a dispute with the Sault producer Inflo – she has sued him for allegedly failing to repay a loan – and a couple of tracks target him in all but name (“You talk about God when you have a God complex / I think you’re the one that needs saving”). But Simz seems to be having a wider reckoning: she revels in how far she’s come from once just having “a dream and a pushbike”, and reflects on self-preservation, creative frustration and – in a gorgeous, naturalistic back-and-forth with Wretch 32 – push-pull family dynamics.BBT21John Glacier – Like a RibbonFor all that you can link her to trip-hop and cloud rap, what British MC has ever really sounded like this? It would be easy to call Glacier monotone, but in truth her careful, even flow holds so much musicality: her deliberately limited melodic and rhythmic range means that the subtle distinctions in her vocals are fascinating, as she goes from bored to wry to boastful to poignant within one-degree turns on the emotional thermostat. The grainy, faintly corrupted beats are superb, but it’s that delivery, and her lyrics themselves – stoic and even amused as life blows her from place to place – which make this album an all-timer in UK rap.BBT20-1120Aya – Hexed!A series of surreal vignettes confronting addiction, panic and the challenges of growing up queer, Aya Sinclair’s experimental electronic masterwork is a wind-whipped dash around the towns and moors of Yorkshire and Greater Manchester. From the rotor blade-whomp of Peach to the infernal pattering snares on Navel Gazer, her sound design hits you like a ton of feathers: a surreal, destabilising flurry of detail. And the lyrics, done as careful mutters or sarky sing-song, are world-class. Her poetry revels in multiple meanings – is she saying “Flemish” or “phlegmish”? – and in the plasticity of language, rhyme and even lived experience, whether retelling a toxic relationship (“Couple rows so we could pop our cysts / as though the pus’d bust right out of the tryst”) or evoking the feeling of being totally cut adrift: “Abseil away another day supine inside the bag.”BBT19Clipse – Let God Sort Em OutView image in fullscreenRich with wisdom … Malice and Pusha T of Clipse.Photograph: Cian MooreThey may have been outdone by Oasis as 2025’s most anticipated fraternal comeback, but there was still considerable excitement around the return of Gene and Terrence Thornton, AKA Clipse’s Malice and Pusha T. After making two of the best albums in 00s rap, Malice found God and left Pusha to it. But on returning, Malice’s mic tone – which always had a sort of ancient, oaken majesty to it – felt rich with wisdom, while Pusha, who in the interim had beefed Drake to hugely entertaining effect, still had his nose for a scrap, this time with Travis Scott. Together, they advocated for their own brilliance and for what they see as a better class of rap, sometimes at the same time: “They content-create, I despise that / I create content then they tries that.”BBT18Big Thief – Double InfinityAfter their bassist Max Oleartchik left the group, Big Thief pressed on as a trio but brought in a number of auxiliary musicians, resulting in an album that sounds like it could have been worked up around the campfire of a utopian off-grid commune. These are some of the American band’s best, biggest-hearted songs to date, with the type of easy facility with melody – and equally easy access to their emotions – that can’t be taught. Take Grandmother, in which frontperson Adrianne Lenker surveys our collapsing world and flawed humanity, and decides on the singalong chorus: “Gonna turn it all into rock’n’roll.” In many other hands this would be trite, but as with so much of Big Thief’s music, the purity of intention makes it life-affirming.BBT17Alex G – HeadlightsView image in fullscreenA new frontier … Alex G.Photograph: Chris MaggioWhat constitutes integrity? Working for love or money? Freedom or obligation to others? On his first album for a major label, standing at a new frontier of success, Alex G weighs these existential questions in appropriately vast, beautiful indie-rock epics, some breathless with anxiety (Spinning), others sardonic (Real Thing) or severe (Headlights). Despite the very contemporary, very Alex G touches – take the sprite-like voices and distortion of Bounce Boy – there’s a comforting solidity to this record that makes it feel as though it’s existed for ever, sharing the same spooked twilight as the best of Yo La Tengo and REM.LS16Pulp – MoreThe anticipation of a reunion album rarely measures up to the often dismal results. Perhaps the key is to spend a solid chunk of years playing together again, as Pulp did, before risking putting anything down on record. “I exist to do this / Shouting and pointing,” Jarvis Cocker sang on comeback single Spike Island; anyone who’s seen Pulp in recent years can attest that he has lost none of his calligraphic physical flair. Nor, as the magnificent More proves, has his gimlet eye for the grubby disappointments of middle age diminished. Life apparently feels no less of a charade at 62 than early adulthood did back in the 90s, a fact he sells as both anticlimax and a weird kind of comfort: if that’s the case, the unvarnished love songs and heartfelt stands against commodification suggested, you might as well stick it all on the line.LS15Turnstile – Never EnoughView image in fullscreenUncomplicated thrills … Turnstile in concert in Guadalajara, Mexico.Photograph: Medios y Media/Getty ImagesIs it hardcore punk or not? As this dull debate brewed on comment sections and Discord servers, the rest of the world got on with the business of just enjoying the uncomplicated thrills on Turnstile’s latest. Certainly, Seein’ Stars sounds like 90s Duran Duran, the epic title track could be played as NFL teams run on to the field and even the hardcore-paced Dull and Solo have a sheen to them. But for every frowning punk purist, you had 10 more lining up to pile into the pit with smiles a mile wide.BBT14Deftones – Private MusicThis was the US alt-metallers’ first album back after serendipitously getting a huge new following via TikTok, particularly for their sweeter, shoegazier material. But rather than court that audience by cynically remaking Sextape 11 times over, they instead created a balletic cyborg of a record. The riffs could put a dent in concrete masonry, but the groove-metal rhythms are light-footed and, as ever, vocalist Chino Moreno sets out even wider tonal possibilities. It’s as if waves of pain and relief pass across his spirit as he goes from dry croaks to thunderous denouncements to blissful clean singing.BBT13Suede – AntidepressantsThree decades since their debut and five albums into the second phase of their career, Suede sound as impassioned and vital as they ever have. Brett Anderson’s voice is a long way from the nasal sneer of Animal Nitrate all those years ago: it’s now rounder and deeper in colour, reminiscent of Echo and the Bunnymen’s Ian McCulloch, but the core Suede theme – humanity in all its reckless and sexy brokenness – is still there. Playing post-punk with a Britpop grandeur, Anderson and co reckon with the fleeting nature of existence (“Formless as a cloud / Weightless as a sound”) and the caprices of brain chemistry, but with a sense of optimism, even triumph.BBT12Jim Legxacy – Black British Music (2025)View image in fullscreenMore assured … Jim Legxacy.Photograph: Igoris TarranHis previous mixtape Homeless N*gga Pop Music was at No 42 in our 2023 albums list; rapper-producer Jim Legxacy jumps up the rankings as his place in British rap becomes more and more assured. Beats-wise, he defines the joyous anything-goes energy of the current UK underground, expertly applying chipmunk effects to samples, adding funny DJ-style vocal tags (“turn that mediocre bullshit off, we’re listening to Jim Legxacy right now!”) and even making a left turn into high-tempo pop-rock for ’06 Wayne Rooney. There’s more of a mournful cast to the lyrics though, as he works through grief for his late sister, and confronts the lingering effects of his impoverished, fatherless childhood.BBT11Jade – That’s Showbiz Baby!Pop’s trickiest manoeuvre is crossing the divide from successful group to solo career. After departing Little Mix, Jade Thirlwall didn’t so much jump it as pirouette across: her multi-part debut solo single Angel of My Dreams was completely nuts, impossible to ignore and spent 20 weeks on the UK chart. Could a whole album match up? From trashy ballroom house (It Girl) to disco-funk (Fantasy, Headache), Robyn-esque sad bangers (Plastic Box, Self Saboteur) and waltz-time ballads (Natural at Disaster), she certainly has the range, not to mention smart and sweary lyrics – rhyming Edward Enninful with experimental is a neat encapsulation of what moves her. It’s her voice that really sets it all apart, though: as you’d expect of a talent show graduate turned longtime pop star, it remains stunning on a technical level, but Thirlwall also brings a whole West End musical’s worth of emotion.BBT10-610Billy Woods – Golliwog“The English language is violence, I hot-wired it / I got a hold of the master’s tools and got dialled in,” Billy Woods announces at the outset of a rap masterpiece that works both as stunning poetry on the page and thrilling music out of loudspeakers. With intensely vivid lyrics, he picks his way through psychic wreckage wrought by racism, poverty, war and more, menaced by horrible dreams (“Didn’t want the doctor to turn, I knew it’d be something awful on the ultrasound”) and dispensing jaded wisdom: “Amputation how you survive / Can’t get away if you don’t leave something behind.” And then there’s Misery, a vivid romcom about a polyamorous and possibly vampiric lover. Frantz Fanon, Cecil Rhodes, Miles Davis and “Black Thanos” are among the other figures populating these strange, heat-sick tracks, helmed by a diverse and stellar range of production talent including the Alchemist, DJ Haram and Kenny Segal.BBT9Geese – Getting KilledView image in fullscreenOutrageously accomplished … Geese.Photograph: Lewis EvansThe ways that love unravels us and knits us back together are explored on the outrageously accomplished and wise fourth album from the New York garage rock band, who are still in their early 20s. They originally formed as kids at a Brooklyn music school which partly explains the depth of their connection, but there’s something bigger at work: how to explain the way a tiny chord change can carry so much emotional weight, or how these songs can groove so tightly at the waist while their arms flail this way and that. Cameron Winter’s lyrics and vocals are peerless, too, done in a reedy head voice that’s also somehow soulful. He’s trying to live his life on a higher frequency than the rest of us, but so often he’s having his heart broken, “getting killed by a pretty good life”, or hemmed in by his circumstances: “I was a sailor, and now I’m a boat / I was a car, and now I’m the road,” he glumly pouts on Bow Down.BBT8Bad Bunny – Debí Tirar Más FotosWith the absolute integrity that has become his trademark, Bad Bunny shone his inestimable spotlight back on his roots in Puerto Rico for his sixth album, singing of sacrifice, colonial oppression and the importance of preserving tradition. He’s an incredible conduit, synthesising the past – salsa, bolero, perreo – with the present, bringing local artists including RaiNao and Lorén Aldarondo along for the ride. As if it needed stressing, Debí … also underscored his own legacy, and his incredible range: heartbroken that life must one day end on Baile Inolvidable; lovelorn in the rave on Perfumito Nuevo; seemingly cast in moonlight on the heavy Bokete.LS7Lily Allen – West End GirlLily Allen’s divorce album is so lurid in its apparent disclosures (she has said she employed some poetic licence) that it felt as though there was a risk of the carcass being tossed aside once the tabloids had picked it clean for gossip. But the quality of the songwriting and silvery electronic production, as well as the tangibility of Allen’s hurt and her ability to mint viral bits in “who the fuck is Madeleine” and Nonmonogamummy, gave West End Girl not just staying power but a place in the pantheon of great breakup albums. Standout Pussy Palace turned the grottiest of reveals into a kind of cosmic reverie that seems to suggest the elemental rearrangement of life as she knew it; the guttingly powerful Relapse, about the sober musician’s fear of losing her grip after her relationship breakdown, highlighted the temptation of oblivion in numbed-out vocoder. It lands light as icing sugar but lingers deadly as toothache.LS6PinkPantheress – Fancy ThatView image in fullscreenBreathless … PinkPantheress.Photograph: Charlie EngmanTrue to her form for writing the shortest songs in the biz, in just 20 minutes and 34 seconds, PinkPantheress vaults from weed highs to romantic lows, obsessive crushes to gripping paranoia, seduction to confrontation. (“The status cheque is due / So do I still belong to you?” from Nice to Know You, is a classic bluff call.) The music of Fancy That is just as much of a slip’n’slide through British club culture at its most playful and dazzling, from jungle to UKG and the big-tent joys of Underworld, Basement Jaxx and even the hyper-cheesy Just Jack, samples she deploys expertly, and all threaded together by her pointedly sugary voice. It’s a breathless ride, and PinkPantheress’s best case yet for her micro melodramas: why dither when you can pack this much into so little?LSNo 55Lady Gaga – MayhemUnlike the smooth tech-house flavour of her previous album Chromatica, and quite diametrically opposed to the dinner jazz of her albums with Tony Bennett, on Mayhem, Gaga returned to the operatic electroclash that powered her first two albums. There are synths that sound like a Dyson on its last legs. There are the kind of trashy guitars that contractually can only be played by someone sporting a lime mohawk, low-riding leather trousers and nothing else. There is the baby talk of her biggest hit Bad Romance, only where that was “Ro-ma, ro-ma-ma / Gaga, ooh la la” it’s now “Ama ooh na-na / Abracadabra, mutta ooh Gaga”.Read more.BBTNo 4 coming soonCome back tomorrow for the next 10 albums in the countdown!

Since 1945, this waif with no mother or father has rarely been out of the bestseller lists and continues to inspire musicals and movies. Heyday Films, the outfit behind Paddington and James Bond, is now developing an English-language adaptation of her stories.What isn’t generally known outside her native Sweden are the circumstances in which author Astrid Lindgren created Pippi during the darkest period of the second world war, under the shadow of Hitler and Stalin.“After I have worked so many years making the film, I am totally clear that Pippi is a child of the war. She never would have existed if there were not these terrible times,” Wilfried Hauke, the veteran German director behind new docudrama A World Gone Mad – The War Diaries of Astrid Lindgren (which will have its international premiere early next year) tells me.View image in fullscreen‘She asked interesting child questions’ … a drawing seen in A World Gone Mad – The War Diaries of Astrid Lindgren.His film features three generations of the Lindgren family – the author’s daughter,Karin Nyman, granddaughter, Annika Lindgren, and great-grandson, Johan Palmberg. It also has reconstructions in which leading Swedish stage actor Sofia Pekkari plays the author but her executors have made sure that every word she utters is taken exactly from what Lindgren actually wrote or said.In 1939, Lindgren was living a quiet middle-class life in Stockholm. She was a housewife in her early 30s with two young children. Her husband, Sture, had a well-paid job at the Swedish National Association of Motorists, and didn’t spend much time at home.Sweden may have been one of the few European nations to remain politically neutral during the second world war, but Lindgren was an ardent anti-Nazi and a news junkie. She scoured the papers, looking for accounts of the war, which she cut out and stuck in her notebooks. An excellent typist, she soon landed a secret wartime job at the postal control centre, steaming open and reading private and military letters.From her letter reading, Lindgren realised that Jews were being sent to death camps. In the diaries she started keeping in this period, she frequently referred to the plight of wartime refugees.Like many Swedes, Lindgren had grown up with a reverence for German literature, culture and philosophy – but now she was vetting private correspondence detailing Nazi atrocities. In May 1941, she writes that she has learned that 1,000 Jews a day are being “forcibly transported to Poland in the most shocking conditions … it is apparently Hitler’s intention to make Poland into one big ghetto where the poor Jews are to perish from hunger and squalor.”“As long as you’re only reading about it in the paper you can sort of avoid believing it but when you read it in a letter … it suddenly brings it home, quite terrifyingly,” she added.View image in fullscreenAstrid Lindgren, 1977.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesHauke says: “You can see that the diary became more and more emotional. She felt this was now the beginning of the end of this old idea of European culture.”Lindgren’s diaries consisted of 17 small handwritten schoolbooks. These were discovered in the Stockholm flat in which the author spent much of her life – and were published in 2015, more than a decade after her death. Hauke sees them as the forerunner to her children’s stories, which would not have existed without them.The name “Pippi Longstocking” was coined by the author’s daughter, Karin. Lindgren invented tales about the character to distract Karin during her frequent wartime illnesses. Then, in 1944, when she hurt her ankle after a fall and was bedridden for three weeks, she began to work in earnest on writing and editing the first Pippi stories.The creation of Pippi Longstocking was her way of dealing with the darkness seeping into her life. Her marriage was breaking down. Sture, she discovered, was seeing another woman and wanted a divorce. This was the “landslide that engulfed her existence”.View image in fullscreenKarin Nyman next to her mother’s desk in 2015.Photograph: Jessica Gow/AFP/Getty Images“But then she felt she had something of her own which was her writing. This made her strong again and helped her go through this crisis,” Hauke suggests.One of her obsessions even then was children’s education – how, as the film-maker puts it, kids could be brought up “not to be psychopaths like Hitler or authoritarians, dictators and so on”. Bringing Pippi to life was part of this mission. The film-maker believes that “there was a lot of herself” in the character. Like her most famous fictional creation, she was a free-thinking individualist with endless resources of resilience and humour.View image in fullscreenFree-thinking, kind … Inger Nilsson as Pippi in the 1968 film version.Photograph: Jacob Forsell/AFP/Getty ImagesLindgren’s great-grandson, Johan Palmberg, rights manager at the family company Astrid Lindgren Aktiebolag, was 11 years old when the author died aged 94 in 2002. He has very fond memories of her and tells me he still marvels at her instinctive way of communicating with children.“She was very unique in that sense. It’s related to the reason why she was such a good children’s book author. She had this ability to go back in her own way to what things felt like as a child – and she could communicate with children on their own terms. She didn’t ask boring grownup questions. She asked interesting child questions.”He believes that Pippi’s commercial appeal in 1945 lay in her cheery individualism. “The world had been in this terrible situation for many years and she comes as this fresh breath of air. She’s the antidote to the authoritarian regimes of Germany and the Soviets. She has all these characteristics of independence, free-thinking and kindness which is the antithesis to the Nazi ideology.”Pippi’s 80th anniversary is now being marked with all the fanfare you might expect. “We’ve had birthday parties all year, more or less, and I think we are going to keep celebrating her because she is such an important character, especially with the world looking how it does,” the author’s great-grandson states. “Her independence, kindness and generosity are needed more than ever.”A World Gone Mad – The War Diaries of Astrid Lindgren is streaming on SVT in Sweden until 18 December, in German cinemas from 22 January and showing at theCopenhagen international documentary festival CPH:DOX from 13 to 22 MarchExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsDocumentary filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser on life after Grand Theft AutoKeith StuartHe rewrote the rule book with Rockstar then left it all behind. Now Dan Houser is back with a storytelling-focused studio to take on AI-obsessed tech bros and Mexican beauty queensMon 15 Dec 2025 07.35 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 10.07 ESTShareThere are only a handful of video game makers who have had as profound an effect on the industry as Dan Houser. The co-founder of Rockstar Games, and its lead writer, worked on all the GTA titles since the groundbreaking third instalment, as well as both Red Dead Redemption adventures. But then, in 2019, he took an extended break from the company which ended with his official departure. Now he’s back with a new studio and a range of projects, and12 years after we last interviewed him, he’s ready to talk about what comes next.“Finishing those big projects and thinking about doing another one is really intense,” he says about his decision to go. “I’d been in full production mode every single day from the very start of each project to the very end, for 20 years. I stayed so long because I loved the games. It was a real privilege to be there, but it was probably the right time to leave. I turned 45 just after Red Dead 2 came out. I thought, well, it’s probably a good time to try working on some other stuff.”At first, he looked into film or TV writing, but didn’t like what he found. “That world was not overly excited by me and I was not overly excited by them,” he says. “I’ve spent 20 years talking about how games are the coming medium and now theyarethe medium […] you look at TV and the budgets and the amount of money they can generate, but the creative ambition is so small at times”. It seemed to Houser that it would be easier to come at the industry with IP that had already been generated. So he moved to Santa Monica and formed Absurd Ventures, bringing in Greg Borrud (founder of SeismicGamesand Pandemic Studios) as head of games and, as COO, Wendy Smith, previously at the New Yorker and Ralph Lauren, and a White House special assistant during Bill Clinton’s presidency.View image in fullscreen‘It was a privilege to be there’… Red Dead Redemption 2.Photograph: Rockstar GamesIt was clear from the start it wouldn’t just be a video games studio. In 2024, the company released the 12-part story podcast A Better Paradise, a dystopian thriller about an ambitious online game world overseen by a powerful AI presence that begins to become sentient – with devastating consequences. Its creator is the mysterious tech billionaire Dr Mark Tyburn, a British inventor who intends the game as a digital utopia, then abandons it when things go awry. In some ways it is a satire on our current digital oligarchy, in which billionaire tech bros wield astronomical influence over society.“All of these tech companies start out with grandiose ambitions, this ‘we are going to save the world through togetherness’-type gibberish,” he says. “We’ve created some of the most powerful people in history in terms of reach and mind control. Those people end up living with far more money than anyone’s ever had. And it feels, as someone who lives in the society that they have helped create, that there are moments in those journeys when they must have felt their product was not quite what they intended it to be and was doing unforeseen harm, and … they went out of their way to ensure that was not regulated. That Faustian moment I find fascinating, and that’s not to say I wouldn’t make the same choice or judge them for it, I just find it interesting.”We’ve created some of the most powerful people in history in terms of reach and mind controlTellingly perhaps, the company at the centre of A Better Paradise, Tyburn Industria, feels much more like a games studio than a social media mega-corp. Also, the lead protagonist is a writer who finds himself at the centre of the game’s development. Is there an element of autobiography here?“Yeah, of course – at that level,” says Houser. “But I also wanted to write about games and tech in a way that felt authentic. To lean slightly more into the games side in terms of the office environment was really easy for me. I know what it’s like to work in a games company obviously. I wanted to try and bring that to life in a way that felt real and to capture some of the micro dramas.”Having turned A Better Paradise into a novel, Houser’s Santa Monica studio is now working on an open-world video game version. He’s not saying how it will fit in with the podcast, just that Mark Tyburn and the AI at the heart of his game, NigelDave (a wildly intelligent program, fixated by humans but with no understanding of how they function), will both figure in the action.Also in development at the company’s second studio in San Rafael, is the Absurdaverse, a comedy universe populated by a menagerie of weird characters, from a skeletal warrior to an ageing hippy. The company is planning a series of animated TV shows and/or movies for the concept, but also another open world game, which Houser has described as, “a living sitcom”. Again, he’s vague on the details, but it looks to be a more story-driven take on The Sims, possibly utilising AI to create emergent narratives around the characters and their lives. “We’re trying to use the memories of NPCs in a fun way,” he says. “Just trying to make it a bit more alive. You’ll see when we talk about it more, but it is shaping up really well. It’s a completely gamey game – very mechanics driven. With both games, we’re trying to make them really strong on mechanics, really fun to play, accessible, but plenty of depth.”View image in fullscreen‘A living sitcom’ … Absurdaverse.Photograph: Absurd VenturesHouser is also planning a game around the company’s third IP, the comic book series American Caper, co-written with fellow Rockstar alumnus, Lazlow. With its cast of escaped convicts, crooked lawyers and Mexican beauty queens, it is perhaps the closest out of all his new projects toGrand Theft Auto. Which is perhaps why the interactive version is going in a different direction. “I’m not making an open-world game for that,” says Houser. “We’re actually looking at maybe doing more of a story game. We’re still kind of exploring it.”We talk a little bit about the current prevalence of forever games such as Minecraft, Fortnite and Roblox and how they’re sucking up a lot of the world’s playtime. But Houser is adamant that there’s still a vast audience for mature single-player narrative experiences – and that’s what he’s aiming at.‘Our industry has been strip-mined’: video game workers protest at The Game AwardsRead more“We’re trying to be ambitious, to make new stuff,” he says. “At some level [our projects] are traditional console games, accessible, but action-oriented story-driven open world console games – but then at the same time, we’re doing it a slightly different way or with slightly different subject matter. Three years ago we were watching one of those PlayStation showcases, and if you blinked and missed the credit sequences, you couldn’t tell where one game ended and the other began. Everything was sort of dark purple and about space ninjas. They were about this apocalypse or that apocalypse but always felt the same.”“That’s fine. Some of them are amazing games. But we were like, well, we’ve got limited money and we are starting from scratch. We have to have good stories and fun dialogue, and make sure our gameplay is amazing and accessible, and our art direction has to be fresh – at all points, it has to feel different. We have to make stuff where people go, ‘Well, I’ve never played a game aboutthat’, and then treat the audience, not just as gamers, but as human beings.”So he’s not worried about the industry’s current obsession with live-service multiplayer mega-games? “I still think there is enough of an audience who want new stuff and single player-led stuff,” he says. And then in his characteristically self-deprecating way he adds: “I hope so. Or we’re in a little bit of trouble.”Explore more on these topicsDan HouserGrand Theft AutoGamesinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It has now been lovingly restored – with a thrillingly bolstered libraryKaty HesselMon 15 Dec 2025 06.02 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 08.32 ESTShareIt is the place where Salvador Dalí painted The Enigma of Hitler, a haunting landscape featuring a giant telephone receiver that seems to be crying a tear over a cutout picture of the Fuhrer. Conceived in 1939, the work seems to anticipate war. It is also the place where Winston Churchill penned parts of his multi-volume A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, and painted its dappled-light view. Somerset Maugham would visit, too, as well as novelist Colette, composer Igor Stravinsky and playwright Jean Cocteau, partaking in lunches that lasted all day and night, with debates and discussions around artistic ideas.This place is La Pausa: the Mediterranean villa in the hills of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, once owned by husband-and-wife writing duo Charles Norris Williamson and Alice Muriel Williamson, followed by French fashion designer Gabrielle “Coco”Chanel, who had it rebuilt from scratch at the end of the 1920s. She later sold it to an American publishing couple, Emery and Wendy Reves.Sprawling yet monastic, the white-walled house – with blue shutters and black crittall windows clustered in groups of five in homage to Chanel’s No 5 – has just been restored to its original specification, after being bought back by the luxury fashion brand in 2015. Architect Peter Marino studied countless photographs to get it right: from the concrete squares that sit in a quilt-like grid atop the lawn, to the potted cacti at the foot of the staircase. Original bedframes were bought, too, as well as the installation of an entirely mirrored bathroom, not unlike the one at 31 Rue Cambon, Coco’s address in Paris.View image in fullscreenRevived … La Pausa, the Mediterranean villa in the hills of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, in 2025.Photograph: Jason Schmidt/ChanelBut when you’re restoring a place with such a rich past, how do you capture its spirit and honour its history, bringing to life the words and minds of its illustrious guests to create the most multi-layered portrait of all? Simple. You build a library.Bookshelves are, after all, a record of the knowledge, characters and ideas that have swirled around someone’s mind, reflecting their interests, desires, and – often in the case of artists or writers – their friends. Whenever I go to an artist’s studio, or visit someone’s house, I am always intrigued about what lives on their shelves – especially if the writers are no longer alive. It’s an intimate way to get to know someone. It deepens our understanding of them, gives us access to their interior worlds, takes us to places we didn’t know they’d been to.I remember visiting Alice Neel’s Manhattan apartment and seeing her many books on topics that ranged from socialism to psychoanalysis. And Leonora Carrington’s Mexico City home was filled with texts on Buddhism, magic, Celtic history, as well as books on loneliness.View image in fullscreen‘We believe the future is made with fragments of the past’ … La Pausa’s library after Peter Marino's restoration.Photograph: Jason Schmidt/ChanelBut what if someone’s library could continue to grow after they had gone? Had the residents of La Pausa lived on, what books would they continue to read, and how might we perceive them in the present day?This was the challenge set by Chanel during the restoration, aided by the specialist booksellers at Hatchards in London (where Coco’s lover, the Duke of Westminster, had an account) and 7L in Paris. Given a list of 100 books that Chanel was known to have cherished and read, the team set about choosing titles in line with her scholarship. But they also wanted to create a broader portrait of her friends and interests, and who and what passed through La Pausa. “And what has happened since, across music, architecture and fiction,” says Yana Peel, president of arts, culture and heritage at Chanel.Entering the wood-panelled library was like stepping into the minds and worlds of those who stood there before me. Adorning the shelves were biographies of Picasso by John Richardson, rare editions of Cecil Beaton’s Scrapbook, dust jackets designed by Vanessa Bell for her sister Virginia Woolf’s book, The Waves; plus first editions of those who frequented the French Riviera, such as F Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. There were also books by (or about) guests who visited the villa, from Somerset Maugham to Greta Garbo, as well as glimpses into their private worlds, with the bounded volumes of Jean Cocteau’s letters.View image in fullscreenSalvador Dalí at La Pausa in the 1930s.Photograph: Photo Wolfgang Vennemann/ Fundació Gala–Salvador Dalí/ADAGP, Paris“We believe the future is made with fragments of the past,” says Peel, which is why the library is also brought up to date with works by Hilary Mantel, Margaret Atwood, Zadie Smith and Rachel Cusk. To make it even more contemporary, says Peel, “as our guests come to visit, they will leave their own books”.Standing back and admiring the library as a whole, you sense a sprawling web of artists who worked, conversed, inspired and consumed each other’s works – directly and indirectly – across centuries. And at its centre was a woman who shaped, and is still shaping, culture today. But why would a library be important to her?Books were the very medium Coco harnessed to escape from her hard and humble beginnings. Aged 11, she was left parentless after her mother died of tuberculosis and her father abandoned his daughters at an orphanage run by Cistercian nuns at the abbey of Aubazine. Never with much money, she found canny ways to access books: “I read everything … We never bought books at home; we cut out the serial from the newspaper and we sewed together long sheets of yellow paper. That’s what little Coco lapped up in secret … I copied down whole passages from novels … [they] taught me about life.”View image in fullscreenCoco Chanel at La Pausa in 1938.Photograph: Roger Schall/ Schall CollectionBooks were a place of refuge, a conduit for Coco to dream about being the heroine in her own fabulous tale and imagine countless other lives for herself. One has to remember how difficult it would have been for her as a woman to build an empire from scratch, decades before women even got the vote in France. It would have required huge amounts of imagination and storytelling. As she said: “Books have been my best friends.”So when it came to restoring La Pausa, the library was to be its beating heart and pensive mind, the place that held everything together. In many ways, aren’t all of our bookshelves? They reflect back to us what we’ve done, learned, and have stored inside of us; who we’ve met (sometimes literally as well as imaginatively) and how we’ve escaped. As with Neel’s and Carrington’s, they reveal our curiosities, secrets and desires. Memory palaces housing our sprawling inner worlds, they can be the most intimate portraits of all. Take a look at your own bookshelves and ask: “What do they say about me?”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureChanelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her performance as Marissa, whose son Milo was kidnapped when she thought he was on a play date, was an absolute powerhouse as we’ve come to expect from the Succession star. It started with the most profound fear a parent can face, before it turned out to be even worse: orchestrated from within her own inner circle. But the plight of Dakota Fanning as her friend Jenny, trying to navigate the incessant hell and guilt of being a working mother, was relatable and affecting too. Together, they deepened this thriller into something far more intriguing.What we said:“All Her Fault is fantastically well done. All the carefully planted seeds come to fruition.

The truth was simpler: Gibson didn’t have cancer and her career and persona was a tissue of lies. Kaitlyn Dever’s portrayal of Gibson was admirably nuanced; she’s deeply dishonest but also desperately needy and in denial about the consequences of her actions, not least for her followers, some of whom relied upon her hokum to combat life-threatening conditions.What we said:“A fast, drily witty, acutely intelligent, compassionate and furious commentary on greed, need, mass delusion, self-deception, the exploitation of the credulous and the enabling of insidious new forms of all of these by technology.”Read more46The ResidenceView image in fullscreenCharmingly good fun … The Residence.Photograph: Erin Simkin/Netflix(Netflix) Something terrible has happened at the White House!

It’s charmingly good fun – essentially a country house murder mystery with added snark and West Wing trappings.What we said: “A gorgeous, gleeful romp.”Read more45Common Side EffectsView image in fullscreenAn absolute triumph … Common Side Effects.Illustration: Adult Swim(Adult Swim/Channel 4) Has Mike Judge ever made a bad show? This is the question it was hard not to ponder while watching this impeccable animated thriller-comedy. The plot? A fungi expert discovers a mysterious mushroom that seems to cure all illness, and ill-advisedly tells his childhood crush Frances – who now works for big pharma. The resulting high-octane deep-state drama was a blackly humorous adventure with real heart that satirised the state of healthcare in a capitalist society. An absolute triumph of TV-making.What we said:“Not merely the best thing I’ve seen on TV this year but one of the best shows I’ve seen in my life.”Read more44Gaza: Doctors Under Attack(Channel 4) The film the BBC couldn’t broadcast. Thanks be, then, to Channel 4 for stepping into the breach and airing it – for this was an essential document of our times. Its unsparing look at the targeting of Palestinian medics showed a pattern that has emerged over the past two years at hospitals across Gaza. First, they are bombed. Then, they are raided and doctors detained and tortured. Then, when their workplaces are reduced to rubble, the cycle starts on the next hospital. The testimony by Dr Khaled Hamouda, whose home was bombed, killing most of his family … before a drone strike mere moments later hit the supposed safe house his remaining children had escaped to, was an unforgettable piece of television that really needed to be aired.What we said:“In an open letter before its broadcast, Channel 4’s Louisa Compton warned that Doctors Under Attack would ‘make people angry, whichever side they take’. She is right. This is the sort of television that will never leave you.”Read more43Am I Being Unreasonable?View image in fullscreenDangerously addictive … Daisy May Cooper as Nic in Am I Being Unreasonable?Photograph: Simon Ridgway/BBC/Boffola Pictures(BBC One/iPlayer) This riot of marital, sexual and social awkwardness (with a side order of murder and betrayal) came courtesy of Daisy May Cooper and Selin Hizli, who have created a worthy successor to Julia Davis’s scabrous 2004 sitcom Nighty Night. Cooper stars as Nic, a woman juggling guilt, trauma and parenting catastrophe, still finding time for extramarital hi-jinks and yetsomehowremaining deserving of sympathy, mainly because of the cavalcade of monsters around her. A dangerously addictive chamber of horrors.What we said:“Howlingly funny.”Read more42Task(Sky Atlantic/Now) This crime drama starring Mark Ruffalo as gone-to-seed cop Tom Brandis allocated a dangerous new assignment in Philadelphia certainly wasn’t for the faint-hearted. But if you could handle the all-pervasive air of impending catastrophe, it was a fine, gritty, twisty procedural centred on stick-up merchants, biker gangs and the grim ramifications of the fentanyl trade. An intense downer, in the best possible way.What we said:“A meditation on guilt, sin and the possibility of redemption.”Read more41The TraitorsView image in fullscreenThe worst traitor ever to roam the castle … Linda, with fellow traitor Minah and faithful Fozia.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio Lambert(BBC One/iPlayer) Before the celebrity version gave us Alan Carr, the third series of normies Traitors delivered Linda, AKA the worst/best traitor to ever roam the castle. Her head-turn when Claudia Winkleman said “traitors” wasn’t the only golden moment. Charlotte’s fake Welsh accent! Lisa the vicar’s bare-faced lie about her job! The shock return of Alexander! Rare is the show that makes appointment TV and creates national watercooler chat in 2025. But beyond all that – Claudia’s gothic outfits alone were worth tuning in for.What we said:“As a study of human behaviour – of deception, manipulation, self-preservation – it remains captivating. As perhaps the best example of social experiment-style reality TV, it has cemented its place in the cultural firmament.”Read more40-3140Dope ThiefView image in fullscreenRide-or-dies … Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura in Dope Thief.Photograph: Jessica Kourkounis/AP(Apple TV) The two amiable, small-time Philadelphia crooks at the heart of Dope Thief have a good thing going. They rob low-level stash houses disguised as DEA officers and put on a performance of authority to avoid using violence. But when a big score at an out-of-town location is offered, they roll the dice and very quickly regret it: soon they have a bunch of very dangerous people on their tails. The key to this show was the chemistry between ride-or-die leads Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura. As the stakes rose, these alternately hilarious and heartbreaking hoods had us rooting for them in no time.What we said:“Brian Tyree Henry ranges from comedy to tragedy in a single scene and never misses a beat. He is extraordinary and the rest of the cast are up there with him. He gives Dope Thief heart and at times threatens to break the viewer’s. Wonderful.”Read more39Squid GameView image in fullscreen‘Hi, Cate Blanchett!’ … Squid Game.Photograph: Netflix(Netflix) Hwang Dong-hyuk’s killer game dystopia was one of those exciting shows that nobody saw coming – and it quickly became the biggest show of 2021. But after the sagging second series, the end was in sight with this final one. Fans simplyneededto know whether Player 456 – name: Gi-hun – could take down the evil game masters and VIPs from within. While he attempted that, new games meant more scream-at-the-screen entertainment, and we had other contestants to side with (or hate). The twists were totally bewildering (hi, Cate Blanchett!), which made this one hell of a ride to the finish line.What we said:“If you can get on board with the new contestant twist – and that is a big if – then the final two episodes have a nicely grand and operatic feel to them, and ultimately, Squid Game does its job.”Read more38Dept. Q(Netflix) Like a Scottish Slow Horses, but with fewer fart gags. This TV adaptation of a series of Danish crime novels – relocated to Edinburgh – was a sarcasm-packed thrill ride as it told the tale of unpopular maverick copper Carl Morck, sent to work on futile cold cases in the basement. You couldn’t help but root for the team he pulls together to track down a missing lawyer, but the show’s real joy lay in the dynamic between grumpy Morck andKelly Macdonaldas his cheeky, pomp-pricking, work-mandated therapist.What we said:“It is all fantastically well, and rigorously, done. The pacing has a leisurely confidence that some may find a touch slow, but allows for a character-first approach, creating a richness that amply rewards initial patience.”Read more37This City Is Ours(BBC One/iPlayer) The city in question was Liverpool and while the drug gang at this drama’s heart had the territory well and truly locked down, the internal politics of family and succession were a different matter. James Nelson-Joyce stole the show as Michael, the gang’s heir apparent who finds his assumed rise to the top threatened by retiring boss Ronnie’s (Sean Bean) surprising preference for his feckless son Jamie. Needless to say, as the brains and the brawn of the operation, Michael doesn’t take this well. This City Is Ours never fully escaped from standard gangster tropes but instead, leaned into them with compelling relish. And that final rooftop standoff! Breathtakingly tense.What we said:“The Sopranos influence can be felt” …Read more36The Beast in MeView image in fullscreenAwards will surely be given … Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys in The Beast in Me.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/AP(Netflix) An extraordinary performance of jittery, self-destructive anguish fromClaire Daneslies at the heart of this ambiguous psychological thriller. Danes is Aggie Wiggs, a creatively blocked and prickly author who is dealing with the trauma of bereavement. When Matthew Rhys’s rebarbative (indeed, possibly murderous) real estate magnate Nile Jarvis moves in next door, it seems like the last thing she needs. Sure enough, the pair hate each other almost on sight – but soon, a weird, co-dependent fascination develops between them which leads to some very dark waters indeed. The two leads inspire each other into something genuinely startling.What we said:“It is, they are, absolutely wonderful to watch. Awards will surely be given, and in the meantime you cannot look away.”Read more35A Thousand Blows(Disney+) The best of Steven Knight’s many shows this year, this punchy underworld drama contained pretty much a full house of his favourite tropes: strangely poetic outlaws, beautifully realised period trappings (London’s East End in the grubby, gruesome late Victorian era) and regular outbursts of bone-crunching violence. It also boasted a trio of magnificent lead performances: Malachi Kirby’s immigrant boxer, Hezekiah Moscow, was charming, principled and deadly, while charismatic gang leader Mary Carr (Erin Doherty) was shrewd and slippery. Meanwhile, Stephen Graham – an actor whose combination of vulnerability and volatility loomed over this TV year – was somehow terrifying and desperately poignant as fading prize-fighter Henry “Sugar” Goodson.What we said:“Hasan irresistible, Dickensian-yarn quality that helps smuggle in timely social and political commentary, much as the great man did himself.”Read more34I Love LAView image in fullscreenA gen Z delight … I Love LA.Photograph: HBO/Sky Comedy(Sky Comedy/Now) Is internet comedianRachel Sennottthe Lena Dunham of her generation? Her first comedy series certainly has potential to be as relevant to gen Z as Girls was for millennials. The show follows 27-year-old aspiring talent manager Maia (Sennott) in LA as she navigates relationships, friendships, career ambitions and all of life’s mortifying moments in between. It took a few episodes to find its feet but the cast burst with energy as they delivered near-constant gags. Plus, for the millennials: Leighton Meester guest stars as Maia’s boss.What we said:“The endless embarrassments and boundless opportunities of celebrity can seem, by season’s end, not too different from that of being alive, particularly in one’s 20s. It’s a bumpy ride, but they’re just getting started.”Read more33The ChangeView image in fullscreenGorgeous whimsy … Bridget Christie as Linda in The Change.Photograph: Photographer: Jon Hall/Channel 4(Channel 4) Bridget Christie’s comedy drama is something special: a deeply personal call to arms for menopausal women who feel invisible. It’s also hilarious. Linda (Christie) is a fiftysomething mother and wife who escapes life on a motorbike to go and find herself in the Forest of Dean. By series two, she has had quite an effect on the local people: women wear “Je suis Linda” T-shirts and, armed with their copy of Linda’s Ledger, boycott doing unrecognised work. But she’s still on her own journey, too, with plenty of touching moments and acts of sisterhood. All of this was explored with Christie’s gorgeous whimsy. What a shame Channel 4 cancelled the show, despite Christie writing it for a three-series arc. Hopefully it will find a new home.What we said:“The Change is still the best (and probably the only) TV comedy series ever written about menopause.”Read more32South ParkView image in fullscreenIncredible … Donald Trump and Satan in bed in South Park.Illustration: YouTube(Paramount+) After Paramount settled a lawsuit with Donald Trump for $16m (£13.5m) and discontinued Stephen Colbert’s show after the late-night host called the deal “a big fat bribe”, South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker signed a $1.5bn five-year contract with the network – and immediately fought back. Episode one starred Donald Trump with a micropenis, climbing into bed with Satan. ICE, AI, tech bros and Labubus have all been in the line of fire. For an animated show in its 28th series to not just stay relevant, but boldly retaliate against the Trump administration’s censoring of the media, is incredible. It’s also still really, really funny.What we said:“Even for a show like South Park, which has often been defined by its anger, this may well go down as its most furious ever.”Read more31Mussolini: Son of the Century(Sky Atlantic/Now) Joe Wright’s stylish adaptation of Antonio Scurati’s doorstop of a historical novel followed Il Duce’s wobbly first steps towards fascism, as he moved from national laughing stock to the March on Rome and his ultimate enshrining as dictator. Luca Marinelli was chillingly compelling as a fourth-wall-breaking Mussolini, walking the audience through each of his norm-shattering acts in a series that served as a honking great warning klaxon in these fractious times.What we said:“A brilliantly performed portrait of a pathetic monster.”Read more30-2130What It Feels Like For a GirlView image in fullscreenCertainly a wild ride … Ellis Howard as Byron in What It Feels Like For A Girl.Photograph: Hera Pictures/BBC(BBC Three/iPlayer) Based on Paris Lees’ unflinching coming-of-age memoir, What It Feels Like For a Girl followed Nottingham teenager Byron (an incredible breakthrough for Ellis Howard) who befriends a group of club-loving transgender women and starts to explore their own identity. Byron is far from a likable protagonist – but that, along with the nuanced ways the story tackled sex work and drug use is what made it so authentic, so bold. It was a challenging but captivating watch, made even better for capturing the 00s in all their inglorious mess.What we said:“It’s certainly a wild ride – I’ll struggle to look at a toilet brush the same way ever again.”Read more29AmandalandView image in fullscreenWelcome to SoHa, darling! … Lucy Punch as Amanda and Samuel Anderson as Mal in Amandaland.Photograph: Natalie Seery/BBC/Merman(BBC One/iPlayer) Replicating the sheer watchability of Motherland’s phenomenal ensemble cast is no mean feat. But it certainly doesn’t hurt to draw on solid-gold comedy pedigree performers like Joanna Lumley and Siobhán McSweeney, plus Motherland’s most underrated character: the gloriously daffy Anne. Add in the subtlety and vulnerability that Lucy Punch brought to her turn as post-divorce queen bee Amanda, plus a script that skewered Insta-obsessed posh parents, and you had a televisual joy. Just don’t accuse her of living in South Harlesden: it’s “SoHa”, darling.What we said:“When writing is this good, it fizzes with the hysterical energy of perimenopause.”Read more28The BearView image in fullscreenStill hits so hard … Ayo Edebiri as Sydney in The Bear.Photograph: FX(Disney+) This one sure divided the critics. There were those who felt the hit restaurant drama that skyrocketed blood pressures and sales of sexy white T-shirts had served up its duffest course yet. But those who stuck with its fourth season were rewarded in spades with way less shouting of “Yes chef” and way more deep and brave and emotional television that had catharsis by the crateload. The under-the-table wedding scene? That two-hander between Sydney and Carmy (“I believe in you more than I’ve ever believed in myself”)? The funeral reveal (“I will fucking destroy you, Carmy”)? This was TV that still hits so hard.What we said:“Having put his creations and his audience through hell, showrunner Christopher Storer now lets the light in via a torrent of tenderly written, fiercely performed interactions where broken people who love each other start to heal, saying variations on those two beautiful phrases, ‘sorry’ and ‘thank you.’”Read more27Andor(Disney+) Probably the best and certainly the most universally appealing of the many additions to the Star Wars universe in recent years, this Rogue One prequel may have had the usual fantasy trappings but was also a stirring meditation on oppression and resistance. And dropping in the year of Donald Trump’s second coming, it felt particularly poignant and potent. It starred the excellent Diego Luna as Cassian Andor, a thief and scavenger whose home planet has been rendered uninhabitable by the Galactic Empire. Andor is a natural leader but he’s also a cynic; sceptical of revolutionary idealism. How does such a man turn into a freedom fighter, willing to risk everything for his cause?What we said:“Even when it’s in a lighter mode, Andor is Star Wars for grownups. This rebellion is a serious business.”Read more26HacksView image in fullscreenStuff of dreams … Jean Smart as Deborah in Hacks.Photograph: Universal(Sky Max/Now) Never mind that this wasn’t the Jean Smart-starring, odd-couple sitcom’s finest season. So glorious is this Emmy-winning tale of a veteran standup paired with a gen Z comedy writer that even a low-key outing is the stuff of most show’s dreams. This time round, we got a new roster of scene-stealing minor characters, heart-wrenching moments of pathos and zingers so acerbic you were in constant danger of spraying tea across the room. It also doesn’t hurt that the relationship between its two leads is one of TV’s most captivating.What we said:“Season four of Hacks is very funny. But what makes it really special is just how raw it is, too, ready to hit you in the feels when you least expect it.”Read more25Trespasses(Channel 4) This beautiful adaptation of Louise Kennedy’s layered story about a forbidden love affair set against the Troubles truly crushed hearts. It followed young Catholic teacher Cushla (Lola Petticrew) who falls for Protestant barrister Michael Agnew (Tom Cullen). Obviously, things couldn’t end well – as the story navigates the temperature of Belfast during that time. Gillian Anderson has, rightly, received a lot of praise for her portrayal of Cushla’s grieving alcoholic mother. But Petticrew is a rising talent, as proven in last year’s Say Nothing.What we said:“Trespasses seems like a collection of familiar melodramas, each borrowing from the Troubles for extra dramatic heft. The narrative is constructed with deceptive skill. As individuals’ hopes and feelings are crushed in the gears of events much bigger than them, we feel that pain.”Read more24The AssemblyView image in fullscreenRare candour … Danny Dyer is grilled in The Assembly.Photograph: ITV(ITV1/ITVX) There’s no denying that one of the great pleasures of this interview show was watching Gary Lineker subjected to an unfiltered grilling, just as he followed years of controversy by announcing he was leaving the BBC. But that was just one of many excellent reasons to tune in to TV’s most joyous chatshow, with the questions this group of neurodivergent people fired at a visiting celebrity leading to unfailingly brilliant viewing. The panel were fearless, funny and not afraid to ask questions most entertainment journalists wouldn’t dare to. All the celebrity guests, including Danny Dyer, Jade Thirlwall and David Tennant, answered with rare candour – while the musical performances left you bawling.What we said:“This is some of the warmest telly you’ll see this year … even when Danny Dyer starts dropping f-bombs left, right and centre.”Read more23Dreaming Whilst BlackView image in fullscreenAlways goes there … Adjani Salmon and his Tyrese backing singers in Dreaming Whilst Black.Photograph: BBC/Big Deal Films/Gary Moyes(BBC iPlayer) “Sometimes you have to Hit the Pavement. Ask Zohran Mamdani.” Since season two of his BBC comedy Dreaming Whilst Black came out, Adjani Salmon has been taking to the streets of central London with his Bafta in one hand and a poster in the other that says “Do you watch Black shows”. It’s an ace marketing strategy, but everyone in the UK should already know Salmon, and should already have watched his show – one of the most exciting and hilarious comedies of our age. In its second outing, aspiring film-maker Kwabena (Salmon) starts out unemployed – his uncle brutally roasts him, declaring “Kwabena is the only Black man in England that never got any work out of Black Lives Matter” – but soon lands what seems like a dream gig: directing a new period drama with colour-blind casting. Soon, though, the wheels come off (literally) in the most catastrophic way. It’s punchy and it always goes there; it even recreated the Tyrese Gibson RnB banger How You Gonna Act Like That. More please, BBC!What we said:“Dreaming Whilst Black remains rich with funny, true observations, about the hypocrisies and degradations of working in TV, and Black British life in general. Pertinent questions raised in this series include: “Who the fuck wines to Giggs?” and “What has Jamaican national dish ackee and saltfish – served on rye, no less – got to do with celebrating Barbados?”Read more22Riot Women(BBC One/iPlayer) This story about a menopausal rock band in Hebden Bridge was unmistakably by Sally Wainwright: a wickedly funny, hugely moving and personal take on women who feel invisible in midlife – with a few twists chucked in for good measure. The cast was some of Britain’s best, including Joanna Scanlan, Lorraine Ashbourne, Tamsin Greig and Sue Johnston. But Rosalie Craig was the standout as furious lead singer Kitty, who belted out their absolute bangers (“Give. Me. HRT!”). There was poignant social commentary, too, and many moments that were a reminder to call your mum tonight. But ultimately, it was a rollicking ode to women who won’t be ignored. Rock on series two!What we said:“Sally Wainwright should be prescribed on the NHS as a form of HRT.”Read more21MoView image in fullscreenAlmost miraculous … Mohammed Amer as Mo.Photograph: Eddy Chen/Netflix(Netflix) Mo is an almost miraculous thing, managing to find humour and humanity in the most impossible circumstances. And the worst of it is that while Mo’s struggles towards belonging in America during season one were already considerable, the Trump administration’s extreme hostility towards “invaders” makes the real situation for such people almost unbearable to contemplate. And yet, Mo’s Palestinian-American creator Mohammed Amer continues to make his extremely heavy points with remarkable lightness – really, the big takeaway should be that the pride, ingenuity and cultural richness offered by strivers like Mo would be an asset to any nation open-hearted and self-possessed enough to welcome them in.What we said:“Surely one of the most heart-rending things you’ll watch on TV this year. It brings together food, identity, immigration, family and Middle Eastern politics in a way that’s as fresh and intriguing as the falafel tacos that become central to the plot.”Read more20-1120Just Act NormalView image in fullscreenThere’s no other show like this … Tionne (Akins Subair), Tiana (Chenée Taylor), Tanika (Kaydrah Walker-Wilkie) and chicken in Just Act Normal.Photograph: Ben Gregory-Ring/BBC/The Forge(BBC Three/iPlayer) Drugs, social services, a live chicken: this wry comedy drama had it all. As if a comic tale of three under-18s desperately trying to avoid being taken into care after their mum vanishes wasn’t idiosyncratic enough, it set the series up with one of the year’s most astonishing narrative rug pulls. The youthful cast was astonishing, the gags were strong and its charmingly dark tone was like nothing else on TV. Eye-prickingly sad moments of childhood trauma rubbed up against satire, with plots that ranged from hilarious spoofs of heist movies to a tender teen romance whose early stage played out in a massage parlour. It also featured the most touching tale of a child bonding with a local drug dealer seen on TV this year. Like we said, there’s no other show like this.What we said:“It is, within each episode and over the entire series, beautifully structured and holds its many strands in perfect tension … It is altogether a wonderful thing.”Read more19ShiftyView image in fullscreenDazzling … a waxwork of Margaret Thatcher from Shifty.Photograph: Adam Curtis(BBC iPlayer) While it’s possible to argue that Adam Curtis has been telling variations of the same story for many years now (the slow death of liberal democracy and human autonomy at the hands of late-stage capitalism), he still finds new and dazzling ways of illuminating his thesis. Shifty was his most convincing offering in some time: an emotional rather than strictly historical journey and all the better for it. It begins in the Thatcher years and, using Curtis’s extraordinary skill as an editor and archive-hunter, maps a path to the New Labour years. There’s no voiceover – simply a cascading collage of imagery that feels at once familiar and revelatory. Curtis’s films are best appreciated as art installations rather than historical narratives, but this intuitive masterpiece felt convincing on every level.What we said:“It is an increasing rarity to stand in the presence of anyone with an idea, a thesis, that they have thoroughly worked out to their own satisfaction and then present stylishly, exuberantly and still intelligently. The hell and the handcart feel that bit more bearable now.”Read more18Slow Horses(Apple TV) We’ve reached season five of the little espionage thriller that could, and by this point it’s become a bona fide blockbuster. Though we can’t help but feel it’s a slight case of diminishing returns, this season still had Gary Oldman giving his all as the slovenly Slough House spy boss Jackson Lamb, Nick “Celebrity Traitors” Mohammed as the London mayor nearly getting shot in a mosque and the honey-trapping of Roddy Ho almost bringing down the whole of MI5. Thankfully, Jackson managed to step in with a cracking checkmate to save the day – and his Slough House crew. Or as he put it: “Fuck MI5. My gaff, my rules.”What we said:“Season five isn’t really about white nationalists, or environmental activists, or hostile foreign actors, and yet it is also about all of those things, all at once.”Read more17The Chair Company(Sky Comedy/Now) Fans of Tim Robinson’s awkward brand of humour were in for a real treat with this cracking series. He played family man and office worker Ron, who becomes obsessed with tracking down the company behind the chair that caused an embarrassing accident in front of his colleagues. But what starts as a week of angry emails and phone calls turns into a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and the unravelling of a man who has had enough. Bizarre, worryingly relatable and absolutely hilarious.What we said:“You can’t tell exactly when the next massive, stupid laugh is coming.”Read more16Last One Laughing UKView image in fullscreenAnyone who cracks is out! … host Jimmy Carr with the cast of Last One Laughing UK.Photograph: Amazon MGM Studios(Prime Video) It’s a simple concept: round up 10 comedians in a room and get them to try to make each other laugh – anyone who cracks is kicked out. No wonder it’s been a hit in 26 other countries. Joe Lycett lasted mere minutes, while Richard Ayoade’s deadpan ways consistently worked in his favour. Daisy May Cooper’s re-enactment of being on a rollercoaster deserves a shout-out, too, but it was Bob Mortimer who stole the show. So much so that he has already been confirmed for season two next year.What we said:“Bob Mortimer performed a magic act first seen on The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer 30 years ago and sang some songs he posted on social media during Covid. The fact that these routines not only found new life on LOL UK, but also pushed his fellow contestants to the brink, is testament to Mortimer’s talent.”Read more15PlatonicView image in fullscreenComedy gold … Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen in Platonic.Photograph: Katrina Marcinowski/Apple(Apple TV) Kayaking disasters, LSD-related wedding catastrophes and the most grim golfing-related accident ever shown on TV – in its second season, Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne’s tale of two uni pals navigating midlife lost none of its anarchic spark. And yet its depiction of the pressures of working motherhood felt more acute than ever, with Byrne the standout performer, reliably turning in comedy gold that veered from deadpan to OTT frenzy. Not bad going in a year that her co-star broke records for the number of Emmys he won for his other comedy, The Studio.What we said:“The show does a brilliant job of capturing that feeling of exclusion from the real world that often accompanies motherhood, and Byrne expertly walks the line between aspirational cool girl and relatably downtrodden housewife.”Read more14Big Boys(Channel 4) It kicked off with Jack finally losing his virginity in a tent in Faliraki and ended up with an emotionally pulverising beach scene (“I didn’t make it did I?”) followed by the revivification of a most beautiful mate. But over three series, Jack Rooke’s gorgeous autobiographical uni comedy about awkward bod Jack (Dylan Llewellyn) and his straight best mate Danny (Jon Pointing) was never one to do things by halves. It tackled love, loss and the drinking of poppers. It had a fish named Alison Hammond, a dissertation called To Bum or Not to Bum, and it offered a masterclass in how to eat Peperami while giving birth to your delivery driver’s baby. But the way it moved towards its final moments was a masterstroke. We can’t wait to see what Rooke does next.What we said: “It’s heartbreaking, it’s beautiful, it’s a valuable companion in itself: sitcoms don’t get much more deep and meaningful than this.”Read more13Such Brave Girls(BBC Three/iPlayer) None of the characters are nice, but it’s almost impossible to watch an episode of this darkly comic, impeccably acted show about three women on the brink and not want to spend more time in their company. A ferocious, laugh-out-loud funny rampage through mental health crises, debt and toxic relationships. Given that creator Kat Sadler and her sister co-star Lizzie Davidson are wringing sparklingly bleak comedy out of material based on their own lives, it makes the bravery of this Bafta-winning creation even more impressive.What we said:“If you like your comedy scary, lairy and perfectly portioned, it is a total knockout.”Read more12PluribusView image in fullscreenSpectacularly original … Rhea Seehorn and Kevin Chambers in Pluribus.Photograph: Anna Kooris/Apple(Apple TV) With Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul behind him, there were huge expectations for showrunner Vince Gilligan’s new drama – but he has pulled off a spectacularly original sci-fi story. Carol (the brilliant Rhea Seehorn, who the show was written for) is a miserable novelist who is immune to an alien virus that takes hold of 99.9% of the world and turns them into a happy hive. As Carol tries to “save” the world, the show morphs into a sharply funny social observation and a psychological thriller that hums with existential dread. As per Gilligan’s works, trust and patience are rewarded – thanks in part to those hypnotic opening montages – and each episode racks up more questions that you’re happy to wait whole series to find answers to. It’s a good job season two has already been commissioned.What we said:“It takes some chutzpah to look at the world in 2025 – especially if you are a non-Maga citizen of the US – and say to yourself, “Yes, but wouldn’t it be almost more terrible if everybody just … got along?” But that is essentially what Gilligan has done. The execution may not be flawless but the audacity of the question is incredible.”Read more11The White LotusView image in fullscreenMelting hearts … Aimee Lou Wood in The White Lotus.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/AP(Sky Atlantic/Now) Parker Posey’s lorazepam-fuelled North Carolinian accent! Leslie Bibb’s “cunty little bob”! Aimee Lou Wood’s melting of hearts! And … Patrick Schwarzenegger’s sibling incest! The third season of Mike White’s luxury resort drama, set in Thailand, might not have been the best – but it was stuffed with viral comedy moments, treacle-dark twists and career-high performances. This is still one of the most solid series going, with White taking it in weirder and wilder directions each time, so who on earth knows what the next White Lotus stay will bring.What we said:“Exquisitely shot, scripted, paced and performed, it’s a sumptuous feast for all the senses. ”Read more10-6 coming soonStay tuned for the next episode"

The 85-year-old singer said his cancer had “gone at the moment” and backed calls for a national screening test for men.In an interview with ITV’s Good Morning Britain on Monday, he said: “I don’t know whether it’s going to come back. We can’t tell those sort of things but we need to, absolutely, I’m convinced, get there, get tested, get checked.”He said he was diagnosed after a health check for his insurance before a concert tour of Australia and New Zealand.“The good fortune was that it was not very old, and the other thing is that it has not metastasised. Nothing had moved into bones or anything like that.”The singer, known for decades of hits including The Young Ones, We Don’t Talk Anymore and Summer Holiday, described the lack of a national screening programme as “absolutely ridiculous”.“We have governments to look after our country and those who live in that country, so I can’t see how you can say: ‘Oh we can do this, we can do that, but we don’t do this for these people,’” Richard said.“We all deserve to have the same ability to have a test and then start treatments really early. It seems to me – I’ve only been for one year now in touch with cancer, but every time I’ve talked with anybody this has come up and so I think our government must listen to us.”The king last week said his cancer treatment would be reduced in the new year, and Richard said he was keen to join forces to raise awareness.“I’ve been involved with many charities over the years and if the king is happy to front it for us, I’m sure loads of people, I certainly would join him.“If the king is listening, I think most of us would say, ‘Yeah, we’re available.’”Richard was interviewed by the former Sky News presenter Dermot Murnaghan, who announced his diagnosis with stage-four prostate cancer in June.Afterwards Murnaghan, 67, spoke to GMB presenters Susanna Reid and Richard Madeley about his own diagnosis and encouraged men to get themselves tested.He said: “I was ill. I fell ill. I’m stage 4, so I was on a long holiday far away from these shores, and felt awful and put it down to jet lag or an infection … rapidly understood that I was really bad, and flew back here and went straight into A&E, straight into a hospital bed.“So that’s how silly I was, that if I had a test, I don’t know however many years, how long it had been developing within me, but if I’d had a test earlier, then, you know, the earlier you catch it, it goes for most cancers, the earlier you catch it, the better the treatment is, or the better the prognosis.”In November, Murnaghan expressed his disappointment when the UK National Screening Committee (UKNSC) said prostate cancer screening should not be made routinely available for the vast majority of men in the UK because it “is likely to cause more harm than good”.The committee has, however, put forward arecommendation to screen men with BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations, which puts them at far higher risk of prostate cancer, every two years, between the ages of 45 and 61.Chiara De Biase, director of health services, equity and improvement at ProstateCancerUK, said: “We’re glad to hear that Sir Cliff Richard found his prostate cancer at an early stage and has had successful treatment.“We thank him for sharing his story and in doing so raising vital awareness of this disease, which is completely curable if found early. But men’s lives should not be left to chance. We lose 12,000 dads, brothers, sons and friends to this disease every year.“Prostate cancer is the last major cancer without a mass screening programme, and it’s about time for change.”Explore more on these topicsCliff RichardProstate cancerMen's healthCancerKing Charles IIINHSHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

In the shadow of the Peacock theater in Los Angeles and next to a giant, demonic statue promoting new game Divinity, which would be announced on stage later that evening, stands a collection of people in bright red shirts. Many are holding signs: a tombstone honouring the “death” of The Game Awards’Future Class talent development programme; a bold, black-and-red graphic that reads “We’re Done Playing”; and “wanted” posters for Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick and Microsoft CEO Phil Spencer. This is a protest.The protesters, who were almost denied entry to the public space outside the Peacock theater (“they knew we were coming,” one jokes), are from United Videogame Workers (UVW), an industry-wide, direct-join union for North America that is part of the Communications Workers of America. “We are out here today to raise awareness of the plight of the game worker,” says Anna C Webster, chair of the freelancing committee, in the hot Los Angeles sun. “Our industry has been strip-mined for resources by these corporate overlords, and we figured the best place to raise awareness of what’s happening in the games industry is at the culmination, the final boss, as it were: The Game Awards.”Webster is referencing several things here. More than 40,000 layoffs have decimated the industry over the past few years; just last month, Grand Theft Auto developer RockstarGames wasaccused of union-bustingafter firing more than 30 staff (the studiodenies this, saying the employees were leaking confidential information), and AI is being rapidlyinjected into game development processes. The industry seems unwilling to reckon with these issues.View image in fullscreen‘They never seem to acknowledge the layofffs’… United Videogame Workers members protest outside LA’s Peacock TheatrePhotograph: Colton “Anarche99” Childrey“I recently read that a three-minute trailer at The Game Awardscosts more than $1m,” says the union’s local secretary, Kaitlin “KB” Bonfiglio. “[Despite] the pomp and circumstance of all of this, they never seem to acknowledge the historic amount of layoffs that have happened in the industry.”For the UVW, there is a core issue here. “It’s all about greed,” Webster insists. “Anyone who works in the games industry can identify that our art form is being sold for parts to make a few people a lot of money. And they don’t care about the games. They don’t care about the art. They just want their money.”For those working in games, the problems plaguing the industry are obvious. But how can UVW make it clear that the issues industry workers face affect players, too? “If you’re someone who loves video games, if you are frustrated by games that launch buggy and are delayed messes, if you’re frustrated by games you’re excited about getting cancelled without warning, all of that ties back to what we’re doing here,” treasurer Sherveen Uduwana says. “Giving us layoff protections, making sure bosses can’t take away our healthcare, making sure they can’t replace us with AI – that is going to lead to better games for players and more ambitious, interesting, creative projects. It’s really a win-win for players and a win-win for workers.”There’s a clear love for the industry permeating through this group, a desire to make the medium and the work they cherish even better. The Game Awards is a major night, one that can help prop up smaller independent studios and highlight incredible voice actors. The UVW team recognises that.“Have a good time today, and tomorrow, let’s wake up and start organising for better workers’ rights and a better games industry,” Uduwana says.Explore more on these topicsGamesGaming awardsAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

Four men have been arrested and placed under formal investigation, but the jewels have not been found.In November, awater leakdamaged 300 to 400 journals, books and documents in the Egyptian department. A gallery housing nine rooms containing ancient Greek ceramics was then closed because offears about ceiling safety.All three trade unions at the Louvre – the CGT, Sud and CFDT – announced a rolling strike, saying: “Staff feel today like they are the last bastion before collapse.”At a general meeting, 400 employees voted unanimously to begin the strike on Monday morning. At the picket line, one night security guard who said he had been working at the museum for 20 years said: “I’ve never seen staff this angry.” Another daytime security guard, who had worked for 14 years checking visitors entering the museum, said: “The pressure in our working lives is extreme.”View image in fullscreenWorkers on strike picket outside the Louvre  over staffing and working conditions.Photograph: Michel Euler/APThe unions said the jewel robbery had shed light on years of difficulties, staff cuts and state underinvestment at the museum, which had 8.7 million visitors last year.Many staff and union representatives said it was discriminatory that the Louvre was raising ticket prices by 45% for visitors from outside the European economic area to raise revenues to fund structural improvements.People from countries including the US, Britain and China, which represent some of the highest numbers of visitors to the museum, will have to pay €32 to get in from January.On the picket line, Vanessa Michaut-Valora of the Sud Culture trade union, who works in security in several wings of the Louvre, said the price increases for non-Europeans were unacceptable. She said: “For example, how can you charge Egyptian visitors extra when they are coming to see their own works in our Egyptian collection? And the same goes for our Mesopotamia collections and other works.”She called for a stop to themajor projectannounced by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, last January to build a new museum entrance and give the Mona Lisa, the world’s most famous portrait, its own room.“Money should be put into restoring and consolidating the building instead of building a new entrance to bring in even more people,” she said.Christian Galani, a CGT union official representing Louvre workers, said it was “unacceptable discrimination” to raise ticket prices for some nationalities. “Worse still, these visitors would have to pay more to see a dilapidated museum, where they can’t access the whole collection because we are chronically lacking staff and rooms are regularly closed off.”He said it was an “absolute scandal” to make visitors from certain countries “pay for years of accumulated failings” at a museum whose collection was made up of works from across the world.“It goes against the universality of culture and the idea of equal access,” Galani said. “For example, this will impact British tourists, yet if I go to the British Museum, it’s free.”Unions are concerned about staffing and working conditions after 200 jobs have been cut since 2015 – many in security.Galani, who works in the museum’s security control room at night, said of the strike action: “We are so exasperated; this is the only way left to make ourselves heard. Problems have accumulated for years and the robbery has brought it all to light. There has been neglect of both building renovation and security measures to protect the collection.”Last month, France’s state auditor said security upgrades had been carried out at a “woefully inadequate pace” and the museum had prioritised “high-profile and attractive operations” instead of protecting itself.Guy Tubiana, a senior police officer and security adviser, who took part in an investigation ordered by the culture ministry after the jewel robbery, told senators he was “stunned” by what he had discovered at the museum.“There was a succession of malfunctions that led to catastrophe but I never would have thought the Louvre could have so many malfunctions,” he said.The preliminary investigation ordered by the government revealed “a chronic underestimation” of the risks of a break-in and “underinvestment in security measures”, the culture minister, Rachida Dati, said.Philippe Jost, who headed the rebuild of Paris’s fire-damagedNotre-Dame Cathedral, is to undertake a study next month into a “deep reorganisation” of the Louvre.The Louvre director, Laurence des Cars, as well as unions, had warned repeatedly before the break-in about conditions inside the museum and the cost of maintaining the vast former royal palace. In January, she said visiting the overcrowded building had become a“physical ordeal”.A general meeting on whether to continue the strike is scheduled to take place on Wednesday morning. The museum is closed on Tuesdays.Explore more on these topicsParisMuseumsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Ahead of its festive special, the stars open up about the show’s poignant comebackLibby BrooksMon 15 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 06.40 ESTShareWhen taxi drivers in London started shouting punchlines at him – that’s when Jonathan Watson knew that Two Doors Down, the BBC Scotland sitcom set in a Glasgow suburb, had gone from slow-burn to blazing.The yelling is appropriate in itself, since Watson’s character, Colin, is congenitally unfiltered. Whether it’s telling his neighbours they needn’t worry about a spate of burglaries because “nobody’ll target your place – they’ll want stuff they can actually sell”, or sharing the secrets of his Tinder success: “You have a chat: ‘How are you? I just put on a wash,’ and the next thing she’s in my bed, well more on top of it with a towel down …”Created by Gregor Sharp and the lateSimon Carlyle, Two Doors Down hops between living rooms on the fictional Latimer Crescent, where a mismatched group of neighbours can’t seem to resist popping in on each other again and again and again. Now, the cast returns for a one-off Christmas special where Beth and Eric cause consternation when they put up their Christmas tree earlier than usual, prompting demands for bespoke mince pies and a heated debate about the song Fairytale of New York.View image in fullscreenIt must be Christmas … Weir and Norton in the Christmas special.Photograph: Graeme Hunter/BBC Studios ScotlandHaving completed seven series, most recently for BBC One, this month’s Christmas special comes just after the announcement that the show willtransfer to the stagenext year, playing 10 showsat the 12,000-seater Glasgow Hydro. It’s testament to the appeal of a show where, at a cursory glance, very little happens.The show’s moral centre – even if she doesn’t want to be – is Beth. Along with her husband Eric, their hospitality is most regularly abused by neighbours such as Colin and Cathy – his eye-wateringly competitive, tipple-chasing wife (played byDoon Mackichan) who puts the petty into bourgeois. Or miserabilist Christine, who outstays her welcome while trading sofa-bound micro-aggressions.Beth is played byArabella Weir, who can communicate anger, discomfort or desperation in the lift of an eyebrow or twitch of a lip. “Simon and Gregor did something so hard,” she says, “to write comedy that is relatable and real. Writing ordinary people who don’t do weird things – it’s really difficult to make that work.”Watson agrees: “The characters are so clearly defined that you can be anywhere in the UK and you can identify with them. Everybody knows a Cathy, a Christine, a Colin. And that’s all down to the writing.”View image in fullscreenParty hard … the neighboours celebrate in series six of Two Doors Down, 2023.Photograph: Anne Binckebanck/BBC StudiosEven though cabbies love to shout out the show’s punchlines, they are just one part of its appeal. With acute observations and finely tuned performances, it’s as far from boom-tish delivery as can be. A classic one-room comedy in the tradition of The Royle Family, the storylines are reassuringly mundane; an entire episode can be based round the purchase of an extra-large box of doughnuts. But the drama is layered through with warmth and recognition. Moments of tenderness sit alongside the outrageous rudeness.What’s glaringly apparent is that Two Doors down is now comfortably ensconced in the nation’s hearts. But how did it get there?“Nobody’s more surprised than me,” says Alex Norton, who plays Eric. “It was supposed to be a one-off, but the script was really fresh and unusual and it seemed to go really well. Next thing was the phone call saying: ‘Would you be interested in doing the series?’”The pilot aired on Hogmanay in 2013 and was commissioned, but the first series only began three years later, on BBC Two. “It began to grow and grow,” Watson recalls, as subsequent series were commissioned.“And then Covid hit,” he says, “and all of a sudden younger folk discovered it on iPlayer, so our audience really expanded.”The booming fanbase was clearly recognised by BBC bosses, and the show moved to BBC One for its seventh series in 2023. (Let’s take a second to appreciate how rare it is for a series to be recommissioned six-plus times.)Both the writing and the filming of the show are rooted in collaboration, explains Sharp: “It’s never felt like overnight success and the process of making the show has remained exactly the same.”By sticking with many of the same cast and crew since the early days, the team have developed a shorthand for working together: “They understand what the world of the show is and what we’re looking to achieve.”Speaking to cast members on set in Glasgow for the Christmas special, the sheer heft of comic – and dramatic – experience in the studio is clear. Cast CVs range from the work of Bill Forsyth, Chris Morris and Michael Winterbottom through landmark shows including Naked Video, The Fast Show, Smack the Pony, Rab C Nesbitt, Still Game and Prince Andrew: The Musical. But what’s also evident from the warm greetings and easy chat is how well the ensemble gel. Currently tThey all plan to appear on stage next September. And when Carlyle died in August 2023 at the age of 48, just weeks after filming on the seventh series concluded, it was a tragedy that is still deeply felt.View image in fullscreenTwo Doors Down co-creator Simon Carlyle.Photograph: BBC“When Simon passed away it was such a loss, and emotionally the thought of walking back on that set without him was just awful,” says Elaine C Smith, who plays Christine, always ready with a dire warning or suspect consumer tip (“You know who does a good paracetamol? Morrisons.”) Both this Christmas special and next year’s live show will be “a farewell and a thank you” to Carlyle, she adds.“As Elaine said, we’re honouring the memory,” says Norton. “I don’t believe in a lot of superstitious nonsense, but I feel his presence [on set]. I think he’d like it because the script is very good and it does honour his legacy.”“We all feel his absence,” says Sharp, who had to develop an entirely new writing process for the show,having spent yearssitting at the same laptop with his writing partner, sharing life stories and “feeling like pulling your brain inside out, trying to solve the puzzles of an episode”.The challenge of writing alone, and while grieving, must have been immense. “Every idea and every line in the script I would filter it through a sense of ‘Is this true to the show’? And as long as you’re being true to the show, then you’re being true to Simon.”Two Doors Down isn’t clunkily issue-based, nor does it exist in some sitcom limbo. Instead, it gently navigates the quotidian politics of family, friendships and generations with an unassuming radicalism.Take the women – the absolute precision of Carlyle and Sharp’s writing combined with the mighty talents of Weir, Mackichan and Smith mean that characters who might in other hands be monstrous are allowed their shadow side, be that Cathy’s inability to have children or Christine’s loneliness.“Here are three women over 50 who you don’t see on television without them being caricatured, and acting one of them is unbelievably joyful and liberating,” says Weir.“The women could easily be the doormat, the whinge and the alcoholic,” says Mackichan. “But the writing is brilliant and we just have to constantly find ways to thread in vulnerability and softness.”She is struck by how many people claim to have a Cathy in their own lives – and see beyond her outrageous behaviour. “There’s one Christmas episode when I’d been drinking way too much, Beth finally mentioned it, and then I got really upset. If she didn’t have that vulnerability, she wouldn’t be as funny. That’s where true humour is: when it’s dark but it’s real.”View image in fullscreenThe way we were … Doon Mackichan as Cathy, Elaine C Smith as Christine, Joy McAvoy as Michelle and Arabella Weir as Beth, the cast in series five, 2022.Photograph: Alan Peebles/BBC StudiosSmith recalls the “incredibly detailed notes” the cast were given during the early series, which emphasised the importance of “not pushing it”. Two Doors Down, she says, is not so much a comedy of action as one of reaction.“They’ve got to be believable. Christine is a monster but she’s not cartoonish. There’s a vulnerability and loneliness: she’s got no one and no life while pretending that she does.” She mentions another festive episode, when Christine is left alone in a coffee shop contemplating an empty Christmas Day. “People were in tears on the set.”The show applies the same gentle curiosity to queer relationships. Eric and Beth’s son Ian, played by Jamie Quinn, is gay and his long-term boyfriend Gordon is played by standup Kieran Hodgson. “We tend not to have major breakthroughs in the show,” Hodgson says, “but year after year, the members of the street – who might not interact with queer culture that much – are given this little window through Ian and Gordon and are slowly coming to a very robust acceptance of it all.”While Gordon spends more time than he might like dodging Cathy’s salacious overtures, his partnership with Ian is comfortably humdrum. “I really enjoy their lack of aspirational sexiness,” says Hodgson. “Often gay people are portrayed as being far too exciting, too dramatic in their lives. Ian and Gordon are just people up the road who happen to have that romantic element in their life, but beyond that they’re actually quite dull.” He beams. “That’s the final liberation.”Two Doors Down Christmas Special is on BBC One on Christmas Eve at 10pm.This article was amended on 15 December 2025.

Kevin Killian, the poet obsessed with Kylie MinogueHe wrote poems named after Kylie songs and named his collection of erotic fiction after her indie album. He even loved the B-sides. So what did the avant garde writer find so inspiring about the mini Melbourne marvel?Michael CraggMon 15 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Dec 2025 01.02 ESTShareKevin Killian was obsessed with stars. Not in a metaphysical sense, like the grand lineage of poets that went before him, but the celebrity kind. Some were A-listers – he kept a vast database on Julia Roberts – and some more obscure. In 2000, taken by the work of cult literary sensation JT LeRoy, andconfusion about their identity, Killian gave public readings of their work in San Francisco, where he had lived for 20 years after moving from New York. He would also turn unknown poets into local celebrities, hosting poetry events and making rapturous introductions to crowds that were occasionally outnumbered by the people on stage. “Anyone he admired was an A-lister,” says poet and friend,Evan Kennedy, “especially unknown poets. He’d enthuse about someone, and I’d say ‘Who?’ Kevin engaged the Bay Area poetry scene like Warhol didhis Factory– but unlike Warhol, it wasn’t centred around him or his work.”Killian – a figure in San Francisco’sNew Narrativemovement, alongside writers such asKathy AckerandRobert Glück– saved his biggest celebrity obsession, however, for Kylie Minogue. She ran through his work like letters in a stick of rock. In 2008, he publishedAction Kylie, a poetry collection that included works named after Kylie songs (Slow, Spinning Around, Your Disco Needs You), and more abstract scenarios, such as the lovelorn An Audience with Kylie Minogue, in which lyrics from Fever intertwine with the mundanity of Love Hearts sweets. A year later, in 2009, Killian published Impossible Princess, an award-winning collection of gay erotic fiction named after Kylie’s misunderstood 1997 opus. She’d crop up elsewhere too, reflecting Killian’s bonafides as a proper fan. Tightrope, from 2014’s Tweaky Village collection, is named after a Kylie B-side, and highlights how “All her best songs saved as B-sides or just leaked on to the internet, where they live on as fan favourites”.View image in fullscreen‘Her glamour is more achievable.’ … Kylie Minogue performing in 2002.Photograph: JMEnternational/RedfernsThese poems and more appear inPadam Padam, a new collection of Killian’s work that pays obvious homage to Kylie’s 2023 hit of the same name. Released four years after Killian died of cancer aged 66, it was chosen as the perfect title by Kennedy and fellow poet Jason Morris, who would hear the song everywhere while they were editing the book. For most Americans, Kylie had slipped off the radar after her 2001 hit Can’t Get You Out of My Head, but “Kevin wouldn’t have called Padam Padam a comeback,” says Kennedy – “though it was to everyone dancing in San Francisco that summer.”An acclaimed editor and playwright as well as a poet, whom transgressive writer Dennis Cooper called “the greatest unsung genius in contemporary American literature”, Killian’s devotion to Kylie initially baffled Kennedy and Morris. “I couldn’t see why Kevin would spend his talents on her,” says Kennedy. But slowly he started to see a connection in the way both Kylie and Killian moved through their careers, and how they interacted with others. “Maybe the reason that his obsession was Kylie and not, say, Madonna or Simone Weil, is the same reason that Kevin settled inSan Francisco, as opposed to New York,” he says. “Kylie is scrappier and less polished. Her glamour is more achievable. Kylie reaches out to her fans.”Morris initially saw Kylie, and Killian’s parallel obsession with writing Amazon product reviews (later compiled in another posthumous book, 2024’s Selected Amazon Reviews), as a curious use of the “deeply charismatic”writer’s time. But Killian seemed to revel in the New Narrative movement’s collapsing of high and low culture, with his love for Kylie speaking to his identity as a gay man. (Killian’s “sexuality was practically off the queer end of the chart,” wrote his wife of 34 years,Dodie Bellamy, in 2000 – they had a fluid approach to sexuality).“In the North American media market, to love Kylie, you probably also have to be gay,” says writerKay Gabriel, who provides Padam Padam’s introduction. “In Kevin’s exhaustive detailing of Kylie’s career and collaborators, there’s a sense that this enthusiasm will yield something like a hidden truth. Maybe what he calls the ‘empty, spooky sigh at the heart’ of her work. All that said, he clearly revered enthusiasm on its own – he had a deep ecumenical respect for the adoring relationship that anybody has with their particular diva.”View image in fullscreen‘Deeply charismatic’ … Kevin Killian in 2011.Photograph: Andrew KenowerIn her introduction, Gabriel homes in on Killian’s use of “a third term between [his poetry] and its object”, a playful style she feels Killian, who disliked being over-intellectualised, would say he used simply because it’s fun. Whether writing about the Aids crisis in 1997via the prism of the horror films of Dario Argento, or exploring the human condition in drag as Kylie, this third term defined his best work. This framework, Gabriel says, was a way for Killian and his readers to engage with trickier experiences “by bouncing our ideas off of something else, something good to think with, something with a lot of captivating material”. A move a certain Padam Padam hitmaker, whose career has been about masking reality via the shiny world of pop, would surely recognise.Padam Padam: The Collected Poemsis out on 18 December published by Nightboat Books, £17.99Explore more on these topicsBooksPoetryKylie MinoguePop and rockSan FranciscofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Each is told with a compelling immediacy and intensity, and with the quality of returning to a memory.In the story Reindeer a man is seeking a bear, which has been woken by hunger from hibernation and is now raiding livestock from the farms of a small isolated community. “There was no true sunshine. There was no gleam in the snow, but the lateness of the left daylight put a cold faint blue through the slopes.” The story’s world is one in which skill, endurance, even stubbornness might be insufficient to succeed, but are just enough to persist.Jones’s austere world of rural settings is a working countryside of risk, hard labour and isolation.In an interview in the Los Angeles Review of BooksJones said: “Much rural fiction I’ve read by contemporary writers often feels quite fake, written from the point of view of a visitor, rather than a native.” His powers of noticing are native yet neutral, bringing precise, vivid life to his stories without dictating moral responses to the reader. Jones makes the reader see and feel the scene: the “happy shock” of the just-fed lamb in Cow, or in the same story: “The calf’s upward-facing eye opened. A dark globe endlessly deep in the pure white surround.”The home in the title story is besieged by high winds and heavy rain: the storm of fate that might batter any familyIn Cow, Jones takes a collision of emergencies on a farm, culminating in the labour of a cow, and makes of them an atmospheric, near-mythic drama. “With the clap of the car doors, a cloud of starlings lifted off the adjacent pasture. As they scarfed away, the ground, with all the wet going through it, seemed to flitter with the sound of their wings.” He inhabits the fleetingness of our human moment in the larger scale of nature and time, while illuminating and latently asserting the essential value of our struggles with the physical world, each other and ourselves.In White Squares a man has received a court order judging that he should have no contact with his son. “He was angry actuallyatthe court – the physical object of it itself, as a person can be angry with a low doorframe they walk their own head into.” His wife had testified: “He never does anything, he never gets anything done.” He decides he is going to fix it so that his son will win the annual river duck race, having been humiliated the previous year. “Some people always win things. Other people never win anything.” “You can’t rely on luck,” the father observes, and the story shows that you can’t necessarily rely on action either.These stories are spaced out in very short paragraphs, many of only one sentence, and these often of just a few words. It is a device that in less skilful hands might produce a false reaching after of poetic effect; here it brings a physical rhythm that generates a maximum of force, presence and meaning. Drama arises from the freshness of witness and the flawless placing of action in the narrative.The home in the title story is besieged by high winds and heavy rain: the storm of fate that might batter any family. The residents are unprepared for the once-in-20-years assault by tempest that now comes every year. The husband bought sealant but failed to apply it to the cabin boards in time, so that water leaks into the house. He was complacent about the pines growing close to the power lines, counting on the cypress trees to block them should they fall. His wife is more insistent about the dangers and he too knows, observing: “There’s just so much force now, in the weather.”Pulse is a story about how connected living things are: trees, people, families, communities. A tree surgeon tells the couple that when one tree in a stand falls the rest are sure to follow, and the husband remembers his grandparents and how they died within weeks of each other. He thinks: “It’s the ground. We just have to hope that the ground holds.” The book as a whole makes a strong case for the centrality of the short story to the reading of fiction, and the reading of fiction as a place and a practice where sense and empathy can flourish.Pulse by Cynan Jones is published by Granta (£14.99).

You don’t have to be related to Hudson to consider her a joyous proposition – a great performer who hasn’t yet made a great film. It was a quarter-century ago in Almost Famous, her breakthrough picture, that she first proved she could hoist a movie out of the doldrums while making the task appear as effortless as blow-drying her hair. Without her performance as Penny Lane, the rock’n’roll muse who describes herself as a “band-aid” rather than a groupie, Cameron Crowe’s dopey valentine to the 1970s of his youth would have been Almost Forgettable.Her vitality propelled that film, and her face alone drove its marketing campaign, so it was only right that Hudson, then just 21, received an Oscar nomination. The years that followed brought a confetti-like flurry of romcoms, including How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and Bride Wars, both smash hits despite their mood of seething bitterness. There were overlooked dramatic gambles (The Killer Inside Me, The Reluctant Fundamentalist), maximum-cringe misfires (the cancer weepie A Little Bit of Heaven, Sia’scrass autism drama Music) and the odd effervescent comeback, includingGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, in which Hudson was superb as a dim-bulb fashion designer prone to facepalm moments.View image in fullscreenUnderdog story … Hugh Jackman as Mike and Kate Hudson as Claire in Song Sung Blue.Photograph: Focus FeaturesNow 46, she has just received a Golden Globe nomination and likely has another Oscar nomination on the way. Once again, it is for a movie steeped in music: Song Sung Blue, a real-life underdogs’ love story based on the 2008 documentary of the same name. Hudson is Claire Sardina, AKA Thunder, who forms a Neil Diamond tribute outfit with her husband, Mike (Hugh Jackman), the Lightning part of the duo. The opening half, in which Claire meets Mike and pushes their collaboration from musical to romantic, is pleasantly nutty. The remainder has more tragic twists than a doom-laden country and western standard. Through it all, Hudson is a beacon of resilience, humanity and tenderness.Dressed all in black today, with straight, glossy blond hair, she is relaxed, if easily distracted. “Should I eat this if it was already open?” she wonders aloud, inspecting the sachet that came with her tea. “Do you think someone did something to this?” She tips the contents into the cup all the same. “Cut to the end of the interview and I’m, like, on the floor…”Hudson also has one eye on what she and her son are doing later this evening. “We’re going to see Radiohead. I’m so excited!” The last time she saw them live, she was Ryder’s age: it was October 2000, Almost Famous had just opened in the US, and the Oxfordshire avant-gardists were the musical guests on Saturday Night Live, which she was hosting. Hudson threw off her clothes to reveal the words “Radiohead is here” daubed on her bikini-clad body along with flowers and peace symbols. To the sound of frantically groovy music, she bopped and shimmied while the camera zoomed in and out at high speed.View image in fullscreen‘It’s awesome that I was conceived in London’ … Goldie Hawn with son Oliver Hudson and daughter Kate at Heathrow in 1982.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesThe entire spectacle was a reference to Rowan and Martin’s Laugh-In, the giddy late-1960s comedy show that made a star of her mother, Goldie Hawn, who was typically seen cavorting in swimwear and body paint. That SNL moment was also an early acknowledgment, as if any were needed, that Hudson would have her work cut out trying to escape her mother’s shadow.Hawn is an invisible presence in this London hotel room. It is her 80th birthday, and Hudson is missing the celebrations back home in favour of promoting Song Sung Blue. At least she can feel symbolically close to her mother by being in the city where it all began. “It’s so awesome that I was conceived in London,” she says, ignoring the teatime rain clattering against the window. Conception occurred in Regent’s Park, about a mile from where we are sitting. “Notinthe actual park. That would have been a way cooler story. It was in an apartment my mom was renting. I bet she’ll remember which one.”Her parents – Hawn was married to the musician Bill Hudson – split when she was 18 months old and her brother Oliver was four. Their stepfather, the actor Kurt Russell, whom their mother has been with for more than 40 years, is the man they call “Pa”. Asked last year about her relationship with her biological father, who blasted her as “spoiled” in his memoir but was largely absent from her life, Hudson said: “I don’t really have one.” She then modified her statement: “It’s warming up.”Music has been the connective tissue throughout her life and work. Bill Hudson was a member of the Hudson Brothers, who spent much of the 1970s as teen idols signed to Elton John’s record label. Hawn released a country-tinged album, Goldie, in 1972. All three of Hudson’s children have musician dads: Ryder’s father, and Hudson’s first and only husband so far, is the Black Crowes singer, Chris Robinson; she had her second son Bingham, who is 14, with Matt Bellamy of Muse; and her current fiance, Danny Fujikawa, formerly of the LA band Chief, is the father of her daughter Rani, who is seven.Hudson has sung on screen plenty of times before, including a boozy duet with Matthew McConaughey of Carly Simon’s You’re So Vain in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, and the showstopping sequence in Nine in which she belts out Cinema Italiano while trooping up and down a catwalk in silver boots. “WHY hasn’t a musical been written for Kate Hudson?” demanded one YouTube commenter, not unreasonably.Song Sung Blue is different. The Neil Diamond numbers are all wrapped up in Hudson’s performance: she’s singing in character, expressing Sardina’s pain, yearning and indefatigability through music. “In the studio, I’d find these harmonies myself and do my own vocal riffs,” she says proudly. The director, Craig Brewer, encouraged her. “I’d be saying, ‘But Craig, is it really Claire?’ And he’d go, ‘It is now!’” That latitude may not have been possible had she modelled herself too closely on the real Sardina, whom she only met when shooting was under way. “By that point, my version of Claire was in my body. But it was good to have her there to ask, ‘Did this bitreallyhappen like this?’”View image in fullscreenWith Anne Hathaway in Bride Wars, 2009.Photograph: Pictorial Press/AlamyHudson’s singing in the film has more authentic gusto than anything heard on her own rent-a-rocker debut album, Glorious, released last year. It was while promoting the album on US television that she caught Hugh Jackman’s eye. “Hugh saw me being interviewed, where I’m talking about how I simplyhadto be singing and writing music, and he was like: ‘Well, she obviously needs to be Claire.’” You can see his point. It’s the urge to perform that sustains Sardina as fate dishes out one flabbergasting blow after another. “I understand what it’s like to love something so much that you can’t face losing it,” says Hudson.She might not have recorded Glorious in the first place if it weren’t for Paul McCartney. “It was Paul’s 80th birthday and I was sitting at the side of the stage watching him headline Glastonbury.” The story ends in an epiphany. “I woke up the next morning and felt so emotional. I was, like, ‘I amnothappy with my output!’ I mean, I have so much gratitude. But I am not just an actor. I’ve been a musician my whole life and I never had the courage to do anything with it. I decided I want to take more chances. I want to fail more.” Perhaps she won’t be too hurt, then, that the Times described Glorious as “the very essence of a vanity project”.Watching McCartney made her think “about those who compromise and those who don’t. I thought about being a woman in the industry and all the compromising you do for other people. About doing comedies and being successful in them but still feeling like you’re constantly having to compromise.”Not that she’s dissing romcoms. “You know what? They’re my favourite. I love them and I will never stop making them. I just think they need to be better. When you’re trying to make a great one, you’re fighting a lot of algorithms. I think they’ve dumbed down the romcom. The ones I loved were written and directed by the best talent. Nora Ephron, Jim [James L] Brooks: those are the great ones that last for ever. They’re like comfort blankets.”View image in fullscreen‘I didn’t get into acting to only do one thing’ … Hudson in The Killer Inside Me, 2010.Photograph: Album/AlamyOther films are more like hair shirts. Take The Killer Inside Me, a necessarily repulsive adaptation of Jim Thompson’s noir novel about a psychopathic deputy sheriff, played by Hudson’s old pal Casey Affleck. It was Affleck and the picture’s British director, Michael Winterbottom, who persuaded her to take the role of the killer’s fiance, who is shown being spanked. For real, as she confirmed in 2010: “There were a couple [of slaps] in there when I thought: God, Casey! He got a bit of power behind it.” Before being murdered by him, she is spat on and punched in the stomach.It’s a contentious filmbut hardly the work of a compromiser.“That stretched different muscles,” she says now. “I didn’t get into acting to only do one thing.” Affleck intimated at the time that his then wife was no fan of the film. What feedback did Hudson receive? “Oh, it was fine. It was such a small movie.” Meaning, presumably, that no one saw it anyway. I tell her I admire it, but I never want to watch it again. “That’s how I felt,” she says.She claims not to pay any attention to what is said about her, good or bad. “It all falls into the category of what Kurt calls ‘noise’. His thing is always: just do great work.” Presumably, that goes for all the Oscar chatter, too. “That’snicenoise,” she concedes. I ask how often she has been checking Variety magazine’s regularly updated Oscar predictions. Should I get them up for her on my phone? “No, don’t!” she squeals in horror. “It freaks me out. I can’t even.” I refrain from telling her that Jessie Buckley is the current favourite totake the prize for Hamnet. Where Buckley’s performance as Shakespeare’s wife, grieving the death of their young son, is studied and self-consciously elemental, Hudson’s work in Song Sung Blue has an undemonstrative fluidity. It feels like life, rather than acting.Nomination or not, she has plenty to keep her busy, including Sibling Revelry, the family-dynamics podcast she co-hosts with her brother Oliver. Guests have ranged from A-list (Michelle Obama and the occasional Kardashian) to niche, such as the “psychic medium” John Edward. He was credulously indulged across two hour-long episodes, egged on by Hawn, who is no stranger to psychics; and Oliver, a garrulous sometime actor who claims to consult oracles before choosing whether to accept a role. Let’s just say this doesn’t reflect well on the oracles.View image in fullscreen‘Just do great work’ … Hudson and Hugh Jackman in Song Sung Blue.Photograph: Focus FeaturesHudson is not quite so woo-woo. “Psychic readings are fun,” she says. “But I take them with a grain of salt.” On a recent episode, the siblings were diagnosed with ADHD live on air by a doctor who didn’t seem entirely sure who he was speaking to; at one point, he mistook Oliver for Hudson’s partner. Was it an official diagnosis? “Oh yeah, it was real.” She says she found it “validating. I’ve spent for ever trying to figure out how to organise my life and now I feel I have the tools.” She distinguishes their diagnosis from what she calls the general ADHD of the world: “the kind that’s due to phones. What we have is the real deal.”Her next goal for the podcast is to quiz more directors. Turning the tables on me, she asks: “What kind of interviews do you like best?

It broke the record for highest-grossing documentary on Amazon’s Prime Video within 48 hours of its release, Deadlinereported this week.‘The public has been lied to’: secretly made documentary insists that aliens existRead moreBut not everyone is impressed by the film’s claims that UFOs – now called UAPs (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) – are real and that governments have been hiding evidence for decades. Several sceptics have gone online to push back at The Age of Disclosure, contending that it has been over-hyped and fails to present new or compelling evidence.In their telling, the documentary has slick production values but rehashes familiar, decades-old grainy infrared videos and anecdotal pilot testimonies insufficient to support extraordinary claims of alien technology.Michael Shermer,the founding publisher of Skeptic magazine, says by phone from Santa Barbara, California: “All we have are blurry photographs, grainy videos and anecdotes from people that say they know somebody who knows something, or they know somebody who said they saw the spaceship, touched the aliens or worked on back engineering the spaceships and so on.“But if you say, who was this person you talked to? ‘Well, I can’t tell you.’ Where was the spaceship? ‘I can’t tell you.’ Do you have any photographs? ‘No, but here’s this grainy video of this blob that was taken from a navy pilot 14 years ago off the coast of San Diego. This is kind of weird. It’s hard to say what it is but it could be aliens.’”Shermer, who for 30 years taught college and university courses in critical thinking and has written books including Why People Believe Weird Things, adds: “From a scientific point of view, none of this is valuable other than well, there might be something interesting here, let’s go find out. It’s no different from the whole search for Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Yeti, that whole thing.”Directed and produced by Dan Farah, The Age of Disclosure asserts an 80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligent life and secret recovery and reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial technology. It features interviews with 34 individuals from US government, military and intelligence backgrounds.They include secretary of state and national security adviser Marco Rubio, senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota and former director of national intelligence James Clapper. Their presence has been seen as giving the film heft and helping reduce the stigma long felt by alleged UAP witnesses.In an interview last week on Fox News, Rubio was asked about his claim in the documentary that unknown entities have been operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities. He did not attack the documentary or seek to disown his remarks – but he did seek to add some context.“First of all, I’m not disavowing that,” Rubio said. “It was an interview that was done almost, like, maybe three or four years ago when I was in the senate. So it wasn’t recent. The second point I would make, I was describing the allegations that people have come forward with … I was describing what people had said to me, not things that I had firsthand knowledge of in that regard. A little bit of selective editing, but it’s okay because you’re trying to sell a show there.”Sceptics argue that UAP sightings are better explained by a combination of misidentification of mundane objects (balloons, satellites, drones), perceptual errors in low-information environments, secret terrestrial technologies and misunderstood optical and sensor phenomena.Jason Colavito, author of The Cult of Alien Gods: HP Lovecraft and Extraterrestrial Pop Culture, comments:“While I can’t possibly give a single explanation for UFOs, or categorically say that no UFO has ever been an alien spaceship, every UFO that has ever been identified has turned out to be a prosaic – either natural or human made – object, and there’s no reason to suspect that any of the objects seen in that movie are anything but that.”Colavito was left cold by The Age of Disclosure. “I found the film to basically be anAncient Aliensepisode with better lighting,” he says. “It was a rehash of material that has been used many times before. I thought that it was old stuff in a slick new package. A lot of the people that you saw interviewed have already appeared on Ancient Aliens, on NewsNation and on other platforms saying the same thing.“The only surprising thing was that they actually went into some of the more extreme and ridiculous pseudoscientific claims they make about how we can’t photograph UFOs clearly because they’re in a space time quantum bubble that distorts all the light around them so we can’t see them. That’s obviously an ex post facto explanation. These are things that people who are very smart have fooled themselves into thinking are true in order to justify a belief that they already came into the process holding.”Colavito notes that the film has had an extensive and expensive publicity campaign including a Hollywood-style premiere. He sees it as part of a sophisticated media campaign aimed at securing government funding for defence contractors and associated thinktanks.View image in fullscreenA still from The Age of Disclosure.Photograph: YouTube“One of the things that surprised me is how much of the film seemed to be an advertisement for investing in UFO-themed energy research. That’s where you have to look into the question of how many of the talking heads in that documentary have government ties, not just that they formerly worked in the government, but that they are currently profiting from the work that they’re doing promoting UFOs.“Luis Elizondo[an author and UAP disclosure activist who also serves as an executive producer on the film], for example, works for adefence contracting company, or at least did until recently, and many of the others also have current or former ties to defence contractors and other businesses and entities that make money from government contracts and government investment.”But for all the headlines and TV attention, Colavito doubts that the buzz will last. “It’s already fading from coverage,” he says. “This was the kind of thing that has a big publicity campaign leading up to it but then, once people begin to see the actual product, interest falls off rapidly because there is nothing new and nothing convincing in the film. There are a lot of stories but very few facts.”Joshua Semeter, director of Boston University’s Center for Space Physics, has only seen the trailer for The Age of Disclosure and was unimpressed. “I guess the word is disappointed to see that their primary evidence is all of these grainy infrared videos.” he says. “There’s a lot of money to be made by keeping things in the spooky category. That’s basically what’s going on here.”Semeter, who served on a Nasa team studying the origin of UAPs, believes that the film is unlikely to create a lasting cultural shift or mainstream acceptance of its claims. Instead it is the culmination of a recent period of heightened interest in UAPs.“We went through a UAP bubble over the past eight years and a lot of this evidence that’s being put forth by the aviators is very old evidence from the 2000s. We’re at the tail end. This production was an effort to grab the last little bits as we head out of the current UAP bubble.”Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsAlien lifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Turning her camera to the streets and taking us into artists’ studios, the film-maker captures the vibrant creative scene of the city. The turmoil of the protests against the 2019 Hong Kong extradition bill, along with the draconian laws that followed, hangs heavy over every frame. In the midst of political turbulence, art emerges as a powerful, transformative tool of collective resistance.In an engaging and personable voiceover, Young weaves in stories from her own life growing up in Hong Kong as a rebellious teenager. Surrounded by bankers and financiers, she yearned to follow the footsteps of her film-making idols, such as Spike Lee, in the west. Her youthful disenchantment only makes Hong Kong Mixtape more moving as a hybrid of autobiography and documentary. We are introduced to a multitalented group of artists, but Young herself is also rediscovering what makes Hong Kong unique and culturally diverse, where activism and creativity go hand in hand. Alongside skilfully graffitied slogans, public electronic displays offer protest songs, raps and skits. Elsewhere, dance troupes create choreography out of banned gestures.The flames of resistance are effectively snuffed out bythe passing of Hong Kong’s national security law in 2020, which led to the imprisonment of many opposition leaders and pro-democracy activists. With artists forced into silence or exile, protest art rapidly disappears from public view, destroyed and erased. Still, the film is not an elegy, but a message of hope; in the same way that Young has picked up her camera, Hong Kong artists around the globe continue to create, keeping the spirit of a movement alive.Hong Kong Mixtape is on True Story from 19 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsHong KongArtAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Then it flirts with taking on social stratification baggage as a beleaguered mother tries to climb up her 30-storey apartment block to escape the rising flood waters. But once it is revealed that An-na (Kim Da-mi) is a second-ranking science officer for an indispensable research project, the film becomes a different beast entirely – possibly something quite insidious.As the film gats under way, An-na’s swimming-obsessed six-year-old son Ja-in (Kwon Eun-seong) sees his dreams come true when water begins flooding their apartment. Along with everyone else, they begin pounding the stairs – before corporate security officer Hee-jo (Park Hae-soo) catches up with them and explains that an asteroid impact in Antarctica is causing catastrophic rains that will end civilisation. But a helicopter is en route to evacuate her and Ja-in, because she is one of the pioneering minds who have been at work in a secret UN lab that holds the key to humanity’s future.Hitting the rooftop – and then continuing further upwards – changes our view on everything, as the exact schema of her work is revealed and the film goes down a virtual rabbithole. Making this sci-fi swerve, Kim has clearly heavily imbibed from Edge of Tomorrow, Charlie Kaufman’s mental mazes and perhaps also – with mega-tsunamis gathering on the horizon and the presiding maudlin-apocalyptic tone – Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar.But Kim’s recursive narrative is not so much prepping us for the future of humanity as it is – as per itsNetflixOriginal ident – the future of entertainment. As An-Na “corrects” her initially selfish reactions to the people she encounters – a girl trapped in a lift, a woman in labour – the suggestion is that emotional responses to this relooping drama can be somehow calibrated. It feels like an apologia, complete with cut-and-paste disaster imagery, for algorithmic entertainment. The often brittle storytelling, especially the failure to designate a helpful antagonist, does suggest human fallibility is alive and well, though. Or perhaps this reluctance to condemn our optimised future means Kim is already complicit to the nth degree.The Great Flood is on Netflix from 19 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersScience fiction and fantasy filmsSouth KoreaNetflixAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Hitting the road with her one-legged doll Bella for company, Lek has only a strong moral compass to guide her to the new home she is promised by her mum’s ghost. A number of picaresque companions put it to the test, including a spoiled rich girl (Kathaya Chongprasith) desperate for a friend and a quack doctor (Adam Kaokept) hawking dodgy cure-alls.Spurrier’s love of the musical genre is plain to see – or, rather, resplendent, with the early rural scenes in particular bottling The Sound of Music’s ruddy glow. The choreography often has a quickstep visual snap, the standout number breaking out on the financial industry campus that is Lek’s introduction to the Bangkok rat race. With business hotshots cartwheeling in and out of a great clockwork cortege, it’s the one moment where The Christmas Dream touches on the abstraction and sophistication of golden-age musicals.Though lushly orchestrated, much of the music is too anodyne musically and lyrically. Rather than studding the drama at key moments, Spurrier douses the film with it, overcompensating for a weak storyline. Only at the beginning and end – with Lek’s mother’s death and when her spirits flag in Bangkok – is there substantial adversity to offset an overly straightforward and saccharine journey. The glimmers of mild class satire, when Lek has a stroke of good fortune that has greedy villagers crawling all over her, will hardly cut it for older audiences; young children might buy the general optimism, but the exotic setting can’t disguise the underlying blandness.The Christmas Dream is on Prime Video from 18 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmMusicalsThailandreviewsShareReuse this content"

On the contrary: in the first half of this Dickensian foul-up, much of the pleasure comes from watching the company spring-load a very familiar crop of gags ready to explode after the break.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Long-term Mischief watchers will guess, for example, that when a Maltesers box is dropped during rehearsals inside the model box for the Cornley Polytechnic Players’ AChristmasCarol, it will end up as a giant-sized component of the set. They will know that the rivalry between supercilious director Chris and bombastic actor Robert, fond of essaying the classics in the nude, will result in crazed feats of sabotage when the production gets under way. And they can be sure that dim-witted Dennis, who thinks he is auditioning for the role of “Frog Cratchit” after seeing the Muppets’ musical as research, will well and truly cook everyone’s goose.“We’re not muppets are we?” disparages Chris, before one blissfully silly routine after another proves otherwise. How to choose even a favourite ghost from all these mix-ups? There’s the inexhaustibly hilarious Henry Lewis, as Robert, playing the Ghost of Christmas Present wearing a giant gift-wrapped box. Or Nancy Zamit, as Annie, zanily gyrating – with limbs launched in all directions – in the role of the Ghost of Christmas Past. And when Trevor (Chris Leask) performs as the Ghost of Christmas Future – or the one who, ahem, hasn’t come yet – it’s a tricky piece of physical comedy done inside a 10ft tall costume. Some of Roberto Surace’s outfits are as outlandishly amusing as Libby Todd’s set designs.View image in fullscreenComedic harmony … Jonathan Sayer, Sasha Frost and Nancy Zamit in Christmas Carol Goes Wrong.Photograph: Mark SeniorAmong Mischief’s other old hands are Jonathan Sayer who returns as Dennis and co-writes, with Lewis and Henry Shields, a script that goes in different directions to their 2017 BBC TV comedy of the same name. Greg Tannahill is given a nice in-joke that his last leading role (in Peter Pan Goes Wrong, also done for TV and stage) has left him with such a fear of heights he needs to avoid the upper register when singing.

The creatures of Mossy Bottom have been put on stage by ‘edgy’ circus stars Circa – but the burlesque shearing had to goLyndsey WinshipMon 15 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTShare‘It’s a family drama,” says Yaron Lifschitz. “It’s kind of a minor key, gently comic version of the Oresteian trilogy. Without the dismemberment and murder and purple carpets.” Lifschitz is talking about his latest production forCirca, the acclaimed Australian contemporary circus group. Is it a Greek epic? A state-of-the-nation drama? A searing emotional journey? Nope, none of those. It’s a fun, family circus show based on that cheeky cartoon character Shaun the Sheep.You might not think the antics of an anthropomorphic flock of farm animals can be compared to Aeschylus, but Lifschitz sees characters bound together as family with different personalities, friends and enemies, having to work out how to live together. Shaun the Sheep has been a huge success since the character originated in Wallace & Gromit: A Close Shave in 1995. The stop-motion series launched in 2007 has been broadcast in more than 50 countries, and had multiple spin-offs including two feature films and another one in the pipeline.A scene where a sheep shears herself like a stripper was dialled back because it was too sexyStill, a kids’ cartoon is not obvious subject matter for Circa, who over the last 20 years have become known for highly skilled, atmospheric shows, a “stripped back and edgy” aesthetic, as Lifschitz puts it. They do awe-inspiring acrobatics with a classy choreographic sensibility – at this year’s Edinburgh festival, for example, they performed in Gluck’s opera Orpheus and Eurydice, to much acclaim.But when artistic director Lifschitz caught wind of the possibility of working with Shaun the Sheep creators Aardman Animations, something about it made sense. “We found we were like-minded spirits,” he says, over video call from Australia. “We’re people that are a bit left of centre. They’re from Bristol, we’re from Brisbane, and they both have a similar offbeat weirdness about them,” he says. “They were a little company that could, and did. And we’re a little company that could. And did.”Lifschitz has made shows for children before, an audience he thinks is not always well served. “I think a lot of theatre for children is frankly pretty bad,” he says. “It’s got a bow around it; it tells nice stories that end really beautifully and in no way reflect the real world.” You’re not going to find much tragedy in Shaun the Sheep, but Lifschitz loves the mischief and anarchy of it, the characterful flock at Mossy Bottom Farm, plus sheepdog Bitzer, and the antagonist gang of pigs, who get up to various high jinks, all the time pulling the wool over the farmer’s eyes. “It’s no different to Kafka in some ways: the absurdity and the rules of being in a society,” he says.Anyone who’s seen the cartoon will know that there’s a lot of physical humour in it already, the sheep balancing on each other’s shoulders, attempting daring escapes, catapulting one another over fences, that sort of thing. So there was plenty to work with. Lifschitz and his team got deeply into the animated series. He shows me a spreadsheet with every episode listed, hundreds of them, and good jokes and scenarios pulled out. They have turned that into a full-length show, the first half like a series of episodes, the second a more full-blown circus performance. It uses some clips from the TV series, alongside impressive tumbling, juggling and aerial skills. In the 80-minute show, the mood is a bit dreamier than a tight seven-minute episode, but it has plenty of gags.Making this show was the first time Circa had dealt with the licensing and IP of a well-known brand, and all the specifications that go with it. An example: each sheep character has their distinctively googly eyes on the headpiece of their costume. “There are 48 eyes, and each one of them gets individually approved for size and position of the pupil,” says Lifschitz. “Which is brilliant, you know, because they care about their work.” But it did mean there were some “robust” conversations, he says. (A scene where a sheep shears herself like a stripper was dialled back because it was too sexy.) Aardman care about rigour in their storytelling, which Lifschitz admits, “is not really my thing”. Lifschitz’s work is generally more abstract. “I think circus can get away with a lot of looseness, because the show is pretty exciting as a default setting,” he says.He’s tackled narrative before, but found himself watching things in “double focus”. “I was trying to convince myself that I believed this was about Peter Pan, or climate change or whatever, as I was watching someone do something skilful and cool, and I thought, ‘Couldn’t we just build our art from “skilful and cool”?’ I had this kind of Heideggerian phenomenological experience,” he says. “I just want the actual experience, the feeling of this thing, not what it’s ‘about’.”On this show, however, Lifschitz appreciated how exacting Aardman were about the art of storytelling. “They were punctilious in how things were set up and explained in a way I didn’t need,” he says. “But it was a really good lesson for me that dramaturgical rigour can be a good thing.” So there you go: Greek drama, Kafka and rigorous dramaturgy. And you thought it was just a funny cartoon about a clever young sheep.Shaun the Sheep’s Circus Show is at Aviva Studios, Manchester, until 4 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsStageCircusCircaDanceTheatreChildren's theatreChristmas showsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Chance decreed that in a Halifax bookshop Britten would buy a copy of Gerald Bullett’s collection, The English Galaxy of Shorter Poems, the mystical and evocative aura of some of the earliest texts immediately inspiring him – unfazed by U-boat activity – to set them to harp accompaniment. This element of serendipity in the emergence of A Ceremony of Carols, with its iconic evoking of medieval sensibilities and faith, perhaps helps define its enduring appeal.Using the arrangement for mixed choir by composer/conductor Julius Harrison, the Britten was the focus of theCardiff Polyphonic Choir’s Christmas celebration, under their conductor Thomas Blunt. Clearly, this was not the bright sheen of boys’ voices with which we’re more familiar, but the atmosphere and dramatic flow of the 11 movements was there, from the sopranos’ opening plainchant to the fading Alleluia in the final Recession. In the central carol, This Little Babe, the words of the 16th-century Catholic martyr Robert Southwell depict the Christ child as an angel come to avenge Satan: Blunt set a pace that allowed the fast, furious, rhythms to realise a wonderful momentum, the voices’ tight imitations then building tension towards the emphatic climax. The energy of this, together with the penultimate Deo Gracias, captured well the contrast with the radiant, lilting beauty of There Is No Rose and Balulalow, Elen Hydref’s harp playing always expressive.The earlier part of the Polyphonic’s delightful programme had featured different composing traditions, given threads of connection through the repetition of key texts and the Alleluia refrains. Mendelssohn’s eight-part Advent and Christmas motets were paired with Gottfried Wolters’s setting of the pilgrimage song Maria durch ein Dornwald ging, where, as the Virgin Mary walks through a forest, thorn-trees blossom in her honour. The contemporary Hodie Christus natus est by the Slovenian Gašper Jereb echoed the contemplative feel of carols by John Rutter and Judith Weir.Works by Welsh composers Alun Hoddinott and William Mathias, commissioned by the Polyphonic early in its six-decade history, were revisited here, the dancing gaiety of Mathias’s Sir Christèmas with Philip Aspden’s lively organ accompaniment ending appropriately with Nowell, Nowell, Nowell! delivered as shouts of joy.Explore more on these topicsChoral musicClassical musicBenjamin BrittenreviewsShareReuse this content"

My family, bar one sweet-toothed aunt, avoids dried fruit-based offerings, so classic Christmas cakes and puddings are a hard no. Over the years, I have tried variations on yule logs, pavlovas and sherry trifles, but the biggest crowdpleaser is easily sticky toffee pudding (or something along those lines). This year, I’m making this warming, simple but decadent pear, sticky ginger and pecan pudding, which feels festive and fancy, and can happily make an appearance whenever.Pear, sticky ginger and pecan puddingThis can be made the day before and reheated before serving. Feel free to serve it with your favourite brandy butter or cream for maximum festiveness.Prep10 minCook1 hrServes8-102 pears(about 275g)185g room-temperature unsalted butter375g light muscovado sugar3 large eggs2 tbsp honey225g self-raising flour75g ground almonds1 tsp baking powder1 tsp mixed spice½ tsp fine sea salt150ml whole milk4 ballsstem ginger, finely chopped50g pecans, roughly chopped300ml double cream1 tsp vanilla extractFlaky sea salt(optional)Creme fraiche or vanilla ice-cream, to serveHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and grease a 30cm x 20cm roasting tin. Peel the pears, cut them into quarters, and remove and discard the cores. Finely chop the fruit into 1cm pieces.In a large bowl or free-standing mixer, beat 110g butter with 200g sugar for two minutes, until pale and creamy, then beat in the eggs and honey.In a second bowl, mix the self-raising flour, ground almonds, baking powder, mixed spice and fine sea salt, then fold this and the milk into the butter mix. Fold in the chopped pears and stem ginger, then pour into the greased tin. Scatter the pecans over the top, then bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a skewer inserted comes out clean. Remove and leave to cool slightly.Meanwhile, put the remaining 75g butter in a small saucepan with the remaining 175g sugar, the double cream and vanilla. Bring to a boil over a medium heat, leave to simmer for a few minutes, then take off the heat and stir in a pinch of flaky sea salt, if you like.I like to serve squares of the warm cake drenched in the hot caramel sauce with a spoonful of something cold and creamy to cut through, ideally creme fraiche or a good vanilla ice-cream.Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkDessertFoodFruitChristmasCakeNuts and seedsrecipesShareReuse this content"
