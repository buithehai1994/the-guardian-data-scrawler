Here, one of the last writers to interview them reopens his filesStephen WalkerSun 22 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTShare‘It was a beautiful morning. The sun was shining on the buildings. Everything down there was bright – very, very bright. You could see the city from 50 miles away, the rivers bisecting it, the aiming point. It was clear as a bell. It was perfect. The perfect mission.”I’m sitting in a Chinese restaurant in San Francisco opposite the navigator of the Enola Gay, the B-29 bomber that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945. The year is 2004, and Theodore “Dutch” Van Kirk, aged 83, has agreed to be interviewed for a book I’m writing for the 60th anniversary of that fateful mission. Van Kirk informs me, with the trace of a smile, that this will probably be the last interview in his life.We have spent the afternoon looking through wartime logbooks from his 58 overseas combat missions. Now, between servings of dim sum, he is telling me about the 59th, the one that wiped out a city, along with well over 100,000 people.“The instant the bomb left the bomb bay, we screamed into a steep diving turn to escape the shockwave. There were two – the first, like a very, very, very close burst of flak. Then we turned back to see Hiroshima. But you couldn’t see it. It was covered in smoke, dust, debris. And coming out of it was that mushroom cloud.”View image in fullscreenThe crew of the B-29 bomber Enola Gay.

It was only three minutes since we’d dropped the bomb.”Van Kirk diedin 2014. In the years since we met, all the other crew members who flew on the missions to Hiroshima, and to Nagasaki three days later on 9 August, have also died. Meanwhile, the numbers ofhibakusha, those who survived the attacks, are rapidly dwindling. We are passing into a twilight of history. As we approach the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings, this biological fact seems disturbingly relevant. Twenty years ago, the world was a dangerous place. Today, it’s more so. More nations are developing nuclear weapons with few, if any, effective international controls. Tactical nuclear strikes have been explicitly threatened by Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. And, just in the last week, war has broken out in the Middle East over fears that Iran may be very close to having a bomb. In such times, perspective matters. The shocked testimony of those like Van Kirk needs to be heard. History has lessons to teach us.It was this thought that prompted me to reopen my files, to reread the transcripts of interviews with some of the crew members of both attacks. Much of this material was untouched for two decades; nothing relating to the Nagasaki mission was published. Here were some of the last testimonies of those who did the unthinkable. They were in their 80s or 90s, nearing the end of their lives. How did they remember it?On 4 August 1945, Charles “Don” Albury, a 24-year-old B-29 pilot, was summoned to a secret briefing on Tinian, a Pacific island 1,500 miles south of Japan. Then the biggest bomber base in the world, Tinian was a jump-off point for a conveyor belt of the almost daily destruction of Japan. About300,000 peoplehad already died and 9 million werenow homeless.But Albury’s outfit had yet to take part in the attacks. Known as the 509th Composite Group, they occupied a secret compound on a far corner of the base. “Security was very, very tight,” Albury told me when I met him at his home in Orlando, Florida. Then aged 83, he grinned mischievously. “I remember one time the base commander got too near one of our planes. A guard nearly shot him.”Even the 509th’s crews knew nothing about their ultimate missions. And they had been training for almost a year. First in Utah, later on Tinian: “We kept dropping practice bombs and flying these crazy steep turns. We did it day after day. For months.” But nobody told them why, and few dared ask. Those who did could find themselves swiftly dispatched by their leader, Paul Tibbets, a battle-hardened bomber pilot, to hardship posts above the Arctic Circle. “You learned to keep your mouth shut,” said Albury.But in that 4 August briefing a part of the secret was about to be revealed.Nine days earlier, on 26 July, President Truman had delivered his ultimatum to Japan in thePotsdam declaration: either surrender unconditionally, or face “prompt and utter destruction”. The means of that destruction was not specified. And Japan had not surrendered.If I live for 100 years I will never get these few minutes out of my mindView image in fullscreenThe scene of devastation at Hiroshima, 1945.Photograph: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesIn the tropical heat of the briefing hut, Tibbets informed his crews that within 48 hours they would destroy a Japanese city with a single bomb unlike any in history, “and hopefully”, recalled Albury, “win the war”. The bomb, said Tibbets, had been tested in New Mexico on 16 July. Its blast was equivalent to the destructivepayload of2,000B-29s. The target would be one of three cities, in this order: Hiroshima, Kokura(now called Kitakyushu) or Nagasaki. The deciding factor would be the weather. On explicit orders from Washington, it had to be clear for the drop.“Nobody and nothing moved in that room,” said Albury. “We were just stunned.” Tibbets then introduced a quiet, balding naval captain, William “Deak” Parsons, who would join the mission. Parsons had witnessed the New Mexico test. He told the men that the explosion would be the hottest and brightest thing since the creation. He warned them to wear welders’ goggles because its light would be dazzling enough to blind them. But he didn’t warn them that the bomb was radioactive. “Nobody,” said Van Kirk, “told us this was going to be an atomic bomb.”Van Kirk remembered Tibbets making a final announcement. “He said anybody who isn’t comfortable with this and doesn’t want to go, doesn’t have to go.” Nobody spoke. “This was going to be a day history would remember,” Albury recalled. He had left a wife and baby daughter in America. If this bomb was successful, the war might be over. Then he could go home.By midnight the following night, they were ready.One of the men who would be flying was Morris Jeppson, a 23-year-old electronics specialist recruited by the atomic scientists at Los Alamos to work on the bomb’s revolutionary fusing system. For two weeks in 1944 the FBI interrogated everybody in Jeppson’s life before he found himself sharing a plane ride with Los Alamos’s director, J Robert Oppenheimer, “a real gentleman who talked nuclear physics with me but never talked weapons”. Sitting in his Las Vegas kitchen, Jeppson, then 82, chuckled at the memory. “Perhaps he was checking me out.”If so, he passed the test. He and Parsons would monitor the electronic wizardry of the bomb – nicknamed “Little Boy” – all the way to the drop.View image in fullscreenThe ‘Little Boy’ bomb at Tinian island before being loaded on to Enola Gay.Photograph: PhotoQuest/Getty ImagesThey would also have to arm it in flight, an exceptionally delicate job that should really have been carried out on the ground. But both men had recently watched too many heavily overloaded B-29s crashing on take-off. “We saw them burning on the runway,” said Jeppson, “and we saw it often.”Harold Agnew, a brilliant 24-year-old Los Alamos physicist who would be flying in an accompanying B-29 filled with blast‑measuring instruments, had also seen those crashes. If this happened with Little Boy, the consequences could be horrific.“That bomb was completely unsafe,” Agnew, then 83, told me when we met at his San Diego home. And he would know. In 1942, as part of a secret team working in Chicago under the Nobel-prizewinning scientist Enrico Fermi, he had witnessed the world’s first controlled nuclear chain reaction. “If they’d crashed, anything could have happened.” Parsons would need to be able to improvise, fast. In the hours before take-off, he and Jeppson began practising how to arm an atomic bomb in flight. Over and over, the two men ran over the checklist, leaving nothing to chance.Out on the hardstand, the bomb-carrying B-29, now sporting the name of Tibbets’ mother, Enola Gay, was bathed in floodlights. “That was our first surprise,” said Van Kirk. “The plane was all lit up and there were all these people – photographers, newspapermen – everywhere. It looked like a Hollywood premiere.”The analogy is eerily accurate. Back in May, before it was certain an atom bomb would even work, a secret target committee had stressed the importance of making its “initial use sufficiently spectacular … when publicity on it is released”. What mattered was “obtaining the greatest psychological effect against Japan”. But to Van Kirk, “all the photos and questions from reporters felt like breakfast for the condemned man”. He was relieved thatTom Ferebee, Enola Gay’s bombardier, had earlier cleaned out all the underwear and silk stockings the crew had stashed inside the plane as good luck charms.At last the surreal scrum was over. At 2.45am Enola Gay, along with Agnew’s plane The Great Artiste,co-piloted byAlbury and carrying blast instruments, and a third camera plane later dubbed Necessary Evil, took off from Tinian’s North Field runways, lined with fire trucks in case of the worst. “I really did have faith in Paul [Tibbets],” said Van Kirk. “I knew we were grossly overloaded. But he got us off – just a few hundred feet from the end of the runway.”Under a moonless sky, the strike force struck north over the Pacific. Tibbets lit his pipe. One hour ahead, three reconnaissance aircraft also flew towards the three possible targets. In keeping with Washington’s orders, their task would be to radio back how much cloud there was over the aiming points. Ultimately the weather would choose which city was obliterated – and which spared.View image in fullscreenThe atomic blast rising over Hiroshima, 6 August 1945.Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesFifty miles out of Tinian, Parsons and Jeppson clambered into Enola Gay’s bomb bay to begin arming Little Boy. “Parsons knelt by the bomb with a wrench. I held a flashlight,” said Jeppson. The work was fiddly and dangerous. Part of the procedure involved inserting four bags of cordite – a form of gunpowder – into the bomb’s breech plug. “That worried me more than anything,” said Van Kirk. “Loading all that damn gunpowder while we were on the aeroplane, for Chrissake.” In 15 minutes the checklist was completed. But there was still one final step before the bomb was fully armed. That would come later.Enola Gay sped through the night into a golden dawn.“That morning the sunrise was the most beautiful I’d ever seen,” Van Kirk remembered. He plotted a course to Iwo Jima, an island that had seen appalling battles in early 1945. Now it was the rendezvous point for the three planes. “My biggest fear was: don’t screw this up,” said Van Kirk. But his calculations were spot on. Iwo emerged dead ahead, along with The Great Artiste and Necessary Evil.An hour and 20 minutes from the Japanese coast, Jeppson – now by himself – climbed back into the bomb bay, to replace Little Boy’s three green safety plugs with three red arming plugs. He double-checked the red plugs were correctly set, gave the third one a final twist – “That was a moment,” he remembered – and left. He was the last person to touch or see the bomb. Enola Gay’s co-pilot, Bob Lewis, pencilled inhis log: “The bomb is now live. It’s a funny feeling knowing it’s in back of you. Knock wood.”But on which city would it be dropped? The answer soon came from the weather planes ahead, radioed in code. Conditions were excellent over the primary target. Tibbets switched on the intercom: “It’s Hiroshima.”“Everybody was getting excited,” recalled Van Kirk. “I could see the city out the window. We all formally identified it.” Ahead was the point from which Enola Gaywould begin its bomb run. “By this time it was a game for me. I was trying to hit that initial point exactly at nine o’clock.” Van Kirk smiled. “I’m a punctual person. When I say I’m going to pick my daughter up at five o’clock, that’s when I pick her up.”He was punctual now. On cue, Enola Gay swung towards a striking T-shaped bridge that Tibbets later described as “the most perfect aiming point in the whole damn war”. Ferebee hunched over his bombsight. Unlike almost every other city inJapan, this one, with a population of about 350,000, had almost never been bombed. It had been preserved instead for atomic obliteration. It satisfied every requirement: it had a sufficient military presence to claim it as a valid military target. It had hills on three sides that would concentrate the blast, creating even greater damage. And, as it had been kept intact, it would demonstrate with brutal clarity to the Japanese what an atom bomb could do to a city.It was impossible to imagine that something so inconsequential and light – approximately 6kg – could erase a cityFifteen seconds before the drop, Ferebee flicked a switch. A warning tone sounded across the airwaves. Agnew heard it on The Great Artiste. “We were flying right beside the bomb plane when the tone went. We opened our bomb bay doors, ready to drop our blast-measuring instruments.” His pilot Albury stared down at the city. “We could see everything, the bridge, everything. It was a sunny, beautiful day.” Then the tone stopped and Little Boy tumbled out.“Tibbets went hard into that steep turn,” said Van Kirk. “Engines going full blast. I started timing.” Oppenheimer had told Tibbets that the shockwave could crush their plane like a giant hand swatting an ant. There were 43 seconds before Little Boy exploded. “Everybody was counting,” continued Van Kirk. “Everybody was waiting for that bomb to go off because there was a real possibility it was going to be a dud.” Jeppson counted in his head – too quickly. “I had a moment of panic. I thought: it’s a dud. And then, within two seconds, there was this flash.”Van Kirk was wearing his goggles, but still “it was like a photographer’s flash going off in your face”. “The whole plane lit up with a white light,” said Agnew. “I scribbled a note: ‘Boy, this thing just went off, it really did.’” On Enola Gay, the tail gunner, George “Bob” Caron, screamed a warning as the shockwave tore up towards them. “And then, whang!” continued Agnew. “We got whacked. And then a few seconds later we got whacked again.” “The whole plane suddenly bounced hard, twice,” said Jeppson. For a horrified instant he thought the shockwave might smash through Enola Gay’s hull.View image in fullscreenHarold Agnew holds the plutonium core of the ‘Fat Man’ bomb dropped on Nagasaki.Photograph: wikicommons“Then,” he said, “we headed to the windows. I watched this churning on the ground. And this cloud started building up, rising, rising, rising. It was awesome.”From his navigator’s window, Van Kirk also stared in amazement. “It was already up to, oh God, 25,000ft and going up rapidly. Anything and everything had been kicked up by that bomb.” The sunlit city he had been looking at moments before was now a huge cauldron of boiling black tar. In The Great Artiste, Albury gazed, transfixed. “We watched that cloud rise. It had every colour of the world up there, beautiful colours. To me it looked like salmon colours, blues, greens.”Behind him, Agnew’s oscilloscopes measured the size of the blast – theequivalent ofabout 13,500 tonnes of high explosive, four times the tonnage thathad wiped out Dresdenin February 1945. He grabbed a 16mm cine camera he had smuggled into the bomber before takeoff. He began filming, his hands shaking. “The city wasn’t there. There was just nothing there. That dust cloud covered the whole city.” He didn’t know it yet, but Necessary Evil’s official cameras would all fail. Agnew’s illicit camera would yield the onlymovie footageof the Hiroshima bomb.“My God, what have we done?” wrote Enola Gay’sco-pilot Lewis in his logbook. “If I live for 100 years I will never get these few minutes out of my mind.” Then Tibbets spoke to the crew. “Fellows,” he said, “you have just dropped the first atomic bomb in history.”“You just can’t imagine something that big,” said Van Kirk. “We couldn’t see how the Japanese could continue the war. Nobody said anything about the people on the ground. That wasn’t mentioned at all.”View image in fullscreenPilot Paul Tibbets receives a medal moments after landing the Enola Gay after the Hiroshima mission.Photograph: George E Staley. Courtesy of Stephen WalkerThe same theme rippled across all three crews. “To me it was a great relief – that it worked,” said Jeppson. “I was happy. I thought I’d be going home.” “Did I think the war was over?” asked Albury. “I was hoping it was. I knew Hiroshima wasn’t there any more anyway.” But the mushroom cloud was. They could still see it, even when they were 400 miles away.Enola Gay landed back at Tinian to a heroes’ welcome. Hundreds were cheering as they taxied in. “We got out of the plane,” said Van Kirk, “and there were more generals than I’d ever seen in my life. We wondered what the hell they were doing there.” They soon found out. Barely had Tibbets stepped from his B-29 before the Distinguished Service Cross was pinned to his chest. It was so unexpected that he was still holding his pipe.Most of the exhausted crew went to bed. Jeppson went drinking with friends. “I remember one of them asked: ‘So what did you do today?’ And I said: ‘Well, we ended the war.’ They thought I was pulling their leg.”But the war didn’t end. And three days later, on 9 August, the atomic squadron did it all over again.Hiroshima, Van Kirk told me, was “the perfect mission” where everything went right. But the next one would be “screwed up”, the mission where almost everything would go wrong. Frederick Ashworth went on it. When I interviewed him in Santa Fe he was 92, a long-retired vice-admiral, but in August 1945 he was a young atomic weaponeer who would fill Parsons’ role, babysitting the bomb to the target.The primary target wasn’t Nagasaki. It was Kokura, 100 miles further north and home to one of Japan’s largest military arsenals. With Hiroshima devastated, this number two city had now moved up to the top slot; Nagasaki was the backup, in case Kokura was socked in.“Originally the second bomb was intended to be dropped on 11 August – five days after Hiroshima,” said Ashworth. A lean, spare man, he spoke quietly with great precision.“But a typhoon was coming in. So we had this window. And the thinking was: we hit them, bang, with the second one, right off the bat.”The bang would come from a different kind of bomb. Unlike Little Boy, “Fat Man” was far more sophisticated, utilising plutonium, rather than enriched uranium. “I actually carried the plutonium core in its funny little case,” Agnew told me. “I wanted to see what it felt like. And I wanted my picture taken.” He dug out the photo for me. Grinning for the camera, he holds the small case in his left hand. It was impossible to imagine that something so inconsequential and light – approximately 6kg – could erase a city.Agnew wouldn’t be flying this time. But at midnight on 8 August, two days after Hiroshima, Albury found himself once again in the briefing room alongside his aircraft commander, Charles “Chuck” Sweeney. Tonight he would be co-piloting Bockscar, the plane carrying the bomb. “It was tense,” he told me. “I hadn’t been sleeping too much. I just lay on my bed. I’d written to my wife, telling her I loved her. I just wanted to get on with this mission and get home.”The briefing was short. Conditions at Kokura were forecast clear, but, because of major thunderstorms en route, Bockscar would rendezvous with the instrument and camera planes over Yakushima, an island south of Japan. “Tibbets reminded us we were under strict orders from Washington to bomb visually,” recalled Ashworth. “Under no circumstances were we to bomb otherwise.” Then they went out to the ramp.“And that’s when we had the first problem,” said Albury. A fuel transfer pump had broken, meaning there were 600 gallons of fuel on board they couldn’t use. Normally they wouldn’t need it, but ahead were those storms. Tibbets called a rapid conference. The stakes were tremendous. With their short weather window, any delay might affect the outcome of the war. “He said: ‘Chuck, it’s up to you. You’re commander of the aeroplane.’ And Chuck said: ‘To hell with it, we’ve never used that fuel before: it’s just ballast. I think we should go.’”At nearly 4am and running late, Bockscar gunned down Tinian’s wet runway, once again lined end to end with fire trucks in case of a catastrophic crash. Thirteen minutes after takeoff, Ashworth’s assistant, Philip Barnes, climbed into the bomb bay to replace the green safety plugs with the red plugs. With Fat Man now fully armed, the plane ran headlong into the first of the thunderstorms.“It was bumpy,” said Albury. “We flew into some pretty big clouds and we saw typhoons go by.” Back near the bomb bay, Ashworth and Barnes watched their bomb control panel like hawks, monitoring Fat Man’s warning lights as lightning stabbed the night skies. “Then this white light suddenly came on,” said Ashworth. “That’s what you see when you’re about to drop the bomb.”View image in fullscreenBob Caron with a newspaper headlining the Hiroshima attack.Photograph: National Archives and Records Administration (Nara). Courtesy of Stephen WalkerThere was a silence as I took this in. Did he think the bomb might go off?“Absolutely. Sure. That was precisely what was concerning us.” His next sentence was a masterpiece of understatement. “I told Sweeney we were having problems and we were working on it.”Barnes saved the day, coolly tracing the fault to a misplaced switch. The mission continued into a storm‑tossed dawn. But when Bockscar joined up with the instrument plane over Yakushima, the third camera plane – captained by James Hopkins – wasn’t there. “Everybody was looking out the window,” said Albury. “We were circling all the time but we couldn’t see him.” They kept circling. What nobody knew was that Hopkins was 10,000ft too high. “Fifteen minutes goes by, then another 15 minutes,” said Ashworth. They were using up valuable fuel. “I said to Sweeney: let’s get out of here. We’ve got to get on with the mission.”“We were pretty late by now,” said Albury, “maybe a couple of hours late when we got to Kokura.” The bombardier, Kermit Beahan, started the bomb run. But the winds had changed direction. Thick smoke from a raid on nearby Yahata the previous night was blanketing Kokura. In an appalling irony, American bombs were preventing the use of the atom bomb. “Kermit said: ‘I can’t find the aiming point!’” Albury continued. “We made a second try and it was  still the same thing. Now our engineer started talking about fuel.”They tried a third run from a different direction. That failed, too. Flak was bursting below. Each bomb run was taking 20 minutes and tempers were mounting.I will not say I was guilty. Under the same conditions I’d do it again, because I honestly believe it saved a lot of livesSweeney and Ashworth argued about what to do, finally agreeing to divert. Kokura had been saved by an accident of the weather. Now it was Nagasaki’s turn to be attacked.But when they got there, the city was covered in cloud. “Wehadto get rid of that bomb,” said Ashworth. With their critically low fuel, they might now not make it to base – which would mean ditching in the sea. Their options were stark: ditch with the atom bomb; jettison it over the ocean; or break direct orders and drop it on Nagasaki through cloud with their primitive radar. They had just minutes to decide.“By now everybody’s talking back and forth,” said Albury. “There was too much tension.” Then Beahan began the final bomb run. “There was no other choice,” said Ashworth. “We hadto get that bomb on Nagasaki. But bombing by radar is notoriously inaccurate.” With seconds to spare, Beahan suddenly spotted a stadium he recognised through a cloud gap. Moments later, he yelled, “Bombs away” – then corrected himself: “Bomb away”. “Thank God,” thought Albury as Sweeney threw Bockscar into the rollercoaster turn.“But we didn’t know where the hell that bomb had gone off,” Ashworth said.In fact, in one of the most bizarre coincidences of the war, Fat Man had detonated almost directly over the factory that once made the torpedoes used in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It killed almost 40,000 peopleinstantly. At least another 40,000 would die later from injuries and radiation sickness.View image in fullscreenPilot Paul Tibbets and bombardier Tom Ferebee reunited in the Enola Gay cockpit in 1981.Photograph: Ben Martin/Getty ImagesThis was Albury’s second atomic explosion in three days. The same Technicolor images pepper his interview, the same “greens, blues, pinks” of the mushroom cloud, “every colour of the rainbow, always changing and moving up pretty fast. I was just thinking: thank God we dropped it safely.” The jarring adverb hung between us. How do you drop an atom bomb safely?But Ashworth was seeing it for the first time.“This was new to me … It was like nothing you ever saw.” His language became suddenly reluctant as I pressed him further. “I try to keep a relatively neutral reaction to these things – it’s a personal psychological reaction. This is the job I’m here for, this is what I’m supposed to be doing. I don’t have time to reflect: should I be worried about those guys down on the ground?”He didn’t, perhaps couldn’t, answer his own question.Bockscar barely made it back, landing unannouncedat Okinawa, the closest American airbase, with a minute’s fuel left in the tanks. There were no crowds to greet them, no generals to pin medals on their chests. Nobody even knew they were coming.There also was no official investigation into their breach of orders. In the end, accuracy was irrelevant. The bomb had done its job. And six days later, on 15 August, battered by both nuclear attacks, as well as a crushing Soviet invasion of Japanese-occupied Manchuria, Japan finally surrendered.About 200,000 people ultimately died from the two bombings, and possibly many more. The exact figures will never be known. Eighty years afterwards, arguments still rage about whether these annihilations were justified, avoidable or saved more lives than they ended. But what did the crews themselves believe?“I will not say I was guilty. I will not apologise for it,” Van Kirk told me. “In fact, under the same conditions I’d do it again, because I truly, honestly believe it saved a lot of lives.” Most of his crewmates clung to this mantra with the same granite faith. Ashworth, who died in 2005 aged 93, always remained proud of his participation in what he called “a major contribution to the war”. Agnew, who later became a director of Los Alamos, held the same view until his death in 2013 at 92. “We had to drop it,” he explained. “The Japanese began this war. If there hadn’t been a Pearl Harbor, Hiroshima would never have happened.” Tibbets went several leagues further. In 1976 he caused an international incident when hesimulated the nuclear attack,flying a B-29 in a Texas airshow, complete with a mushroom-shaped explosion. He said he’d “never lost a night’s sleep over the fact that I commanded the bombing”.View image in fullscreenNavigator Theodore ‘Dutch’ Van Kirk.Photograph: Getty ImagesBut there are occasional peepholes into troubled consciences. “You don’t brag about wiping out 60‑70,000,”admitted Robert Shumard, a flight engineer on Enola Gay, who died in 1967. And Caron, its tail gunner, confessed to “a partial feeling of guilt” when he saw photos of burned children from Hiroshima. “I wish I hadn’t seen them,” he added. Jeppson, who died in 2010, once suggested the bomb might have been demonstrated “without the need for destroying a city”. He personally wrote to me of his “sorrow” at Hiroshima’s “great tragedy”.And then there was this unexpected postscript.At the end of our interview, Albury told me how he had returned to Nagasaki – barely three weeks after bombing it. Tibbets haddecided to fly to Japanwith some of his team on the strangest of sightseeing trips. They wanted to visit Hiroshima but the airfield there was badly damaged, so they landed at Nagasaki instead. Van Kirk was also on that trip. “We arrived two or three days before any American troops,” Van Kirk told me. “There were maybe 20 Americans in the whole city. Nobody knew who we were. We didn’t put a sign on ourselves. It was eerie. Very eerie.”They drove into the city. “There’s all this damage you see from just one bomb. I was amazed,” said Van Kirk. “It scares the hell out of you.”“We took pictures,” said Albury. “The people didn’t look very happy, I can tell you.” In the ruins, he saw “a shadow on the wall, where somebody was probably walking by when the bomb went off”. There was no trace of the body. The thousands-of-degrees heat from the bomb had simply vaporised it. Then, in a hospital, he saw the dead and dying, “some of the people laying out on the ground outside. It was the only place I saw bodies. They were treating some of the people on the lower floors.”He suddenly stopped. “It was devastation,” he said finally. “I can’t go back there. I don’t dwell on this too much. It’s been almost 60 years.” There was a long silence. We ended the interview there and I thanked him. But it seemed his mind was still in that hospital.Then he said, very quietly: “Never again.”Shockwave: Countdown to HiroshimabyStephen Walkeris published by William Collins.stephenwalkerbeyond.comExplore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsSecond world warHistory booksJapanUS militaryWeapons technologyAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Activists spray-paint a plane. Guess which the UK government calls terrorismSally RooneyIf Palestine Action becomes a proscribed group, writing these words of support could become a serious offence. It’s vital we fight this alarming attack on free speechSun 22 Jun 2025 10.19 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 15.36 EDTShareOn 20 June, in what has now become an appallinglyfamiliarstory, Israeli forces once again opened fire on Palestinians at an aid distribution site, this timekilling 23 people. The same day, it was revealed that activists affiliated with the UK group Palestine Action hadbroken into an RAF baseand defaced two military aircraft in an act of protest. One of these actions involved the intentional use of lethal violence against civilians, resulting in the deaths of 23 loved and irreplaceable human beings. The other involved no violence against any living things and resulted in no deaths or injuries. The UK government has now announced its intention to deal with one of these incidents as a terrorist offence.Guess which.International organisations could hardly be more unanimous in their assessment that Israel is committing extremely grave war crimes in Gaza. In November last year, aUN special committeefound that Israel’s campaign in Gaza was consistent with the characteristics of genocide. In December, anAmnesty International investigationconcluded that Israel “has committed and is continuing to commit genocide”. Now, a series of unprovoked and illegal Israeli attacks on Iran have succeeded in drawing the USdirectly into war with Iran, in violation of US and international law. While massacres continue in Gaza, Israeli aggression threatens to ignite a major regional and perhaps even global conflict.Don’t believe the doubters: protest still has power | Jan-Werner MüllerRead moreAnd yet the UK continues to provide Israel with military intelligence, and British companies continue to sell lethal weapons to the Israeli state. In a poll conducted last year,56% of British voterssupported a complete embargo on arms sales to Israel. Across the UK,hundreds of thousands of peoplehave attended demonstrations mourning those lost to the conflict and demanding an end to the slaughter. But the government stubbornly persists in its support for Israel’s military campaign. Mass peaceful protest, even with majority support among the wider population, has yielded no results. In the face of state support for genocide, what are conscientious people supposed to do?The activists who broke into the RAF facility at Brize Norton knew, of course, that their actions were illegal. From the suffragettes to the gay rights movement to the anti-apartheid struggle, genuine political resistance has always involved intentional law-breaking. AsMartin Luther King Jr wrotefrom a Birmingham jail: “One has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.” And the provision of weapons to facilitate genocide is more than unjust: it is an abyss of moral horror. Those brave enough to break the law in protest – many of whom are alreadyserving time in prisonfor their actions – deserve our highest respect.But proscribing an entire organisation under the Terrorism Act is not the same thing as prosecuting particular individuals for specific transgressions. If the government follows through with its intention to designate Palestine Action as a terror organisation, mere membership of the group would constitute a crime. In fact, even supporting the group purely in words – as I am doing now – could also constitute a serious legal offence, punishable with a sentence of up to14 years in prison. Financial dealings with members and supporters may also be illegal, even if the individuals concerned have done nothing against the law other than belong to or express support for a protest movement.View image in fullscreenA Palestine Action activist approaches a military aircraft at RAF Brize Norton before spraying it with red paint, 20 June 2025.Photograph: Palestine Action/ReutersUnder UK law, the home secretary has broad discretion to proscribe any organisation “concerned in terrorism”. Until now, this process has only ever been used against militant groups either directly involved in or actively advocating violent armed struggle. But crucially, the act defines terrorism vaguely enough to include mere property damage and disruption of electronic systems – even in the total absence of a threat to human life or public safety. If the government proceeds down this path, any ordinary person in the UK could in theory be sent to prison simply for expressing verbal support for non-violent activism. Quite aside from the broader principle, this would represent an alarming curtailment of free speech.Palestine Action is not an armed group. It has never been responsible for any fatalities and does not pose any risk to the public. Its methods do involve property sabotage, which is, obviously, illegal. But if killing 23 civilians at an aid distribution site is not terrorism, how can we possibly be expected to accept that spray-painting a plane is? Law-abiding protest has so far failed to stop the genocide. More than50,000 innocent childrenhave been killed or injured. In what circumstances could civil disobedience ever be justified if not now?I can only say that I admire and support Palestine Action wholeheartedly – and I will continue to, whether that becomes a terrorist offence or not.Sally Rooney is an Irish writerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This is what I’ve learnedCharlie Brinkhurst-CuffSun 22 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTShareIsuspected I had polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) long before it was confirmed. The signs were there: the acne scars that littered my back, the irregular periods, the hair in places on my body that I didn’t see on many of my friends. I suspected it from the moment that one of my best friends, who as a girl taught me about bleaching my body hair and waxing my legs, was diagnosed with it as a teenager.Admitting all this publicly feels like an unburdening, but also an invitation to more shame. But I write this because my experience is far from unique. As many as one in 10 women have PCOS, a condition associated with hormonal disturbances that can range from weight gain, “unwanted” body hair and hair loss, to irregular periods and struggles to conceive children (including an increasedrisk of miscarriage). It can leave women more likely to develop high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and heart disease. It is not clear what causes PCOS, but it is known to be passed downgenerational linesand can be influenced by lifestyle.I was finally diagnosed with PCOS last year, at 30, and have been on a journey to understand what that means ever since. The thing that leaped out at me early on (and has since been uncoveredby the BBC) is just how much information, and misinformation, exists around the condition. My Instagram feed is filled with medically unqualified influencers. Sorting through all that to figure out which nutritionists and health professionals to pay attention to, in the absence of adequate support from the doctors and nurses who gave me that initial assessment and diagnosis, has been a battle.There are a lot of practitioners who are there for financial gain. The biggest challenge I have is the misinformationI’ve been encouraged to adopt unrealistic diets (so-called “PCOS nutritionists” often suggest cutting out gluten, dairy and carbohydrates, despite a lack of evidence to show this is sustainable or useful for the condition); take unregulated supplements that can have significant side-effects; and sign up to expensive health plans and apps. I’ve been told to stop doing cardio and focus instead on weights and walking, because of the misguided idea that high-intensity exercise will cause my cortisol levels to rise to the degree that it will worsen my symptoms. In reality, all types of exercise can be beneficial.Medical misogyny has been well documented, and women’s healthcare is rarely taken seriously. I first asked my GP about symptoms during the pandemic, when, after a blood test, I was told that my hormone levels were normal and I didn’t have the condition. Later, having an ultrasound for an unrelated matter, I was unceremoniously told that I had lots of follicles on my ovaries and probably had PCOS. When I mentioned the earlier blood test, the sonographer told me that this is not a good way to diagnose the condition, especially if you are using hormonal birth control.Confusingly, PCOS does not cause cysts on the ovaries. “They’re not actual true cysts,” says Helena Teede, an Australian endocrinologist and expert in PCOS at Monash University in Melbourne. “They’re follicles or eggs that are just developing along a pathway, but they stop developing normally because they don’t like the hormones that they’re floating around in.”There has long been chatter about renaming PCOS to something that is more representative of the breadth of symptoms it causes. The current name, Teede says, “completely misses the fact that this is a hormonal condition; that it has long-term impacts; that it is psychological, dermatological, metabolic, reproductive and, beyond fertility, it goes into many other reproductive features. And it really has an impact on quality of life.” She says it’s likely that the process to give it a new name will be completed this year – her organisation hasopened a surveyfor anyone who wants to contribute.View image in fullscreenPCOS can affect your blood pressure.Photograph: Posed by models; ZeynepKaya/Getty ImagesAnother myth is that women with the condition have a significant “excess” of testosterone. And PCOS does open up someinteresting questions about gender. But, says Teede, the idea that testosterone is an exclusively male hormone is false. Plus, women with PCOS do not typically have elevated levels of testosterone; it’s more that our bodies are not very good at dealing with it. We have much less of the hormone than most men.After my diagnosis at the ultrasound, I had a follow-up call with a nurse practitioner, where I was told simply that I should put up with my symptoms but come back when I wanted to get pregnant; because, of course, that is theonlything that young women aspire to. When I pushed, I wasoffered a drug named metformin, which is used to treat insulin resistance and diabetes.It wasn’t explained to me how this drug works and why it would be useful for my specific case. But, I have since learned, insulin resistance – when your body struggles to regulate your blood sugar levels – isone of the hallmark symptoms of PCOSand triggers a lot of the other issues that people with the condition face. Teede, however, points out that “every woman has a different problem and a different life stage that’s most important to them, and it’s about their interpretation”. Doctors should think holistically about treatment plans for women with PCOS and listen to their concerns.View image in fullscreenRachel Morman.My own contrasting experience, though, is much more common, says Rachel Morman, the chair of theUK PCOS charity Verity: “After 20 years of doing this work, I’m like: ‘Why is this still happening?’” She had a similar conversation with doctors after she was diagnosed in the early 00s, with the added shock of being told that she wouldn’t be able to have children at all. While it is true that about 70% of women with PCOS experience fertility struggles, after intervention that number drops significantly; the vast majority of women with the condition are able to get pregnant. Morman has three children now.It’s also important for women to know that a lot of the risks associated with PCOS in pregnancy (such as miscarriage, gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia) are preventable. Before they start trying for a baby, women with the condition should have a full diabetes test and get their blood pressure checked, as well as aim for a healthy diet and active lifestyle.But when doctors tell us that PCOS is something we should be concerned about only if we want to get pregnant, that is extremely frustrating, considering the wide range of effects it has on our bodies.Morman says that while there is a lot more information available now than when she was diagnosed, some treatment options have become worse: hair removal treatments used to be offered on the NHS for women diagnosed with PCOS, but not any more. As Teede acknowledges: “One of the reasons why people go to alternative sources of information is because they’re not satisfied with what they get from the health practitioners.”Misinformation about PCOS abounds, and much of it is repeated by medical professionals. To help counteract this, Teede helped to develop the extensively researchedinternational evidence-based guidelines for PCOSin 2023, which I now regard as the holy grail of information about the condition. Her team has also createdan app called AskPCOS, which can help women to find the right treatment pathways. It doesn’t cover everything, but it is thorough, uses up-to-date research and doesn’t make bold claims about “curing” PCOS, as some people do on social media.“There are a whole lot of individual practitioners, most of whom are not actually practitioners, who are there for financial gain,” says Teede. “The biggest challenge I have is the misinformation, and then associated with that, the harm that’s done by denigrating actual evidence-based strategies. Which, in the end, does a disservice for women with the condition.”She is not wholly against what she terms “complementary therapies” (ie supplements and diets), as long as women undertake them clear-eyed and unswayed by false claims. But she does not believe people will stop looking to these types of practitioners for support until there are more trustworthy medical repositories, alongside legal liability for people who provide misinformation.Having researched PCOS over the past year (though there’s still much to learn), here’s what I’ve tried: in terms of monitoring the metabolic symptoms, I’ve checked my blood pressure and had screenings for diabetes and high cholesterol. My levels were fine. I’ve come off my birth control (some types of pill can help with the symptoms of PCOS; this one didn’t) and started taking a well-researchedsupplement called myo-inositol, which may help with insulin resistance. But I’ve since come off it because it made me dizzy, a known side-effect for some people. I get periods most months, though I did so before I was put on the pill in my teens, so this may not have affected my ovulation.In terms of cosmetic treatments, I have moved away from laser hair removal, which can cause women with PCOS to experience paradoxical hypertrichosis – the regrowth of darker hairs, seemingly stimulated by the laser. Instead, I have begun electrolysis, the only way to permanently remove hairs. I’m on a break from it as the treatment has been slow and moderately painful, causing breakouts that take weeks to heal.Thankfully, the acne on my face has never been severe, but I have got topical treatment for it from an online dermatologist and benzoyl peroxide from my GP. My body acne has taken longer to get under control; I had a private online consultation with a dermatologist, which cost me £100, and have found reasonably priced skincare products that mostly work for me (shout out to Cerave).View image in fullscreenExercise – yes, even cardio – can benefit people with PCOS.Photograph: Posed by model; Drs Producoes/Getty ImagesThe reason I am sharing this is not so that others with PCOS can attempt to mirror my journey. Everyone is different. For example, some women arecomfortable with having visible facial hair. It is not inherently shameful and I hate that it is considered to be so. Instead, I am sharing because it shows how much time and energy I have had to put into dealing with PCOS. As it stands, all women with the condition need to go on a journey ofevidence-based self-education, because it is unlikely that their primary care doctors will be able to adequately direct them, and there are very few accessible specialists. We have to test out treatments and cosmetic procedures – many unregulated – for ourselves, working through trial and error.Perhaps one of the biggest learnings I’ve taken from this year has been around mental expenditure. While we undoubtedly have to demand better treatment from our doctors, and ask them to seek out research, those of us with chronic conditions have personal choices to make. Even in an ideal system, where I could be supported on and off medication with all the necessary tests, I would still have to make a judgment call about how much time and energy to invest in “managing” my PCOS.It is lifelong and incurable, and, for me at least, learning to live with it has become just as important as tackling some of the issues that it causes. That is not to say people with PCOS should give up – learn to embrace their facial hair or uncomfortable acne, or the more serious difficulties related to heart health or diabetes – but it does move it in my mind from a space of hopelessness to one of pragmatism. And it has allowed me to give myself a mental break.Male bias in medical trials risks women’s lives. But at least the data gap is finally being addressed | Caroline Criado PerezRead more“You do need to have at least four periods a year, because otherwise it’s a higher risk of getting cancer of the womb, for example,” says Teede. She says that people with PCOS must go for an annual checkup, including blood pressure tests. “But you don’t need to carry that around permanently,” she adds.The other brilliant news is that, in the background, things are changing. Anew study showsthat awareness of the syndrome has grown massively in the past eight years. In the UK, there is collaborative work happening to make sure that the syndrome becomes a research priority, including an all-party parliamentary group. “We’ll actually have proper pathways for PCOS treatment, so hopefully that should improve standard of care,” says Morman.For me, I had my foray into the land of misinformation and I battled my way out of it. I have sought out community with other women who have the condition, and I’m taking steps to mitigate its potential effect on my fertility in the future.Most of all, I feel incredibly thankful that I have been diagnosed in an era where there are women like Teede and Morman who are fighting for the recognition and evidence-based treatment of PCOS. We are not at a loss. We are at the bright beginning.Explore more on these topicsWomen's healthWomen (Life and style)Women (Society)Health & wellbeingReproductionHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The recent college graduate – an employee in the IT industry – is at a mandatory team dinner.“I end up working late almost every day,” laughs Lee. “By the end of the day, I feel completely drained, like I’ve used up all my energy [and] I can’t really do anything on weekdays after work.”She begins the workday at 9.30am and ends most days at 10pm, sometimes pushing to midnight. On a single workday, Lee receives about 200 messages. With constant meetings and collaborative work filling the day, evenings are often the only time Lee has to catch up on individual tasks.This is far from unusual, according to new research. Microsoft’s 2025 work trend indexreportfound that many workers are increasingly grappling with “infinite workdays”, which start before sunrise and stretch late into the night. They are interrupted by some 270 pinging notifications along the way, about one every two minutes.Working from home? It’s so much nicer if you’re a man | Emma BeddingtonRead moreMany young professionals are struggling with this new reality. “If I pushed myself [too] hard one day, I try to leave work early the next day to get some rest,” Lee said. “There’s usually this unspoken pressure not to work from home, even if it’s allowed, but I do it anyway because I have so much work, [so] commuting feels like a waste of time, and I am just exhausted.”This traditional work culture is disillusioning gen Z as 94% of the generation are prioritizing work-life balance over climbing the corporate ladder, according toresearchby Deloitte.Sal, a New York-based compensation specialist who declined to provide his full name for privacy reasons, believes his generation is facing new hurdles in the workplace such as rising mental health concerns, and stagnant wage increases in the face of inflating living costs.Despite these challenges, Sal, 24, said he is still expected to conform to an outdated working structure, putting in long hours without the payoff older generations had. “We’re graduating with a high amount of debt [from university] and then working a job that is burning us out, and it’s not even paying for this debt,” he said. “A lot of people my age are job hopping because they’re burnt out or cannot find longevity in their roles.”Sal’s first year in his current role led him to seek therapy because the workload seemed to be a “constant queue” and he felt perpetually anxious despite “being in a spot that is better than most people in my generation”. He was diagnosed with a general anxiety disorder.Even in South Korea, a country known for its notoriously long working hours, gen Z is rejecting this lifestyle.“Young people really value their free time after work, and prefer having enough rest, flexible work environmentsand more freedom,” said Lee. “The younger generation believes working overtime, too, often can sometimes be seen as a sign of poor time management, so people don’t think working long hours is always a good thing.”For some, long working hours are inevitable. Others are choosing to endure them temporarily, in the hope of buying back their time later.Jane, who also declined to disclose her surname, is working two full-time jobs with the goal of escaping corporate life in four years, when she turns 30. Based in Toronto, she splits her 70-hour workweek between a 9-to-5 marketing manager role and a 5-to-11 call service representative position. Both are remote.“My first 9 to 5 internship experience in university was so horrible that it made me very anti-career and anti-work, to the point where I wouldn’t do this until I was 65,” Jane said. “The older management clearly expected employees to make work their entire life.”In Jane’s previous marketing role with a different company, she drowned in infinite workdays which ultimately led her into a spiral of depression. The management team scheduled meetings off-the-clock, chastised employees who left on time, and expected workers to check messages 24/7, including on holidays like Christmas.“I would just be very anxious all the time, and I would lose sleep over it,” Jane explained. “I feel like getting sucked into work and over-obsessing while thinking that that’s your life is definitely the wrong approach.Work-life balanceis so important.”Jane experienced burnout numerous times since entering the workforce after college. However, she now sets firm working boundaries and communicates her bandwidth to her team. She refuses to work off-the-clock and prioritizes time with loved ones instead.“What I’ve realized is that the only way to fix burnout is to leave the company, because if the environment makes you stressed, you cannot fully mentally protect yourself,” Jane said. “I’m working to live, not living to work.”Explore more on these topicsWork-life balanceWork & careersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet immigrants are still fighting to be seen that wayDiane AbbottThis week’s Windrush Day reception at No 10 was joyous – but also a reminder of the ugliness behind the ‘island of strangers’ rhetoricSun 22 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 04.04 EDTShareThis week I went to a Windrush Day reception in the gardens of 10 Downing Street. Standing in the brilliant sunshine, with a steelband tinkling away in the background, it was great to see this generation ofCaribbeanmigrants finally being honoured as their bravery and enterprise deserves.The excited guests – Windrush-era Caribbean migrants, their friends and family – were thrilled to be at No 10, and the absolute highlight was being addressed by the prime minister, Keir Starmer. Fortunately on this occasion, he refrained from telling his guests that they were turning Britain into an “island of strangers”. In any case, it would have been nonsense.Nobody identified more strongly with Britain than that generation, many of whom had a picture of Queen Elizabeth II on their living-room wall. When the Empire Windrusharrived at Tilbury docks in Essex,its occupants did not see themselves as “immigrants”, but citizens of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth come to help rebuild the “mother country” after the war. Most of the passengers gave their last country of residence as the Caribbean, including Jamaica, Trinidad, St Lucia, Grenada and Barbados. Some had served in the British armed forces, but others had responded to the British government advertisements for workers.While it is good to see the contribution of migrants to Britain in the postwar period commemorated, it is possible to get too sentimental about the Windrush era and forget the brutality of the racism they faced when they disembarked from those ships. They had been so very proud to come, but Britain’s reception was cooler than they might have expected.One issue was employment. The Windrush era spanned from 1948 to the early 1970s, but the first Race Relations Act was not until 1965. So, in the early years of the Windrush era, employers could brazenly refuse to employ someone because they were black and not even pretend there was another reason. Accordingly, most Windrush migrants went into sectors hit by postwar labour shortages like transport or factory work.Windrush-era women often went into the NHS. It was not an easy way to make a living. Nurses, in particular, were often on permanent nights or put into grades where there was plenty of backbreaking work but no promotion. Instead, they had to train younger white nurses and watch them climb the ladder. Despite all that, they were hugely proud of their jobs. Some people nowadays like to talk about the pressure immigrants put on the public services. But my mother’s generation helped to build the NHS.View image in fullscreenJamaican immigrants are welcomed after the Empire Windrush docked at Tilbury in Essex, 22 June 1948.Photograph: PAAnother problem was housing. Windrush-era migrants owned their own homes to an extent that might seem remarkable now. But it was not because they earned a lot of money. They had little choice. Before the 1965 Race Relations Act, many councils simply would not let to black people. The private sector was even worse. A notorious slum landlord of the time was Peter Rachman, who would charge double or treble the normal rent. He specialised in Caribbean tenants because they could get so few mainstream landlords to rent to them.My father, like very many Caribbean migrants of the time, bought a house in what was then a shabby part of west London. He accumulated the deposit using an intra-communitysaving scheme called “pardner”. But he paid the mortgage by having a tenant or a family in every room. We ourselves were in one room in that house with a cooker on the landing. When my father bought his house, there was an Irish family, headed by “Uncle Jimmy”, as sitting tenants in the basement. I don’t think Uncle Jimmy had encountered a black baby before. When I was born, he promptly fell in love. Every morning, my mother would give me breakfast. Then she would take me down to Uncle Jimmy and he would give me another breakfast.Yvette Cooper reinstates Home Office unit for post-Windrush culture changeRead moreIn the Windrush era, black people were often the victims of violence by bad actors such as teddy boys or fascist organisations such as the BNP. There was a backdrop of fear. The Notting Hill race riots were the culmination of years of teddy boys attacking black people. My mother used to tell a story about teddy boys storming down our west London road. They knocked on every door and if they found a black family inside, they beat them up. My parents waited petrified as the noise of the teddy boys grew nearer. Then out from our basement emerged Uncle Jimmy. He said very firmly “they are not getting our Diane” and when the teddy boys knocked on our door, he opened it. Seeing a white man, they assumed a white family lived inside and moved on to the next house.No one should ever underestimate the courage of the Windrush generation. Travelling from the Caribbean countryside to one of the biggest cities in the world in order to build a new life was an act of extraordinary daring. Nor could my parents, and that whole wave of Caribbean migrants who came here in the 1950s on the Empire Windrush and all the other ships, have ever guessed that their achievements would one day be celebrated with so many splendid events.

Long summer evenings, with temperatures rarely topping 30C, form the backdrop for rooftop bars thrumming with live DJs, as well as alfresco concerts in leafy parks, while the beautiful sandy beaches of seaside Jūrmala are just a half-hour bus ride away.Any visit should begin with a wander along the banks of the city canal and down Alberta Street, lined with ornate art nouveau mansions. Stop to refuel at the sprawlingCentral Market, housed in five former German Zeppelin hangars, offering dozens of local cheeses, smoked meats and classic dark rye breads – perfect sandwich fare.The streets kick into life in summer, with free weeklyconcerts on Wednesdaynights in Dzegužkalns park and in theVērmanes gardens on Fridaysin August, while jazz and world music fans should visit between 2 and 5 July for theRīgas Ritmimusic festival.Where to stayBehind an art nouveau frontage,Hotel Neiburgs(from €114 B&B) combines the flexibility of self-catering apartments with hotel add-ons such as an excellent restaurant, fitness room and small spa.Antwerp, BelgiumView image in fullscreenMAS Antwerp, a striking museum on the River Scheldt.Photograph: Random Lights/AlamyAnyone who thinks Belgium is a bit boring has never been to Antwerp – an artsy, quirky city packed with cocktail bars, coffee shops and independent art galleries that sparks into alfresco life in summer. On sunny weekends, Sint-Anneke beach (on the left bank of the River Scheldt) fills up with locals dipping their toes in the water and lunching on mussels at one of the many bistros that line the riverbank. Parks and open spaces become venues for street theatre, circus acts and open-air cinema, particularly during theZomer van Antwerpenarts festival (19 June to 31 August).To get an idea of the city’s rich history, visitMAS, an architecturally striking museum on the river, with each floor charting Antwerp’s history as a global trading port, topped with a huge rooftop terrace that gives spectacular 360-degree views.Antwerp runs on its stomach, with microbreweries, chocolate shops andmoules friteson every corner. The latest addition isWolf, a food market with 10 restaurants. Pick up a picnic to eat in the gardens ofMiddelheim Museum’sworld-class sculpture park. It features six zones exploring the relationship between humans and nature through abstract installations and strikingly innovative pieces, such as Erwin Vurm’sboat curving off a jetty, Misconceivable.Where to stayIn the historic centre,Hotel Matelote(from €115 B&B) features chic, minimalist design within the framework of two 16th-century buildings.Bolzano, ItalyView image in fullscreenBolzano offers a fusion of German and Italian influences.Photograph: Prisma by Dukas Presseagentur/AlamyThe capital of the South Tyrol – a fusion of Germanic architecture and history with Italian culture and food, set among the spectacular peaks of the Dolomites – is a gem. Surrounded by vineyards and lush mountain plateaux, it has one of the best summer music scenes in Europe. Jazz fans should visit between 27 June and 6 July, when theSüdtyrol jazz festivaloffers more than 50 concerts across the region, while theBolzano Festival Bozen(5 August-7 September) is a treat for classical music lovers, with performances held in some of the city’s most beautiful buildings, including Dominican cloisters and the 13th-century Castel Mareccio.Most visitors to Bolzano head out to explore the spectacular scenery – at its loveliest in the summer months – either on foot along the city’s greenways or by taking a cable car up to theRitten plateau. The Guncina Promenade is a 2.8-mile (4.5km) walk from the centre of the city out into the hills, with lovely views back across the skyline, while hiking trails unfold from the 1,227-metre high cable station at Oberbozen, along with the South Tyrol’s only surviving narrow-gauge railway. The big historic draw in Bolzano is Ötzi, a 5,300-year-old mummified iceman found by hikers in 1991 and sensitively displayed at theSouth Tyrol Museum of Archaeology.Where to stayGoldenstern Townhouse(doubles from €149 room-only) is set in the city’s medieval arcades and makes a wonderful base.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Näsetbadet and Askimsbadet beaches are short bus rides away, while a tram to the ferry port opens up the tranquil waters, unspoilt villages and long sandy beaches of the Gothenburg archipelago. Explore by kayak or island-hop by ferry, with the waterside deck atTullhusetrestaurant on Hönö island a great spot for a seafood lunch, before a paddle on the long stretch of sandy shoreline on Rivö island.Gothenburg is famed for its oysters and seafood, best sampled atFeskekörka, the city’s waterfront fish market hall, which houses a clutch of excellent restaurants and a sunlit outdoor terrace. The city also has a centuries-long history of craft brewing and 40 independent breweries, many with tap rooms and restaurants. Sink a couple atPoppels Citybryggeri, or try the innovative brews atSad Robot, open on Friday and Saturday nights.Need to clear a thick head?

Popular spots for a swim include the artificial beach at Eaux-Vives on Lake Geneva (including a doughnut-shaped overwater deck and central pool), the floating “beach platform” at the Quai de Cologny and the Genève-Plage, where all manner of watersports, from yachting to paddleboarding, are on offer alongside a straightforward dip.A great choice for vinophiles, the lattice of streets in the Vieille Ville (old town) are dotted with wine bars, from sleekly modernSoul Winesto the more traditionalVino Olio Caffe. Most roads lead to theCathédrale Saint-Pierre, where the imposing vaulted exterior is a precursor to the spectacular lake views from its towers. After sightseeing, there’s plenty more to enjoy; truffle out vintage finds at the Plainpalais flea market (Wednesdays and Saturdays), learn about the city’s watchmaking history at thePatek Philippemuseum, or soak up live music at the Genève-Plage with three nights of alfresco performances at theOrchestre de la Suisse Romande festival(21-23 August).It’s a pleasingly indulgent city, too, filled withfromageriesand farmers’ markets (the best are at the Plainpalais on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday and Eaux-Vives on Wednesday and Saturday). For the ultimate treat, snag a table atLe Gruyérienfor fondue, best worked off with a hike across the green slopes of Mont Salève – just a five-minute cable-car ride from the city.Where to stayIn a city of ruinously pricey hotels, theTiffany by Fassbind(from 122 Swiss francs/£109 room-only) is a relative steal, tucked away on a quiet street in the Les Bains neighbourhood with a chic terrace restaurant.Accommodation prices correct at time of going to press.

They said their joint aim was to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and called on Tehran to address all concerns associated with the nuclear programme.“We stand ready to contribute to that goal in coordination with all parties,” the statement said. “We urge Iran not to take any further action that could destabilise the region. We will continue our joint diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions and ensure the conflict does not intensify and spread further.”Starmer warned earlier that the fallout from the conflict could reverberate beyond the region. “It is important that we now de-escalate the situation, stabilise the region and get the parties back around the table to negotiate,” he told broadcasters.Flights from London to Dubai and Doha were cancelled after a British Airways flight from Heathrow to Dubai was forced to divert to Zurich on Saturday night.Israelannounced on Sunday that it had closed its airspace to inbound and outbound flights.US bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities is Trump’s biggest gamble yet as presidentRead moreStarmer spoke to Donald Trump on Sunday night but the official readout of the call gave no hint as to whether the prime minister had called for the US to de-escalate.No 10 said Starmer and Trump “reiterated the grave risk posed by Iran’s nuclear programme to international security. They discussed the actions taken by the United States last night to reduce the threat and agreed that Iran must never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon.“They discussed the need for Iran to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and to make progress on a lasting settlement.”After Starmer spoke earlier on Sunday with the sultan of Oman and the king of Jordan, No 10 said the leaders agreed that “escalation of the conflict is in no one’s interests”.The US decision to join Israel’s offensive against Iran came after western leaders, including Starmer, had urged restraint. They are due to meet again on Tuesday at the Nato summit in the Netherlands.As recently as last Tuesday at the G7 summit, which Trump left early, Starmer said he did not have any indication the US was planning on joining the attack.Map showing location of Iranian nuclear facilities hit by US strikesThe business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, told Sky News that while the UK had preferred a different path, the outcome was in British interests. “We support the prevention of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. We had proposed a diplomatic course of action, as other European countries had done; the Iranians had rejected that.”Reynolds said people should be in no doubt that the Iranian regime did pose a threat to the UK, but that regime change in Tehran was “not the question” when it came to these strikes. “I wanted a different way to obtain this, but I cannot pretend to you that the prevention of Iran having a nuclear weapon is anything other than [in] the interests of this country,” Reynolds told the BBC.“This is very different to what we saw with the invasion of Iraq … I think stability for the region would come about through an agreement where Iran would acknowledge that, because of its behaviour, no country in that theatre or the wider world would be able to countenance it having nuclear weapons.”The chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Emily Thornberry, said the strikes were a “big mistake”. She told the BBC: “The concern is it will just become a wider conflict, and we are at a very dangerous moment. The war aim is supposed to be to stop the Iranians building a bomb, but this isn’t the way to do it. At best, it can slow down the Iranians. The way to stop them building a bomb is negotiation.”Labour and opposition MPs are likely to raise concerns in parliament when they return on Monday afternoon. The Green party co-leader, Adrian Ramsay,said: “We utterly condemn the reckless attacks on Iran by the United States that can only lead to further dangerous conflict in an already volatile region. There is no international legal basis for this unilateral action that poses a serious threat to international peace and security.”What a difference a week makes: Trump falls into the Netanyahu trapRead moreThe foreign secretary, David Lammy, had urged the US to pull back from the brink on a visit to Washington for talks with his counterpart, Marco Rubio, before attending talks with Iran on Friday alongside European allies in Geneva.Lammy also spoke to Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, saying on X that he had stressed the need for de-escalation.But Iran’s state news agency, IRNA, had a slightly different take on things, posting on X: “UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy expressed regret over the US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, categorically denied any involvement, and called for continued diplomacy.”The first part of the tweet prompted the UK Foreign Office to issue a response. A spokesperson said: “This representation of the foreign secretary’s phone call is inaccurate. The foreign secretary warned that this is a moment of extreme peril and that it is important we now de-escalate the situation, stabilise the region, and get all parties back around the table to negotiate. Iran must now immediately seek a diplomatic, negotiated solution to end this crisis.”Iran says US ‘must receive a response’ after Trump’s strikes on nuclear sitesRead moreThe Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said the US strike was “decisive action against a regime that fuels global terror and directly threatens the UK. Iranian operatives have plotted murders and attacks on British soil. We should stand firmly with the US and Israel.”Overnight, Iran launched a ballistic missile barrage against Israel in retaliation against the US action.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyKeir StarmerIranIran's nuclear programmeIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

No British airbases or any other military assets were involved in Operation Midnight Hammer, ministers added.Keir Starmer said the UK had been “given due notice” of Donald Trump’s intention to bomb Iran, though it is unclear how far in advance this may have been of the bombing raid, which took place just before midnight UK time.Officials said notification occurred “shortly before” the US strikes were launched.View image in fullscreenThe Isfahan nuclear technology centre in Iran on Sunday 22 June after US strikes.Photograph: APIn the past, Britain has been eager to act as the US’s principal military ally in the Middle East, most notably in 2003 when the UK participated in the controversial ground invasion of Iraq as Tony Blair, then the prime minister, sought to work closely with George W Bush.The Guardian view on Trump bombing Iran: an illegal and reckless act | EditorialRead moreBut on this occasion the UK has largely acted as a bystander, and it has not always appeared to read the ultimate intentions of the US president, who is notoriously unpredictable.Last Tuesday at the G7 summit in Banff, Canada, from which Trump departed early because of the Iran crisis, Starmer said there was “nothing the president said that suggests that he’s about to get involved in this conflict”, having sat next to him at dinner the previous evening. Those present said the prime minister seemed confident, even unequivocal, in his analysis of the situation.After the summit, reports circulated that the government’s most senior lawyer, Richard Hermer, was unconvinced that any UK military involvement in attacking Iran would be legal. One official who had seen Hermer’s legal advicetold the Spectator: “The AG has concerns about the UK playing any role in this except for defending our allies.”B-2 bombers frequently use the RAF base at Diego Garcia, which is a shorter flight over water to Iran but, as is the case with the use of all UK bases by the US air force, it requires British permission. Similar authorisation would be needed for the US to use RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus for refuelling, though that too was not sought.View image in fullscreenSatellite images over Fordow underground complex near Qom, Iran before and after the US struck the underground nuclear facility, seen on 20 June and 22 June.Photograph: Maxar Technologies/ReutersA graphic released by the Pentagon showed seven B-2 bombers flying from their home base at Whiteman, Missouri, across the Atlantic and avoiding passing over European countries by flying over the strait of Gibraltar and through the Mediterranean before going on to Iran via Israel, Jordan and Iraq, a flight path of more than 8,000 miles.How effective was the US attack on Iran’s nuclear sites? A visual guideRead morePete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, said on Sunday morning that “no other country on planet Earth” could have conducted the bombing raid on Iran, which he later emphasised “was US-operated and US-led”.Only assistance from Israel was acknowledged by Gen Dan Caine, the US chair of the joint chiefs of staff, in the form of prior attacks to degrade Iranian air defences.Under international law, a country is allowed to fight in self-defence, and the prevailing view is that pre-emptive military strikes are legal if it is believed an incoming military threat is imminent –though the US arguesthe right of self-defence applies broadly against any illegal use of force against itself or its allies.In justifying thebombing raidon Sunday, Hegseth did not mention the question of imminence. He said: “The president authorised a precision operation to neutralise the threats to our national interests posed by the Iranian nuclear programme and the collective self-defence of our troops and our ally Israel.”Matthew Savill, a former civil servant now with the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said: “I think to a certain degree the UK government will be relieved” that the US did not ask for help. But he cautioned that the UK “could get sucked into the regional blowback” in the form of attacks by Iran or its proxies.On Sunday, UK defence officials said additional steps had been taken to protect British forces in the Middle East after the US bombing. Force protection at sites such as Akrotiri – where at least 14 Typhoon fighters are stationed – and naval bases in Oman and Bahrain were at the highest level, said the defence secretary, John Healey.1:31Keir Starmer backs US strike on Iran's nuclear facilities – videoStarmer called for restraint in the response to US strikes on Iran, warning of the possibility of escalation beyond the Middle East. The prime minister spoke to the king of Jordan and the sultan of Oman and called for talks that would end the threat posed by Iran’s nuclear programme.“It is important that we now de-escalate the situation, stabilise the region and get the parties back around the table to negotiate,” hetold broadcasterson Sunday morning. “I’m very clear in my own mind that Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.

In the process his personal authority will have been enhanced, and his next three years in office will be a triumph that may exacerbate some of his worst authoritarian and impulsive traits.He will also have allied the US more closely than ever withBenjamin Netanyahu, a man deeply disliked in large parts of the world for Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and its assault on Gaza.Under such a scenario, America will not be loved, but it will be feared, and from that fear will come deference. After the failures of ground interventions and occupations in Afghanistan in the wake of 9/11 and the Iraq war in 2003, Trump would have re-established the value of limited military intervention.Alarm in Middle East over US strikes on Iran amid fears of widening conflictRead moreEqually, however, much could go wrong. Many leaders and diplomats in Europe may well privately be hoping that is the case – not because they have time for the Iranian government, but because they fear Trump’s methods are perilous, and in breach of thenuclear non-proliferation treatyand international law.How the carefully planned US bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities unfoldedRead moreChina, which has big interests in Iran, will want to make sure this episode does not usher in a unipolar world. Russia will draw lessons, and is already willing to acknowledge the danger of a US win, telling Iran it is willing to do more to help Tehran develop its nuclear capabilities.Gulf states are alsoexpressing outrage at Trump’s intervention. Arab diplomats said they were trying to square Trump’s military intervention with his extraordinary speech in Riyadh two months ago in which he decried past US military adventurism. “In the end, the so-called ‘nation-builders’ wrecked far more nations than they built – and the interventionists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves,” Trump had said.The Gulf states fear being dragged into a war. Most had thought an irascible Trump needed to allow Iran a right to very limited enrichment of uranium, under close UN monitoring. As an issue it was considered eminently solvable through patient diplomacy – of the kind the Europeans had just embarked on.Nor is the military conflict over. So far Iran has been out-thought and outmanoeuvred in this war. But it is possible that Trump finds himself sucked into a longer conflict than he intended. Netanyahu has notoriously so far shown himself better at starting conflicts than ending them. Once fully engaged in the Iran conflict, Trump will have to see it through to the end, tying him up in the kind of endless foreign conflict that he promised on the election campaign trail he would abjure.If Iran refuses to submit, it has options. It could abandon the non-proliferation treaty, deport the UN inspectors and try to rebuild the nuclear programme in secret. Should Tehran still possess a so-far hidden supply of highly enriched uranium, its nuclear scientists may be tempted to try to dash for a crude nuclear device. That would give Tehran time to try to rally support among its battered allies in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.Sanam Vakil, the Middle East specialist at the London thinktank Chatham House, said the US leader perceives of this strike as a one-off. “Trump was careful, he telegraphed the strikes, he sent messages of warning to Iran in advance,” she said. “I think he wants this to end with a negotiation, with a deal and one he can show is a victory in setting back Iran’s nuclear programme.”Iran says US ‘must receive a response’ after Trump’s strikes on nuclear sitesRead moreBut a careful de-escalation after such a US escalation is fraught with risk. Vakil said: “The president is impatient and does not have the bandwidth for protracted negotiation. The Iranians want sanctions relief, but do not know how any longer they can trust Trump, a man they say has repeatedly deceived them.”The best-case scenario is that Iran settles on a symbolic retaliation, much as it did in 2020, when Trumpordered the assassination of Qassem Suleimani, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps commander. The president might then push Israel to wind down its war and urge Iran to resume negotiations over a new nuclear deal.Either way, Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s foreign minister, appeared to speak for the region with his assessment. “The events this morning are outrageous and will have everlasting consequences,” he said.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpIran's nuclear programmeIranBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Still, it remains unclear how much physical damage has been done or what the longer-term impact might be on Iran’s nuclear programme.What was the target?The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) confirmed that attacks took place on its Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz sites, but insisted its nuclear programme would not be stopped. Iran and the UN nuclear watchdog said there were no immediate signs of radioactive contamination around the three locations after the strikes.US strikes on IranThe Iranian Red Crescent Society reported no deaths from the US strikes, appearing to confirm Iranian claims they had been largely evacuated in advance. The health ministry said those who were injured showed no evidence of nuclear contamination. In the immediate aftermath, US military officialssaid the three sites had suffered “severe damage”after an operation that had been planned for weeks, suggesting it was coordinated with Israel.The Pentagon said a battle damage assessment was still being conducted.What do we know about the strike on Fordow?Long regarded as the most difficult military target among Iran’s nuclear sites, the uranium enrichment facilities at Fordow – the primary target of the operation – are buried beneath the Zagros mountains. Reports have suggested that the site was constructed beneath 45-90 metres of bedrock, largely limestone and dolomite.The bunker busting bombsSome experts have suggested the layering of the sedimentary rocks, including faults, would also make it more difficult to strike the centrifuge array, providing a kind of geological cushioning against a blast wave.The attack – codenamed Operation Midnight Hammer – was carried out by seven B-2 Spirit stealth bombers flying from the US, after a deception flight by other B-2s into the Pacific. Tomahawk missiles were fired from US ships in waters south of Iran.The site was hit by a dozen 13,600kg massive ordnance penetrators – known as bunker busters – at approximately 2.10am Iranian time. It was the weapon’s first operational use. The number used suggests a lack of confidence that a smaller strike could penetrate through to the target.The result to a large extent depends on the kind of concrete inside the facility. Estimates of the bunker busters’ penetration are based largely on reinforced concrete resistant to 5,000psi. Iran is believed to have used more resistant concrete.While video from the site showed evidence of a fire in the immediate aftermath, satellite images published on Sunday were suggestive but far from conclusive.The main support building at the site appeared to be undamaged, but the topography of a prominent area of ridge line appeared to have altered and been flattened out, with some evidence of rock scarring close to two clusters of bomb craters around the ridge.Impact of strikes on Fordow enrichment plantAnalysts had suggested that a strike could hit the main entrance tunnel to the site, but the main effort appears to have been in a different location.How the bunker buster bomb worksAt odds with Trump’s claim of “complete obliteration”, two Israeli officials who spoke to the New York Times described serious damage at Fordow but said the site had not been completely destroyed.The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, added: “As for the assessment of the degree of damage underground, on this we cannot pronounce ourselves. It could be important; it could be significant, but no one … neither us nor anybody else could be able to tell you how much it has been damaged.”What was the impact at Isfahan?Isfahan’s nuclear technology centre was struck by Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from an Ohio-class submarine as opposed to bunker busters. Video posted on social media showed a distant detonation from the site on Saturday night.According to the IAEA, in addition to four hit by Israeli strikes, six other buildings had now been attacked, including a fuel rod production facility. It said facilities targeted at Isfahan either contained no nuclear material or small quantities of natural or low-enriched uranium.What was hit at Natanz?Natanz had previously been damaged by the first Israeli strikes of the conflict, with assessments then suggesting they had hit the power plant supplying the main centrifuge hall. Uranium had been enriched to up to 60%, short of weapons-grade material.It appears that Natanz’s underground enrichment hall was targeted. Enhancement of satellite images from the site on Sunday showed fresh damage to overground buildings and new cratering in the centre of the site.In response to the US strikes, Iran launched ballistic missiles at Israel on Sunday, triggering countrywide air raid sirens and injuring 16 people.Drone footage of damage in IsraelWas Iran’s nuclear programme obliterated?Iran has claimed that it evacuated the sites several days ago, and satellite imagery from several days ago suggests there was unusual truck traffic at Fordow. That appears to confirm the movement of some material from the site, possibly including the uranium stockpile – or parts of it – which remains unaccounted for.Hassan Abedini, the deputy political head of Iran’s state broadcaster, said Iran had evacuated the three sites – Natanz, Isfahan and Fordow – some time ago.0:40Blasts heard in Isfahan as US strikes Iranian nuclear sites – video“The enriched uranium reserves had been transferred from the nuclear centres and there are no materials left there that, if targeted, would cause radiation and be harmful to our compatriots,” he said.Three days before the US attacks, 16 cargo trucks were seen near the Fordow entrance tunnel.What a difference a week makes: Trump falls into the Netanyahu trapRead moreThe head of the AEOI, Mohammad Eslami, claimed this month that Iran had another enrichment site “in a secure and invulnerable location” that could house centrifuges.Analysts have long argued that while it is possible to disrupt the physical function of a nuclear facility and limit the scope of a programme through, for example, the killing of scientists, the breadth of technical knowledge acquired during the decades-long programme is impossible to destroy.Ultimately, the question is whether the US-Israeli attacks are seen as sufficient for Iran to capitulate, or whether they instead encourage the regime to accelerate its efforts to produce a viable nuclear weapon.Explore more on these topicsIranUS foreign policyIran's nuclear programmeMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelUS militaryNuclear weaponsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

About 220,000 people with “greatest need” are expected to receive Mounjaro, also known as tirzepatide and made by Eli Lilly, on the NHS over the next three years.The drug works by lowering blood sugar levels and slows down how quickly food is digested.From Monday, GPs in England will be allowed to prescribe Mounjaro to severely obese people living with a range of other health problems. Patients previously needed to access the drugs through a special weight loss service.GP leaders said some family doctors had expressed concern about the additional workload, while pharmacy experts also said there could be pressure on supplies of the drug.In the first year of the programme, it will be offered to people with a body mass index (BMI) score of more than 40 who have at least four other health problems linked to obesity such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and obstructive sleep apnoea.Estimates suggest about 1.5 million people in the UK are already taking weight-loss drugs, which may have been prescribed through specialist weight loss services or via private prescription.Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “While we recognise the potential benefits of weight-loss drugs, we know many GPs are concerned about the implications of the rollout of weight-loss drugs into general practice, both in terms of workload and training to appropriately initiate and manage these treatments.“GPs and our teams are already working under intense workload and workforce pressures, and this must be factored into this rollout in order to guarantee it can be delivered safely.“More widely, while weight-loss medications have a lot of potential benefits for patients who are struggling to lose weight and who meet all the clinical criteria for a prescription, they mustn’t be seen as a ‘silver bullet’ to aid weight loss.“We also need to see a focus on prevention, stopping people becoming overweight in the first place so they don’t require a medical intervention later.”Olivier Picard, the chair of the National Pharmacy Association, said the demand for weight-loss jabs continued to rise sharply.“As the NHS is now moving to implement National Institute forHealthand Care Excellence guidance, and tirzepatide becomes prescribable to more patients, we expect to see prescription volumes increase rapidly,” he said.“However, NHS provision won’t meet demand straight away, so we fully expect that many people will continue seeking it privately from a pharmacy.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthObesityEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It examined all the official reviews of domestic abuse-related homicides and suicides published in 2024 and found that about 90% cited safeguarding failings by the NHS.Lack of domestic abuse training was the most frequent criticism identified. National Institute for Health and Care Excellenceguidanceadvises mandatory training for frontline NHS staff in identifying and properly caring for domestic abuse victims. But Stada’s analysis found that such training was “sporadic and inconsistent”.The report also highlights repeated failures by the NHS to record risks, share information and get victims help from other specialists such as alcohol and mental health services, and independent domestic violence advisers.Domestic abusers driving more victims to suicide, warn policeRead moreThe findings follow aseparate studypublished in the Lancet Regional Health Europe, which calculated that 26% of all women who died by suicide, and were known to secondary mental health services, had been a victim of domestic violence.The government is due to publish its strategy this summer on how to meet its pledgeto halve violence against women and girlsby 2034.But without urgent action, this ambition will not be achieved, the Stada report concludes. The NHS should fund mandatory, standardised domestic abuse training for frontline health professionals and specialist support such as mental health domestic violence advisers, the study recommends. Data recording and information sharing should also be improved.Cherryl Henry-Leach, the chief executive of Stada, said: “We call on the government to recognise domestic abuse as a public health issue.“Treating [domestic abuse] solely as a criminal justice issue costs lives. The NHS has more contact with victims and perpetrators than any other public service, making it uniquely positioned to address this crisis.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The level of physical and mental pain imposed on victims (and their children) by perpetrators is immense and we know that, for many, that mental torture becomes too great and they end up taking their own life.“I’ve calculated that 1,800 people a year could be dying in domestic abuse-related suicides every year. This is a tragically high waste of life, and a national scandal.”Andrea Simon, the director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: “Healthcare workers are often the first, and only, point of contact for victims of abuse and it is essential they are equipped to identify, signpost and safeguard victims who need support. As this report shows, the consequences of inaction can be serious harm, including death. It’s time the government took action on repeated recommendations in domestic homicide reviews and ensured all health professionals receive comprehensive training, including on the risk posed by domestic abuse-related suicides.”Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said given the trusted relationships GPs have with patients, “it is concerning to hear that opportunities to help victims might be being missed”.More training would be welcomed and valuable, she added, “as long as these are appropriately funded, take into consideration the existing training that GPs receive on safeguarding, and the workload pressures we face daily”.An NHS spokesperson said:“All NHS staff are required to complete safeguarding training on domestic violence and abuse to give them the skills and knowledge they need to support victims and survivors, and this training is currently being updated.”A government spokesperson said: “We remain resolute in our mission to tackle domestic abuse and put a system in place that protects victims, supports their journey to justice and holds perpetrators to account.“Healthcare professionals are often the first lifeline for domestic abuse victims – playing a vital role in supporting them to overcome trauma and rebuild their lives – and we have prioritised funding to deliver an additional 345,000 NHS talking therapies interventions to ensure survivors get the support they need.“Through our plan for change, we are developing a coordinated approach across government, underpinned by a new strategy to be published later this year, to prevent domestic abuse and protect victims.”In the UK, call the nationaldomestic abuse helplineon 0808 2000 247, or visit theMen’s Advice LineorWomen’s Aid.

It promises a 10-year residence permit and a return to the controversial “remittance basis” of taxation, allowing cardholders to shield overseas income from UK tax and avoid inheritance tax entirely.In return, high-net-worth applicants would pay an upfront “entry contribution” of £250,000, which Reform UK said would be distributed in full to the bottom 10% of UK earners.Reform estimates this “Britannia workers’ dividend” could provide a tax-free annual payout of £600-£1,000 to roughly 2.5 million low-paid full-time workers, depending on uptake. The money would be delivered directly by HMRC at the end of each tax year.‘They feel betrayed’: how Reform UK is targeting votes in Britain’s manufacturing heartlandsRead moreUnder the plan, foreign nationals and wealthy British returnees would gain access to the UK through a tax-light regime that exempts all overseas income and assets from UK taxation for a decade. Inheritance tax would also scrapped entirely.In effect, Reform is proposing to sell exemption from the UK tax system – reinstating the abolished non-dom privileges in a simplified form but with a cash price attached. The party says the fee is not a “golden visa” but a way of ensuring wealthy newcomers “immediately contribute to British society”.Unlike Labour’s 2024 abolition of non-dom status, and the shift under former Tory chancellor Jeremy Hunt to a residence-based tax system for all new arrivals, Reform’s plan would restore tax breaks for the globally mobile– while simultaneously claiming to deliver for the British working class.Critics are likely to seize on what amounts to a structural loophole: the ability for millionaires to buy their way out of full UK tax liability, while ordinary residents remain subject to standard tax rules.Reform claims the policy will channel billions directly into the bank accounts of Britain’s poorest workers.Under its lowest-uptake scenario – 6,000 Britannia Cards issued a year – the scheme would generate £1.5bn, enough to fund a £600 tax-free bonus to 2.5 million workers. A higher-uptake scenario, with 10,000 cards, would raise £2.5bn and deliver £1,000 per worker.Only full-time workers in the bottom 10% of the income distribution would qualify, with payments issued automatically via HMRC. Reform said the boost would disproportionately benefit workers in Wales, Scotland and the north-east of England – regions where a greater share of jobs sit in the bottom pay decile.The party has yet to publish a clear threshold for who qualifies as a “high-net-worth newcomer” nor how the policy would be enforced or integrated into HMRC’s current tax framework. No legislative draft has been released.Since sweeping to power in more than 670 council seats in May and taking control of 10 councils and two mayoralties, Reform has emerged as a serious national contender. The party now leads in multiple polls: a recent Sky/YouGov tracker shows Reform on 34%, with Labour trailing at 25% and the Conservatives at just 15%.The move is part of Farage’s latest attempt toposition Reform as the party of working people, not through traditional wage policies or trade unionism, but via direct wealth transfers and blunt fiscal symbolism. The Britannia Card is his clearest move yet to dominate the “red wall” on economic terms.However the policy is likely to raise questions over who would be eligible with no confirmed income or asset threshold for applicants. It is also unclear whether HMRC could legally define and enforce the £250,000 fee.There are also concerns over it creating a two-tier tax system with British workers still paying full tax on global income while wealthy newcomers will not, and that it consists of a one-off fee and is not a recurring tax yet grants up to 10 years of preferential status.A Reform spokesperson said: “We are serious about repairing the social contract. It’s time workers feel the benefit of high-net-worth individuals entering the country.“We are taking policy formulation very serious internally, as can be seen by today’s announcement.”Responding to the trail of Reform’s non-dom policy, a Labour spokesperson said: “Nigel Farage can brand this whatever he wants – the reality is his first proper policy is a golden ticket for foreign billionaires to avoid the tax they owe in this country.“As ever with Reform, the devil is in the detail. This giveaway would reduce revenues raised from the rich that would have to be made up elsewhere – through tax hikes on working families or through Farage’s promise to charge them to use the NHS.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKTax and spendingNigel FarageImmigration and asylumMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The group further urged the Israeli government to return the remaining 50 hostages from Gaza, which it said was the “key to achieving complete victory”.The group described Samerano as “a talented DJ who just wanted to make music, have fun, and travel”. Keidar, 71, lived in the Be’eri kibbutz, where more than 100 people were killed.Some of the families of those abducted fear that Israel’s war withIran, which started on 13 June, would distract from efforts to return the remaining captives. Hamas-led militants took 251 people hostage during its 7 October 2023 attack in Israel, and killed 1,200 people. Of the remaining hostages, Israel believes approximately 30 are dead.On Sunday, Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, called for the “urgent release” of the remaining hostages after theUS carried out strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.“This brave step serves the security and safety of the entire free world. I hope it will lead to a better future for the Middle East – and help advance the urgent release of our hostages held in captivity in Gaza,” Herzog wrote on X.Some families of the hostages protested against the Israeli government’s resumption of the war in Gaza in March and have said a ceasefire is the only way to safely recover those remaining. Fighting resumed after Israel declined to move to a second phase of an agreed-upon ceasefire that could have led to a permanent end to the war.Israel continues its operations in Gaza, where more than 55,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed over the last 20 months.Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIrannewsShareReuse this content"

Eyewitnesses inside the church reported a second gunman who did not blow himself up, but also shot at the 150 or so worshippers present.“People were praying safely under the eyes of God,” said Fadi Ghattas, who said he saw at least 20 people killed. “There were 350 people praying at the church.”Videos of the church’s interior show splintered pews overturned by the force of the blast and the bloodied corpses of congregants splayed out across the church. Nearby residents reported hearing a large blast and then the sound of sirens as security forces attempted to establish a cordon around the area and civil defence personnel headed towards the church.Issam Nasr, who was praying at the church, said he saw people “blown to bits”.“We have never held a knife in our lives. All we ever carried were our prayers,” he said.The attack came after months of low-level IS activity and propaganda, as the group attempted to exploit the security vacuum created after the fall of Assad to reconstitute itself. Syrian officials have said the group was able to seize weaponry and ammunition left by fleeing Assad regime soldiers to bolster its caches.View image in fullscreenThe blast on Sunday killed 20 people and damaged the interior of Saint Elias’s church, splintering pews and scattering debris.Photograph: Mohammed Al Rifai/EPAThe Syrian government, led by former leaders of the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), have been carrying out anti-IS raids throughout the country since taking power. While still a rebel group, HTS had been fighting IS in areas under its control, viewing it as a source of instability and radicalisation for rival rebel groups.Since the fall of the Assad regime, IS has attempted to use the apparent moderation of the former Islamist rebels who now lead the country as a recruitment tool for disaffected Islamist fighters.IS social media channels and propaganda published pictures of the Syrian president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, meeting the US president, Donald Trump, in Riyadh in May, describing it as an apparent betrayal of his jihadist roots.Syrian authorities have stressed religious minorities will be protected under their rule. Security personnel usually are posted at each entrance of the city’s Christian quarter, inspecting cars as they come in.The Syrian minister of information, Hamza al-Mustafa, said: “This cowardly act contradicts the values of citizenship that unite us all. We, as Syrians, emphasise the importance of national unity and civil peace, and call for strengthening the bonds of fraternity between all components of society.”View image in fullscreenA clergyman walks among debris at the scene of a suicide bombing at the Saint Elias church in Damascus, Syria on 22 June.Photograph: Mohammed Al Rifai/EPAThe Damascus municipality said security services were investigating the circumstances of the bombing. Syria’s foreign ministry described the event as a “desperate attempt to undermine national coexistence and to destabilise the country”.A statement from the office of the UN special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, said he was outraged at the “heinous crime” and condemned it in the “strongest possible terms”. The office added that the envoy also called for “a full investigation and action by the authorities”.Though nominally in power of most of Syria, the country’s new government has struggled to extend its control on the ground over the country. Syria is still full of militias, some of them more radical than others. The country’s defence ministry is in the process of folding militias into a unified national army and disarming those who refuse to join its ranks.Since the territorial defeat of the so-called caliphate of IS in Syria, it has been mostly the US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that have been leading the anti-IS fight. Cooperation between the SDF and the new Syrian government in fighting IS has been growing but is still in its infancy.The US, as well as the other members of the anti-IS coalition in Iraq and Syria, have cited the resurgence of IS in Syria as one of their key concerns for the country.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIslamic StateChristianityIslamReligionMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Annabel was a truly wonderful woman. She touched the hearts of so many.“She gave her life to helping the vulnerable and the disadvantaged, whether it was in refugee camps in Africa, or setting up MamaSuze in London to enhance the lives of survivors of forced displacement and gender-based violence.”The family asked for their privacy to be respected.A 44-year-old man was arrested at the address on suspicion of murder. He was taken to hospital and later discharged and taken into police custody, the force said. Police have said they believed the incident was “domestic-related”.John Martin, the artistic director of Pan Intercultural Arts, where Rook worked with young refugees for 16 years until 2022, previously described her as “a larger-than-life character” who had joined the charity as a volunteer.In a personal tribute, Martin said: “Annabel’s energy brought a lot to the women and gave them new hope. This was her speciality, I think – a sort of boundless optimism, a boundless self-confidence, which she transferred on to other people.“She spent her life, certainly the 10, 12 years that I knew her, fighting [for] women who had been abused [and] fighting against violence to women.”MamaSuze said in a statement shared on Tuesday that it was “devastated by the loss of our beloved co-founder” and that she treated everyone with “warmth and kindness”.“Annabel was a profound force for good in the world, dedicating her working life to supporting women survivors,” it said.Police were called at 4.57am on Tuesday to reports of a gas explosion with a person trapped inside the property. Rook was found at the scene with stab wounds.The front bay window of the property was completely blown out, and debris including plants, wooden shutters and glass was scattered across the street.Two children aged seven and nine were taken to hospital as a precaution after the incident. They are not thought to have been inside the home when the explosion occurred.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It will ensure the industries that make Britain great can thrive,” she said. “It will boost our economy and create jobs that put more money in people’s pockets.”The government said the reforms would not directly cost the taxpayer anything or lead to an increase in household bills, but would be funded through reforms to the energy system.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the global race to attract investment will require a laser-like and unwavering focus on the UK’s overall competitiveness.”Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of the manufacturers’ organisation Make UK, said the strategy was a “giant and much-needed step forward”, saying there had long been frustration in the sector at the skills crisis, crippling energy costs and difficulty in accessing capital.“The strategy announced today sets out plans to address all three of these structural failings,” he said. “Clearly there is much to do as we move towards implementation, but this will send a message across the country and around the world that Britain is back in business.”Explore more on these topicsManufacturing sectorIndustrial policyKeir StarmerRachel ReevesEnergyLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Nine other crew members and six guests – including Bacares – were rescued.About 70 specialist personnel had been mobilised to Porticello from across Europe to work on the recovery operation.Inquest proceedings in the UK are looking at the deaths of Lynch, his daughter and the Bloomers, who were all British nationals.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Over the past two and a half years, business has picked up again. Part of the reason: Russia’s casualties in its continuing invasion ofUkraine.Few regions in Russia have sent as many men to fight and die in Ukraine as the republic of Bashkortostan, whose capital, Ufa, draws recruits from poorer surrounding areas in search of money.“Sometimes, I check the name of the person we’re burying and realise it’s someone I know – someone I went to school with or met before,” said Nikolai, who asked that his last name be withheld for fear of government reprisal.Since the start of its war in Ukraine, Russia’s military casualties have remained a closely guarded state secret. But look a little closer and the signs of devastation are unmistakable – from the booming funeral industry to the rising number of veterans returning home without arms or legs.In total, between January and April 2025, funeral service providers in the country earned nearly 40bn rubles – (£380m), a 12.7% year-on-year increase, according to Rosstat, Russia’s federal state statistics service.View image in fullscreenA screengrab showing officers next to a truck repatriating the bodies of Ukrainian service personnel.Photograph: Russian Defence Ministry Press Service/EPAThis month, Russia’s wartime toll of dead and wounded reached a historic milestone.According to the British Ministry of Defence, more than one million Russian troops have been killed or injured since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February 2022.The estimate aligns with a recentstudy by the US-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), which puts Russian military deaths at up to 250,000 and total casualties, including the wounded, at over 950,000. Ukraine has suffered very high losses as well, with between 60,000 and 100,000 personnel killed and total casualties reaching approximately 400,000.While precise wartime casualty figures are notoriously difficult to verify, the independent Russian outlet Mediazona has identified thenames of more than 111,000 Russian military personnel killed, using official records, social media obituaries, and images of tombstones. The outlet believes the true death toll is significantly higher.These are staggering figures by any measure of comparison in modern Russian history.In just over three years, Russian fatalities are estimated to be five times higher than the combined death toll from all Soviet and Russian wars between the end of the second world war and the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022.The war in Ukraine has proved far deadlier for the Kremlin than other recent conflicts: Russia’s losses are roughly 15 times greater than those suffered during the Soviet Union’s decade-long war in Afghanistan, and 10 times higher than in Russia’s 13-year war in Chechnya.And it’s not just the dead returning in caskets – soldiers with amputated limbs and serious injuries are also coming home, driving a sharp rise in the production of prosthetic limbs.“We doubled the number of our clients one year into the conflict and since then it has been a steady 10% increase annually,” said Igor Vinogradov, the director of a mid-sized prosthetics and orthopaedics firm in northern Russia.“By far, the majority are war veterans,” Vinogradov said, adding that his company relies on imported prosthetic arms and legs from Germany, as well as some homegrown technology.View image in fullscreenThe funeral of Alexander Skobelev, a soldier killed in the war with Ukraine, is held at a cemetery in Shlisselburg, in the Leningrad oblast.Photograph: Anton Vaganov/ReutersData from Russia’s labour ministry shows the state subsidised the provision of 152,500 prosthetic limbs to people with disabilities in 2024. That marks a 53% increase on the previous year, when 99,200 artificial arms and legs were distributed – itself a sharp rise from 64,800 in 2022.“The market has exploded,” said a prosthetics manufacturer in Moscow, who asked not to be named.Russia’s losses in Ukraine are likely to further accelerate the country’s deepening demographic crisis. The invasion has already caused tens of thousands of young Russians to emigrate to the west and has claimed the lives of many others who might have formed the backbone of the workforce for decades to come.The toll compounds the damage from the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused more than a million excess deaths and left lasting scars on Russia’s population.Alexander Raksha, an independent demographer and former analyst at Rostat, estimates average male life expectancy has fallen from 68 to 66 since the start of the full-scale invasion. He said the government has made it harder to track the long-term demographic consequences of the ongoing fighting.“Russia stopped publishing all mortality and life expectancy data for its male population from 2024 onwards,” Raksha said.Russian anti-war activists, inside and outside the country, initially believed the rising number of returning bodies would spark public protests.View image in fullscreenThe Russian flagship of its Black Sea fleet, the Moskva, sank after being struck by Ukrainian missiles in April 2022.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockBut Russia’s expansive propaganda campaign has portrayed the fallen as heroes, withVladimir Putinrepeatedly touting the idea that dying on the frontlines is more meaningful than enduring a bleak existence in the country’s impoverished towns.Responding to a grieving mother during a televised meeting in late 2022, he said: “Some people die in road accidents, others from alcohol – when they die, it’s unclear how. But your son lived, do you understand? He fulfilled his purpose.”Instead of widespread public discontent, the opposite now appears to be true: many Russians who have lost relatives are urging the Kremlin to press on, convinced that the losses must be justified.Among them is Dmitry Shkrebets, whose son, Yegor, was one of more than three dozen sailors killed whenUkraine struck Russia’s Black Sea flagship, the Moskva, in 2022.Shkrebets now runs a blog in which he routinely urges Russia to step up its attacks on Ukraine.“Any compromise with Ukraine would be a betrayal of the country. A betrayal of the blood our sons have shed,” Shkrebets said.“We need to see this through to the end,” he said, adding that he hoped Russia would soon launch an offensive on the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Mykolaiv.To maintain support among grieving families, the Kremlin has also resorted to offering generous payouts to the relatives of the dead and wounded. According to astudy by the Re:Russia thinkthank, the government allocated at least 1.2tn rubles (about $15.3bn) in 2024 alone for compensation to the families of the dead and injured.The sheer scale of the losses – and the money involved – has given rise to dedicated message boards and online discussion groups, where relatives of the deceased exchange advice on how to access death benefits, or vent their frustrations about long-absent family members suddenly reappearing to claim a share of the compensation.“My husband signed the contract a few days before we got married. He died shortly after. Now his children from a previous marriage are suing me to take away the death payouts … Please help!” read one recent post on VKontakte, Russia’s equivalent of Facebook.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin has repeatedly pushed the idea of the country’s war dead having made meaningful sacrifices.Photograph: Anatoly Maltsev/EPAFor now, Moscow appears able to replenish its manpower for the war, allowing it to slowly advance and capture more territory in Ukraine despite the human cost.Military recruitment continues to surge across many regions, with signing bonuses for contracts to join the war reaching record highs – up to 2m rubles (about $25,000).Janis Kluge, a researcher on the Russian economy at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, estimates Russia recruited 89,601 men between January and March 2025, based on federal spending on sign-up bonuses.“This represents a 22% increase over the same period last year,” Kluge said.Nikolai, the funeral home director, said he’s closely watching the ongoing peace talks between Russia and Ukraine to determine his next business move.“Of course, I hope this ends soon and the deaths stop,” he said, noting with disappointment the talks appear to have stalled. “It just feels wrong to be making money off young guys dying.”"

We kept taking cover behind the ruins of houses. Whoever doesn’t take cover is exposed to death,” he said.All last week, every night and most mornings, there weresimilar scenes across Gaza, as tens of thousands of hungry, desperate people converged on the GHF sites or waited at points where trucks loaded with UN flour were expected.Every day, somewhere in the devastated territory, these gatherings had a similarly lethal conclusion when Israeli forces open fire.Israeli forces kill 11 Palestinians awaiting food trucks, say Gaza officialsRead moreThe exact toll over the last 12 days is unclear. Medical authorities in Gaza say about 450 have died and thousands more have been injured. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) admit that some have been hurt by their fire but have not admitted any deaths in shootings, which they say are directed at “suspects” who have posed a threat to their forces and only ever follow warning shots.The GHF on Sunday said its model was working: “The Gaza health ministry, operated by Hamas, has been putting out false information on a daily basis which unfortunately media outlets have not verified before publishing.”But 10 witnesses interviewed by the Guardian last week all broadly corroborated reports of repeated lethal incidents involving high numbers of casualties, as do the records of medical aid groups working in Gaza.View image in fullscreenPalestinians with supplies from the GHF site at al-Bureij in the Gaza Strip on 8 June.Photograph: APA Images/ShutterstockWhen Ahmed came close to the GHF site north of al-Bureij, he heard “heavy but intermittent gunfire from tanks, artillery and quadcopters”. “As we got closer to the site, gunfire resumed and a shell fell just a few metres away from me, and then shrapnel scattered, some of which hit me in my chest, neck and leg,” Ahmed said.“I fell to the ground … I was trying to stop the blood flow from my neck using pieces of my clothes. My friends carried me a long distance until we reached the entrance of al-Bureij city, and there we found a car to take us to al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital.”The witnesses, many interviewed in hospital after being wounded, described similar scenarios.Between 27 May and 19 June, the Red Cross field hospital in Rafah received 1,874 “weapon-wounded patients” and recorded 18 “mass casualty incidents”, in which the vast majority of the patients reported to medical staff that they had been wounded while trying to access food at or near GHF sites.According to Médecins Sans Frontières, most of the 285 casualties treated at its primary health clinic in al-Mawasi, Khan Younis and the Red Cross field hospital in Rafah on 11 and 12 June had been seeking supplies at the GHF’s distribution sites. These included 14 people who were declared dead upon arrival or shortly after.EU cites ‘indications’ Israel is breaching human rights obligations over conduct in GazaRead moreFood has become extremely scarce in Gaza since Israel imposed a tight blockade on all supplies throughout March and April, threatening many of the 2.3 million people who live there with a“critical risk of famine”. A kilo of sugar now costs 60 times more than before the war and a 25kg bag of flour is up to $500. Fuel for cooking is scarce, fresh vegetables almost unobtainable for many and there is no fresh meat.Since the blockade was partly lifted last month, the UN has tried to bring in aid but it has faced major obstacles, including rubble-choked roads, Israeli military restrictions, continuing airstrikes and growing anarchy.Many of the deaths in recent weeks have occurred when rumours spread of the possible arrival of aid trucks sent into Gaza by the World Food Programme (WFP), which was recently given permission by Israel to use northern entry points to Gaza, allowing more direct access to the areas where the humanitarian crisis is most acute.But none of these deliveries have reached their destinations, all being stopped and offloaded, sometimes by criminal gangs but for the most part by desperate ordinary Palestinians, aid officials said.The WFP said on Wednesday it had beenable to dispatch just 9,000 tonnesof food aid into Gaza over the last four weeks, “a tiny fraction of what a population of 2.1 million hungry people needs”.Even those who obtain food are at risk. Once supplies at the hubs run out, some of those who came too late rob those leaving. Witnesses described adults beating and robbing children to take their food outside one of the three GHF hubs in Rafah. Thieves stabbed an older man in the arm when he tried to hold on to a sack of food, weeping that his children had no food, one said.Israel hopes the GHF will replace the previous comprehensive system of aid distribution run by the UN, which Israeli officials claim allowed Hamas to steal and sell supplies. A spokesperson said the IDF “will continue to facilitate humanitarian assistance in the Gaza Strip while making every effort to ensure that the aid does not reach the hands of the Hamas terrorist organisation”.UN agencies and major aid groups, which have delivered humanitarian aid across Gaza since the start of 20-month-long war, haverejected the new system, saying it is impractical, inadequate and unethical. They deny there is widespread theft of aid by Hamas.Aid workers in Gaza said some of the food provided by GHF was reaching Hamas, which has been seriously weakened but remains a significant actor in the increasingly fractured and chaotic territory. “They send people in to get it direct from the hubs, which is pretty simple because GHF are not vetting anyone,” said one senior UN official working in Gaza.Palestinian witnesses said Israeli troops fired to prevent crowds from moving past a certain point before the centres opened or because people left the road designated by the military.The IDF said its “operational conduct … is accompanied by systematic learning processes” and that it was looking into safety measures such as fences and road signs.In a statement on Sunday, the GHF said it had distributed 38m meals in Gaza “without injury or any fatalities at or near their site” though said there had been “unfortunate cases where some [seeking aid] have attempted dangerous shortcuts through active war zones or gotten lost.“Ultimately the solution is more aid, which will create more certainty and less urgency among the population. There is not yet enough capacity or food to feed everyone in need in Gaza. If the UN and other humanitarian organizations would join us we could scale aid across Gaza,” the GHF said.The war was triggered by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel, in which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage, of which 53 remain in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be still alive.The death toll in Gaza since the war broke out has reached 55,600, mostly civilians, according to the health ministry.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Adolescence, she says, has become like the wild westSun 22 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTShareReactions to Lauren Greenfield’s documentary seriesSocial Studiestend to fall into two categories. Young people think it is validating; adults think it’s a horror show. After all, the screen of a teenager’s smartphone is a shiny black hole to which access is rarely granted. “Our kids are right there,” as Greenfield puts it, “and yet we don’t really know what’s going on in their lives.”Her five-part series, which tracks the online and offline lives of a group of teenagers and young adults – the first generation of social media natives – is beingtipped for an Emmy. Under the noses of their parents, she captures teenagers climbing out of bedroom windows to spend the night with boyfriends, posting sexually explicit images, tracking their longest-ever fast (91 hours) and living out their experiences of rape, cyberbullying, whitewashing, the tyranny of Caucasian beauty standards and suicidal ideation. She makes adolescence look like the wild west.I was blaming my son for his screen time, and ended up feeling that’s like blaming an opium addict for their addiction“I really tried to go into this as a social experiment,” says Greenfield, speaking on a video call from the Fahey/Klein Gallery in Los Angeles, which is hosting a Social Studiesphotographic exhibitionuntil July. Initially she conducted more than 200 mini-interviews in high schools in LA, and then whittled these down to a cohort of about 25, who let her shoot them at home, at school, at parties, and in discussion groups over the course of the 2021-22 high school year. Crucially, they agreed to screen record, thereby sharing their online lives with Greenfield in real time. The result is a frenetic, immersive collage of a documentary, in which screens are overlaid on in-person lives. It is sometimes hard to keep pace, and hard to know where to look – but that is the point.Greenfield started out in anthropology; her first commission was for National Geographic, photographing Maya people in Mexico. Her mother, Patricia Marks Greenfield, a psychologist, was the writer. But after the project was dropped, she turned her gaze closer to home, to LA, where she grew up. Since her first monograph,Fast Forward: Growing Up in the Shadow of Hollywood, her work has focused on consumerism, extreme wealth, addiction and youth culture.The idea for Social Studies partly came from observing her youngest son Gabriel’s phone habits. He was 14 when she started filming the series. “We had constant battles about screen time.” Arguments? “Yes,” she says. “I never could control his access or see the content on his phone. He was super private about his phone, which is probably why I was so obsessed with getting into phones and really seeing what was in there.”View image in fullscreenGoing viral … Bella and Holly in Social Studies.Photograph: Lauren Greenfield/Institute/FXAlongside about 1,000 hours of documentary footage, Greenfield also captured 2,000 hours of screen-recorded content. Her son “helped to figure out the tech”. He was a year younger than most of the young people featured – and filming was personally confronting for Greenfield as a parent. Not least when she ran into him at a party she was filming.Making Social Studies has triggered her own evolution as a parent. “I was blaming my son for his screen time,” she says. “And I ended up feeling that’s like blaming an opium addict for their addiction.Social mediais made to be addictive – purposefully, for maximum engagement, and without any concern for the consequences.” Social Studies “brought me together with my teenager”, she says.Greenfield has previously said that she went into her 2002 monographGirl Culturewith an open mind “and came out a feminist”. (She later directed the#LikeAGirlSuper Bowl commercial.) Was the experience of filming Social Studies transformative too? Did she come out an activist?“I definitely came out thinking that we were giving a very unsafe environment to our young people and we needed to do something about it,” she says. “I did come out of it wanting to spread the word, raise awareness. It’s about collective action.”She hadn’t planned to include parents, which is interesting because those who do feature come off pretty badly. “All of the parents?” she asks me. All except Vito, who lovingly supports his children through transition and alternative education. But others come across as missing in action or nonplussed. A mother, whose daughter films thirst traps in her bedroom, says: “I really don’t want to look at Sydney’s TikTok.” A father stops his daughter using the app – by paying her $50 a day.View image in fullscreenRevelation after revelation … Lauren Greenfield at the Fahey Klein Gallery.Photograph: Jessica Pons/The Guardian“But they really represent all of us,” Greenfield says. “And not in a way where we can point a finger at them, but in a way where hopefully we are urged to reflect on ourselves. I mean, I didn’t know a lot of the questions to ask my own kids until I did this project.” When working on the project, she would go home and ask her sons – the eldest was 20 and already at college – “Have you heard of this BDSM trend?”For all the devastating revelations, there is humour here, too, as when one female participant says: “We don’t judge each other for [foot pics] but we also don’t feel super-empowered.” It is hard to tell if the teenagers are incredibly worldly or incredibly naive. “You start a TikTok to be in that TV show, movie-type life where everything comes easy for you,” says 17-year-old Keshawn, who soon after becomes a father.The shadow of Kim Kardashian looms large. Fittingly, her career tracks the arc of Greenfield’s own, since Greenfield shot a then unknown 12-year-old Kardashian for Fast Forward. In Social Studies, to nods of agreement, one girl announces: “I would release a sex tape if it made me viral.”Into the vacuum of adult regulation young people step, such as 20-year-old vigilante Anthony, who collects evidence from victims of assault and outs the perpetrators on social media. As he says, wisely and dispassionately: “I’m part of cancel culture. It kind of works. It kind of doesn’t work.”Greenfield implicates herself in the dynamic of absent adults. She asks the teenagers questions such as “Who here has been sent a dick pic? Who has gone viral?” (Pretty much everyone.) Dressed in unobtrusive navy, she is a peripheral presence, and the only adult hearing, receiving, capturing revelation after revelation.When kids set their parents’ screen time rules: ‘I hit my limit before I even get out of bed’Read moreShe initially thought about casting a therapist or teacher but “I realised it had to be me.” Though, she says: “I don’t like being in an authoritarian role at all.” Indeed, her presence sometimes feels like an absence, as when Sofia recounts her experience of being raped. Anthony helped her to gather evidence, but she hadn’t felt heard and validated by adults. In the most moving scene, Sydney reaches out and hooks Sofia’s fingers with her own.I wonder how Greenfield felt hearing a young woman share her experience of rape. Her attentive silence, while Sofia weeps, is notable. “Don’t I say, ‘Are you OK?’ and she says ‘Yeah, I’m OK’?” she asks.Greenfield does ask “OK?”, but as check-ins go, it’s pretty minimal. Given that she’s a parent, did it feel hard not to step into the space of the circle? “I mean, I thinkthatfelt very natural. If I could have avoided being in it altogether, I would have,” she says.So she didn’t go home burdened by the emotional weight of the stories she had documented?“It’s an interesting question.” She pauses. “I really love doing this work. It is so hard to get access and gain trust. When I’m hearing the stories, I’m so … fulfilled. My frustration is often if I can’t tell the story. When I can actually tell it, I’m so happy. A lot of the young people participated because they wanted to tell a story. And they got to tell that story.”View image in fullscreenVeronika, Tiffany and Michael on their way to the prom in Greenfield’s documentary Generation Wealth.Photograph: Lauren Greenfield/Courtesy of the Fahey/Klein GalleryGreenfield has also documented her own addiction to work. At one point in 2018’sGeneration Wealth, her 16-year-old son Noah tells her she’s a workaholic and a 10-year-old Gabriel holds up a piece of paper to the ever-present camera that says: “You have a problem.”In Social Studies, there is a sense in which Greenfield is present as a person who intimately knows, and was herself a childhood victim of, the addictive comparison culture she documents. In Girl Culture, she writes about her experience, aged six, of looking in the mirror and “realising that I was unimaginably ugly, and crying hysterically. I understood the pain and shame of not measuring up as a girl.” Maybe this girl, too, is in the circle in Social Studies.“That was also when my parents were splitting up,” she says. “So I think that was … maybe my origin trauma.” She would have found social media very hard as a teen. “I was super insecure as a teenager about my body, about fashion, about fitting in. And I was really looking to other kids. So I zeroed in on this [in Social Studies]. I think the 24/7 comparison culture is not just the end of innocence but the end of joy. You’re never happy with yourself.”It’s a trap to blame parents. The tech companies could make this completely different if they wanted to“What keeps me honest in my work is really coming from things that have affected me,” Greenfield says. Honesty is her medium – but not for too long on the subject of herself. When I ask about her arguments with her son, she says: “I feel it’s a trap to blame the parents. Really, the tech companies could make this completely different if they wanted to. These [apps] are made by humans, engineered to do exactly what they’re doing. They know so well what kids love, what will addict kids, they even know brain science, which I think used to be unethical – to use brain science in the creation of products for young people. We know from theTikTok research that was leakedthat [the app] is addictive in less than 35 minutes.“And I was really struck when I saw last year the Jim Henson movie, Idea Man,” she says. “The founder of Sesame Street – Joan Ganz Cooney – is talking about how they brought together artists who knew what kids loved – like Henson and the Muppet people – with educators who knew what kids needed to learn, and knew what was good for kids. And I was so moved by that,” she says. “It almost makes me want to cry.” Given her unflinching calm in the most emotional documentary scenes, I am surprised to see that her eyes are pink and she looks as if she really might cry. “Because it’s another time. When people cared about what young people were getting.”View image in fullscreenSydney in Social Studies.Photograph: Lauren Greenfield/FX/InstituteA few weeks ago, shewent to Sacramentowith some of Social Studies’ protagonists, to talk to senators. She has taken the series into schools. “I do feel [making Social Studies] has activated me,” she says.She mentions how the Australian government has banned social media for under-16s, and Common Sense Media’s campaign forhealth warnings on platforms. As Sydney points out in the series, once governments knew the dangers of smoking, they applied warnings. “In the US, it is unlikely that [regulation] will be done by government or tech, but there is a critical mass of parents and educators who are getting concerned,” Greenfield says.In the final episode of Social Studies, the group reflects on the experience of taking part. For many, holding a conversation without a phone – they had to leave them in a different room – was a rare liberation. “We all need to delete social media!” someone says – to the biggest round of applause. But the handclaps falter under existential questioning: “How do you get off social media without people forgetting that you exist?”We’ve given our communication to companies that are just thinking about their own profit“That really resonated with me,” Greenfield says. “They are showing us there’s a problem. They’re giving us a roadmap for how to solve it. But they can’t solve it on their own.” So what’s the roadmap? “We’ve given our communication to companies that not only don’t have our best interests in mind and are just thinking about their own profit but maybe have a political agenda. And that is terrifying. We need an independent form of communication where our information is not being marketed, sold.”Some kind of public platform, like a public utility? “Exactly. It’s a radical move to just say, ‘I’ll be off of [social media].’ As a person in the world, I can’t be off of it, either.” A public-service communication platform sounds like a pipe dream. Is it possible? “I feel like my job is to let people know what’s going on. I’m not a tech entrepreneur so I don’t know if it’s possible,” she says.But she is too invested to leave it there. “I do think it’s possible, actually,” she adds. “I absolutely think it is possible.”Social Studies is streaming on Disney+Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsLauren GreenfieldSocial mediaSmartphonesChildrenMobile phonesDigital mediainterviewsShareReuse this content"

Possibly several waves of enemy drones,” said a statement from Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration that urged people to stay in shelters.The attack injured at least five civilians, sparked fires in residential areas and damaged an entrance to a metro station, Ukrainian authorities said on Monday.Metro stations are used as bomb shelters in Ukraine during Russian attacks.Ukraine’s top military commander has vowed to increase the “scale and depth” of strikes on Russiain remarks made public on Sunday, saying Kyiv would not sit idly by while Moscow prolonged its three-year invasion. Diplomatic efforts to end the war have stalled in recent weeks. The last direct meeting between the two sides was almost three weeks ago and no follow-up talks have been scheduled. “We will not just sit in defence. Because this brings nothing and eventually leads to the fact that we still retreat, lose people and territories,” Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky told reporters including AFP.In wide-ranging remarks, Syrsky conceded that Russia had some advantages in drone warfare, particularly in making fibre-optic drones that are tethered and difficult to jam. “Here, unfortunately, they have an advantage in both the number and range of their use,” he said.About 10,000 Russian soldiers are fighting in Russia’s Kursk region, about 90 sq km (35 sq miles) of which is controlled by Ukraine, Ukraine’s top military commander said. “We control about 90 sq km of territory in the Hlushkov district of the Kursk region of the Russian Federation, and these are our preemptive actions in response to a possible enemy attack,” Oleksandr Syrsky said without elaborating, in remarks released by his office for publication on Sunday.This month, Russia’s wartime toll of dead and wounded reached a historic milestone:according to the British Ministry of Defence,more than one million Russian troops have been killed or injuredsince the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February 2022. Since the start of its war in Ukraine, Russia’s military casualties have remained a closely guarded state secret. But the signs of devastation are unmistakable – from the booming funeral industry to the rising number of veterans returning home without arms or legs.Russia’s defence ministry claimed forces had taken control of two villages in Ukraine– Petrovske in the eastern Kharkiv region and Perebuda in the Donetsk region.Ukrainesaid on Sunday that US and Israeli strikes on Iran were justified to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons, praising the military intervention as a “clear signal”. “Ukraine is convinced that Iran’s nuclear programme must be stopped so that it never again poses a threat to the countries of the Middle East or any other state,” the Ukrainian foreign ministry said.Meanwhile a senior Russian official said on Sunday that Trump had started a new war by attacking Iranthat would only strengthen Tehran’s leaders by consolidating society around supreme leader Ali Khamenei. The Kremlin, which has a strategic partnership with Iran and also maintains close links to Israel, had repeatedly cautioned Washington that US strikes on Iran would plunge the entire region into the “abyss”.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussia-Ukraine war at a glanceEuropeRussiaexplainersShareReuse this content"

As ever, Dickinson spends much of the set on top of the backline, acting out characters, Steve Harris machine-guns the audience with his bass while playing his “galloping” lines, and Janick Gers, when not swinging his guitar around, sticks his left leg in the air and rests it on the stage side speakers. No idea why. But he always does it. And, of course, the song subjects are the contents of a 12-year-old’s head: the Battle of Britain (Aces High); crazy mental powers (The Clairvoyant); Satan (The Number of the Beast). You get the picture.The one deviation from usual, Dickinson informs us, is that this is as near as Maiden get to a greatest hits show: the most recent song tonight, Fear of the Dark, dates from 1992. For the less committed, that is a good thing. Maiden have a tendency to be windy, and this format – their early songs were generally shorter and sharper – helps with that, though it doesn’t eliminate it entirely. Rime of the Ancient Mariner lasts nearly as long as a cross-channel ferry, and you can’t even buy duty free to pass the time.Age is starting to show, too: Dickinson’s famous “air-raid siren” voice is still a thing of range and power, but it is more “car-alarm voice” now. And in this echoey, sweltering arena, some of the complexities of the sound are lost (the mix leaves new drummer Simon Dawson so low at times that one loses the beat; guitar solos are mixed so high the rest of the band sometimes disappear behind them), which is frustrating.But what an institution: a band whose career has been constructed absolutely on their own terms without a single compromise, something few artists can manage. And, of course, Birmingham screams for them, long and loud.Iron Maiden tour England and Ireland until 30 JuneExplore more on these topicsPop and rockIron MaidenreviewsShareReuse this content"

She died before she could receive them. My sister died at 11am and I got a text from the florist saying they’d delivered the flowers at 11.30am – how ridiculous. They must have sat on her doorstep for days.I got the call as I was walking through the doors at Emerald airport in Queensland, about to fly home to Brisbane. My stepdad rang me and said, “I need to talk to you about something – your sister’s died.” I was like, “What? What do you mean?” I told him I was about to hop on a plane home and that I’d call him when I got on the ground. I hung up, stunned.I kind of held it together until we had to walk out to the airstrip, when I realised I was walking towards my sister’s death. It was horrible. I sat down on the plane, sobbing. One of the flight attendants knelt down next to me and asked if there was anything he could do to help. I said, “My sister has just died, I don’t think anyone can help.” He just held my hand and said, “We’ll get you back to Brisbane.”The kindness of strangers: I was crying at the airport carousel, then a couple offered a simple solutionRead moreHe didn’t try to tell me everything will be all right, because it clearly wouldn’t have been. Just, “We’ll get you back to Brisbane.” Throughout the flight he brought my water, checked in on me and helped me get off the plane quickly when we landed.One might say that’s his job. But it wasn’t, actually. It was so above and beyond what he needed to do as cabin crew, especially on a short flight where everyone’s just trying to get it over and done with. He was really gentle, kind and sweet. If he hadn’t been there I would have just sat there sobbing on my own – certainly the person sitting next to me didn’t engage at all, not that I blame them for that.The flight attendant made me feel as though I wasn’t alone on that plane. When I think about my sister now, I think of him.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceFrom making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

But her largest headline show in the UK – part of a five-date UK and Ireland tour climaxing at Glastonbury – suggests her outlier-country is now legitimately mainstream here. Her No 1 album withElton Johnplayed no small part and this setlist paid gracious tribute to her collaborator. She even serenaded him with a yearningly harmonised version of its title track as he sat in his box like a silent angel.Despite his retirement Elton seemed a constant presence on stage, from the 80s pop-rock of Swing for the Fences to his protege’s patter about a recent dinner with David. He even approved the tie to go with her natty black suit, although not her cover of Joni Mitchell’s A Case of You. She sang it anyway – sparingly solo, with woozy panache.Elton may have encouraged Carlile towards her recent rockier sound but it’s a gear she has always had. Few artists are so authentically versatile they could open with a lush and timeless crooner ballad, entreating us to Stay Gentle, then immediately unleash the hot-rubber-and-leather vibes of Broken Horses.Her clarinet-smooth voice stretched to ever greater technical feats throughout the night, until ululations turned to screams and individual notes threatened to hang forever in the ceiling. A fingerpicking acoustic medley paired two her greatest songs about motherhood, and their Art Garfunkel tenderness unleashed waves of catharsis in the largely female audience.On their feet for Hold Out Your Hand – half Lumineers, half Charlie Daniels Band – the mom rockers were less confident as Carlile ventured into grungier territory and by the time she was duelling guitars with the Hanseroth Twins they seemed a little lost. The show’s landing was its sole stumble: a dazzling but late interlude by violin and cello duo SistaStrings indicated that Carlile was on the move, and up she popped up in Elton’s box, spotlit by a condenser mic, her BFF sitting silently beside her.Was it worth the effort? By the time she had raced back for her closer, the show had lost momentum and an expected encore (the house lights staying defiantly down) never came. Still, a minor quibble of an artist who shines just as bright without the reflected sparkle of her diamond-bright duetting partner.Brandi Carlile is touring the UK and Ireland until 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsPop and rockBrandi CarlileElton JohnRoyal Albert HallreviewsShareReuse this content"

They’ve attained high roles in the company on merit, and that’s how it should be. It’s not the same as it was in the 70s.LivvyStudies have shown that if you have a CV with a female name on it, and a CV with a male name on it, the male will get more interviews.JulianMaybe there is unconscious bias – that would be wrong and I wouldn’t try to defend that in any way. The bit we honed in on was if women take some time to have family, then their careers are effectively stagnating. For me, positive discrimination is a red line, because it is still discrimination, and you might have discriminated against somebody who is better for the job. I just can’t settle with that feeling fair.LivvyI know I’m less likely to get a job because I’m a woman, and of child-bearing age.

Some of it is fundamental – if I’d sat down with someone who’d said, “This race of people is terrible”, I would have called a taxi. But there are some differences where you need to be able to see the other person’s side of the story. They’re not evil, or wrong – this is just what they’ve taken from their life experience.JulianMore people need to do this.

He talks about challenging perceptions, being detained by the FBI and ‘redefining the idea of the everyman’Sun 22 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTShareAdecade ago, it would have been rare to have an Asian actor playing the British prime minister or leader of the opposition. But in the space of a couple of years, Adeel Akhtar has done both. He was the PM in the Netflix dramaBlack Doves, which took the world by storm last year, and now he’s stepping into the shoes of a man vying to be leader of the opposition at London’s National Theatre.For Akhtar, who has been working as an actor for more than two decades, there has been an undeniable shift in the kind of roles he’s been offered in recent years. The British Asian experience is no longer a niche subject.“I wouldn’t dream of being offered these types of roles previously,” the 44-year-old tells me when we meet at the National during a Friday lunchtime. “We’re sort of redefining the idea of what an everyman can or should be. We’re suddenly in a situation for it not to be a massive thing to be Asian and to be the prime minister; it’s just accepted. You can be critiqued in the same way as anyone else, and it doesn’t matter what your heritage is. Which really wasn’t the case when I first started out. You would find yourself playing a particular type of role over and over again.”View image in fullscreenSpy master … Adeel Akhtar as the British prime minister in Black Doves.Photograph: NetflixOf course that reflects changes in both British politics – we are, after all, living in the wake of “Dishy Rishi” in No 10 – as well as evolving attitudes to casting. From Meera Syal to Riz Ahmed to Dev Patel, we’re seeing more brown actors stepping into roles where their ethnicity and background are merely incidental, and not the main focus.“I’m blessed to be able to present some really complicated ideas, and help move conversations on. Working at the National has always been a massive dream,” Akhtar says.He plays the lead inThe Estate, which premieres in early July. Directed by Daniel Raggett and written by Shaan Sahota (a full-time doctor in the NHS), the play explores fictional MP Angad Singh’s attempt to become leader of his party.For Akhtar, it is an opportunity to probe biases within cultures, politics and society. Singh finds out he doesn’t have his party’s backing, and interrogates the reasons behind that. At the same time, he learns that he has inherited his father’s entire estate, while his sisters “have been completely overlooked”.The play is based on Sahota’s own experiences of growing up in a south Asian community, but Angad’s personal sphere is distinct from his political sphere – it doesn’t influence his running for leader, and his politics isn’t affected by his heritage.View image in fullscreenBest foot forward … Adeel Akhtar.Photograph: Sarah CresswellAkhtar may not be a household name yet, but it feels as if he’s been in everything. His recent credits are like a roll-call of every massive show on TV over the past few years: Utopia, The Night Manager, Killing Eve, Sweet Tooth, Sherwood, Fool Me Once, Showtrial. He has also starred in films including The Big Sick, The Nest and 2021’scritically acclaimed Ali & Ava.I wait for Akhtar in a small meeting room within the network of nondescript tunnels of theNational Theatrebuilding. When he arrives, it’s like seeing an old acquaintance. He’s wearing a loose blazer from the Salvation Army, rolled-up khakis and a pair of black trainers he “bought for £30 online”. A faded cap sits askew on his head, giving him the look of a mischievous schoolkid.Akhtar’s dark, hooded eyes and turned-down mouth mean he’s described as “hangdog” in almost every interview he’s given, but they’re also what make him so relatable. He tells me people often stop him when he’s out and about for “pleasant chats” like they would with a pal. What do they want to talk about?“Oh, everything,” he says. “The themes of the shows I’m in, my performance. Particularly Sherwood, which seemed to elicit a huge reaction from people.” Akhtar’s devastating portrayal of a man who hides in the forest after killing his son’s wife in James Graham’s crime drama has often been referred to as a show-stealing performance.Born in London to a Pakistani father (one of Britain’s first Black immigration officers) and an Indo-Kenyan mother, Akhtar knew early on that he wanted to be an actor. As a child he attended speech and drama classes because his parents believed they were elocution lessons that could teach him to “speak properly”. It was here, during a reading of Lewis Carroll’s poem Jabberwocky, that he found his love for performing. He went to boarding school in Cheltenham, where he was one of just a handful of brown kids and had stones thrown at him, then did a law degree due to pressure from his father, before retraining at the Actors Studio drama school in New York.View image in fullscreenSomething to crow about … Adeel Akhtar in Four Lions in 2010.Photograph: Film4/AllstarIt was in 2002, on his way to audition for the drama school, that he experienced a life-changing incident. Upon arrival at JFK, a fleet of FBI cars pulled up alongside the plane, handcuffed him and took him away. They hadmistaken him for a terror suspect.“I was detained for hours,” he says. “This was just post 9/11, so everything you’re doing is suspicious and triggering, just because of the colour of your skin.” It was a harrowing experience that sparked years of reflection. “For ages my name was on the system, so every time I travelled to the States I’d set off an alarm and have to be questioned.”It is ironic that his first film role that same year was as a 9/11 hijacker in Let’s Roll: The Story of Flight 93. But Akhtar has said his experience has actually informed some of the work he’s chosen to take on, that he’s drawn to stories about people who lack a safety net and put their misguided faith in systems that don’t serve them.His first major role came a few years later, aged 30, in Chris Morris’s 2010 cult classicFour Lions. Akhtar played a bumbling Muslim extremist who accidentally blows himself up in a field of sheep.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We were in a situation where we were terrified of the Muslim community, both here and in America. And the film was so irreverent, it just took the teeth out of it. It portrayed these young men as buffoons, clowns, not something to be feared. Because it doesn’t matter if it’s a bunch of young Muslim lads, or young white lads or whatever, you just get lads in a room and it’s going to be a shitshow.”Despite the success of the film – fans still shout its most famous line “Rubber dinghy rapids bro!” at Akhtar – the offers failed to come in, and the actor found himself living in a van and desperately searching for work. About that time, he had his beard yanked by a stranger in the street and, on another occasion, a group of men started shouting racist slurs at him when he was with his wife, the director Alexis Burke.But if Akhtar is holding on to any residual anger, he doesn’t show it. “Even as a teenager, I refused to let anybody tell me I was just one thing, because it’s false,” he says. “If I feel upset by those experiences it means they’ve won. Whatever they were trying to make me feel worked. The only option is to blankly refuse that. I’m lucky now I can look back on it, with the career that I’ve had, and interrogate it in different ways.” In fact, he adds, he often draws on his own life in his work. “I’m always working that way. I ask: what do I have in my experience that is close or approximate to this character?”View image in fullscreenShow-stealing … Adeel Akhtar in Sherwood.Photograph: Neil Sherwood/BBC/House ProductionsAkhtar has the ability to make you root for his characters, no matter how shocking their actions. He won his first Bafta for his performance as the Muslim father who murders his daughter and then kills himself in the BBC Three drama Murdered By My Father, making him the first non-white man to win the lead actor gong (he was previously nominated for Utopia, and has since won a best supporting actor Bafta for Sherwood). It’s an event the actor calls “bittersweet … You can’t not celebrate winning a massive award. I was happy and proud of making it happen, but there was also this overwhelming feeling of it being strange. We’ve been here for a really long time, so 2017 seemed pretty late in the day to start noticing British Asian actors.”He has become so sought after that his nickname in the business is Ideal Actor, a play on his name. Does he feel vindicated in his decision to stick with acting, despite those years in the van? “There was never an option of not doing so, because the alternative was returning to a life of law.” What kind of lawyer does he think he would have been? He laughs. “Oh, a terrible one.”Over time, the resentment Akhtar once felt towards his father for pushing him into that degree has evolved into understanding. “I’ve got kids myself now, an eight- and six-year-old, and I totally get it. My dad came up against a lot of struggles, pain and discomfort. It’s the job of a parent to make sure your children don’t feel that. He was going to do everything in his power to mitigate against it.”We discuss that common immigrant experience, of feeling you have to make sacrifices for your parents because of the huge sacrifice they made for you. In fact, he says, he has come to believe that cultural assimilation is the greatest act of creative expression. Even if they couldn’t understand his career choices, he feels he can trace his talent for creativity straight back to his parents.View image in fullscreenA big Adeel … Akhtar in 2017 with his Bafta for best leading actor for Murdered By My Father.Photograph: Joel Ryan/AP“I’m writing a film at the moment which is loosely based on my mum and her experience of coming over from east Africa,” he explains. “I was working out why I was drawn to this story. I was thinking of her leaving Nairobi as a 16-year-old. How she got on a plane and flew over. The only thing she could hold on to was this faint idea of what her life could be, and the only thing at her disposal to meet that vision was her sheer will. It’s like being in front of an open canvas, or the first page of a novel. There’s nothing more terrifying than looking at a horizon and it being blank, with nothing to orient you.”He dwells on this. “Maybe that’s why I stuck with the acting on some level, because I saw in my parents the tenacity and will to meet your objective,” he adds.The Estate is Akhtar’s second play in two years, after starring in Anton Chekhov’sThe Cherry Orchardat London’s Donmar Warehouse last year, and he says he would love to do more. It reminds him why he wanted to act in the first place. “It’s just you and the audience. The thing that makes it terrifying is the thing that makes it so fulfilling.”Is there anything specific he hopes audiences will take away from The Estate? “We’re so multiplicitous as individuals, I just hope people have an insight into an experience they otherwise wouldn’t have been exposed to. In this instance, it’s seeing someone who is British Asian in a way they wouldn’t necessarily have seen them before. You want people to bypass the nonsense questions – like why is this person in this position? – and get to the proper questions, like am I feeling something true?”The Estateis at the National Theatre: Dorfman, London, 9 July to 23 August.Explore more on these topicsTheatreTelevisionNational TheatreFour LionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Later photograph: Pål Hansen/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Grooming: Neusa Neves at Arlington Artists using Shiseido. Archive photograph: Andrew CotterillHard-Fi formed in 2003 in Staines, Surrey. Frontman Richard Archer, guitarist Ross Phillips, bassist Kai Stephens and drummer Steve Kemp released their debut album, Stars of CCTV, in 2005. Featuring Cash Machine, Hard to Beat and Living for the Weekend, it reached No 1 in the UK, sold 1.2m copies worldwide and earned Brit awards and a Mercury prize nomination. The band released two further albums before going on hiatus in 2014. They reunited in 2022 and released a new EP in 2024.Richard (front)This shoot was for an interview in the Big Issue. I still wear those clothes now, but back then a good jacket or pair of sunglasses was a suit of armour. With the right pair of shades, I could face the Terminator.The more extrovert elements of being a frontman didn’t always come naturally, so at times I was playing a larger-than-life character. I wasn’t that confident performing – not to the extent I’d puke up backstage, but I’d get nervous and try too hard. I was also a bit gobbier and swearier back then. A lot of people thought I was off my face on coke, which I wasn’t. Adrenaline is powerful stuff.After our third record, the label said: ‘We’re not going to make another album with you’I often had this outsider feeling – as if there was a party going on we weren’t invited to. We’d go out in Staines rather than Camden, but, even though we weren’t part of the “scene”, our shows kept selling out. By 2006, it felt like we were on a train that was getting faster and faster. For years, we’d tour and do promo, with no days off – all of which was exciting but exhausting. The whole time I thought: “We can’t stop, we can’t screw it up.” There was so much pressure that I didn’t get a chance to stop and soak it in.After our third record, the label said: “We’re not going to make another album with you.” I wanted to keep the band going, but the energy wasn’t there any more. Ross had his first child, money was getting tight and I realised we should move on. In the years since, I’ve been writing and producing for other artists.In 2020, I got in touch with the guys and suggested we do something. I was thinking, “Will people actually turn up?”, but we sold out the Kentish Town Forum in 10 minutes. And here we are!Steve (far left)I had never worn a flat cap in my life. It was not my thing, so I felt self-conscious. But this was 2005 – I felt self-conscious permanently. I was almost certainly thinking: “Right, a flat cap, is it? I’ll just stand here and try to look tough.”Before Hard-Fi, I was on the dole. I’d go in and say: “We’ve got meetings at a record label, the band might actually happen.” They’d reply: “Sure. Have you thought about getting a job at HMV?” When we signed to Atlantic in December 2004, the dole office thought I was making it up. I was shocked, too – so much so that I wanted to hide my portion of the advance in a pillow case. That approach continued whenever the band had success. As soon as anything good happened, I couldn’t celebrate. I just felt fear.Paris Hilton looked me up and down, twice, then turned and walked awayOur debut album was recorded in a taxi office covered in cheap asbestos tiles that looked as if they’d been painted yellow, but it was nicotine. They’d turn to dust if you touched them, and there were rats living in the roof. It was grim, a really nasty place. All of which made the more glamorous parts of the band more surreal. James Blunt invited us to a party at his place once. I was introduced to Paris Hilton. She looked me up and down, twice, then turned and walked away.Being in Hard-Fi is half family, half military operation. Rich is the colonel. I am the sergeant – I crack the whip. Ross is a private – “Yes, sir!” – and Kai is more likely to be awol. We are solid, but we can bicker about all sorts. I get wound up the easiest. I get the hump about anything.After the group went on hiatus, I wanted to use my brain, so I ended up retraining as a nutritionist. Do I help the band eat healthily now? Not remotely.Twenty years later, I am still the same guy. Although, these days I would have the confidence to say no to the flat cap.Kai (far right)Those Versace shades definitely helped me get into character.When I joined the group, I realised I was probably not in the best place for what could be a really exciting opportunity. I wasn’t getting enough sleep or living my best life, so I had to sharpen up and straighten out. I had a lot of respect for Richard, I had come across Steve at university, and I got on with Ross straight away – we were both just lads from Staines.Before Hard-Fi, I was doing pest control. We used my van for some of those early gigs, and, as I had tough guts, I wasn’t bothered by much. Once someone dropped something down a toilet and I grabbed it out with my hand. When the taxi office had an ant infestation, I said: “Why do you think they’re here? It’s not for the tunes. There’s sugar everywhere.”I feel positive about life now, but mixed about what’s happening with the bandWhen our first single made the Top 20, I couldn’t believe it was happening. Looking back, I don’t think I responded well. Artistically I stepped up to the plate, but personally I lost the plot. My impostor syndrome was huge, and I was dealing with it by becoming dependent on alcohol. There wasn’t much talk about addiction back then. To some extent, it was encouraged by the industry.After we were dropped, we had a good break from each other for a fair few years. During that time, I went on a real journey – bad habits returning, and losing a loved one. But I also got the chance to become a good father.I feel positive about life now, but mixed about what’s happening with the band. As much as it’s exciting to live a bit of 2005 again, because of the crazy curve I’ve been on, there’s apprehension there, too.Ross (second left)We were considered “urban” by the press, so most of our early shoots were done in car parks or bus shelters – anywhere that looked grimy. This one would have been a pleasant change. My outfit is standard Hard-Fi clobber – a black polo and army surplus. I felt comfortable in that – ready to go.Broadcaster Angela Rippon looks back: ‘I want to age disgracefully. It’s much more fun’Read moreI was only 21 when Hard-Fi took off, and the last one to join. I was nervous, but they were an easy bunch of fellas. I’m the youngest of three siblings, I go with the flow, and I applied that same mentality to being in Hard-Fi. It’s almost impossible to wind me up. Only my kids can – they’ve got special skills.I’d forgotten how much I loved playing. But it is a different dynamic this time aroundIn 2005, we were out every night and away from home for months on end. It was great, but I found doing red carpets stressful. Even after four pints, I look like I’m thinking: “Ahh. What the fuck.”When the third album came around, I started having kids and I thought it was time to get a job. Music stopped for me for a few years – my guitars were put in a cupboard to keep them away from the kids. As we started up the group again, I realised I had forgotten how much I loved playing. But it is a different dynamic this time around. Back then I was just making music. I had zero responsibilities. I knew absolutely nothing at all.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleFlashbackPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No wonder they are scared about where this all might leadSun 22 Jun 2025 08.29 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 15.13 EDTShareEarlier this month, theNew Statesman publisheda long and fascinating article by its newly installed editor, Tom McTague, about the prime minister. Much of it was an account of a dogged hunt for something that never really materialised: some idea of what Keir Starmer believes in. The closest McTague got was an answer to a question about ideals Starmer thinks of as sacrosanct. “Human dignity,” he said. “The dignity of the individual. And the respect that goes with it.”Successful politicians are often distinguished by their ability to hold completely contradictory beliefs, and Starmer is clearly no exception. After months of outrage and protest – and whispers about ministerial resignations, given more credence by the return to the backbenches of theLabour whip Vicky Foxcroft– he and his government are seemingly more committed than ever to reforms to disability and sickness benefits that will soon come to a vote in the House of Commons. The people these changes will tip into an everyday nightmare are already terrified. Quite where a belief in human dignity fits into all this is a question that answers itself.A huge part of the government’s plans centres on the tightening of eligibility for the part of personal independence payments (or Pip) known as the daily living component. Assessments are based on acumulative score, which adds together ratings for “descriptors” of living activities based on a scale from zero to eight. They include such bald representations of abilities as “can prepare and cook a simple meal” and “needs physical help to be able to manage toilet needs”. In thenew system, people will have to score at least one rating of four to qualify for the daily living component, which will rule out thousands who experience complicated but very real issues – autism and learning disabilities, for example, tend to be manifested in lots of twos and threes – and threaten to tip their lives into financial freefall.Asummaryfrom Citizens Advice speaks volumes: “Someone who needs assistance to cut up food, wash their hair and body below the waist, use the toilet and dress/undress their lower body wouldn’t receive Pip under the new rules.” These changes are grim enough, but there are more: chiefly, thehacking backof the so-called health element of universal credit. The Pip reforms will have knock-on effects for people’s eligibility for this benefit: many who are refused one are likely to be denied the other. The rate for new claimants whose applications are granted will be cut from £97 a week to £50, and then frozen for four years. The entitlement age is also being raised,from 18 to 22.And so, as the government insists that “those who can work should work”, this cruelty charter goes on. Reduced Pip entitlements look set to affect whether lots of people’s family members are entitled to carer’s allowance, which is now £83.30 a week. After rumblings about partial retreats, the only clear change to what was originally floated is an increase in the transition period from people forced off Pip from four to13 weeks. The arrival point, needless to say, will remain the same: huge losses of income for hundreds of thousands of households – some of whom, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, will be as much as£12,000 a year worse off.Amid predictions of a big parliamentary revolt and wild speculation that the vote could even be pulled, it is worth thinking about how Labour’s collective belief in the dignity of labour regularly curdles into two toxic ways of thinking. One is a belief that paid employment is the only reliable gauge of people’s esteem; the other is a queasiness about disability that sometimes lurks just below the surface. There is also an apparently desperate need to counter any suggestion that Labour ministers are liberal fainthearts. In March, the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, offered acurt explanationof why the government was set on its plan: “This is the Labour party. The clue is in the name. We believe in work.”Such banal obstinacy gets in the way of any deep understanding of the issues swirling around this story. Since the pandemic, the number of Pip awards hasmore than doubled. Much of this is to do with an epidemic of anxiety and depression, not least among the young. That shines light on something politicians rarely talk about, which also includes the kind of long-term health conditions that blur into disability: the fact that millions of people were damaged by both Covid-19 and the lockdowns it triggered. Research by theNew Economics Foundationalso suggests that although many disabled people usually claim no benefits at all, the cost of living crisis pushed them into applying for Pip, and therefore shoved up the benefits bill. These, needless to say, are all complex stories that demand careful answers; what the government is proposing, by contrast, amounts to the insane idea that you can immiserate people out of their problems.Meanwhile, a very convenient theory is gaining ground. Over the past six months, we have heard more and more about the alleged modern scourge of “overdiagnosis”. Words of sympathy and support for such ideas have come from – among others –Nigel Farage, Kemi Badenoch and theheath secretary, Wes Streeting. And this school of thought now has a set text:The Age of Diagnosisby the consultant neurologist Suzanne O’Sullivan, which has receivedrave reviews, and become one of this year’s most fashionable books.It presents as a measured and nuanced exploration of everything from Lyme disease to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but it can easily be read as an elegant justification for taking some people’s claims of disability and illness with a pinch of salt. She insists, for example, that “a psychosomatic explanation for people with long Covid has not featured nearly enough in public discourse”. This point is surrounded by caveats and qualifications, and reminders that illness triggered in the mind can be just as debilitating as ailments with physical causes. But her book makes it far too easy for bad actors to strip those nuances away, and lean into a cruelly dismissive attitude that perfectly suits culture warriors, and politicians who want to hack back public spending.A lot of what she has to say about human psychology, moreover, reflects themisplaced ideathat particular conditions sit on a simple continuum that goes from severe to mild, and it might be in everyone’s interests to tell those on the “mild” end that the labels they claim are doing them more harm than good. As O’Sullivan sees it, diagnoses of autism (which she describes as a “brain disorder”) “might become a self-fulfilling prophecy as some will take the diagnosis to mean they can’t do certain things, so won’t even try”. There is a strong whiff here of the crass logic the government wants to apply to the benefits system, and the same implied message: buck up, be resilient, get back to work.People are scared. For many, the prospect of disabled people being so impoverished is part of what made last week’s vote for assisted dying more than a little unsettling. Changes to special needs education will materialise in the autumn, and there have been whispers and briefings about the restriction of disabled children and young people’s most basic legal rights. It all seems to confirm that whatever a progressive approach to disability and human difference looks like, Starmer and his people are speeding off in the opposite direction. The idea that the people at the top believe in “the dignity of the individual”, in other words, is looking more threadbare by the day.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDisabilityOpinionBenefitsWelfarecommentShareReuse this content"

His reckless gamble makes a nuclear weapon for Iran more, not less, likelySun 22 Jun 2025 07.28 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 11.46 EDTShareBombing will not make Iran go away. US bombs will not destroy the knowhow needed to build a nuclear weapon or the will do so, if that is what Tehran wants. Thehuge attackordered by Donald Trump will not halt ongoing open warfare between Israel and Iran. It will not bring lasting peace to the Middle East, end the slaughter in Gaza, deliver justice to the Palestinians, or end more than half a century of bitter enmity between Tehran and Washington.More likely, Trump’s rash, reckless gamble will inflame and exacerbate all these problems. Depending on how Iran and its allies and supporters react, the region could plunge into an uncontrolled conflagration. US bases in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere in the region, home toabout 40,000 American troops, must now be considered potential targets for retaliation – and possiblyBritish and allied forces, too.Trump says he has not declared war onIran. He claims the attack is not an opening salvo in a campaign aimed at triggering regime change in Tehran. But that’s not how Iran’s politicians and people will see it. Trump’s premature bragging about “spectacular” success, and threats of more and bigger bombs, sound like the words of a ruthless conqueror intent on total, crushing victory.Trump, the isolationist president who vowed to avoid foreign wars, has walked slap bang into a trap prepared by Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu – a trap his smarter predecessors avoided. Netanyahu has constantly exaggerated the immediacy of the Iranian nuclear threat. His alarmist speeches on this subjectgo back 30 years. Always, he claimed to know what UN nuclear inspectors, US and European intelligence agencies and even some of his own spy chiefs did not – namely, that Iran was on the verge of deploying a ready-to-use nuclear weapon aimed at Israel’s heart.The warmongers were wrong about Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. Now watch them make the same mistake about Iran | Owen JonesRead moreThis contention has never been proven. Iran has always denied seeking a nuclear bomb. Its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,issued a fatwabanning any such programme. Netanyahu’s most recent claim that Iran was weaponising, made as he tried to justify last week’s unilateral, illegal Israeli attacks, was not supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) or US intelligence experts. But weak-minded Trump chose to believe it. Reading from Netanyahu’s script, he said on Saturday night thateliminating this incontrovertible nuclear threatwas vital – and the sole aim of the US air assault.So, once again, the US has gone to war in the Middle East on the back of a lie, on disputed, probably faulty intelligence purposefully distorted for political reasons. Once again, as in Iraq in 2003, the overall objectives of the war are unclear, uncertain and open to interpretation by friend and foe alike. Once again, there appears to be no “exit strategy”, no guardrails against escalation and no plan for what happens next. Demanding that Iran capitulate or face “national tragedy” is not a policy. It’s a deadly dead-end.Iran will not go away, whatever Trump and Netanyahu may imagine in their fevered dreams. It will remain a force in the region. It will remain a country to be reckoned with, a country of 90 million people, and one with powerful allies in China, Russia and the global south. It is already insisting it will continue with its civil nuclear programme.These events are a reminder of how profound is official US ignorance of Iran. Unlike the UK, Washington has had no diplomatic presence there since the revolution. It has had few direct political contacts, and its swingeing economic sanctions have created even greater distance, further diminishing mutual understanding. Trump’s decision to renege on the2015 nuclear accord(negotiated by Barack Obama, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the EU) was a product of this ignorance. Ten years later, he is trying to do with bombs what was largely, peacefully achieved through diplomacy by his wiser, less impulsive, less easily led predecessors.View image in fullscreenA 2025 satellite image shows the Fordow nuclear enrichment plant, north-east of Qom, Iran.Photograph: Maxar Technologies Handout/EPAPeace seems more elusive than ever – and Netanyahu is celebrating. The US cannot walk away now. It’s committed. And, as Netanyahu sees it,he and Israel cannot lose. Except, except … Iran cannot somehow be imagined away. It still has to be dealt with. And the reckoning that now looms, short- and long-term, may be more terrible than any of Netanyahu’s scare stories.Iran previously warned that if the US attacked, it would hit back at US bases. There aremany to choose from, in Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan and elsewhere. The Houthis in Yemen say they will resume attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. The strait of Hormuz, so important a transit point for global energy supplies, may be mined, as happened in the 1980s during the Iran-Iraq war. The result could be a global oil shock and markets meltdown. And Iran is still reportedly firing missiles into Israel, despite claims in Jerusalem that most of its ballistic missiles bases have been destroyed.Reacting to Trump’s attack, Iranian officials sayno options are off the tablein terms of retaliation. And they say they will not negotiate under fire, despite acall to do sofrom the British prime minister, Keir Starmer. Rejecting Trump’s unverified claims about the total destruction of all nuclear facilities, they also insist Iran will reconstitute and continue its nuclear programme. The big question now is whether that programme really will be weaponised.Trump, Netanyahu and Khamenei – three angry old men who could get us all killed | Simon TisdallRead moreTwo radical longer-term consequences may flow from this watershed moment. One is that Khamenei’s unpopular regime, notorious for corruption, military incompetence and economic mismanagement, and deprived of support from Lebanese Hezbollah and Hamas in Gaza, may crack under the strain of this disaster. So far there has been little sign of an uprising or a change in government. That’s not surprising, given that Tehran and other cities are under bombardment. Butregime collapsecannot be ruled out.The other is that, rather than surrender the cherished right to uranium enrichment and submit to the Trump-Netanyahu ultimatum, Iran’s rulers, whoever they are, will decide to follow North Korea and try to acquire a bomb as quickly as possible, to fend off future humiliations. That could entail withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and rejection of the UN inspections regime. After years of trying to play by western rules, Iran could reallyfinally go rogue.The supposed need to acquire nukes for self-defence is a grim lesson other countries around the world may draw from these events. The proliferation of nuclear weapons is thebiggest immediate dangerto the future of the planet. What Trump just did in recklessly and violently trying to eliminate an unproven threat may ensure the proven danger of a nuclear-armed world grows ever-more real.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsIranOpinionTrump administrationIsraelUS foreign policyDonald TrumpUS militaryMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Now history is repeating itselfSun 22 Jun 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 19.57 EDTShareIn May 2003, George W Bush landed on the deck of a US aircraft carrier to deliver a triumphant speech, declaring that majorcombat operations in Iraqhad ended – six weeks after he had ordered US troops to invade the country. Bush spoke under a now infamous banner on the carrier’s bridge that proclaimed, “Mission Accomplished”. It would turn into a case study of American hubris and one of the most mocked photo-ops in modern history.As Bush made his speech off the coast of San Diego, I was in Baghdad covering the invasion’s aftermath as a correspondent for a US newspaper. It was clear then that the war was far from over, and the US was likely to face a grinding insurgency led by former members of the Iraqi security forces. It would also soon become clear that Bush’s rationale for invading Iraq was built on a lie: Saddam Hussein’s regime did not haveweapons of mass destructionand was not intent on developing them. And Iraq had nothing to do with the September 11 terrorist attacks on the US, despite the Bush administration’s repeated attempts toconnect Hussein’s regimeto al-Qaida.Today,Donald Trumphas dragged the US into another war based on exaggerations and manipulated intelligence: the Israel-Iran conflict, which began on 13 June when Israel launched a surprise attack killing some of Iran’s top military officials and nuclear scientists, and bombing dozens of targets across the country.The Guardian view on Trump bombing Iran: an illegal and reckless act | EditorialRead moreThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, claimed that Israel had to attack because Tehran was working to weaponize its stockpile of enriched uranium and racing to build a nuclear bomb. “If not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time,”Netanyahu said, as the first wave of Israeli bombs fell on Iran. “It could be a year. It could be within a few months.”Before dawn on Sunday, US warplanes and submarines bombed three major nuclear facilities inIran. In a speech from the White House, Trump declared the operation a “spectacular military success” and said the sites had been “totally obliterated”. Trump added that his goal was to stop “the nuclear threat posed by the world’s number one state sponsor of terror”.But does Iran pose the immediate threat that Netanyahu and Trump have claimed?US intelligence officials, along with the UN’s nuclear watchdog and independent experts, say that while Iran has dramatically increased its supply of uranium enriched to nearly weapons grade, there is no evidence it has taken steps to produce a nuclear weapon. In March, the US director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard,told Congressthat America’s intelligence agencies continued “to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon”. She added that Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, “has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003”.Gabbard also noted that Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium was “at its highest levels” and “unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons”. That’s largely because, in 2018,Trump unilaterally withdrewthe US from the Iran nuclear deal that was negotiated in 2015 between Tehran and six world powers. Under that agreement, Iran agreed to limit its uranium enrichment in exchange for relief from international sanctions. A few years after Trump tore up the deal that was signed by his predecessor, Barack Obama, Iran began to enrich uraniumup to 60% purity– a short step away from the 90% level required for a nuclear device.Still, in a report issued last month, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN watchdog that has monitored Iran’s main nuclear enrichment sites for years, said it found no evidence that Tehran was actively developing a weapons program. The agencycriticized Iranian officialsfor failing to provide access to some sites and to cooperate with UN inspectors, especially over Tehran’s past secret nuclear weapons program, which is believed to have ended by 2003. Despite these criticisms, theIAEA report saidit had “no credible indications of an ongoing, undeclared structured nuclear program”.Recent US intelligence assessments found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon and was up tothree years awayfrom being able to develop an actual warhead and deploy it on a missile. (Under pressure from Trump, who said twice last week that Gabbard’s testimony to Congress in March was “wrong”, the intelligence chief changed course on Friday to say that Irancould producea nuclear weapon “within weeks to months”.)Of course, there’s one state in the Middle East that has an active nuclear weapons program: Israel, which doesn’t acknowledge having anuclear arsenal. But in January, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute identified Israel as one of the world’s nine nuclear-armed states, and estimated that it currently has90 warheads.Despite all the evidence to the contrary, Netanyahu continues to insist that Iran was dashing to produce a nuclear weapon. “The intel we got and we shared with the United States was absolutely clear – was absolutely clear – that they [the Iranians] were working in a secret plan to weaponize the uranium,”Netanyahu toldthe Fox News anchor Bret Baier (who hosts one of Trump’s favorite news shows) inan interviewon 15 June. “They were marching very quickly. They would achieve a test device and possibly an initial device within months and certainly less than a year.”Netanyahu’s statements echo the exaggerated intelligence and sense of fear peddled by the Bush administration ahead of the US invasion of Iraq – and it’s exactly the kind of open-ended conflict based on lies that Trump promised voters he would avoid as president. In September 2002, Bush’s national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, said in aCNN interviewthat “there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly” the Iraqi regime could acquire nuclear weapons. “But we don’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud,” she added in a reference that would be repeated by other US officials, includingBush himself.Not surprisingly, Netanyahu had also lobbied the Bush administration to attack Iraq – and insisted that the Iraqi regime was developing a nuclear bomb. After his first term as Israel’s prime minister,Netanyahu testifiedbefore Congress as a private citizen in September 2002, warning of the danger posed by a nuclear-armed Iraq. “There is no question whatsoever that Saddam is seeking and is working and is advancing toward the development of nuclear weapons,” Netanyahu confidentlytold Congress. He added: “Once Saddam has nuclear weapons, the terror network will have nuclear weapons.”Netanyahu, who has always had a flair for the extravagant soundbite, also claimed that Hussein no longer needed one large reactor to produce nuclear fuel, but could do so “in centrifuges the size of washing machines” that could be hidden throughout Iraq.The Israeli leader was not only wrong about Hussein developing weapons of mass destruction, but he also insisted that a US war on Iraq would be a boon for the Middle East and would inspire Iranians to rise up against the Islamic republic. “If you take out Saddam’s regime, I guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region,”Netanyahu said. “I think that people sitting right nextdoor in Iran, young people and many others, will say the time of such regimes, of such despots, is gone.”It’s also important to remember that Netanyahu has practically made a career out of warning that Iran is years (or months) away from developing nukes. Over the past 30 years, he regularly issuedsome variationon this threat – and often wildly overestimated how close Iran was to having a bomb. In 1992, as a member of Israel’s Knesset, Netanyahu cautioned that Iran was “three to five years” away from developing a nuclear weapons capability. In 1996, as prime minister, he addressed a joint session of Congress andurged the USto “stop the nuclearization of terrorist states”. He added, “The deadline for attaining this goal is getting extremely close.”In February 2009, as leader of the Likud party and a candidate for prime minister, Netanyahu told a congressional delegation visiting Israel that Iran was “probably only one or two years away” from developing a nuclear weapons capability – attributing the claim to Israeli “experts” without offering other evidence. The conversation was summarized in a US state department cablereleased by WikiLeaks.Later in 2009, when he was back in office as premier,another leaked cablerevealed that Netanyahu told a separate group of visiting members of Congress that “Iran has the capability now to make one bomb” or it “could wait and make several bombs in a year or two”.No matter what Trump says, the US has gone to war – and there will be profound and lasting consequences | Simon TisdallRead moreBut the most memorable example of Netanyahu exaggerating the threat of Iran’s ability to develop a nuclear weapon came in September 2012, when the Israeli leader took tothe UN general assemblypodium armed with a cartoon-style drawing of a bomb with a lit fuse. Netanyahu warned the world that Iran was enriching uranium so quickly that it was on track to be able to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear devicewithin months. He then used a marker pen to draw a red line across the cartoon bomb, to highlight the stage of the nuclear process where he claimed Iran had to be stopped. Netanyahu warned that Iran could produce a working weapon by thefollowing springor “at most by next summer”.Nearly 13 years after Netanyahu stood before the world to cry wolf about Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons, he used the same pretext – that Iran is“within a few months”of having a bomb – to launch a devastating war against Tehran. Netanyahu then successfully pulled the US into the conflict, promising Trump a quick victory if the US used its 30,000-poundbunker buster bombsto destroy Fordow, Iran’s most heavily fortified nuclear facility.Unfortunately, Trump heeded the siren call of a US ally who has spent decades manipulating intelligence and public fears to exaggerate the nuclear threat posed by Iran. And the people of the Middle East will pay the highest price for yet another reckless war built on a lie.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies and an associate professor of journalism at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyOpinionDonald TrumpIrancommentShareReuse this content"

But the costs of the emergency are being felt everywhere.Three nuggets from the last week alone: first, chocolate prices in the UK increased at a record annual rate of 18% rate last month,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), driven by repeated weather-related failures of the cocoa crop in west Africa.Second, research by Bloomberg Intelligence calculated that an extraordinary $1tn was spent in the US last year on rebuilding and recovery after climate disasters such as wildfires and floods.The analysis highlighted the benefits for companies specialising in repair and resilience (the DIY chain Home Depot gets a mention, for example, as does the cement-maker Heidelberg), but rightly pointed out that these are resources that have to be diverted from other purposes.“Climate-related disasters are redistributing trillions of dollars in global spending away from the broader economy to pay for the costs of repairing the damage from the last fire, flood and storm and preparing for the next one,” as the authors put it.And third, adeeply depressing paperby US academics, for the IZA Institute of Labor Economics, washighlighted by Ruth Curticeof the Resolution Foundation. It showed that wildfires, which are becoming increasingly prevalent, have a direct impact on jobs and earnings because the smoke affects the health of people many miles away from the centre of the blaze.Researchers found that the impact over a typically smoky year knocks as much as 2%, or $125bn, off the total earnings of US workers – with older employees feeling the worst effects. That’s a health crisis and an economic challenge, too.Even in wealthy countries, in other words, the climate emergency is absorbing an ever-expanding share of resources and causing repeated cost shocks.For policymakers contemplating this “age of shifts and breaks”, as the ECB chief Christine Lagarde has called it,another fascinating piece of researchpublished last week – not specifically about climate, but about cost shocks more generally – provided some worrying context.Isabella Weber and her colleagues analysed transcripts of more than 100,000 “earnings calls” – the crucial meetings at which companies update their investors – from almost 5,000 US companies between 2007 and 2022, and cross-checked them against data on costs across the economy.They found that during cost shocks – when everyone knows costs are going up – companies feel emboldened to push up prices and build their profit margins.Scrutinising the language used on the calls, Weber et al suggest executives tend to calculate that they won’t lose market share, because rival companies will also raise prices, and assume the public will be more understanding than during normal times.It’s not that CEOs put their heads together and cook up a top-secret plan to make bumper profits in the teeth of a crisis – instead, an economy-wide cost shock acts as what the authors call an “implicit coordination mechanism”.This is what Weber and co call “sellers’ inflation” – driven not by the demands of workers for higher wages, which companies then pass on to consumers, but by opportunistic behaviour from bosses.They don’t argue that this is necessarily the main driver of inflation during crises such as the Covid pandemic, but that this “markup increase” channel is significant – and makes managing inflation more complex.“If, in the face of major supply shocks, firms do not absorb cost increases but instead perceive them as good news – as they facilitate price hikes and hence higher profits – this has important implications for price stability in a world of overlapping emergencies,” they warn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And as it hits food production in particular, it appears likely to continue presenting policymakers with cost shocks.The main weapon of central banks – raising interest rates – is a very blunt one against this particular species of inflation.Weber argues instead for a “toolbox approach” that includes building up “buffer stocks” of essential commodities (chocolate, sadly, seems unlikely to qualify), cracking down on companies taking unfair advantage of economic shocks, and in extremis, price controls.Another recent plea for policymakers to think differently about climate-driven inflation came from a pair of researchers at the LSE’s Grantham Research Institute.David Barmes and Luiz Awazu Pereira da Silvaadvocate “adaptive inflation targeting,”in what they call a “hot and volatile world”.They argue that given the likelihood of increasingly frequent climate cost shocks, policymakers would be wise to tolerate, or “look through,” these short-term blips more willingly than they do at present.They suggest politicians might also want to allow central banks to temporarily target a higher inflation rate at times of repeated shocks, and perhaps allow more leeway around the target, too.Keeping rates high to squash climate-driven inflation has no impact on the underlying problem, Barmes and Pereira da Silva argue, and raises government borrowing costs, just as public investment in the green transition is urgently needed.Anyone sweating through the weekend in a home built when 30C was a once-in-a-generation aberration may have pondered how out of step Britain’s infrastructure is with the changing climate. But our economic policymaking infrastructure, too, will surely need to adapt.Explore more on these topicsInflationEconomics viewpointClimate crisisEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

And I’m as complicit as anyone else …Sun 22 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 15.47 EDTShareNot all heroes wear capes; some have a box in their bedroom instead. Dragons’ Den’s Sara Davies says she confiscates her kids’ friends’ phones when they come round, so instead of sitting glued to their devices, they talk to each other and play together.“I have a box at the front door … they put their phones and iPads in the box and it stays in my bedroom,”shetold the Daily Mail. “No one complains. They’re outside playing football, they merge so much better – and they communicate.”Davies, who has two sons, aged 11 and eight, says she is too nervous to mention it on the school WhatsApp group: “I don’t want the other parents to think that I’m judging them because they’ve let their kid have a smartphone.”Of course she is judging them. We all do it.Smartphoneshave become the new parenting signifier. Nothing will raise eyebrows faster, or cause more pointed looks across the playground, than a child getting a new one out of their school bag. Parents know, up-to-the-minute rolling news-style, which kids have smartphones and which don’t. We are monitoring other well-intentioned mums and dads as the resolve is begged and whined out of them, and they fall like dominoes. Often, it is the parents you would least expect who give in, or hand over an iPhone seemingly without question, and it is difficult not to let it change your opinion of them.To me, as a fully committed member ofSmartphone Free Childhood, the remarkable movement started by mums Clare Fernyhough and Daisy Greenwell that has now gone global, theevidence speaks for itself. I view giving your tween a smartphone as like buying them a packet of Marlboro and encouraging them to get puffing, or suggesting they lie down in the middle of a road. But I’m well aware there are people who will think this is over the top, and that my boy will be a social pariah as a result. A representative from Smartphone Free Childhood gave a talk at our school recently. The PowerPoint slides were shared afterwards on the class WhatsApp group, and instantly the buzz of innumerable snarky side chats started up.Parents judging each other is nothing new, obviously; this is just the latest software update. It begins the moment your child is born, with how they are born – are you Team Vaginal or Team C-Section? Then, how you feed them – breast either is or isn’t best. Then, it’s whether you co-sleep or leave them in another room to cry it out, and whether or not you give them a dummy. Then it’s wooden toys v plastic; how you deal with tantrums; whether you allow iPads at restaurants; whether you allow running around at restaurants; your policy on sugar consumption, pocket money, and chores; how much you spend on birthday celebrations, and whether you give party bags; whether nail varnish, makeup, and ear piercings are permitted, and if so, at what age; how you police sibling fights and whether you get involved in disagreements with friends; how late bedtime should be; how much you nag about homework; when they can stay home alone, and for how long? It’s never-ending. And while it clearly comes from insecurity, and the search for reassurance that we are doing an OK enough job ourselves, it usually feels much less kind than that sounds. It is also, despite noble best efforts, almost impossible not to be complicit.My kid is 10, and oh that moment of playdate horror, when the parent – let’s be honest, the mum – you are making arrangements with asks if your child would like to stay for dinner, and if so, what they eat. Your back is against the wall and you are forced to out yourself as the producer of either a quinoa kid or a fish-finger fan. There is no in between.

Responses you don’t want to “what do they eat?” (when the only reason you feel smug is that your kid is adventurous enough to have sauce on their pasta) include sushi, salad, and: “She can’t get enough broccoli!” I know, because I’ve had them all.Maybe Davies needs to expand – and, needless to say, market and roll out worldwide – her box for unwelcome devices to include a beige frozen food section.

From the slow shuffle at the supermarket checkout to the more profound waiting between a medical test and its result, wait we must. Yet in a society hellbent on speed and efficiency, waiting has become the enemy.Historically, the act of waiting had spiritual meaning: waiting for the Messiah or the second coming, waiting for sacred rain, or the return of the Sun God. But in today’s world, where time is money and productivity is a virtue, we’ve developed a pervasive impatience.Waiting raises our anxiety – not just mentally but physiologically, as stress hormones flood our systems. We experience it as a gap to be filled, a void to be plugged.How Charlie discovered that time wealth can be the key to a slower, happier life | Modern mindRead moreIt also heightens our awareness of uncertainty, and uncertainty activates the same neural pathways as pain, fear and threat detection. But while these neurological facts explain our psychological responses to waiting, explanations do not necessarily change these responses.There are different forms of waiting, each demanding something unique from us. Everyday waiting – traffic jams, slow wifi – tests our patience and requires frustration tolerance. Interpersonal waiting, where we are asked to match the pace of someone more vulnerable, calls us to slow down and inhabit a better version of ourselves. And then there is existential waiting, which is particularly challenging as it relates to matters of life and death. Existential waiting can lead us into the abyss: catastrophic thinking, free-floating anxiety, the unravelling of our defences, even the fragmentation of our sense of self.Navigating these moments requires the capacity to bear difficulty with grace and to cultivate faith and hope that transcend the immediate without slipping into denial and unreality. It means tolerating anguish, slowing down and navigating suffering, not only with tolerance but with purpose and hopeful endurance.Religious traditions have long valorised such states. Christianity focuses on the redemptive power of suffering through Christ; Sufism sees longing and anguish as paths towards union with the divine; Buddhism teaches us to sit with pain, to observe and detach.Some secular philosophies also mirror these insights.What are we waiting for? What does it teach us?Viktor Frankl, writing from the depths of a concentration camp, emphasised the importance of finding meaning even in suffering. The contemporaryrise of death cafes, where people gather to reflect on mortality, speaks to a desire to confront and grapple with the existential unknowns. These cafes offer a space to explore death as a way of enhancing life, inviting us to see waiting not as lost time but as time forbecoming– individually, and in resistance to the commodification of time itself.Existential waiting also raises important questions. What are we waiting for? What does it teach us? What are we becoming in the process? But before we can engage with these larger questions, many of us need help simply learning to tolerate the anxiety that waiting provokes.Take Michael*, a high-achieving software developer who came to therapy after experiencing a panic attack prompted by a routine health check. Rational and successful, Michael found himself unravelling in the face of uncertainty as he awaited the results. He described himself as feeling “out of control” and “spiralling”. He couldn’t sleep. He compulsively checked his email. He imagined worst-case diagnoses. Physically, he experienced heart palpitations, stomach tightness, restlessness and persistent anxiety.Digging deeper, it became clear that Michael’s difficulty with waiting was rooted in a familiar psychological pattern. He had grown up in a family that prized achievement and productivity. He had lived a life mapped out by goals – goals that he usually met. But recently, he had been shaken by the sudden death of a close friend his own age during a routine jog. Since then, his health anxiety had escalated.In Michael’s case, the medical test – and the waiting it required – was the trigger for a common psychological pattern. His automatic thought was: “It’s probably bad news.” This gave rise to anxiety and dread, which led to physical symptoms like tightness in the chest and a racing heart. His response to this was rumination, compulsive checking, Googling and avoidance of sleep. These behaviours brought temporary relief but ultimately reinforced his anxiety. Underneath it all lay a core belief: that not knowing is dangerous. He struggled to hold multiple possibilities in mind; for him, uncertainty collapsed into catastrophe.A moment that changed me: I went to a death cafe – and learned how to live a much happier lifeRead moreTherapy began by helping Michael recognise this cycle. We worked to challenge his catastrophic thinking and to open space for alternative outcomes. He was encouraged to delay checking his email and to soothe his anxiety in more helpful ways. He practised guided body scans to anchor himself in his body’s present safety. He learned mindfulness and breathing techniques. Gradually, he began to see waiting not as a void to be feared, but as an opportunity to observe.Over time, Michael’s anxiety lessened. “Waiting still sucks,” he said. “But now it doesn’t own me.”To live slowly and to wait well is an act of quiet rebellion – a refusal to see time as a thief. It is a form of resistance against a culture that equates speed with worth. Waiting will never be easy, but if we develop the capacity to wait with presence and intention we may discover that waiting is its own form of becoming. In the words of CS Lewis, waiting can become “the scent of a flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard”.*Michael is a fictional amalgam to exemplify similar cases we see.

He may imagine he has scored an easy win, but the world is likely to pay a steep priceSun 22 Jun 2025 13.11 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 21.30 EDTShareDonald Trump was predictably quick to claim victory followingthe illegalUS strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities: “Completely and totally obliterated,” he crowed. Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel and sycophants at home rushed to fawn over his “courageous” and “brilliant” decision. The most senior US military official, Dan Caine, offered amore muted assessment: it was “way too early” to know the full outcome despite severe damage. We cannot yet know whether the blow has ended Iran’s nuclear aspirations – or will spur it to pursue the bomb. It may be weeks or months, too, before Iranian retaliation plays out, with all its potential repercussions.Two nuclear-armed states have gone to war on the unevidenced claim that a third state is on the verge of acquiring its own nuclear arms. In March, the US director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, said Iran was not building weapons (though she has now scrambled to align with Mr Trump).Israelis clear that its attacks will continue, and has increasingly talked of regime change. The price is being paid not only by a reviled regime but by the Iranian people.Senior administration figures insisted that the US is solely focused on the nuclear programme. As a candidate, Mr Trump vowed to “stop the chaos in the Middle East” and “prevent world war three”. Yet the risk of regional conflagration is growing, and now he warns of “either peace or … tragedy for Iran” if it does not end uranium enrichment. Mr Netanyahulured him into this attackand may lead him into more, paying gushing tribute to a history-making president and thanking him on behalf of “the forces of civilisation”. Mr Trump described them as working together “like perhaps no team has ever worked before”.Iran has been notably cautious since Israel’s attack began. The pillars of its security – its regional networks, missiles and nuclear programme – haveall suffered punishing blows. To do nothing invites further attack; to hit back – particularly by targeting US personnel in the region – courts disaster. Closethe strait of Hormuzand oil prices would soar. But that would hit Iran’s own exports and risk involving Gulf states. Russia and China condemned the US strike but are hardly rushing to offer Tehran assistance.Israel’s strike – and the US’s – on Iran cannot bejustifiedunder international law’s self-defence doctrine. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, rightly warns of catastrophe in the Middle East, urging diplomacy as the only solution. Yet Mr Trump walked away from the Obama-overseen deal that slowed Iran’s programme, and now has struck Iran when it sought negotiation despite Israel’s attacks. Sir Keir Starmer, too,called for de-escalation and negotiation, though he backed the US strike. The US did not request British assistance – but the fear remains that European powers may be drawn into another criminal and disastrous war in the Middle East.In rejecting diplomacy and choosing war, not only in breach of international law but at the behest of a country pursuing annihilation in Gaza, the US has delivered a resounding blow to the architecture of global affairs. It has signalled that countries that negotiate (Iran) face stark consequences, which those which rush to own the bomb (North Korea) can avoid. Its embrace of pre-emptive strikes is handy for Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and any leader who might want to carry out their own. Even if the immediate crisis in the Middle East can be contained, the cost of this reckless act may not be fully felt or comprehended for decades.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionIranNuclear weaponsBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelAntónio GuterresKeir StarmereditorialsShareReuse this content"

Urgent, coordinated investment is needed to protect lives and infrastructureSun 22 Jun 2025 13.10 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 21.30 EDTShareBritain’s four-day heatwave – made100 times more likelyby the climate crisis – is expected to claimabout 600 lives. Researchers say high temperatures from Thursday to Sunday would lead to a sharp rise in excess mortality, especially among older people in cities such as London and Birmingham. They forecast the deadliest day as Saturday, with temperatures above 32C and about 266 deaths. These are not abstract figures, but lives cut short by a threat we understand, yet remain unprepared for.Young people seem to grasp this. In a YouGov poll lastweek, roughly a quarter of 18- to 24-year-olds said they hoped there wouldn’t be a heatwave – while more than two-fifths of older people welcomed the sunshine. That generational split isn’t just cultural. It reflects an entirely rational anxiety: younger people face a future living in a climate emergency. The generation that caused and benefited from the conditions driving global heating will be gone long before the worst costs – financial, environmental, social – have to be paid.The effects are already here. In 2022, almost a fifth of UK hospitals were forced to canceloperationsduring the three days when temperatures soared highest because NHS buildings could not cope with the heat. That was a summer of hosepipe bans and wildfires. A year later, floods caused by extreme rainfall contributed to a third of all UK train delays, according tocampaignersat Round Our Way. From drought to downpour, climate chaos is driving up food prices – UK-farmed carrots and lettuce now cost athirdmore than two years ago. For Britons, climate breakdown is felt not in the disappearance of distant ice caps but postponed appointments, cancelled trains and bigger shopping bills.Britain, warn the government’s own advisers on theClimate Change Committee, is not institutionally ready. There’s no national adaptation budget, no cross-government plan and no clearaccountof what’s even being spent. The recent spending review proves the point. While there is a modest rise in flood defence funding to £1.4bn a year, the Treasury ignored calls, notably from experts at the London School of Economics’Grantham Institute, for a joined-up approach, leaving key risks – health, infrastructure, food security – unfunded and uncoordinated.And the cost of doing nothing is mounting. The investigative campaigners Global Witnesscalculatethat in 2025 UK households face a £3,000 bill in climate-related costs. But the solutions exist. The LondonClimate Resilience Reviewlays out the blueprint: heat plans, flood protection, NHS retrofits and early-warning systems. The review led to the capital conducting a disaster training exercise, OperationHelios, to test its readiness for extreme heat. Other metro mayors are looking at London as a model.According to Labour’smanifesto, preparing for the future means Britain adapting to big shifts in climate and nature. There has been some positive change. The government’sinfrastructure strategytalks about climate resilience for new capital stock. But plans need funding, not just fine words. The UK requires a national adaptation budget, drawn together by central government but managed and transparently delivered locally. TheOffice for Budget Responsibilityrecognised during the pandemic that emergency spending on the climate was affordable. It still is. What’s coming is no mystery. What works is already known. What’s missing is the willingness at the heart of government to act in a purposeful way.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionClimate Change CommitteeGreenhouse gas emissionseditorialsShareReuse this content"

After seven years of Test cricket, Jasprit Bumrah has grown to know a good handful of them about as well as any man can, from awe, through disgust, to fear, sadness, surprise and all their many combinations. You would guess it’s been a while since he’s seen a happy batter looking back at him from 22 yards, but if you had the binoculars onHarry Brookfirst thing on Sunday morning, you could see he was wearing such a big, goofy grin that his teeth were glinting through the gloaming.You don’t want to kink-shame him, but you’d think there must be easier ways to get your kicks than to go running down the pitch to hit a man bowling 90mph bouncers. But Brook’s brain seems to be wired a little differently. On the third ball Bumrah bowled him on Sunday, he decided to take two quick steps forwards and wallop it through the covers for four.Stokes strikes late for England to leave India Test in balance after Brook falls for 99Read moreIt was an extraordinary shot, in an innings studded with them. Brook picked up one of Prasidh Krishna’s short balls from outside off and heaved it into the stands beyond midwicket; he walked down the pitch to launch Mohammed Siraj over the silly mid-off he’d just set to try and deter exactly that shot, and even played Rishabh Pant’s roly‑poly scoop over the wicketkeeper to score a four off Ravindra Jadeja. It was like watching a kid copying the trick he’d just seen on TV, except he got away with it.These aren’t strokes your typical batter could imagine, let alone execute. But thenBrook is the most richly giftedshotmaker England have had since Kevin Pietersen was in the team. Time was, and not so long ago, when you would have been told off for trying them. But Brendon McCullum is the only England coach Brook has ever known – he has grown up being encouraged to play this way.By the time the second new ball came around, India’s bowlers had had just about enough of it. They already thought they’d got Brook out once when he couldn’t help himself but try to hook one of Bumrah’s bouncers and was caught at midwicket off what turned out to be a no-ball, and then they thought they had got him a second time when he edged a ball from Jadeja through to Pant, who couldn’t hold on to the catch. They had spent all morning trying, and failing, to persuade the umpires to let them change the soft ball they’d been working with, and now they finally had a shiny new one by right.View image in fullscreenHarry Brook survived a couple of chances in his innings, including this drop by Rishabh Pant.Photograph: Darren Staples/AFP/Getty ImagesThey gave it to Siraj. He is one of those bowlers who likes to pick a fight, and always seems to be pissed off with his lot. The Telangana police recently swore him in as an honorary deputy constable, and he has the air of a man you wouldn’t want to make ask twice to see your licence.Siraj beat Brook once outside off, when Brook swung so hard at a cut that he threw himself off his feet, then he beat him again when he hit his inside edge and the ball ricocheted away off his thigh. He was starting to warm up, then Brook went and belted his next two deliveries for four, and he reached a boil. Siraj banged the next ball in short at Brook’s ribs, and hit him on the elbow. He followed the delivery in and, while Brook winced, Siraj stood in the middle of the pitch, staring at him. He shot him a couple of kind words – exactly what is between the two of them – and then a length delivery which Brook spanked back over his head for six.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Siraj fired the next one in so quick that even though Brook missed it, it shot off his pads for four leg byes. When Siraj overcorrected himself and dropped the next one wide on the off side, Brook hammered him for four more through point. That made it 18 off the over. And it was at this point that Pant decided everyone needed a time out, and called a trainer on to strap up his ankle. His teammates gathered in a huddle. Apart from Siraj who stood, hands on hips, staring into the distance. He looked as if he was going to blow up if anyone came within three feet of him.Somewhere in among all this, Brook was dropped yet again when he cut one of Bumrah’s away-swingers to gully. He was finally out on 99, caught in the deep. You sometimes wonder if there’s a thought in his head at all, except to belt the ball. In this, at least, he is part of a long Yorkshire tradition – Geoff Boycott, Herbert Sutcliffe and Norman Yardley all got out one shy of a Test hundred in their time, too, though you have to guess they probably weren’t trying to belt a six when they did it.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025Harry BrookEngland cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

In the final stages of a ­bruising second-set tie-break, the score at 5-5, Alcaraz betrayed his nerves with a double fault under pressure from a soaring Jiri Lehecka. He soon found himself battling in a final set he would have preferred to avoid.Alcaraz handled this moment of adversity with the self-assurance and courage he has shown so many times before while demonstrating his growing maturity as he refocused to close out the in-form Czech 7-5, 6-7 (5), 6-2 and triumph at Queen’s Club for the second time in his career.Carlos Alcaraz beats the heat in epic comeback against Munar at Queen’s ClubRead moreWith his third title in a row fol­lowing victories at the Italian Openand Roland Garros, Alcaraz has extended his career-best winning sequence to 18 matches and he is the first player since Rafael Nadal in 2008, when the two events were held in consecutive weeks, to win in Paris and at Queen’s Club in the same year. Although he is a menace on all surfaces, Alcaraz has improved his astounding career record on grass to 29 wins and three defeats and he will head to the All England Club as the clear favourite.“I came here with no expectations at all. I just came here with a goal to play two, three matches, try to feel great on grass moving, and give myself the feedback of what I have to improve, what I have to do better. But I just got used to the grass really quick, and I’m just really proud about it,” the world No 2 said.“My goal was complete, and I’m not talking about lifting the trophy or making the final. It was just to feel great, to feel really comfortable on grass once again. So what I’m more proud about this week is the way that I have been improving every day.”Alcaraz has built an excellent résumé at a faster rate than all but only a couple of male players in the history of tennis but for the stratospheric heights his game has already reached, and the many occasions when it seems he is capable of ­absolutely anything on the court, his form can also be temperamental.Over the past few months, things have clearly shifted. In addition to his three consecutive titles, the ­Spaniard has now reached five consecutive finals, compiling a record of one defeat in 28 matches since the start of April. Off the court, Alcaraz has shaken off the outside pressure that suffocated him earlier in the year. On court, he has a greater ­understanding of when to pull back and remain solid on important points instead of solely relying on his superb ­shotmaking. He broke Lehecka’s service by continually putting returns into the court, offering few errors and making himself extremely difficult to beat.Alcaraz’s serve, meanwhile, has been his most notable asset of the tournament. After his tight three‑set victory against Jaume Munar in the last 16, where he was extremely ­frustrated with his serve, Alcaraz practised hard and he served spectacularly in the final three rounds. His decision to change his service motion at the start of the year continues to pay dividends.View image in fullscreenMarketa Vondrousova beat Wang Xinyu in the Berlin Open final for her first title since Wimbledon in 2023.Photograph: Andreas Gora/AP“I have been serving really, really well. Honestly, now I know how John Isner and Reilly Opelka feels when they playing,” he said, smiling.This victory is even more impressive considering how life ­continues to move at warp speed for the 22‑year‑old. Only two weeks ago, Alcaraz was in the process of pulling off one of the greatest comebacks of all time as hetoppled his great rival Jannik Sinnerin the French Open final. He had only three nights in Ibiza to disconnect and reckon with all that he had achieved before duty called once more.Alcaraz has spent the past eight days trying to work through the notorious, extreme transition from clay to grass along with the mental and physical challenges that come with following up such a monumental win. As has been the case so many times in his young career, he has faced all of those challenges with a smile and emerged from them with a significant trophy.Elsewhere, Marketa Vondrousova closed out an impressive week by defeating Wang Xinyu of China 7-6 (10), 4-6, 6-2 to win the Berlin Open title, her first triumph sincewinning Wimbledon in 2023. The Czech’s career had already been derailed numerous times by significant injuries before her Wimbledon win and she has been repeatedly sidelined since then. Having fallen from her career-high ranking of No 6 a year ago to her current ranking of No 164, the 25-year-old defeated the world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka and Madison Keys, the Australian Open champion, en route to her third career title.Explore more on these topicsTennisCarlos AlcaraznewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Sipa US/AlamyA poor Nations League and an injury troubled buildup has taken the shine off Marko Saloranta’s side after an impressive qualifying campaignByAri VirtanenSun 22 Jun 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 22.26 EDTShareThis article is part of the Guardian’sEuro 2025 Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 16 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two teams each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 2 July.OverviewFinland played well during the qualifying campaign, beating Scotland 2-0 on aggregate in the playoffs, and their performances raised expectations. However, the Nations League campaign that followed acted as a rude awakening. A draw at home to Serbia – after they conceded an 84th-minute own goal – meant they finished second in their group behind their opponents.The reason for the dip in form can largely be explained by the numerous injuries the team has suffered in the run-up to the Euros. Key players such as Natalia Kuikka, Elli Pikkujämsä and Jutta Rantala have been out for a long time.Kuikka, one of the most important players in the squad, is now back playing but has missed several months of the buildup. Pikkujämsä, one of the team’s most reliable defenders, has been out for a year with a knee injury.After the match against Serbia, the head coach, Marko Saloranta, said: “The players’ fitness and health are constantly monitored. It is clear that we cannot include too many players [in the final squad] whose fitness we are not sure about.”Rantala is a key player in attack. The Leicester forward has been out since October and Finland simply look a less dangerous side without her.As a team Finland have been able to develop their game in the past couple of years under the tutelage of Saloranta. They attack in a varied manner, keeping opponents on their toes, are able to keep possession well with a diamond formation in midfield and rely on their tireless full-backs who often run deep into the opposition’s half and also contribute with goals.The team’s success in recent years has been based on disciplined performances and being clinical in front of goal.FinlandThe coachThe 53-year-oldMarko Salorantahas been one of the key figures in the rise of women’s football in Finland over the past 20 years. He has had to pay a heavy price, though, for all the work he has put in and revealed that he went through a divorce during the qualifiers. “There are pros and cons to every job,” he said. “I can handle stress and criticism, but it’s draining that I don’t have enough time to be with my loved ones.” Saloranta has worked for the Finnish FA for more than 15 years and was the head coach for the under-17 girls’ national team when they qualified for the 2018 Euros and the World Cup the following year.Star playerNatalia Kuikkahas won the Finnish women’s player of the year award five times. She should reach the 100-cap mark at the Euros. The 29-year-old has spent most of her career in the United States. She won the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship in 2018 with Florida State and was nominated for the collegiate female athlete of the year award. She then became the first Finn to win the National Women’s Soccer League championship, with Portland Thorns in 2022. At one point, she seriously considered moving back to Europe but decided against it. “I just felt like I didn’t have to. I didn’t have to show anyone anything. This is my career and my life,” she said in an interview with the Finnish broadcasters Yle in January 2025. Kuikka is a cool-headed defender, physically strong and fast, and absolutely key for this team.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Halttunen is an exceptional striker and Joonas Sarelius, the sports director at the club where she learned her trade, HJK, says she has a good chance to develop into a top player. She is one of those rare players who seem capable of doing everything. “She is excellent at protecting the ball and can use that skill to win one-on-one situations in surprising places on the pitch,” he says. “She is really strong and can find the net from long range. These are the qualities that bring her a lot of scoring opportunities.”Probable lineupView image in fullscreenStatus of domestic top-flightThe Kansallinen Liiga could be called semi-professional but in reality it is still an amateur league. There were 245 players in the league last year and 70% were considered to be amateurs. A third were “professionals” with contracts that guaranteed them some payments, but only 10 players were actually professional in the true sense of the word with insurance cover and other necessities. In 2024 the average attendance was 357. The media coverage of the league is pretty good, to be fair, with all games streamed live on a major media platform.Realistic aim in SwitzerlandConsidering how well Finland has competed against better teams during qualifying it is fair to expect them to progress to the knockout round. That would be a good achievement for a team whose key players have been injured this year.The Finland team guide was written by Ari Virtanen forIlta-Sanomat.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euros 2025: Guardian Experts’ NetworkFinland women's football teamWomen's Euro 2025Women's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fleetwood, who left an approach shot short, had just missed a par putt from inside seven feet for a two-shot swing.Fleetwood, who began the day with a three-shot lead, appeared to have recovered after a ragged opening stretch. Instead, Bradley won for the first time since last year’s BMW Championship.

But Fleetwood birdies on the 11th and 13th gave him a three-shot advantage with four holes to play.When Bradley rolled in a 37-foot birdie putt on the 15th, he moved to two strokes back.

A consultation process led by the ECB’s professional game committee (PGC) gave the counties five different options for next season, with two to be put forward after the meetings of the counties before a final decision in July.It is understood that both proposed options to be taken forward will involve cutting the Championship fixture list to 12 matches. The most radical proposal involves creating a 12-team Division One, split across two pools of six, with a six-team Division Two underneath.Each team in the two Division One pools would play 10 games against each other home and away, plus two additional fixtures against sides from the other pool. The winners of both pools after 12 matches would then play off in September for the County Championship title, with the bottom county in each pool being relegated.The six Division Two teams would also play 12 matches, with some playing each other three times in a lopsided fixture list, and the winners of the league being promoted automatically. The second- and third‑placed teams would also play off at the end of the season for the right to be promoted.The alternative option to be put forward would maintain the existing 10-team Division One and eight‑team Division Two format, but with a cut to 12 games. There would be no playoff title decider, but the second- and third-placed teams in Division Two would face each other for the second promotion place.Other options proposed by the PGC, including three conferences of six followed by playoffs, a midseason split similar to that used by the Scottish Premier League and keeping the current 14-game, two-division structure, are set to be rejected. Sources involved in the discussions said that the 12/6 split is regarded as the favoured format to be adopted, with the final decision to be made next month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Removing two rounds of Championship fixtures would also enable the One-Day Cup to be split, with five rounds taking place in April and another five in August during the Hundred, giving more players the opportunity to play 50-over cricket.The County Championship schedule was last cut from 16 to 14 matchesbefore the 2017 season, but with the volume of global franchise cricket having increased significantly since, and the Hundred now taking up all of August, there is a growing acceptance that a further reduction is required. The players are strongly in favour of less cricket, with 83% of respondents to a Professional Cricketers’ Association surveypublished in Mayciting physical concerns over their workload, and 67% believing the schedule is detrimental to their mental health.Explore more on these topicsCricketCounty ChampionshipCounty Championship Division OneCounty Championship Division TwoNottinghamshireSurreySussexnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a battle against myself pretty much, especially with how tough the conditions were this whole week,” Lee said of her final-round approach.“Not just today. It’s just amplified today because it’s a major Sunday, but yeah, just be patient, take every shot as it comes.“I pretty much I saw every single leaderboard and I knew exactly where I was, pretty much all of today, so I checked the scores and then I just came back to each shot and tried to execute it the best that I could, so I played within myself today.”Lee finished with a 72-hole four-under 284 total to deny fast-finishing American Auston Kim (68) and Thai Chanetee Wannasaen (68) improbable comeback victories at the third women’s major of the year.In adding to her 2021 Evian Championship triumph and 2022 US Open success, Lee completed the third leg of women’s golf’s fabled grand slam to edge ever closer to a place in the sport’s Hall of Fame.The British Open and Chevron Championship are the only two majors to elude Lee.Just as significantly, Lee joined legends – and fellow females – Karrie Webb and Jan Stephenson as only the third Australian golfer in history to win three different major championships.With three majors, Lee also surpassed the great Greg Norman and David Graham on Australia’s all-time majors winning list. Lee now only trails seven-times major champion Webb and five-times British Open winner Thomson.Sunday’s victory also snapped a 19-month winless run, the longest drought of her decorated career, and secured Australian women’s sport’s highest earner another monster cheque of $US1.8m ($A2.8m).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asked if he would like to be teammates with Lamine Yamal, Rashford said: “Yes, for sure. Everyone wants to play with the best. Hopefully … we’ll see.” Barcelona’s sporting director, Deco, told the Catalan radio station RAC1 in May that the club like Rashford.Rashford, whose own breakthrough at United came as an 18-year-old, with four goals in two games against Denmark’s FC Midtjylland and Arsenal in February 2016, said: “It’s difficult to put into words what [Lamine Yamal] is doing because he’s not supposed to be doing that at 16 or 17. I don’t think we’ve seen that before.”Unitedare hoping to sell Rashford, frozen out by Ruben Amorim and loaned to Aston Villa in January, to fund further summer transfer business beyond the £62.5msigning of Matheus Cunha. Alejandro Garnacho is another who may be sold. For Rashford, contracted until 2027, having stated his time at United is at its end, the asking price is understood to be £40m.Despite a productive spell at Villa, including a throwback performance in the club’s Champions League near-miss against the eventual winners, Paris Saint-Germain, he is unlikely to return to Unai Emery’s club, who have profit and sustainability concerns after missing out on a return to the competition. “Spain is nice, and it’s not too far from home,” Rashford said.Barcelona have made a wide forward a priority, with Liverpool’s Luis Díazalso linked. “As wingers we only have Lamine and Raphinha, because Ferran [Torres] is becoming more and more a striker,” Deco said.The No 1 target is the Athletic Bilbao winger Nico Williams, 22, for whom a buyout clause is set at €58m (£49.7m), and Barça are willing to pay it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Personal terms are reported to be agreed, but Barça’s own, precarious PSR position may delay that deal until July. Deco said: “The fact that Nico and Lamine are friends is good.

Cooper is preparing a written ministerial statement that will be placed before parliament on Monday.Palestine Actionreleased a short video on Friday morningshowing two people driving electric scooters inside the airbase at night and spraying two military planes.The group said it had targeted RAF Voyager aircraft used for transport and refuelling, and that “activists have interrupted Britain’s direct participation in the commission of genocide and war crimes across the Middle East”.The incident is the latest action in recent years by the group, but it is also a particularly embarrassing breach of MoD security at a site holding planes used by the king and prime minister.The former justice secretary Charlie Falconer said on Sunday that the “sort of demonstration” at the base would not justify proscription, “so there must be something else that I don’t know about”.0:40Footage shows Palestine Action breaking into Brize Norton airbase – videoAsked if the actions were “commensurate with the need to proscribe an organisation”, Lord Falconer told Sky News’s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme: “I am not aware of what Palestine Action has done beyond the painting of things on the planes in Brize Norton. They may have done other things I didn’t know.“I think the question will probably not be what we know about them publicly, but there would need to be something that was known by those who look at these sorts of things that we don’t know about, because they got into the airbase, which might suggest they’ve got some degree of ability to make them dangerous.”The MP and former Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said on X: “Prosecuting Palestine Action protestors for criminal damage for paint spraying at the airbase would be expected but putting them on a par with mass killers like Jihadis & Boko Haram & proscribing doesn’t seem appropriate & not what the counter-terrorism laws were introduced for.”During a protest march in London on Saturday, Yousaf accused the UK government of “abusing” anti-terror laws against Palestine Action. He later said on X: “If the UK Government believes those protesting against the atrocities in Gaza are terrorists, but those killing children should be supported and provided with weapons, then this Government has not only lost its way, it has lost its conscience.”Amnesty International UK said it was “deeply concerned at the use of counter-terrorism powers to target protest groups”.Palestine Action and other groups have urged supporters to demonstrate outside parliament at noon on Monday. A spokesperson said it would fight any ban and was “considering all options”. They added: “This emerged on Friday evening in the form of leaks to the press. We have not been consulted and have received no right of reply.”The group was founded in 2020 by Huda Ammori, whose father is Palestinian, and Richard Barnard, a leftwing activist. The organisation, which focuses its campaigns on multinational arms dealers and corporate banks, recently targeted a factory in Shenstone, Staffordshire, claiming it made drones for the Israeli army.The home secretary has been the focus of lobbying by groups, including the Campaign Against Antisemitism, pushing for Palestine Action to be banned.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

There isn’t a budget for this. Politics is about prioritising. It is a daily series of choices and trade-offs. I fear we’ve made the wrong one.”Assisted dying bill: how will it work and when will it come into effect?Read moreThe bill will now head to the House of Lords, where there are expected to be continued battles over its progress, with campaigners urging peers to use “dark arts” to impede it. MPs who backed the legislation have said it would be anti-democratic for peers to block the private member’s bill passed by the elected house.Writing on Facebook, the health secretary said he wanted to speak directly to his Ilford North constituents on the issue. “There is no doubt that this is a major and profound social change for our NHS and our country. I can understand why many people who are facing terminal illness, or fear terminal illness, are seeking the right to die at a time and manner of their choosing and I have enormous respect for their position,” he wrote.“I also have the utmost respect for Kim Leadbeater and my other friends and colleagues in parliament who have supported this bill. I’ve seen first-hand how hard Kim has worked to listen to everyone’s views and take onboard amendments to her bill with integrity.”But Streeting said he was disturbed by the concerns about the bill that have been voiced by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Royal College of Physicians, the Association for Palliative Medicine and disability campaigners.Streeting said the department would work closely on the technical aspects of the bill, even though the government was neutral, and that Stephen Kinnock, the care minister, would work on the bill should the Lords pass it, in order to make sure “we do a good job with it for the country”.The impact assessment produced by the government on the bill suggested that panels set up to approve procedures would cost about £2,000 a day, adding up to between £900,000 and £3.6m over a 10-year period. The total cost of running the panels – and employing a dedicated commissioner – would be between £10.9m and £13.6m a year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This would be subject to approval by two doctors and a panel including a social worker, senior legal figure and psychiatrist.TheLabourpeer Charlie Falconer, who is expected to take the lead on the legislation in the House of Lords, said despite the depth of feeling on the issue, peers should not use procedural devices to block it.“The overwhelming instinct in the Lords will be not to block or delay but to see whether there can be any improvements which do not interfere with the bill’s principles,” he wrote in the Sunday Times.“The last time there were votes of real substance on this issue was on a bill I introduced in 2014 for which the votes in the Lords were in favour. There have been many new peers introduced into the house since then, and many departures. Where the house’s views are now is difficult to judge but they will work towards a bill that gives effect to the Commons’ view.”Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingHealth policyWes StreetingLabourNHSHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He was arrested in Statenville,Georgiaon 9 April due to a parole violation – and died on 5 May in the back of a van about half-way between the Lowndes county jail and Stewart detention center.His family say their search for answers has been frustrating, and have hired an attorney to help. Two of Avellaneda Delgado’s six children who lived with their father told the Guardian he had no health conditions before being detained – but somehow was put in a wheelchair during the weeks he spent in jail, and was unable to speak during a family visit. The Guardian learned that he was given medications while in jail.View image in fullscreenAbelardo Avellaneda Delgado and his family.Photograph: Courtesy of Abelardo Avellaneda Delgado’s family“Junior” Avellaneda, who bears his father’s name and is the youngest, said he and his sister, Nayely, were rebuffed several times in their attempts to visit their father during the 25 days he was in jail, receiving emails that said only “visit request denied”. Screenshots of the emails were shared with the Guardian.On 4 May, Junior finally was allowed a visit and drove the 30 minutes from the house where he lives with his father and Nayely, in Statenville. At the jail, he was shocked to see his father brought out in a wheelchair.“My heart drops,” Junior said of the moment he saw Abelardo Sr. “I’m thinking, ‘What’s he doing in the wheelchair?’ Junior, 32, said he had never seen his father like that. The two sat facing each other, with a glass partition between them. “I tried to get his attention and tapped on the glass. He was zoned out. At one point, he tried to stand up and fell back on his chair.”“He didn’t make eye contact with me and kept bobbing his head left and right,” he said. Junior asked a jail staffer accompanying Abelardo, Sr to hold the phone to his ear. “I said, ‘Dad, please answer me! Say something to me!’ He just said, ‘Hmmmm.’ It broke me.”The staffer told Junior: “We gave him his medication, that’s probably why he’s that way.” He thought, what medication? His father never took any medications at home, he said.Lowndes county jail’s Capt Jason Clifton told the Guardian that Avellaneda Delgado was kept in the medical unit of the jail. Asked why, he referred to “a note in the system that says he hadn’t been eating enough, and didn’t like the food”.“I don’t believe he was on any medications,” Clifton said. “I don’t see anything in the medical chart.” Told about Junior’s account, the captain checked with the jail’s nurse, who listed five medications being given to Avellaneda Delgado, two of which were for high blood pressure, plus an antibiotic.The morning after Junior’s visit, the local jail handed Avellaneda Delgado over to Ice, for transport to Stewart detention center. Several hours later, Webster county coroner Steven D Hubbard was called to Weston, Georgia, where the van transporting Avellaneda Delgado had stopped on 5 May, after the driver called 911. A text summarizing the call sent by police to Hubbard said Avellaneda Delgado was “unresponsive”, with a blood pressure of 226/57. When the coroner arrived at the scene, he was already dead.The coroner told investigative reporter and immigration researcher Andrew Free he suspected that an aortic aneurysm was the cause of death. The Guardian heard a recording of the interview. Hubbard told the Guardian he doesn’t know where the blood pressure reading cited in the text summarizing the 911 call came from – “but if that was his blood pressure when he left Lowndes, he shouldn’t have been going to Stewart. He should’ve been going to the hospital.”Avellaneda Delgado’s family only learned of his death because the Mexican consulate in Atlanta called Nayely with the news – a pattern seen in most deaths under Ice custody, said Valencia, of El Refugio. “You want to know what happened, but you face a system that is stopping access every step of the way,” he said.Ice’s press release on the incident says the death is “under investigation”. But Clifton and Hubbard both told the Guardian no one has contacted them, more than a month later.The family has learned there are at least two public agencies and three private companies that may have answers about what happened: Lowndes county and Ice; plus CoreCivic, which runs Stewart; CoreCivic’s wholly-owned subsidiary TransCor, the company paid to transport detainees; and Southern Health Partners, the company paid to provide healthcare to detainees in Lowndes county jail.The Guardian asked Ice, TransCor and CoreCivic about the incident – including whether vans and buses transporting immigration detainees are equipped with cameras. Ice and TransCor did not respond.Ryan Gustin, senior director of public affairs for CoreCivic, said: “At TransCor, the safety and security of the public, our staff, and those entrusted to our care are our highest priorities. To that end, we do not publicly disclose how the TransCor fleet is equipped, related to safety and security equipment.”Transportation of detainees is more under the control of private companies than in the past, said Katherine Culliton-González, chief policy counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. TransCor president Curtiss D Sullivan titled the company’s 2025first quarter outlook“The Time for Growth is Now”. CoreCivic’s TransCor is not the only company growing its transport business under Trump; the Geo Group, which runs 16 immigration detention centers across the country, also has a transportation subsidiary.Added to the privatization of services needed for Trump’s mass immigration push is the decimation of agencies performing federal oversight of Ice – includingthe Office for Civil Rights and Civil Ciberties (CRCL) and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (Oido),said Culliton-González. In this setting, “how can we hold private companies accountable?” she said.The issue of oversight will be increasingly important as more health issues and deaths follow the increasing number of detainees being transported around the country. “Ice right now is all about more people coming in, and pushing them through [to deportation],” saidDora Schriro, a consultant on immigration and former Ice official.“As input/output grows – not just in size, but in speed – the likelihood of making mistakes is going to increase,” Schriro said. “Ice should make sure every person they take from law enforcement is fit for travel – for the length and conditions of being transported.”Avellaneda Delgado was the first Ice detainee in at least a decade to die while being transported from a local jail to a federal detention center, said Free, who alsowrote about the casefor ACPC, an Atlanta-based digital outlet.Meanwhile, Avellaneda Delgado’s children just spent their first Father’s Day without him. The day was doubly difficult for the youngest because it was also his birthday. Heavy rains kept the family from visiting Avellaneda Delgado’s grave. “It bothers me,” Junior said. Then he added: “He was a great grandfather.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationGeorgianewsShareReuse this content"

They had privately hired Disneyland Paris claiming it was a real wedding.”Four people were arrested and taken into police custody. Two were still being questioned on Sunday on suspicion of fraud and money-laundering.They included a man said to have been the fake groom, who is alleged to have organised the event. He is 22 and thought to be British, AFP reported. A 24-year-old Latvian woman was also being questioned.The young girl, who is Ukrainian, was not found to have suffered any “violence or constraint”, the prosecutor’s office said. Her mother, aged 41, was released from questioning, as was a 55-year-old Latvian man.Disneyland Paris is Europe’s most-visited theme park and can be hired for weddings at a very high price outside opening hours, with its Sleeping Beauty Castle as a backdrop.It was unclear why a fake wedding might have been staged there, and what the child’s role was. The local daily paper, Le Parisien, reported that extras who were to attend in the role of guests were taken by bus to the area.One of the extras who was hired to attend what she thought was a real wedding told France Inter radio: “I saw the panic of the Disney people, then, through the window, I saw a small child with a wedding dress on. A woman was carrying her in her arms and that’s when I understood that the child was really young.”Disneyland Paris told the station: “A private event booked at our destination was immediately cancelled by our staff after irregularities were identified. Police were called and arrived quickly.”The theme park said it was cooperating with authorities and had filed its own legal complaint.Explore more on these topicsFranceParisEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The raid has been heavily criticised by politicians, campaigners and religious groups.Booth, who claims to have never been involved in disruptive protest and to have previously attended one peaceful Youth Demand march on Downing Street, said the arrest had left him with post-traumatic stress disorder.He said the officers who arrested him appeared to be surprised that he lived in supported accommodation for vulnerable adults.After a support worker let the police into his flat, an officer had grabbed his arm, he claimed, and asked whether “I need to put you in handcuffs” before reading him his rights.“They did not know until they turned up that I lived in supported accommodation,” claimed Booth, who is a cleaner on the London underground. “When they arrested me, they said to me: ‘Joe, is this supported accommodation?’ They didn’t know. You would think there would be a system in place when they are going to an address to say this is a care setting.”Booth was in his pyjamas when the police arrived. They searched his bedroom and seized his work phone. He was then taken on a two-hour drive to Kingston police station where he was questioned and held for more than seven hours.He was released on police bail with conditions that included a ban on him entering Westminster.View image in fullscreenJoe Booth had previous handed out leaflets promoting Youth Demand’s plans to oppose arms sales to Israel and a lack of action on fossil-fuel harm.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianBooth, whose brother was allowed to attend the police interview as an “appropriate adult” due to his vulnerability, said: “They showed me pictures of protests that I wasn’t even in. They showed me pictures of [information about] upcoming events, only a few of which were actually protests, the other which were just meetings and free food events. So they didn’t tell me at any point what evidence they had on me and why they got me and how they even knew my face.”He had previously attended Youth Demand meetings at the Quaker meeting hall on St Martin’s Lane in London where attenders enjoyed a spread of jasmine tea, ginger biscuits and a selection of vegan cheese straws.Youth Demand had been planning a series of 10-minute protests as part of a “Shut Down London” campaign and Booth had handed out leaflets promoting the group’s actions in opposition to arms sales to Israel and a lack of action on fossil-fuel harm, he said.Booth, whose father is John Leach, the assistant general secretary of the RMT union, claimed: “I was only planning to spread news of the events. I’m not at a stage in my life where I’m ready to risk going to prison.“Like all autistic people, I can often struggle to understand certain messages that are told to me, which is why I often need staff with me when I receive letters, because I interpret things differently and I also can’t survive without structure and routine.

So my alertness has increased and my anxiety has increased. And I see a therapist every single week, because I always have and he’s in full knowledge of how it’s been affecting me.”Booth had previously been arrested in June 2024 on the same grounds after attending Just Stop Oil meetings, he said, but again released on police bail without charge. Booth claimed he had never been involved in their disruptive activities. “I remember specifically going to meetings and saying, ‘I have not been at a protest,’” he said. “It has left me bewildered.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Our human ancestors knew the extraordinary power of peatlands, so why are they still being destroyed?Alys FowlerSun 22 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 06.22 EDTShareIhaven’t found an hour when I don’t love a bog. Recently, after a night of counting rare caterpillars in Borth in Mid Wales (they come out only after dark), walking back to the car under the glow of aflower moon, I wondered if 2am was my new favourite. I felt very safe, held by the bog’s softness, and everyone that was out at that hour seemed to have a sense of humour. I met a nightjar hopping around on the ground, pretending, I think, to be a frog.But there is also something about the humidity of a languid afternoon on a bog, when everything slows and fat bumbles hum, that is surprisingly good. I have done freezing horizontal rain and thick, cold-to-your-bones fog and wind so howling that I couldn’t think. All of those were hard, but I did come away feeling truly alive.I have travelled to the tip of Scotland and far beyond to visit bogs. In all the hours, days and weeks I have spent on them, I have learned that time behaves differently. It stretches out like the bog landscape, seeming to still the world beyond. There is something very special about that.Like many of us, I came to know bogs not by visiting one, but by ripping open a bag of compost and plunging my hands into the soft, dark peat. Then I learned that there was more to peat than an amiable bed in which to coax a plant to grow. It is ripped from a living, breathing entity with complex ways and wants. We sneer at bogs, we tease them and drain them, scrape at them and pillage them, but give them back their waters and they care not just for the creatures that live on them, but those much further afield.View image in fullscreenDartmoor’s Fox Tor Mire is a good example of a valley blanket bog.Photograph: Douglas Lander/AlamyThere is more carbon stored in peatlands than in all the above-ground vegetation in the world. They account for 3% of landmass, but hold at least 30% of soil carbon. Seventy per cent of the UK’s drinking water starts its journey on peatlands, where the bogs not only filter but also slow water, helping to mitigate flooding. This is why draining, extracting and turning peat into agricultural land has consequences. Roughly80% of the UK’s peatlands are damaged, polluting our water, exacerbating flooding and increasing the risk of fires.But this knowledge doesn’t stop us using extracted peat. Sure, I don’t buy peat compost, but I have eaten fresh cultivated mushrooms (most large-scale growing is done in peat), bought supermarket basil (usually peat-grown), “saved” numerous discounted houseplants (only about 11% of houseplants are truly grown peat-free) and eaten lettuce, celery, potatoes, carrots, peas, beans and tomatoes, some of which are grown in the UK on drained peat, as well as crisps, biscuits, cakes and chips made with palm oil grown on drained peatlands in south-east Asia. Most of us are complicit in damaging, extracting and wasting peat, despite years of writing, campaigning, shouting and imploring.I decided I would get to know the bogs, to learn their ways and stories and see if a different song might stir the soul. Bogs are magical in many ways. These ancient beings are much more than their brown flatness suggests from a distance. Below the surface, they seduce water with their engineering. Under every bog is a sea held in suspension, so when you walk over a bog you are truly walking on water. It is why they wobble when you jump up and down on them. They are nature’s answer to a water bed. Don’t jump, though – they are fragile places. It takes an average of 25 years for a footprint to disappear.What is a bog? Well, there are many types of peatlands, but broadly speaking peat is either fen or – more frequently – bog. A fen is alkali: it gets its water from a ground or surface source and is flushed with minerals because of it. A bog is acid: it is fed entirely by the sky, which means it is very poor in nutrients. Bogs form in wet places, where the humidity and rainfall are high and evapotranspiration (the combined process where water moves from land to air) is low.Many of them start life as a depression, a hollow or a dip in the land that starts to fill with water. The rock below is hard, often impervious, such as granite, and the water pools. As the climate and world around it change, things begin to grow around the bog: plants spring up, die, fall in the water. The dip starts to fill with rotting organic matter, creating oxygen-poor, acidic conditions. Most things don’t want to grow in waters that are turning acidic, but mosses don’t mind; in fact, they thrive. This is particularly true of bog mosses, which are from the genusSphagnum. The mosses creep in, the rain continues to fall and the bog is born, made up of plants, mostly mosses, some rushes and a few shrubs, living and dying, but not completely rotting. This is what peat is: partially decomposed organic matter. When it is wet, it is happy; when it is drained of water, it starts rotting again.A similar process happens with fens. But whereas peat is extracted from bogs to be used for compost, most of our lowland fens have been drained for agriculture. That flush of minerals from the groundwater makes them fertile places, once drained.Peat in the northern hemisphere is mostly made up of mosses. They call the shots; they are the ecosystem engineers. These tiny, centimetre-high plants are alchemists, taking only what falls from the sky and creating a kind of immortality for themselves as they strive to be dead and alive at the same time. They do this by pickling themselves and everything that falls into the bog in acid, which means nothing entirely rots away. The bog mosses’ pickle juice also prevents bigger plants from doing too well and shading out the moss.View image in fullscreen‘They are nature’s answer to a water bed’ … Alys Fowler at Cors y Llyn.Photograph: Joann Randles/The GuardianThe mosses do this in such style, too. They don’t stick to the run-of-the-mill green – they come in every jewel tone imaginable: golds and oranges, neon-green emeralds, lobster pinks and deep wine reds, in russets and chestnut browns, their colours turning with the seasons, deepening across the summer. What appears flat from a distance up close rises and falls in miniature mountains of hummock-type mosses, with valleys, pools and lawns of looser types.The things that live on and in this world have run with this otherworldly theme. There are the giants:bog bush-cricketswith their huge antennae;emperor mothswith their peacock-like eyespots on their wings; darters, damselflies and dragonflies of all colours that often come to peer at you curiously if you sit for a while.This is to say nothing of the green-eyed horseflies, which are a terrifying size, although it is hard to not be beguiled by their giant emerald eyes. There are frogs, toads, lizards, snakes and so many spiders, including one of Britain’s largest, the raft spider. Spend long enough at a bog pool and you might spot one floating, waiting for the vibrations of prey, only to run across the surface of the water and pounce. They go for prey as large as tadpoles, but if you frighten them, they dive and swim underwater. Imagine that – a swimming spider!These are just the easy-to-spot guys. There is an abundance of tiny insects: pseudoscorpions, gnats, midges (not all of which bite), strange-looking larvae and tiny micromoths that flit about. These bring an abundance of other wings. Peatlands are hugely important habitats for birds: hen harriers, golden and white-tipped eagles, merlins, owls, jack snipes, golden plovers, curlews, lapwings, pipits, snow buntings, grouse, dunlins, redshanks and, at coastal edges, strange-looking ducks. A chorus of beings in full song for those intrepid enough to venture in.For that is the thing about bogs: they are not hugely interested in wowing you. The mountains have good views and the forest has majesty; the sand dunes sculpture and the wildflower meadow an easy romance. But the bog is quite happy to be passed over – it will share its best secrets only with those who carefully tiptoe in and are patient enough to wait a while to see what comes out once they have settled down.View image in fullscreenThe remarkably well preserved Tollund Man, who died circa 300BC.Photograph: robertharding/AlamyThe bog has other secrets, too: underneath this living layer, preserved in all that peat, is an archive of our past doings. A healthy bog grows just a millimetre a year, which puts in context anyone who tries to argue that cutting peat is sustainable. It is important to remember that less than 13% of our bogs are considered healthy, or in a near-natural state. But each millimetre is a record of everything that happened that year: it holds big data, such as fragments of moth wings or pollen and seeds, and tiny microbe data, such as all the amoeba that dined on the semi-rotting plant material before it got weighed down by water. This allows scientists to take a core sample and tell you what the climate was like 6,000 years ago, which plants grew there, which moths fluttered and which bees buzzed, who crawled over and passed by.There are other buried treasures. The most famous are the bog bodies, including Denmark’s iron-ageTollund Manand Ireland’s bronze-ageCashel Man, but you can also find hoards of coins, jewellery and weapons, as well as pots and pans, fishing nets, whole canoes, carts and cartwheels and even butter. When our ancestors buried all this, they knew it wouldn’t disappear or rot away. It is believed that this is why so much of it is decommissioned, broken and bent, just in case the bog was a portal to another world and the undead might be able to use it when they rose again.Ritually buried bog butter is often found near bog bodies. It represents such a huge amount of milk to a culture only just beginning to farm that if it wasn’t a gift to the gods, perhaps it was a gift to the bog itself. The bog certainly represented seasonal abundance for those who knew where to look. It was a source of plant medicines, dyes and fibres. Then there is the rich foraging opportunity: cranberries, bilberries and cowberries, as well as all the meat and eggs from otters, fish and fowl. Not an easy place to get on or off, but useful nevertheless.The reverence our ancestors felt for bogs is a lesson we need to remember. They aren’t barren or desolate, although many are certainly remote. They shouldn’t be drained or burned to make them productive, nor should they be extracted from. What they need is our respect, because peatlands are the air-conditioning units of the world. Their long-term storage of carbon and filtering of water is helping to keep our climate cool. And no one needs the air-con turned off now.Six of Britain’s best bogsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Richard Becker/AlamyCors y Llynnear Builth Wells in Powys is a great example of aquaking bog, with strange, stunted ancient Scots pines growing on it.

Theyalso want Ofwat to reverse £254m in fines and penalties imposed on Thames over the past two years.These comprise two fines imposed in May –£104.5m for “significant” sewage and wastewater failures and £18.2m for illegally paying dividends– and another £131.3m of tax losses that Thames transferred to its parent company, whichOfwat has said it will claw back.The Liberal Democrat MP for Witney in Oxfordshire, Charlie Maynard, haschallenged Thames Water in the high court, including trying to block a £3bn high-interest rescue loan from the creditors.Maynard said: “Thames Water’s creditors are trying to dictate government policy and bully the regulators. Steve Reed must not cave in to these demands. The secretary of state should call their bluff.“If the company ends up in special administration it is the vulture funds who stand to lose billions, Thames Water’s 16 million customers will be released from a mountain of debt and the company will be better able to start fixing its problems.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The government must stand up and oppose any attempt by Thames Water to railroad the British people.“Being able to apply for a judicial review is one of the fundamental cornerstones of democracy. As a democracy, we are totally dependent on the ability of people to take the government and quangos to the high court to have that level of scrutiny from the judiciary. It’s a balance and check against abuse of power.”A spokesperson for the creditors said: “Broad regulatory support is needed to unlock a market-led solution for Thames Water that will secure billions of pounds in fresh investment for its ageing network, allowing a world-class leadership team to start the intensive turnaround and deliver better outcomes for customers and the environment.”A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “The government will always act in the national interest on these issues.“Thames Water must meet its statutory and regulatory obligations to their customers and to the environment. It is only right that the company is subject to the same consequences as any other water company.“The company remains financially stable, but the government has stepped up our preparations and stand ready for all eventualities, including special administration regime if that were to become necessary.”A spokesperson for Thames said: “Thames Water is committed to improving outcomes for the environment and its customers. We are investing billions of pounds in our network and any recapitalisation of the business will need to ensure that is maintained for the benefit of all our stakeholders.“Our focus remains on a holistic and fundamental recapitalisation, delivering a market-led solution, which includes targeting investment-grade credit ratings. In order to be investable, we and prospective investors would need to engage in discussions with our regulators.”A spokesperson for Ofwat said: “We are assessing whether the plans are realistic, deliverable and will bring substantial benefits for customers and the environment.’’Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It’s a testament to the dreams of the Caribbean diaspora and the legacy of my generation, who dared to build a better future against the odds.”Campaigners are looking to HistoricEnglandfor a lifeline. The Save Bridge Park campaign applied to the heritage body earlier this year to have the building listed to save it from development, a move backed by the Labour MP Dawn Butler, Paul Boateng, the UK’s first Black cabinet minister, and the broadcaster Trevor Phillips.In the years since Bridge Park was taken over by the local authority, the focus has shifted from enterprise to sports, leisure and events, but it remains well used, with a powerful legacy.Until 1981 it was the Stonebridge bus depot, where staff from the Windrush generation worked. When the site became disused, local young people formed a cooperative – the Harlesden People’s Community Council – to transform it into a space for Black-owned businesses, with funding from Brent council and the former Greater London Council, amid high unemployment and discrimination in Margaret Thatcher’s Britain.Founders included thecommunity leader Leonard Johnson, whose philosophy – “let’s build and not destroy” – prevented disorder from spreading to Harlesden on the night of Brixton’s uprising in 1981.2:00Who are the Windrush generation? – video explainerBridge Park was inaugurated by King Charles, then the Prince of Wales, in 1988. At its peak it had 32 business units, a sports hall, theatre, training centre, recording studio, restaurant and bar.The Royal Shakespeare Company’s Ray Fearon, 51, and the Premier League footballer Raheem Sterling, 30, spent formative years there, and arebacking plans to save it.Brent council said it acknowledged “the part Bridge Park had in an important chapter in Black British history”, but spending £1.5m to bring it up to “suitable safe standard” was “not a good use for public funds”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, we want to get on with building a brand new leisure centre for the community, which will be more than double the size and purpose-built.“Our plans are all about transforming the area for the benefit of local people – much-needed new homes, more green spaces and new jobs.”Rebecca Markus, a researcher and co-lead of Save Bridge Park, said: “It’s a really amazing, early example of adaptive reuse. There’s an idea that for a building to be of architectural merit it needs to be designed by a star architect and subscribe to a specific style, but if our heritage is actually going to reflect the nation then we have to be inclusive in the way we think about these things.“Buildings hold a tangible connection to the past that can’t be captured by words or photographs.”Historic England is expected to make a decision this summer.

Fans resplendent in costumes inspired by their idol milled around the concourse, and groups of women took selfies, jigging with excitement.But among the jollity, specialist Met Officers interspersed in the crowd were on the hunt for something different: “We’re here to spot predatory men.”On the lookout for offences ranging from upskirting to sexual assault, seven specially trained officers stood on standby as scores of female fans, most of them aged between 14 and 30, filtered into the venue. They were there as part of an initiative billed as “the first of its kind” by the Met.The idea is to combat violence against women and girls in real time. According to the force, reports rose by more than a third between 2018 and 2023. By putting officers in places where women may be vulnerable, while they are distracted while dancing with friends or having enjoyed a drink at a concert, officers are hoping to bring down numbers by stopping attacks before they happen.View image in fullscreenOfficer Sherelle Jones hands a Dua Lipa fan a leaflet about the new initiative.Photograph: Andy Hall/The GuardianOne of the officers on patrol at the Lipa concert was 23-year-old Sherelle Jones. “I’d like to be the help that I wish I had if I was in that situation,” she said, watching a sea of pink cowboy hats and selfie sticks outside the stadium.The patrol was first rolled out on 5 June during Beyoncé’s sold-out Cowboy Carter tour at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and will provide an increased police presence at 51 large-scale concerts throughout the capital this summer. According to the Met, it has already led to the removal of one man on suspicion of stalking and threatening behaviour, and the arrest of another for upskirting.“I’m quite new to the job, but it’s been eye-opening,” said Jones, who joined the Met last year. “Even behaviour I witnessed at the Cowboy Carter tour when I was off duty made me see that this is really needed.”Many female concert-goers were inclined to agree: hours before the singer was due on stage, friends Maya Somerville and Anneka Terrance, who had travelled from Scotland to the stadium, had already planned their route home after dark.“As a woman, there are so many things that you automatically do that you shouldn’t have to,” said 28-year-old Somerville. “Like I sometimes walk home with my keys between my knuckles.”An increased police presence, said Terrance, means “you don’t have to be constantly looking over your shoulder every two seconds”.According to the group, there were 17 reports of violence against women and girls at London’s large-scale music events last year, but with the number of such events more than doubling in 2025, and 3 million people expected to attend events at Wembley alone, police fear the number could grow.View image in fullscreenAlicia Long (left) and Alyx Spanton (right).Photograph: Andy Hall/The GuardianNot everyone was quite so convinced that more police meant better protection for women. “Generally seeing a lot of officers puts me on edge,” said 24-year-old Alyx Spanton. “But especially when they’re male.”Of the seven officers on duty on Friday, just two were women. “This is a female-dominated event – there are so many other women around you that you generally just feel safe. Women support women better than police support women,” Spanton added.Her friend Alicia Long, 25, was similarly cynical: “When I hear the Met police, I automatically think of Sarah Everard.“For me, more police isn’t the solution. It’s bizarre – this is not the environment where I feel unsafe. A football event? That’s the one that needs this. Not a concert by a female artist attended by women.”Explore more on these topicsViolence against women and girlsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

But he is not expected to be allowed to go free.At his 13 June detention hearing, prosecutors said US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) would take Ábrego García into custody if he were released on the criminal charges, and he could be deported before he has a chance to stand trial.US magistrate judge Barbara Holmes has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday to discuss the conditions of Ábrego García’s release. The US government has already filed a motion to appeal the judge’s release order.Denied, detained, deported: the faces of Trump’s immigration crackdownRead moreHolmes acknowledged in her ruling on Sunday that determining whether Ábrego García should be released is “little more than an academic exercise” because Ice will probably detain him. But the judge wrote that everyone is entitled to the presumption of innocence and “a full and fair determination of whether he must remain in federal custody pending trial”.Holmes wrote that the government failed to prove that Ábrego García was a flight risk, that he posed a danger to the community or that he would interfere with proceedings if released.“Overall, the Court cannot find from the evidence presented that Ábrego’s release clearly and convincingly poses an irremediable danger to other persons or to the community,” the judge wrote.Ábrego García has pleaded not guilty to the smuggling charges that his attorneys have characterized as an attempt to justify the deportation mistake after the fact.The acting US attorney for the middle district ofTennessee, Rob McGuire, argued on 13 June that the likely attempt by Ice to try to deport him was one reason to keep him in jail.But Holmes said then that she had no intention of “getting in the middle of any Ice hold”.“If I elect to release Mr Ábrego, I will impose conditions of release, and the US Marshal will release him.” If he is released into Ice custody, that is “above my pay grade”, she said.The judge suggested that the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security could work out between themselves whether the government’s priority is to try him on the criminal charges or deport him. No date has been set for the trial.Will Allensworth, an assistant federal public defender representing Ábrego García at the detention hearing, told Holmes that “it’s not necessarily accurate that he would be immediately deported.”A 2019 immigration judge’s order prevents Ábrego García, who had been living in Maryland, from being deported to his home country of El Salvador, Allensworth said in court. That’s because he faces a credible threat from gangs there, according to court papers.The government could deport him to a third country, but immigration officials would first be required to show that third country was willing to keep him and not simply deport him back to El Salvador, Allensworth said.The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding in Tennessee during which Ábrego García was driving a vehicle with nine passengers. Although officers suspected possible smuggling, he was allowed to go on his way with only a warning. He has pleaded not guilty.At the detention hearing, McGuire said cooperating witnesses have accused Ábrego García of trafficking drugs and firearms and of abusing the women he transported, among other claims. Although he is not charged with such crimes, McGuire said they showed Ábrego García to be a dangerous person who should remain in jail pretrial.Ábrego García’s attorneys have characterized the smuggling case as a desperate attempt to justify the mistaken deportation. The investigation was launched weeks after the US government deported Ábrego García and the supreme courtordered the administrationto facilitate his return amid mounting public pressure.The US is now expected to try to deport him again with much of the world watching and the outcome hard to predict.Kilmar Ábrego García pleads not guilty to human smuggling chargesRead moreMost people in Ice custody who are facing criminal charges are not kept in the US for trial but deported, César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, an Ohio State University law professor, said.The US will probably try to deport Ábrego García quickly without going before an immigration judge, the professor said. The government would not need a conviction to deport him because Ábrego García came to the US illegally.“The legal standard is laxer,” García Hernández said. “The government’s argument is on stronger legal footing.”However an immigration judge rules, the decision can be appealed to the board of immigration appeals, García Hernández said. And the board’s ruling can then be contested in a federal appeals court.Explore more on these topicsKilmar Ábrego GarcíaUS immigrationTennesseeLaw (US)Trump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

You’d think he’d take the situation in Los Angeles more seriously.“We’ve got a lot of important work to do. But this is how the vice-president chooses to act, and that says a lot.”Vance’s barb toward Padilla on Friday came during a visit to Los Angeles in which he accused mayor Karen Bass and California governor Gavin Newsom of encouraging violent anti-Ice protests to parry criticism from state officials. Local authorities had contended that, over their objections, Donald Trump’s administration fueled the unrest by sending federal officers and military troops tothe city.When a correspondent for the far-right Daily Wire asked aboutDemocratsbeing placed in handcuffs by federal officers, Vance referred to Padilla as “Jose Padilla”, invoking the name of a US national who was accused of plotting to detonate a radioactive dirty bomb on behalf of al-Qaida in 2002.“I was hoping Jose Padilla would be here to ask a question,” said Vance, who previously served on theUS Senatealongside Alex Padilla. “I guess he decided not to show up because there wasn’t a theater. And that’s all it is.”The Republican’s comments drew backlash fromDemocrats, prompting a spokesperson for Vance to say that the vice-president “must have mixed up two people who broke the law.”Newsom called Vance out in aposton social media. “JD Vance served with Alex Padilla in the United States Senate. Calling him ‘Jose Padilla’ is not an accident,” Newsom wrote.Newsom continued to take shots at Vance,postingthat it was nice of Vance to “finally make it out to California” and challenging him to a debate. “Since you’re so eager to talk about me, how about saying it to my face? Let’s debate. Time and place?” the post read.Anothersocial media postfrom Newsom’s press office account addressed Trump and included a cartoonish depiction of Vance at a podium. “Donald, you should send @JDVance out to California more often. He’s absolutely crushing it!”In his interview with MSNBC, Padilla alluded to the fact that he had neither been arrested nor charged with any crimes after he was handcuffed and removed from the Noem news conference, saying, “I didn’t break any laws.”Padilla’s removal – caughton video– occurred as he tried to ask questions about the White House’s immigration policies, which were implemented after Trump won a second presidency in November despite having been convicted in criminal court of 34 felony charges of criminally falsifying business records in a case that involved payments to adult film actor Stormy Daniels.He told The Weekend that he would have no issue if Trump’s immigration crackdown was aimed exclusively at “drug dealers, violent criminals, dangerous criminals, et cetera”.“Everybody is on board with that,” he said. But he mentioned recentnews reportingthat established most people being taken into Ice custody “have no serious criminal convictions”, as he put it.Padilla’s removal from the Noem press briefing was just one of many instances of “overreach” demonstrated by Trump’s administration since he retook office in January, he said to The Weekend.“We have no choice but to stand up – we have no choice but to speak up,” said Padilla, who joined the Senate in 2021. “As painful as [the removal] was for me, for my family, it’s not about me.“If this is what this administration is willing to do to a senator trying to ask a question, imagine … what is happening in all corners of the country … when the cameras are not on.”Robert Mackeycontributed reportingExplore more on these topicsJD VanceUS politicsTrump administrationRepublicansDemocratsUS SenateUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

Humanitarian assistance falls back. So this will have real-world consequences. There’s no way to avoid that. The scale of cuts is just much too large.”Dodds’s successor, Jenny Chapman, has suggested the move to a “0.3 world”,marks a shift from “charity” to a “partnership”with developing countries – but Malik rejects that characterisation.“Respectful partnerships: yes, I agree, it’s hugely important, but that is not what our partners have experienced. And indeed, as this government goes from 0.5 to 0.3, that is not what our partners will be experiencing. They will be experiencing withdrawal,” he says.“In a country like Pakistan or Ethiopia or in Nepal, or Indonesia or other parts of the world, their experience of Britain over these last five years is of us not being at the table, trying to work collaboratively to find solutions to the problems that we both face, but as one of exit.”Malik sees the UK’s stance as part of a wider shift away from multilateralism in an increasingly complex geopolitical context – including a more insular US.“Early on in my time as a civil servant – I joined DfID in 1997 – and through the early 2000s, there was a real sense that you could remake the world in the post cold war era and deal with global challenges in a way that was fair, equitable, and that created a better future for everyone: that you could win. And I think that opportunity has been squandered.”View image in fullscreenStarmer was said to have been adept at juggling egos and issues at tricky G7 summit this week.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/APAlongsideother charity leaders, he is calling on the UK government to engage at the highest level with the UN Financing for Development conference in Seville at the end of this month, which is intended to be a collective attempt to confront challenges including the mounting global debt crisis.“It would be good for the prime minister to show up,” he said. “UK leadership requires engagement.”At home, Save the Children has been campaigning vociferously for the government to scrap the two-child limit that stops families receiving universal credit for their third and successive children. This month,Transport for London banned the charity’s adverton the issue, deeming it to be too political.Starmer has recently appeared to hint that he is preparing to move on the issue, when the government’s long-awaited child poverty strategy is finally published in the autumn.“We have one in three kids in the UK growing up in poverty. That’s a travesty,” Malik said. “The benefits system is the single quickest thing that the government could do to make a dent in child poverty.”View image in fullscreenJenny Chapman has suggested the move to a ‘0.3 world’ marks a shift from ‘charity’ to a ‘partnership’ with developing countries.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAHis charity also wants to see a “child lock”, similar to the pensions triple lock, that would prevent low-income families falling behind.Save the Children UK has been carefully rebuilding its reputation since it wascondemned by the Charity Commission in 2020for mishandling allegations of inappropriate behaviour by senior staff members between 2012 and 2015.It recently published an internal review covering a much more recent period, however – late 2023 – suggesting some staff had experienced antisemitism or anti-Muslim hatred at three internal events that included discussion of the war in Gaza. Save the Children accepted the review’s recommendations andapologisedto “colleagues have experienced any form of hatred – whether anti-Muslim hate, antisemitism or other – in the workplace”.Malik welcomed the fact the review had been commissioned, and committed the charity to learning from it. “As somebody who has suffered both Islamophobia and racism personally and violently, I have no truck with hatreds of any sort,” he says.As Malik prepares to visit Somalia, one of the 120 countries in which Save theChildrenoperates, he says the charity will continue to make the case for the UK to engage internationally.“This is a debate about the nature of the world in which we want our children and our grandchildren to grow up,” he says. “Britain is an open economy, in an open society. Our future is linked and intimately connected to the state of the world.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentForeign policyCharitiesChildrenAidKeir StarmerLabourinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Will it matter?The election has turned into an Israel-Palestine proxy war of sorts, even as voters on both sides wish the focus remained on local issuesAlice SperiSun 22 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 13.22 EDTShareSpeaking from a Jerusalem bomb shelter last week as Iran and Israel exchanged fire, a New York state senator posted avideomessage toNew York Cityvoters: “There is a mayoral primary coming up this week where one of the candidates does not believe the Jewish state has a right to exist,” said Sam Sutton, the senator from Brooklyn. “We don’t want to be in a situation like this in America.”Sutton called on New Yorkers to elect a “great friend of the Jewish people”:Andrew Cuomo, New York’s former governor.The appeal was a stark illustration of the outsized role a foreign country and its conflicts have come to play in local elections. While Tuesday’s vote is just the primary, the winner of the Democratic contest historically has gone on to win the mayoral contest in November – though this year could be different.“This election has turned into a two-person contest between Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mandani, two candidates with very stark views on this matter,” said Jacob Kornbluh, a senior politics reporter with the Forward Jewish newspaper.With New York City’s nearly one million Jews making up the largest Jewish population outside of Israel, mayors of the past have always claimed support for the country with little pushback. But the war in Gaza has fundamentally changed the dynamic. Mamdani’s outspoken support for Palestinians might have previously tanked his candidacy, but his insurgent campaign has galvanised voters. Cuomo has responded by portraying Mamdani as “dangerous” and himself as uniquely positioned to fight antisemitism, a growing source of anxiety among Jewish voters.Cuomo’s campaign – flush with millions from pro-Israel billionaires like Bill Ackman – has ramped up attacks against Mamdani as he surged in the polls, including bydistributing mailerscondemned as racist. The former governor has stated unequivocally that “anti-Zionism is antisemitism”.It’s not just Cuomo appealing to the fears of Jewish voters. Eric Adams – the current mayor, who is running as an independent given his plummeting popularity – recentlyadopteda contentious definition of antisemitism and floated running on an “EndAntisemitism” party line.Mamdanigrew emotionallast week while discussing the personal toll of the attacks, including multipledeath threats, and has invoked his experience as a Muslim New Yorker to say he understands the pain of the Jewish communities that hepledges to protect.“The attacks on Zohran are textbook post 9/11 Islamophobia,” said Sumaya Awad, a Palestinian New Yorker and member of the Democratic Socialists of America, one of the first groups to back his candidacy. She praised Mamdani for not “backing down”.Mamdani co-founded his college’s Students for Justice in Palestine chapter, and as a state assembly member,introduced legislationto stop the funding of illegal Israeli settlements. He has built an enthusiastic coalition of young, progressive, and unabashedly pro-Palestinain New Yorkers, as well as immigrants and many of the city’s roughly 800,000 Muslims.View image in fullscreenAndrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani spar during a mayoral debate with Democratic candidates in New York on 4 June 2025.Photograph: Yuki Iwamura/AFP/Getty ImagesCity comptroller and mayoral candidateBrad Lander,who is Jewish and has cross-endorsed Mamdani, has sought to find a middle ground and accused Cuomo and Adams of “using Jews as pawns”, he told the Guardian in an interview – “not with the intention of making Jews any safer, but with the intention of gaining political advantage for themselves”.“Thankfully it’s not the job of the mayor to find mutual recognition and peace and safety for Israelis and Palestinians,” he said. “It is incumbent on the next mayor, whatever their position is, to find ways to reach across the divide.”As some candidates stoke fears, anxiety around the election is palpable among many Jewish voters.Alex Kaufman, a leader of LGBTQ Zionists of NYC, which endorsed Cuomo, said he had always prioritized issues like housing affordability, sustainability, and racial inclusion. “But this year, my number one issue is antisemitism,” he said. “I’ve never felt this unsafe.”With election day around the corner, the race has turned into an Israel-Palestine proxy war of sorts, even as voters on both sides wish the focus remained on local issues. Candidates have been asked in mayoral debates about their support for Israel and whether they would visit – with Mamdani’s answers that he supports Israel’s right to exist as a state “with equal rights” and that as mayor he would stay in the city rather than travel to a foreign country drawing both praise and condemnation (including somefrom the left, who criticised him for recognising Israel at all). In recent days, Cuomo has seized on Mamdani’s position on the words “globalize the intifada”, saying theyfuel “hate” and “murder”.Beth Miller, the political director of Jewish Voice for Peace’s advocacy arm, which has been canvassing for Mamdani, said that his success challenges the long-held wisdom that a New York mayor must support the Israeli government. “If you believe in safety, freedom, dignity, and justice for people here at home, you can’t have a Palestine exception to that,” she said.‘The status quo is being bent’New York’s Jews are a diverse constituency – ranging from some anti-Zionists and others variously critical of Israel to orthodox communities traditionally voting as a unified bloc for more conservative candidates. Arecent pollof the city’s Jewish Democrats showed 31% supporting Cuomo, 20% backing Mamdani, and 18% behind Lander.In the middle are New York Jews who consistently vote Democratic and espouse a host of liberal and even progressive causes. Many are still reeling from the 7 October 2023 attacks in Israel, are uneasy about the tone of US protests against the war in Gaza, and are increasingly worried about Jewish safety, pointing to recent violent attacks in Washington DC, and Colorado, and defacing of Jewish businesses and synagogues in the city.View image in fullscreenPro-Palestine and pro-Israel protests in Times Square in New York City on 18 March 2025.Photograph: Pacific Press/LightRocket/Getty ImagesKaufman, of LGBTQ Zionists, said he wished there were “better options” but that many of his acquaintances were coalescing around Cuomo even as they have reservations about his past conduct, including the sexual assault allegations that ended his governorship. Others gravitated toward Lander, but were troubled by his endorsement of Mamdani. Some said they were “terrified” of the latter, pointing to his refusal to recognize Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state and his presence at protests where Houthi flags were on display.Cuomo has promised to run as an independent if Mamdani wins on Tuesday. Because Adams is running as an independent, and Mamdani is also expected to remain on the ballot as the Working Families Party candidate, the contest is far from over.But to some, the fact that an openly pro-Palestinian candidate has made it this far is a sign of a profound shift in the city’s politics.“The status quo is being bent,” said Awad. She said she cried when filling in her ballot early. “Hope is such a rare thing to feel these days.”Explore more on these topicsNew YorkUS politicsIsraelIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

John Palmer has a galloping cocaine habit and dozens of angry pensioners to deal with in Tenerife. Charlie Miller is finding that exile in Costa Rica doesn’t offer total protection. And Kenneth Noye has attracted the attention of the police for a brutal and brand new crime. The story is labyrinthine and the cast, led by Hugh Bonneville, Jack Lowden and Charlotte Spencer, is excellent.Phil HarrisonCapital’s Summertime Ball 20255.30pm, ITV1A week after the event, here are highlights from Capital’s big Wembley pop gig, and the lineup is impressively starry. As well as Jade, Lola Young and Renee Rapp are veteran chart-toppers including Jessie J, Will Smith and the regal headline act, Mariah Carey.Jack SealeDeath Valley8.15pm, BBC OneNothing about this cosy crime drama is groundbreaking and the premise of this episode feels strikingly familiar: a murder mystery event that turns into a real-life crime scene. Surely a situation in which Timothy Spall’s crime-fighting thesp John Chapel will be in his element? If only he wasn’t distracted by the prospect of romance.PHThis Cultural Life: Sheku Kanneh-Mason9pm, BBC FourView image in fullscreenAll things strings … This Cultural Life: Sheku Kanneh-Mason on BBC Four.Photograph: BBC StudiosAhead of a repeated Proms performance from siblings Sheku and Braimah Kanneh-Mason, this documentary finds Sheku talking to John Wilson about his influences.

Plus Guy Garvey pops in for a chat.PHThe Handmaid’s Tale10.25pm, Channel 4It’s go-time for June (Elisabeth Moss) and Moira (Samira Wiley) as the moment to execute their deadly plan arrives. Elsewhere in the final series of the haunting dystopian drama, Serena (Yvonne Strahovski) is shocked by a betrayal on her big day and makes a major decision for her and her son Noah.Nicole VassellFilm choiceIn a Lonely Place, 2pm, Talking Pictures TVAn unusual romantic lead at the best of times, Humphrey Bogart really pushed the boat out in terms of audience sympathy in this 1950 Nicholas Ray film. His Hollywood screenwriter Dixon Steele is sardonic and bitter, with a history of getting into fights. And when he is suspected of the murder of a hat-check girl, his blithe indifference raises the hackles of the cops. That doesn’t stop new neighbour Laurel (a superb Gloria Grahame) falling for him, but as she gets to know Dixon better her suspicions rise. An edgy mystery, with Bogart an opaque, menacing presence.Simon WardellStagecoach, 12.45pm, 5ActionView image in fullscreenA bumpy ride … Stagecoach on 5Action.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyCelebrated for making stars of John Wayne and its chief location, Monument Valley, John Ford’s 1939 film also showed that the western could allow for moral complexity in between shootouts. With renegade Apache Geronimo on the warpath, an assortment of ill-matched passengers find themselves on a dangerous journey. These include Wayne’s escaped convict, a sex worker, a drunken doctor, a cavalry officer’s wife and a thieving bank manager. Naturally, the rough and ready types prove more reliable than their social betters when push comes to shove.SWHappy Gilmore, 9pm, Comedy CentralJust in case the upcoming Netflix sequel doesn’t quite live up to expectations, here’s Adam Sandler’s 1996 slapstick comedy to prove where most of its best jokes originated. Sandler’s Happy is a dreadful ice-hockey player with a hair-trigger temper but he possesses a stupendously hard shot, which when adapted to the game of golf proves an unlikely boon. The disconnect between the etiquettes of the two sports is fertile ground for laughs, as is Sandler’s man-child shtick.SWSaltburn, 10.30pm, BBC OneView image in fullscreenBurning up … Saltburn on BBC One.Photograph: Courtesy of PrimeWriter-director Emerald Fennell has her gateau and eats it in this dark comedy thriller, satirising the British aristocracy while revelling in their massive houses and insouciant confidence.

She has little to hideLloyd GreenSun 22 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 08.02 EDTShareAt his wedding to Marla Maples inDecember 1993, two months after the birth of their daughter, Tiffany, Donald Trump got talking to Howard Stern.Accordingto the shock jock, Trump allegedly opined, charmingly: “Vagina is expensive.” Trump and Maplessplitin 1997. Nearly 30 years later, E Jean Carroll, an adjudicated victim of Trump’s verbal and sexual abuse, might at least in one way concur with his crude and sexist analysis.Carroll was assaulted by Trump in a changing room at Bergdorf Goodman, the New York department store. Thanks to court cases arising from that encounter, Trump owes her “slightly over $100m”, Carroll writes.Subtitled One Woman vs a President, at 368 pages her book – Not My Type – is a breezy read, packed with revenge, joy and barbed wit. Carroll is a former writer for Elle and Saturday Night Live, a biographer of Hunter S Thompson. At 81, she has little to hide.In court, Alina Habba, a Trump lawyer (now US attorney for New Jersey) said: “I hate to ask you this, but – approximately – how many people do you think you’ve slept with?“Eight? Could you list me those people?”Carroll approached it all with a disarming smile. But scars remain. There is venom in her book, however sweetly draped. Her contempt for Habba, for example, is unvarnished.Not My Type by E Jean Carroll.Photograph: St Martin’s PressIn May 2023, a federal civil juryfound Trump liablefor sexual abuse, forcible touching, and defamation. The jury awarded $5m in damages, rejecting Trump’s defense that Carroll was not his “type”. In a deposition, though, Trump mistook her for Maples. After the decision, Trump lashed out. That was a colossal mistake.“While I am sleeping, Trump has his CNN town hall and cracks everybody up with jokes about sexual assault and repeats every single thing that a unanimous federal jury just declared he has to pay me $5m for saying,” Carroll writes.“And, after I wake up? I sue him again.”It cost him. In January 2024, a second federal jury handed down another adverse verdict. The price tag topped $83m.Justice grinds on. So does interest accruing.“What am I gonna do with the $100m?” Carroll asks, quickly answering: “I,E Jean Carroll, pledge to make Trump very, very mad by giving most of the $100m to all things he hates. If Trump despises it … I’m gonna be giving money to it.”Think reproductive freedom, voting rights and combating the climate crisis.Trump haslosttwo rounds of appeals of the $5m judgment, the latest in early June. Review by the US supreme court seems likely. The second circuit intermediate appellate court, in Manhattan, is set to hear arguments in the $83m case later this month.Gleefully, Carroll takes a hatchet to Trump and a stiletto to his legal team. She homes in on Trump’s age, girth and flamboyance. Her prose is colorful and memorable. Though she is not above using simple words, to trash Trump as merely “old” and “fat”, in one very long and colorful sentence, she describes what she believes jurors witnessed:“Some are masked, all are upright, and, no way in God’s hell – whether they love Trump or loathe Trump – are they gonna miss telling their kids and grandkids that they saw the famous old geezer, with his peacock-blue tie jumping out in front of his shirt and his hair twirled across his forehead like Bette Davis in Now, Voyager, raise his small right hand and swear to tell the truth.”God, Trump, Bette Davis and peacocks. That’s writing.Habba, lead defense counsel at the second trial, earns particular scorn:“Wow! Alina Habba, Esq looks so pretty with her dark hair pulled into a low bun – the humble-brag of a beauty! – with her tremendous high heels, and her very tight, white sweater, and her electric-blue pantsuit hugging her round bottom, and her diamonds glittering from her ears.”The chaser: “At one point, when [Carroll’s counsel] is standing and objecting, Alina Habba, Esq smiles at the jury like Tiffany Haddish in Girls Trip, then turns to Judge Kaplan and asks: ‘Why is she objecting?’“His Honor replies: ‘This is not my law school examination.’”Kaplan and Carroll are not alone in their dim assessment of Habba. To quote the author Michael Wolff, she was “a lawyer with little relevant experience … hopelessly mismatched by Carroll’s legal team”.Carroll sheds light on prospective evidence that her team ultimately declined to introduce at trial, concerning Wolff, Trump and the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. She reminds us that in his book Too Famous, published in 2021, Wolff wrote that Trump “regaled” Epstein with “torrid details” of what passed between Trump and Carroll.Given the dramas of the Access Hollywood Tape and “Pussygate”, and Trump’s trial testimony that “unfortunately or fortunately” stars can grab women, Wolff’s tale carried at least a whiff of credibility. On the other hand, problems surrounding admissibility and hearsay might have been insurmountable. Furthermore, as Carroll writes, the “two words ‘Jeffrey Epstein’ are so flamingly prejudicial”. In the end, her legal team punted on injecting Epstein into the case.Hearteningly, Carroll is able to conclude her book on an upbeat note.“So, Friends, it looks like we are doing a bit of good here,” she writes. “We prove Trump is a liar. We changethe rape lawin New York.”At the first trial, the jury found that Trump had not raped Carroll because it determined that he had not penetrated her with penis. But after Judge Kaplandeterminedthe rape claim was “substantially true” in a 7 August 2023 decision, the statute wasamendedin early 2024. The “rape is rape” bill expanded the law to include nonconsensual anal, oral, and vaginal sexual contact.That victory belongs to Carroll alone.Not My Type: One Woman vs a Presidentis publishedin the US by MacmillanExplore more on these topicsBooksE Jean CarrollDonald TrumpreviewsShareReuse this content"

Passionate about the theatre,Charles Dickens, then just 20, wrote to the famous Covent Garden theatre actor-manager George Bartley seeking an audition, saying he believed he “had a strong perception of character and oddity, and a natural power of reproducing in my own person what I observed in others”.Bartley responded saying they were producing “the Hunchback” and arranging an appointment. Dickens planned to take his sister, Fanny, to accompany him singing on the piano.Then Dickens fell ill “with a terrible bad cold” and missed the audition. By the time the next season came around he had embarked on the parliamentary reporter job that would firmly set him on his path to novelist. Would the world have been deprived of his literary canon but for the timing of that cold?Yet Dickens never abandoned his love of theatre, which is examined in detail in a new exhibition, “Showtime!”, opening on 23 July at theCharles Dickens Museumin London, highlighting his fondness of drama and the dramatic impact of his works.It was evident in how he constructed stories, published as weekly serials with a cliffhanger.In public readings he would physically act out episodes on tours around Britain and America. His most famous one, of the gruesome murder of Nancy by Bill Sykes in Oliver Twist, was so intense it is said it contributed to his death, aged 58, in 1870.View image in fullscreenPages of Charles Dickens’s reading copy of The Story of Little Dombey.Photograph: Lewis Bush/Charles Dickens MuseumThe dramatic quality of his stories has lent them easily to innumerable adaptations over two centuries, from those brazenly pirated by the Victorian dramatist Edward Stirling at the Adelphi in London during Dickens’s lifetime to The Muppets Christmas Carol in 1992.The actor Simon Callow, who has played many Dickensian characters on stage and screen, said: “Performing was central to Dickens’s life from a very early age. His father used to take him as a five-year-old to the local pub where he would recite and sing.“Perhaps the pivotal moment of his life was his cancellation because of illness of an audition with the greatest actor-manager of his day. Instead he took a job as a parliamentary reporter and then the course of his life was set.”But Dickens never stopped writing, directing and performing plays, said Callow, a patron of the museum. “All this came to a head in the public readings, which he performed for massive and astounded audiences on both sides of the Atlantic.”One such astounded spectator was Mark Twain, who wrote of one Dickens reading of a “spry, (if I may say it,) thin-legged old gentleman, gotten up regardless of expense, especially as to shirt-front and diamonds … the very Dickens came! He did not emerge upon the stage – that is rather too deliberate a word – he strode.”Emma Harper, the exhibition’s curator, said: “I don’t think many are aware of the extent of Dickens’s theatricality. And particularly that ‘sliding doors’ moment. I don’t know had he gone into acting as his main career whether writing would have been that side hustle for him. It’s a great ‘what if?’.”View image in fullscreenAnother page of Dickens’s reading copy of The Story of Little Dombey.Photograph: Charles Dickens MuseumDickens wrote to his friend John Forster of the missed audition: “See how near I may have been, to another sort of life.” He said he still thought of the theatre. “I begin to be once more of opinion that nature intended me for the Lessee of a NationalTheatre– and that pen ink and paper have spoiled a (Theatre) Manager.”Harper said: “His drama comes through. We have his reading copies where he is taking his own work, he’s editing it, he’s striking through on the book, glueing pages together, highlighting, writing in his own stage directions to make it as dramatic as possible.”He said Dickens’s daughter Mamie, telling of watching him work, “describes how he jumps up from his desk, goes towards the nearest mirror and he acts out what he’s just written; he does all the faces, the voices and then he rushes back to the desk to write it back down again, so to check that his description matches what he wants his audience to experience.”The exhibition, funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, explores 200 years of performances of Dickens’s stories, from his own edited reading copies to letters, posters, playbills, programmes, photographs and props. Yes, and even including from the Muppets. “Can’t do this without the Muppets!” said Harper.Showtime! is on 23 July 2025 – 18 January 2026 at theCharles Dickens Museumat 48 Doughty Street, Holborn, London.Explore more on these topicsCharles DickensTheatreExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It could be any amateur choir in any town hall, but this motley group first meet to be among fellow lesbians and then embark on a quest to perform on the main stage of the Pride festival in a national competition.For a while, Iman Qureshi’s comic musical drama follows an “against-all-odds” trajectory, in the mould of a good, old-fashioned underdog endeavour warmly reminiscent of The Full Monty or Calendar Girls. It is exuberant and uplifting, accomplishing the extraordinary feat of being broad and universal in its appeal, yet speaking to and about the lesbian and queer community.Directed by Hannah Hauer-King, characters are comic but run clear of cliche; everyone is flawed but lovable, more and more as they reveal who they are. Shuna Snow infuses her part as conductor and Older Wiser Lesbian (OWL) with adorable physical comedy; Leah Harvey is excellent as Lori who is only half out of the closet; Georgie Henley’s performance, as Lori’s partner, Ana, grows from strength to strength. The frisson between Fi (Liz Carr) and Bridget (Mariah Louca) feels delicious until it turns into ideological schism, while Fanta Barrie is charming as the group’s lothario. Serena Manteghi is charming as Dina too, although her storyline (a woman in a controlling heterosexual relationship) is the only one which feels under-written. Zak Ghazi-Torbati, acting all marginal male parts, brings great comic froth.The interpersonal gripes and tensions are not huge in the first hour of the drama but, like paper cuts, surprisingly painful for something so small. There is sentiment but it is never sugary or manipulative. The serious brushes closely alongside the comic and vice versa. Connie, as the OWL is sent up for her old-school language, but so is Ana for the tyranny of her political correctness while there are passing, playful, digs at pronouns.To add to the mood-transforming magic are the songs, which are by turns funny (especially in a Bizet, Charli xcx and Lady Gaga mashup), full of feeling, and heart-stoppingly lovely in a cappella.There is a sharp left turn after the interval when the play re-orients its tone and purpose, so it seems, to turn audaciously into something different. Its arc is no longer that of the uplifting endeavour. Now it talks more directly about issues around these women’s identities and sexualities, from the attenuation of public spaces for lesbians to everydayhomophobia. At the centre is acrisis-point over trans identity that hits this choir.But drama is never sacrificed on the altar of sincerity.Story takes primacy and like best “heart warming” narratives, it wriggles its way in your heart to take residency there, weaving its delicate balance between the silly, sweet and serious. Having had a first run at Soho theatre in 2022, this is a second incarnation. Let’s hope for a third. Genuinely heart warming, and utterly winning with it.At Kiln theatre, London, until 12 JulyExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreLGBTQ+ rightsKiln theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

The least monumental of the symphonies, though still clearly long, it lent itself well to being scaled down, with each of the 14 instruments plus soprano in the last movement treated as soloists and the listener being given a new aural perspective on even the most familiar passages.In the hands of the top players that David Adams and Alice Neary bring together for their annual Penarth festival, the clarity and eloquence both of Mahler’s flowing contrapuntal writing and of his harmonies seemed to emerge newly minted. Schönberg himself had conducted that first concert; here, Ryan Bancroft was a quietly animated presence, alert to the teeming detail and to the irresistibly dancing lilt. Yet, in what is sometimes only characterised as the child-like innocence of this symphony, lurks the grim reaper figure, said to have been inspired byArnold Böcklin’s self-portrait, the scordatura mis-tuning of the violin giving death’s devilish waltz its grotesque edge. And even in the last movement’s setting of Das Himmlische Leben from Des Knaben Wunderhorn, always Mahler’s conscious destination for the work, the litany of saints have a delicious touch of anarchy about them. SopranoRebecca Evanscaptured both the mischievous excitability of the child’s vision of heaven and also the ethereal joy.Programming the two movements of the String Octet Op 11 by the young Shostakovich was a clever pointer to the affinity he would always have with Mahler. The drama and mystery of the Prelude and the whirling wildness of its Scherzo certainly made for an arresting opening to the evening.By contrast, the Clarinet Quintet Op 115 by Brahms that followed traced the late reflection of this composer’s life-long concerns with richly expansive line and a mellowness of sound, the two violas darkening the colours. The almost concertante flourish of Robert Plane’s clarinet in the Adagio second movement was vivid while, in the theme and variations of the final Con Moto, each individual player – and notably cellist Rebecca Gilliver – could relish their moment in the sun, beautifully played.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicGustav MahlerPenarthFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Amid Peru’s sacred mountains and ancestral plateaux, they confront daily challenges, such as parched pastures, melting glaciers, disruptions to agricultural cycles and persistent mining that damages the land.In this context, survival itself becomes an act of resistance.The Quechuas’ resistance involves men, women, children, animals and the ecosystem itself, but has never been closer to collapse.View image in fullscreenSheep grazing in the Sacred Valley of the Urubamba River, once the heartland of the Incas’ empireOver the past six decades,glaciers in the Peruvian Andes have lost more than 48%of their surface area, according to data from the national water authority. The Cusco region is no exception.View image in fullscreenA Quechua man in traditional dress during the Compadres festivalThe gradual retreat of glaciers has reduced the summer water supply, affecting small potato fields and the pastures where llamas, sheep and alpacas graze. In some areas, the productive capacity of pasture has decreased by up to 30%, making life harder for livestock.In dealing with this crisis, the public response has been fragmented. Although nationwide climate mitigation programmes exist, such asPerú Limpio(Clean Peru) or the environment ministry’snational adaptation plan, rural communities report poor implementation at the local level, particularly in remote provinces.View image in fullscreenEvery morning, a woman from the Quechua community of Misminay, near Maras, climbs the slopes with her dog, crossing ancestral lands that have long sustained pastoral lifeThis has resulted in increased internal migration. A report by IDL-Reporteros, an online newspaper based in Lima, and the aid organisation Care Peru indicates that more than 72,000 families left rural Andean areas between 2018 and 2024 due to drought, agricultural crises and a lack of structural support.View image in fullscreenIn one of the region’s most isolated areas, in a hamlet above the Sacred Valley, two women shear the wool from their dead sheep. As the ecosystem changes, villagers’ sheep are dying more frequentlyAgainst this backdrop, the resilience observed in Quechua villages is everywhere in everyday actions, such as tending endangered livestock, preparing soup with what is to hand, and teaching children to recognise the cycles of the Earth.View image in fullscreenChildren from the Queros community play near their homes. Due to the melting glaciers, their future is increasingly uncertainThe cult ofPacha Mama, meaning “Mother Earth” in Quechua, dates back to pre-Incan times on the Andean plateau. Spanish chroniclers documented her veneration as early as the 16th century, describing her as a female deity associated with fertility, soil and agricultural cycles.Today, millions of people in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and Chile maintain the ancient traditions.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop left: A Quechua shepherd climbs the steep slopes of the Sacred Valley carrying food for his family.

Above: At the foot of a snow-capped peak, 5,000 metres above sea level, a Quechua father and son perform the ancient ritual of spiritual purification and union with Pacha MamaFor the Quechua people, Pacha Mama is a tangible figure, to whom offerings of coca, maize, seeds and wool are made. She is “the mother of all living creatures”, according to Andean leaders, such as the late Quechua writer Hernán Huarache Mamani.“We must respect her, know her,” Mamani said.Quechua spirituality is more than a veneration cult – it is an active, communal form of resistance. It involves summoning all components of the world – air, rain, rocks, animals and people – into harmony, when faith is renewed, and for a moment, fatigue, drought and isolation are suspended.View image in fullscreenA group of men in ritual dress celebrate friendship and the bond with Pacha Mama during the Compadres festival in the Sacred Valley“In recent years, the glaciers that give us water are receding. The streams that feed the pastures dry up before summer, and the grasses gradually disappear. Animals are drinking less and eating poorly. And we with them,” says a Quechua woman.“I am afraid for the future of my grandchildren,” she says. “If the water continues to be lacking, they will be forced to leave these mountains or do jobs they don’t know.”View image in fullscreenAt the foot of the highest snow-capped peak in Queros, sacred to all the communities, a father and son perform a ritual of spiritual purification and union with Pacha MamaThis communal struggle drives a resistance more robust than any external pressure could possibly be. It is based, not on institutional structures or top-down funding, but on the bond that unites every living being to its environment.“I am very attached to this land, to the animals, to the mountains,” says Miguel, from the Queros Quechua community in the Sacred Valley.“Despite the loneliness and difficulties, I continue grazing and try to pass on the value of this activity to my grandchildren as well, so that one day they too can endure.”View image in fullscreenTwo llamas embrace in the Urubamba valley, embodying the resilience of their species, which is threatened by the rapid transformation of the Andean ecosystemThe Quechua people’s testimonies provide first-hand accounts of daily exposure to the pressures of a predatory system that, despite the climate crisis, continues to expand without enabling anyone to adequately address its consequences.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop left: A man from the Chahuaytire community prepares soup for his family.

The resistance of the Quechua through grazing, rituals and Pacha Mama worship is the voice of those who have built their existence in balance with the environment and who pay the highest price for the choices of others.Their model does not place humans at the centre of the world, but as part of a larger, ecological and participatory web where every element is indispensable for life.View image in fullscreenDuring the Compadres festival, groups of figures can be seen dancing in the Sacred ValleyExplore more on these topicsSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanIndigenous peoplesInternally displaced peopleEndangered habitatsClimate crisisPeruAmericasShareReuse this content"

That silence is exactly what these criminals are counting on.”Virtual funerals became common during the Covid pandemic and continue to be popular, as they allow friends and relatives who can’t attend in person to pay their respects.But they have become a target for online scammers who often home in on deaths that have been in the media, or those of young people, as they know there will be a lot of public interest.Victims often feel they can’t report what’s happened for fear of adding further stress to grieving familiesKatherine Hart, lead officer at CTSIThe National Association of Funeral Directors (NAFD) says the scam has been circulating for two years and is happening across the UK and Ireland.As many victims do not report what has happened, it is hard to gauge the number of cases, but the trade body says that anecdotally they continue to rise.How it worksFraudsters are scanning publicly available funeral notices and creating fake Facebook profiles, posing as family members or friends of the deceased, according to the CTSI.The criminals then contact mourners with bogus links to funeral live streams that demand payment, or set up fake donation pages, often on trusted fundraising platforms.Sometimes they send friend requests to people connected to the original site which, if they accept, can give them access to their photographs and details.After clicking on the live stream link, mourners are prompted to pay. The fake link then causes heartbreak as the individual may be missing a genuine live stream, but is also upset by the fact that they have given their card details to a scammer.What to do?Don’t hand over any money.Andrew Judd, NAFD chief executive, says that, as a rule, funeral directors do not charge for livestreaming. The public should be “extremely wary of any external links supposedly promoting one and asking for money”, he says.“Similarly, for pages seemingly fundraising, or asking for donations, instead of clicking, always check with the family or the funeral director to see whether it is legitimate.”“If a funeral is being livestreamed, a funeral director will be able to provide the genuine link and is always happy to be asked if anyone has concerns.”Embarrassed victims often don’t tell anyone, but Hart says that “silence is exactly what these criminals are counting on,” adding: “We need people to stay vigilant, share warnings and report anything suspicious.”The CTSI reiterates that you should never be charged to attend a funeral, whether in person or via live stream. You should only donate through official, verified channels, and should check with the named funeral director or celebrant if unsure, it adds.On social media, be cautious of friend requests or messages from unfamiliar profiles, even if they appear to be mutual friends.If you think you have given you card details to a fraudster, contact your bank immediately.While trying to raise awareness of the scam, the CTSI says it needs the public to “speak out, report concerns and protect others from becoming a victim”.If you or someone you know has been affected, and you live in England and Wales, you should contactAction Fraudvia its website or by calling 0300 123 2040.

These three different restaurants share DNA. Yes, 10 years have passed, but very little in the pared-back, pan-European anchovies-on-a-plate-for-£12 dining scene has moved on.No-frills decor, bare-brick walls, earnest small plates, staff with statement moustaches despite it not being remotely near Movember. We all know the drill for such places. There will be those exemplary anchovies on some sort of crostini, asparagus because it’s in season, some beans, maybe green, perhaps white, fancy French cheese and a tart of the day for afters. While Ellory merged into Leroy via a move from London Fields to Shoreditch, Leroy has become Duchy, it seems, via a simple change of the sign above the door. Front-of-house Alex Grant and chef Simon Shand met at Leroy and have now made this restaurant their own. In pop music terms, visiting Duchy is like going to see Bucks Fizz at Butlin’s and the only remaining member isDavid Van Day, and you’re pretty sure he was actually in Dollar, but hey, it’s fine, whatever, because they’re now cranking through Making Your Mind Up anyway.View image in fullscreenDuchy’s take on vitello tonnato features meat presented tartare-style and shoestring fries that look a bit like a rösti.Still, clearly this “things on plates, served sporadically” concept isn’t broken, and Duchy don’t need to fix it, because by 5pm on a Tuesday night, this new/old restaurant is filling up nicely, and by the time we leave two hours later, it’s absolutely heaving.The UK restaurant world is patently nowhere near the end of its “three ravioli dressed in olive oil and a scattering of podded peas” era, of “Hey, guys, can I start you off with some comté gougères” and “Yes, we are playingTalking Heads’ Stop Making Sense”. There has, admittedly, been a surge of “authentic French” restaurants in the capital recently –74 Duke,French Society,Marjorie’s,Joséphine– where beret-wearing British restaurateurs seem to be draping onions around their necks and serving up hearty soups, souffles, trotters and Paris-Brests, and very nice they are, too. But this thing that Ellory, then Leroy and now Duchy does, and which was once so edgy, shows no sign of relenting.View image in fullscreen‘A highlight’: Duchy’s Italian flat beans with gorgonzola, loquats and ‘pleasing’ almonds.Two anchovies on two crostini dotted with marjoram leaves arrive for £5, followed by a pile of rather soft, chunkily cutpanisse– polenta fries – enrobed in a thick grating ofmeuledes Alpesfrom Savoie. Avitello tonnatowith the veal served tartare-style is topped with what are reportedly shoestring fries, but have tangled into what looks like a deep-fried potato rösti. A highlight is a bowl of al dente Italian flat beans served cold in some type of vinaigrette, and with the pleasing addition of fresh almonds, blobs of rather pungent gorgonzola and a few slices ofloquat. Surely loquats are just kumquats with aspirations of grandeur, you might be thinking. Well, you would be very wrong: loquats are bigger, more like a sharp pear in flavour and wholly suitable for matching with a stinky, oozy Italian cheese and some crunchy veg.A bowl of fresh spaghetti with sage is as memorable as the chorus of Britain’slast Eurovision entry, and I am truly puzzled by what appears to be Duchy’s signature dish: some very damp smoked trout on a bowl of vivid greenspätzlethat have been cooked until mushy.View image in fullscreenDuchy’s ‘delicious’ poulet au vin jaune.Thank heavens for the final main course, then,poulet au vinjaune, served on a silky butterypomme puréewith a scattering of outstanding morels. Delicious, although there is always a moment, when I have been fooled again into sharing a plate of chicken and mash, that I think, “Surely sharing mash and gravy is the type of thing you should only need to do in a national emergency and you’re huddling around a brazier with other survivors. Why am I paying £28 for this pleasure?”But, as I say, we are too far down this route to back out now; those brick walls that make conversations bounce around deafeningly, the slice of perfectly fine apricot tart with creme fraiche for afters, the £130 bill without drinks for an adequate, perfectly of-its-ilk, London small-plates dinner. Stop Making Sense is reaching its final track as we pay up, and I’m not entirely sure if the food world ever truly started making sense.Duchy18 Phipp Street, London EC2, 07874 310612.

But there areso manyvariations, so let’s start with one that’s soft on the inside, crisp on the outside and oozing melted cheese…Felicity CloakeSun 22 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 08.02 EDTShareWhen I first came across arepas, at a food market in Williamsburg, New York, almost a decade ago, I was attracted mainly by the fact that these stuffed South American corn breads were, as the stall proclaimed in big letters: “110% gluten-free!” which meant I could share one with a coeliac friend. One bite later, I regretted my generosity: crunchy, buttery and filled with sweetcorn and salty, stringy cheese, I could easily have polished off the whole thing without any help.These, I later learned, were Colombianarepas de choclo, but arepas – flat, unleavened maize patties that pre-date European settlement – are found in many forms and flavours in many other countries, too, most notably Venezuela, but also Bolivia, Ecuador and parts of Central America. AsJ Kenji López-Alt noteson Serious Eats, to think of arepas like thick tortillas “is the equivalent of a Colombian native hearing about bread and saying: ‘Oh, it’s that European wheat cake, right?’” Within the first three days of his first visit to the country, he says he sampled more than a dozen different variations: “Arepas stuffed with cheese and baked on hot stones in coal-fired ovens. Arepas with sour milk cheese worked right into the dough. Arepas de choclo, made like a pancake with sweetcorn on a hot griddle.Arepas de huevo, golden yellow deep-fried puffy arepas split open and stuffed with an egg. Tinyarepitaseaten as a snack. Even packs of arepa-flavoured corn chips.”View image in fullscreenRipping success: Felicity’s perfect cheese arepas. All thumbnails by Felicity Cloake.So much to eat, so little time, but here I’ve chosen to remain loyal to my first love and focus on the Colombian cheese-stuffed version. Even so, seeing as that country alone is estimated to have 75 kinds, this can only ever be a very partial survey. Still, it’s a good start, and an even better breakfast.The cornmealThis is likely to be the trickiest aspect of the whole process, because arepas are made from dried cooked cornmeal (these days sold ready-made), rather than the dried raw corn sold in the UK as cornmeal or polenta, or the masa harina used to make tortillas, which has been nixtamalised (treated with an alkali to remove the hull and make it easier to grind, as well as increasing its nutritional availability). AsSharon Glascoe of the Certified Pastry Aficionado blognoteswith commendable firmness: “Masarepa is the most important ingredient. There is no substitute for the specific cornmeal used for arepas. If you’re unsure if you have the right kind, check the package. It should say what the flour can be used for. Also, most masarepa packages have an arepas recipe on the back, so if you see that, you got the right kind.”Though it comes in yellow, too, I’m assured that white masarepa is most commonly used for Colombian arepas. Those in major cities should be able to source it quite easily, but, it is also available online – the two major brands seem to be PAN andGoya.The liquidNaturally, the flour must be wetted to become a dough, and in such a simple recipe (the one on the back of the PAN packet is simply flour, water and salt), the ratio of dry to liquid ingredients is of primary importance. López-Alt’s dough is the driest, using two parts flour to one part water, “plus more as necessary”.Patricia McCausland-Gallo’sSecrets of Colombian Cooking,Erica Dinho’s blogMy Colombian RecipesandMaricel Presillain the New York Times all opt for equal parts. Others recommend using more liquid than flour – PAN most of all, with one and a half parts of water to every one of flour.View image in fullscreenPAN’s packet arepas turn out to be a little ‘austere’.López-Alt reckonsthat the “key is to use only as much moisture as is necessary to get a dough that doesn’t crack when you shape it. Too much water, and you’ll end up with dense, gummy arepas.” I obediently follow his lead and add another good splash of water, too. But, though the dough feels smooth and supple as instructed, it still cracks slightly on shaping, leading me to tend it anxiously with water as it cooks (which,an old eGullet thread claimsactually helps to crisp up the outside, which is no bad thing).While López-Alt’s arepas are certainly crunchy rather than gummy, I find wetter doughs far easier to work with, especially given that the dough continues to solidify as the flour absorbs the water. Presilla rests hers for as long as 15 minutes, which I think is helpful, though an even better tip is heating up the liquid before use, which seems to make the resulting dough far more pliable and easy to work with. Glascoe suggests scalding it, but Presilla and Dinho’s lukewarm water does the trick fine, too.Glascoe is also the only one to employ milk in her dough; though not strictly necessary, it does make the arepas fluffier, with an almost crumpet-like interior, and slightly more flavourful, too, though you could just use the same amount of water if you prefer.The fatView image in fullscreenAccording to Sharon Glascoe, ‘masarepa is the most important ingredient. There is no substitute.’When I ask Sandra atCafe Terrace, the Colombian cafe down the road from me, if she has any tips for arepas, she tells me to add butter to the dough, whether or not the recipe on the packet calls for it. Glascoe, Presilla and McCausland-Gallo agree, though López-Alt opts for vegetable oil instead, and the austere PAN packet recipe is fat-free, though its high moisture level means it’s still flexible, if rather less tasty than the rest. Because of the fat in the milk, I’ve decided to skip this step, too, in favour of buttering the arepas as soon as they come out of the pan. However, you might like to add a tablespoon or so, particularly if you’re not using milk, or adding cheese, of which more below.The fillings and flavouringsAs with any bread, salt is a must. Presilla includes a little sugar as well, which helps give his arepas a golden colour, but isn’t strictly necessary from a flavour perspective. You could leave it at that, but why would you when you could add cheese as well? The most common choice isqueso frescoorblanco, which McCausland-Gallow says is “sold in large 30-pound blocks at the entrance of many supermarkets, fresh for people to buy as much as they want, or packaged in the dairy sections”. A British version can be bought online fromYorkshire Dama Cheese, though López-Alt suggests substituting Mexicancotija, Italian ricotta salata or (most easily accessible for most Brits) Greek feta or a similar white salty cheese; I used Turkishbeyaz penir, but Balkan white cheese and so on would work just fine. López-Alt, Glascoe and Presilla knead this into the dough, which I’m very pro as a concept: the cheesier, the better as far as I’m concerned. (Vegans could easily adapt this recipe using plant milk or plain water and appropriate plant-based cheeses.)View image in fullscreenJ Kenji López-Alt’s arepas are ‘delicious, but finicky for an amateur’.Sandra stuffs her arepas with mozzarella, a popular choice for that all-important stringy molten centre (the New York Times also mentions manchego or parmesan, and the comment section is predictably incredulous). Like Dinho, she splits them like a sandwich to fill them with cheese, while Glascoe folds the dough around it and Presilla grates it in with the white cheese. López-Alt makes my life difficult by forming his arepas like ravioli, covering one with cheese and sticking another on top – there’s so much cheese, in fact, that mine bulges like a flying saucer. Delicious, naturally, but finicky for an amateur; I’m going with Glascoe’s method, which feels a lot more forgiving.The shaping and cookingArepas, even cheese-stuffed ones, come in a range of thicknesses, as evidenced by those I try, which vary from Presilla’s chunky little discs to McCausland-Gallo’s almost pancake-like 6mm. If you’re intending to split and fill them, slightly thicker is preferable, but go for whatever thickness you like. The only thing to bear in mind is that thicker arepas will, of course, take longer to cook through; it should be only the cheese that’s gooey in the middle.View image in fullscreenMaricel Presilla grills her ‘chunky little discs’.The method by which you do so is similarly up to you and dependent on the equipment you have to hand. PAN, Glascoe and Dinho cook their arepas in a pan in the traditional fashion, López-Alt starts his in a pan, then transfers them to the oven to cook through fully, while Presilla grills them, which looks great, but involves a lot of careful work with a spatula to dislodge them from even a well-greased baking tray. The simplest option is a lightly greased pan: keep the heat medium-low and cover the pan for the first few minutes to help the arepas cook through before they burn on the outside – the crust should be crunchy and golden with charred spots, rather than charcoal. Finish with a generous helping of butter and eat hot, or freeze. (They can also be stored uncooked in the fridge under a damp cloth for a day or so.)Perfect cheese arepasPrep10 minCook10 minMakes6100ml milk, whole milk, ideally½ tsp fine salt200g masarepa, or white pre-cooked cornmeal100g salty white cheese(eg, queso fresco, feta or similar), crumbled60g firm mozzarellaOilButter, to finishView image in fullscreenPut the milk and salt in a large bowl with 220ml hot water.

Having sex with other people allows them to fulfil their personal needs and strengthen their bond as a coupleHow do you do it? Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toOlivia LadanyiSun 22 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTShareNicole, 53I thought Simon might leave me if I said no to swinging. I agreed to it for him, for our relationshipSimon and I met on a blind date when I was 19. I was immediately attracted to him – he looked like a tall Tom Cruise. In the years that followed, we got married, had kids. I was too busy being a mother to think about my needs, or his, which meant Simon stopped feeling wanted. I felt inadequate, like I couldn’t give him what he needed.When I found flirtatious messages on his phone from another woman, it was a wake-up call. I felt hurt and betrayed, and trust was lost. Then one night in bed, Simon gently suggested swinging. I was resistant to it, but I thought Simon might leave me if I said no. I agreed to it for him, for our relationship. I never thought it would end up bringing so much value to my life.Simon signed us up to local swinging group’s mailing list, but I thought it looked seedy, so he set up a profile for us on Swinging Heaven, a dating app for people in the lifestyle. A week later, we were in a pub interviewing a couple about everything from safety and consent to swinging resorts. Meeting these nice people helped quell my fears.Swinging has boosted my confidence – I used to feel insecure about my body, but now I feel empowered and sexyI’ve since discovered that I’m bisexual. When I kissed a woman for the first time, I thought: “Wow, this is why men love kissing women; they’re so soft and sensual.”Simon would have sex twice a day if he could, whereas I’d prefer to have it every seven to 10 days. We now have sex four to five times a week, which is more in line with Simon’s libido than mine. This level of compromise partly comes from an old insecurity: that if he doesn’t feel satisfied, he could cheat again. But swinging has given Simon the freedom he needs, so he’s less likely to now.On a personal level, swinging has boosted my confidence – I used to feel insecure about my body, but now I feel empowered and sexy. It’s also improved our relationship, forcing us to communicate and be more open with each other. I always say that as long as your relationship is strong, every couple should try swinging at least once.Share your experiencesIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

Having sex with other people has also transformed our sex life with each otherBecause I have a higher sex drive than Nicole, when our sex life waned after 29 years of marriage, I found it frustrating. So, 10 years ago, I began an affair with a colleague. Although we didn’t have sex, we’d message and meet up in secret. It felt good to be desired. When Nicole found out, I ended it, but I realised I needed sexual freedom. I no longer wanted a monogamous life.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She was initially sceptical, so we were cautious. We went for drinks with a couple experienced in the lifestyle and bombarded them with questions. We wanted to know everything. After an OK first experience with another couple in their hot tub, we had sex with that first couple. With them, we were in safe hands, and we’ve been friends ever since.The swinging lifestyle is more than just sex, it’s friendship – we have ‘besties with benefits’ who we care deeply forThe swinging lifestyle is more than just sex, it’s friendship. We have “besties with benefits”, who we see every other week and care deeply for. I need to feel something for someone to have sex, but I’d struggle to be in love with someone else.There has been surprisingly little jealousy on both sides, especially when we know the people well. Mostly, it’s a turn on to see my wife with other people. Having sex with other people has also transformed our sex life with each other, and made me desire my wife more.People comment on our physical connection, which is still strong after 34 years. But where before we’d go weeks without having sex, we now have it every other day. I feel most attracted to Nicole when she is radiant, happy and confident, surrounded by her friends, and getting attention from men and women who fancy her.Explore more on these topicsSexThis is how we do itRelationshipsMarriagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I laugh. What a fun game. And when I run through the house to find her, there is a man in a balaclava with a knife to her throat. She is not chirping. She is screaming. The expectation of one thing when the opposite is true. And yet in my memory it is still a chirp, not a scream.When I think about the robbery, even now, decades later, it is my toes that tingle. My ankles. I was four at the time. Or five. I do not remember. Time, what a slippery thing. My friend Hayley was over to play. Sometime after the chirping, the man with a knife to my mother’s throat told us to go upstairs to my room and not to open the door. I do not remember this happening but, when I reverse-engineer the events, I know it to be true. Until it’s not. Maybe it was my mum. Maybe my mum had told us to go to my room and not to come out. What I do remember is sitting on my bed. I remember a dollhouse at the foot of my bed, its white pointed roof. I remember thinking we had to jump from the dollhouse to the bed. We could not let our feet touch the floor. If we did, the burglar (Did I know he was a burglar then? The intruder? The man?)would be able to reach through my bedroom floor and grab our feet, our ankles, his arms stretching up through the ceiling above him. We could not let our feet touch the carpet.I remember standing on the street. I remember the police. I remember my mum’s wrists, bound with rope. I remember begging the police to take off the rope. There is no in-between. There is the chirp/the scream, the man, the dollhouse, the feet through the floor, the wrists bound with rope.Trauma, trust and triumph: psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk on how to recover from our deepest painRead more“I don’t know,” she says, in the years that follow, when I ask her the man’s name. “I used to know. But I always forget. It wasn’t relevant. He was caught. I didn’t want his name in my head.”I don’t know his name. I don’t know if I ever did. If it was a detail I knew and then forgot or never knew at all. I know he drove a blue van. Whenever I see a blue van now, my toes tingle. My ankles. I think of the dollhouse and the floor, my knees tucked up under my chin.More than 30 years later I receive a message on a social media account I rarely use. It is Hayley. She apologises, knows it is out of the blue, but wonders if I may be free to talk about the robbery.The incident, she calls it.I try to identify the emotion that bubbled up when I saw Hayley’s message in my inbox. It was not fear. There were no flashbacks of the event.The incident. No terror or anxiety. No apprehension. But the feeling was sudden and strong and all-consuming. Red, hot shame.Before I meet Hayley, I tell my mum. I ask her if this is OK. Yes, she says. I ask her again if she remembers the robber’s name. No, she says. Is he still in jail? I’m not sure how long he got in the end, she says. But is there anything else you want to know?View image in fullscreen‘I have no memory of the dollhouse, except for in this memory. A memory in a memory. A house in a house.’Photograph: simonbradfield/Getty Images/iStockphotoShe says that it was a Friday afternoon. That kindergarten was a half-day on Fridays, so she had picked us up early and taken us home. That my two older brothers weren’t home from school yet and my dad was at work. That Hayley and I were playing in the living room after eating lunch, and a man came up behind her. I asked if he had a knife. A box cutter, she said.My mother is chirping, like a small bird. I laugh. What a fun game. And when I run through the house to find her, there is a man in a balaclava with a box cutter to her throat.She told him that there were two young children in the house and that he could take anything he wanted, do anything he wanted to her, but not to touch the children. Do not touch the children. That when he attacked her, she had screamed and we had rushed in and she said to us slowly, calmly, go upstairs to your bedroom, close the door and do not come out. And that we went upstairs and closed the door. And that the man told her to take off all her clothes. That he had covered her head with a pillowcase so she wouldn’t see his face. That he tied her up, and that he led her around the house naked and bound from room to room to room. And that she didn’t stop talking. She was a social worker and had worked at a rape crisis centre. She knew from what she heard there that she could not remain faceless and nameless. That she needed to become a person to him, that he was less likely to hurt her; or less likely to hurt heras badly, if she could personalise herself. Even while she was naked. Even with a pillowcase over her head. And so she talked about my brothers and school and holidays and what we liked to do on the weekends and our favourite foods and hobbies and my dad and which music we liked, as he led her from room to room to room.Take whatever you want. Do not touch the children.At one point, after what felt like a few hours, he threw her on to the couch in the living room, face down, wrists bound, head covered. And then there was silence. She waited a few moments. To make sure it was over. To make sure he had left. She did not move. Did not make a noise. She waited longer. And longer, still. She wriggled her wrists through the rope, and that was when he came back.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsAt some point, not then, but later, she heard the front gate slam. That was when she ran, wrists loose from their binding. Ran to throw a dressing gown over her naked body. Ran to my room. Bundled us up into the bathroom, the only door with a lock, grabbing the landline phone as she ran, closing the door behind us to call the police. As she says this, I can picture the loops of the phone cord under the door.I ask her if he drove a blue van. No, she says. He didn’t drive a blue van.She calls my mum brave. She says she’s a hero. Hayley is also a social worker. My mum and Hayley are the only social workers I knowI do not have a memory of the dollhouse, except for in this memory. Its sharp, pointed roof. Growing up I played with my brothers’ hand-me-down toys. Trains. Blocks. Transformers. I have no memory of the dollhouse, except for in this memory. A memory in a memory. A house in a house. Did I own a dollhouse, or invent it? Invent the danger of the pointed roof.I meet Hayley near the hotel where she is staying in South Yarra. She lives interstate now and is down for a few days to visit her parents. Her dad is not well. I ask her how often she thinks of the robbery. Often, she says. I’m so sorry, I say. She says that after her mum picked her up from our house, they went to buy a present and that was that. That they never spoke of it again. Which made her think about it more. That she never came over to my house after that. That whenever her sisters have mentioned my name in the decades that followed, I’m referred to as Hayley’s First Best Friend. It’s only then that I start to wonder what else was taken that day.View image in fullscreen‘My mother was 39 when it happened, and it is 39 years later that I read her statement. I don’t know what this means.’Photograph: Asanka Brendon Ratnayake/The GuardianThe table where we are sitting is sticky with spilt beer. Yeasty and heated by the December sun. She remembers my mum screaming, she says. She remembers us running in and seeing a man on top of my mother, pinning her down, with a screwdriver to her neck. She remembers he told us to hide, or he would kill us. She remembers the fear. She remembers being told to go upstairs to my room and not to come out. She does not remember who said this. She remembers the waiting. She remembers sitting on my bed reading Mr Men books. She remembers my mum opening the door, the way she grabbed us, running to the bathroom and locking us in. She remembers the phone dragging behind her as she did this. She remembers my mother in her dressing gown. She remembers the phone call to the police. Her memories are crisp and fully formed.They are in her mind’s eye, she says. I tell her that because of my mum’s experience as a social worker she knew to talk and talk and talk, to not stop talking. That she told him over and over again not to hurt us. She calls my mum brave. She says she’s a hero. Hayley is also a social worker. My mum and Hayley are the only social workers I know. I’m jealous that she remembers the phone call. Remembers the bathroom. Remembers the dressing gown. I do not tell her why my mother was in a dressing gown. She doesn’t ask.I ask if she remembers the dollhouse. Remembers that he drove a blue van. No. And no.She asks if he was caught. Yes, I say. I ask if she was told that there was a trial and that he went to jail. No, she says. She had spent every day since then thinking he could be anywhere.There is a file in my dad’s filing cabinet about the robbery. I know this because every few years when I ask my mother if she remembers the man’s name and she says that she doesn’t, she says there is a file in my dad’s filing cabinet and I can see it if I’d like to. I never ask for the file. Even after Hayley asks to speak to me. Even after Hayley asks me his name and I say I do not know.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Another hot day, in another December. It feels urgent and important in that moment but I can’t explain why. A repurposed manila folder, a thick White-Out block on one side and, over the top, my dad’s pointed handwriting:ROBBERY. Inside there is a subpoena for my mother to appear in court. We command you to attend, it begins. It includes the man’s name and the charges against him. I wait to feel something.Burglary (eight counts); Aggravatedburglary (one count);falseimprisonment (one count);indecentassault with aggravating circumstances (one count);armedrobbery (one count);damagingproperty (one count);theft (one count). I wait, and wait, and wait (three counts) and feel nothing.Total recall: the people who never forgetRead moreHis name is underwhelming. I feel almost embarrassed to see it. It is boring. There is nothing that hints at the violence it contains. It’s comical in its ordinariness. After I see it, I Google his name on my phone. No trials appear in the search. No burglaries. A LinkedIn profile for a plastics CEO in Alabama is the first result. A news article about a sculptor. An obituary for a cinematographer. I check to make sure I have spelt his name correctly and giggle because I realise I have searched for a completely different person. First name. Middle name. Last name. All completely wrong. In the time it took for me to look away from the subpoena and search for him, I have given him a new identity.I look at my mother’s statement, typed and faded. The one that has been in my father’s red filing cabinet for 39 years. The drawers that creak when they’re opened, the lock that doesn’t quite work. My mother was 39 when it happened, and it is 39 years later that I read her statement. I don’t know what this means.I play with the memory and change it. I open my bedroom door. I run to her. I scream. I flail my arms. I bite and kickHer statement talks about arriving to our house. How she parked in the garage and Hayley and I ran inside first. How she collected armfuls of shopping and then came inside with them. I picture plastic bags digging into her forearms, leaving a mark, the garage closing behind her. I try to picture my mother at the age of 39 but can’t. I can only picture her the age she is now. My image of her constantly updating, overriding the previous versions of her. Her written statement describes the way Hayley and I were playing piano in the lounge room. And I can hear the clank of keys. The laughter. And as we were playing, how she was grabbed by the wrists. The way she struggled. Fought back. Was thrown to the floor. And I can hear her chirp, her scream. In her statement it says he held a yellow screwdriver, its shank to her neck. There is no mention of a balaclava.My mother is chirping, like a small bird. I laugh. What a fun game. And when I run through the house to find her, there is a man with a screwdriver to her throat.Also in the statement: the things she said. The things he did. The things she pleaded with him not to do. And yet I still feel nothing. Blank. As if I am reading about someone else and not my mother. Which doesn’t make sense actually because when I do read about these things in the news, I feel waves of anger. I feel instant rage, my body prickly with heat.Why can’t we remember our lives as babies or toddlers?Read moreIn the statement she described his hands. A plain gold ring on the third finger of his right hand. Wide hands. Short, fat fingers. The hand which held a yellow screwdriver to her neck. It is these hands that make me feel something. Rising bile. I picture them hairy, though there is no mention of this. I have invented it. And in the days that follow, this is the image that returns to me. Wide hands, short, fat fingers. Hairy knuckles. My breath catches and I count to slow it. Three counts in. One. Two. Three. Three counts out. One. Two. Three.We moved house straight after the robbery. I do not remember the layout of the original house. The colour of its walls. The feel of it. I remember the house we moved into afterwards. Its brown laminate benches. The way the front door swivelled. The sound of the rain on the skylight. The tread of the carpet.There arememories that I have that don’t belong to me. My parents and my brothers lived in San Diego before I was born. I remember the sound of their voices, the cereals they ate, their visit to Disneyland, that time my middle brother almost drowned and was pulled out of the pool by his curly hair. I know these memories as my own, constructed from stories repeated around the dinner table and photos yellowed around their edges. Their hand-me-down toys and their hand-me-down clothes and their hand-me-down memories.7:36Why your memories can't be trusted – videoBefore the trial my mother was told to stick to the facts. That after the man was arrested, he told the police that he would not contest anything if they were fair with him. I know what “stick to the facts” meant, she said. Do not be hysterical. Do not play the victim.I roll the memory of the robbery around in my mind, try to press it like a bruise until I can feel something. Wait for the ache of it. But it’s dull, out of reach.I play with the memory and change it. I open my bedroom door. I run to her. I scream. I flail my arms. I bite and kick. My four-year-old self. Or I don’t. I am quiet and I tiptoe to the phone, and I call the police. I do something. Anything. But that is not what happened.Stay in your room. Do not come out.I write his name in a note in my phone. I scroll back. My car registration. Our alarm code. Our wi-fi password. Another password that belongs to something I can’t place. An old shopping list.Canned tomatoes. Red wine.Writing-related questions:Staring at magpies so they don’t swoop you. They remember your face. Is this true?I never checked.The robbery. It’s there. Between the magpie and a shopping list. A years-old note to self.The robbery. And again, as I scroll down. A Joan Didion quote, an idea for a character, a podcast recommendation, notes from a doctor’s appointment, words without context:Longing(for what?). AndThe robbery, the robbery, The Robbery. Sometimes capitalised. Sometimes not. I look at his name. The last entry. First name. Middle name. Last name. I hold my thumb down on the screen. Press on his name. Four options appear: Mark as completed. Deadline. Priority. Delete. I press delete. I let the other reminders stay there.The robbery, the robbery, The Robbery.I will continue to forget his name. I don’t know if I ever owned a dollhouse. My feet will continue to tingle when I see a blue van.This is an edited version of The Chirp/The Scream whichappeared in Australian Book Review’s June issue as runner-up in the 2025 Calibre essay prize.

Shortly after,another video went viralshowing a doll being “treated” at a hospital. The collector laterexplained it was a role play, but that did not stop widespread reposts portraying it as real.Artist and collectorBianca Miranda, 27, says that in the 14 years she has been immersed in the reborn world, she has never encountered anyone who treats the dolls as actual children. “I have always known they were dolls and have always treated them as such, and today I understand the amount of love and work involved in making one.”‘People don’t get it’: inside the world of hyper-realistic baby doll collectingRead moreCompleting one, which costs anywhere from £200 to £2,500, can take weeks depending on its complexity – for instance, whether the hair is painted or implanted strand by strand.“The first reaction of the average internet user these days is to find something to shout at,” said YouTuber Chico Barney, who filmed a collectors’ gathering in São Paulo for his documentaryReborn Babies Don’t Cry.“We went there with open minds to see what happens at a reborn doll event … When we arrived, I was surprised by how un-eccentric it all was. It was just a bunch of people exchanging ideas about something they enjoy,” he said.For Kalil, an anthropologist, the controversy also reveals an element of pathologising women, as if owning or playing with hyper-realistic dolls were a sign of mental illness.“Adult men can collect action figures or play video games without raising eyebrows. But adult women are not allowed the luxury of entertainment,” she said.The artist Vedolin argues that the dolls “are not toys, but works of art”.However, practising it has taken on bitter elements that artists were not used to.“I know artists who have been crying all day because they can’t bear to open their social media and be insulted on every video and photo they post. And to me, this reaction boils down to hate – people just want something to hate,” she said.Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasHobbiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Chaos and upheaval unfolded on the streets. As his power base quickly collapsed, the shah – so recently thought by western allies to be unassailable – fled abroad with his family in January 1979.Weeks later, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a radical Shia cleric, returned from Paris after years in exile, to take power and turn Iran into an Islamic state. He immediately severed all ties with Israel. With revolutionaries storming the Israeli embassy, the country’s remaining diplomats were forced to flee, lucky to escape Iran with their lives.View image in fullscreenAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989.Photograph: Denis Cameron/Rex FeaturesThus began a deadly ideological enmity between two countries that had been allies, shared no common border and harbored no territorial claims against each other – and which has now spiralled into open war and, last night, dragged in the United States with consequences that may transform the geopolitical map, afterDonald Trumpannounced that the US had bombed three Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.With the US’s entry into the conflict on Israel’s side, Merhav’s gloomy forecast has now acquired graver dimensions than perhaps even he foresaw.More than three decades after he first made them, I had an improbably serendipitous encounter with Merhav on a train from Hamburg in Germany to Prague, the Czech capital.Having entered my compartment after getting on the train at Berlin, the elderly man sitting opposite noticed my reading material and asked if I was reading Arabic. I told him it was Farsi, which I was attempting to learn, in the hope that I might one day be allowed back into Iran.I had been the Guardian’s correspondent in Tehran several years earlier, but had been forced to leave Iran in late 2007 after the authorities refused to renew my residence permit, apparently due to objections over my reporting. But the intensity of the experience had kept my interest in the country – and hopes of returning – alive.The man replied that he spoke Farsi, in which we then attempted to converse, with limited success before reverting to English as it became clear that his fluency in the language far exceeded mine. He explained that he was Israeli and had worked in the embassy in Tehran before the revolution. He introduced himself as Reuven – at which my eyes widened in sudden recognition.I had read Bergman’s vivid account of Merhav’s grim warnings and the subsequent evacuation of Israelis from Tehran months earlier. It left a lasting impression. Now I was in the company of the main protagonist. He sidestepped my question about the book’s description of him as Mossad’s man in Tehran, confirming only that he worked for Israel’s foreign ministry, but acknowledged knowing Bergman and his work. There was no doubt that the stranger on the train was Merhav, a fact confirmed by subsequent Google searches and one Israeli foreign ministry official I later asked.The chance encounter added context and meaning to events I had witnessed first-hand as the Guardian’s correspondent. Much of what happened then explains why the two countries are locked in combat now. To be in Tehran then was to be a witness to what turns out to have been a long prelude to the current warfare – as tensions between Iran and Israel escalated.Nearly every night during spring and summer, I could hear living proof of the enmity that Merhav had predicted from the balcony of my rented house in north Tehran as youthful chants ofmarg bar Israeel(death to Israel) andmarg bar Amrika(death to America) emanated from what seemed to be a nearby training camp for the Basij, a volunteer militia run by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.Both slogans had been absorbed into the fabric of Iran’s revolutionary landscape. They could be seen emblazoned on buildings and were a staple chant at Friday prayers. “Death to Israel” was even graffitied in a section of Isfahan’s Naqsh-e Jahan Square, a Unesco world heritage site.Israel and Iran had been locked in shadow hostilities for years – with Tehran suspected of masterminding deadly attacks on Israeli and Jewish installations in Argentina and backing Hezbollah in Lebanon – when I arrived in Iran in early 2005. But it was after the election ofMahmoud Ahmadinejadas president in June of that year that the ante was dramatically raised.View image in fullscreenThen Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during the Eid-al-Fitr ceremony in Teheran on 4 November 2005.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAAt a conference in Tehran in October, Ahmadinejad, a populist who promoted himself as a champion of the marginalized and underprivileged, stoked international outrage with a comment that was interpreted as calling for Israel “to be wiped off the map”, although other translations offered less incendiary forms of words.Apparently revelling in the notoriety, the president followed up by calling the Holocaust “a myth”.Worse followed. The following year, Iran’s biggest-selling newspaper, Hamshahri,staged the resultsof a cartoon contest to lampoon history’s worst genocide at Tehran’s Palestine Contemporary Art Museum.The most egregious instance of Israel-baiting came in December 2006, when the Iranian foreign ministry staged what it called a “scientific” conference purporting to prove that the murder of 6 million Jews had not happened.The event drew a rogue’s gallery of holocaust deniers and antisemites, among them David Duke, a former imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and future supporter of Donald Trump, who praised Iran for allowing “free speech” and denounced Israel as “a terrorist state”.It was, on many levels, a sickening spectacle, both for its unsavoury catalogue of attenders and the brazen assault on truth, with some exhibits purporting to show that allied forces, rather than the Nazis, were responsible for wartime atrocities.“The biggest turning point was Ahmadinejad being elected and then denying the Holocaust,’ said Meir Javedanfar, an Iranian-born Israeli scholar, who teaches Iran studies at Reichman University, near Tel Aviv.“Iranians lose their mind if somebody calls the Persian Gulf the Arabian Gulf. Yet they fail to understand what kind of emotions it creates in Israelis when somebody says the Holocaust is a myth.”The insult was compounded by growing Israeli suspicions that Iran was trying to build an atomic bomb.The existence of a hitherto secret Iranian nuclear project, in the form of a uranium-enrichment facility at Natanz, had been disclosed by the opposition Mojahedin-e-Khalq (MEK) movement in 2002. Enrichment activities were subsequently suspended by the then reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, as a confidence-building measure as western powers exerted pressure.Ahmadinejad ordered the program’s resumption, stridently asserting Iran’s nuclear “rights” and sending international tensions soaring while elevating Israeli fears to fever pitch.“You have somebody who denies the Holocaust, they’re developing nuclear program, they’re supporting Hezbollah – Iran took on a new form in terms of threats,” said Javedanfar.Israel’s preoccupation with Iran’s nuclear activities underscored how dramatically the relationship between the two one-time allies had been transformed by the fall of the shah, historians say.“One of Iran’s most important allies in the shah’s pursuit of a nuclear program in the last decade of his rule was Israel,” said Abbas Milani, director of Iranian studies at Stanford University and a biographer of the shah. “There are published reports of cooperation between Iran, Israel and South Africa in the last decade of his rule.”View image in fullscreenThe shah of Iran, Reza Pahlevi, and his wife, Farah Diba, in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 1979.Photograph: Randy Taylor/Associated PressThe shah, said Milani, saw Israel as a “strategic ally”, a view enhanced by the two countries’ shared suspicions of Arab nationalism, as embodied by the Egyptian leader, Gamal Abdel Nasser.“The shah was a realist. He realized Israel is there to stay and it controlled his enemies.”Jews, meanwhile, felt relatively secure in Iran.“Iran has had long history of very good relations with its own Jewish population,” said Milani. “It had largest Jewish population of any Muslim country at that time. There were maybe 150,000 at the time of the revolution.”That, too, was transformed by the shah’s downfall. The onset of the Islamic regime – bringing with it a climate of fierce anti-Zionism – prompted a mass exodus of Iranian Jews, many of them eventually moving to Israel.In the early 1980s, with Iran embroiled in a bitter attritional war with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, Israel attempted a rapprochement. Fearing a Saddam victory at least as much as Khomeini’s regime, it sent weapons to Iranian forces, helping them to stave off defeat.The Iranians gladly accepted the weapons – but resisted any attempts at restoring the friendship.“I’ve spoken to Israelis who served in Iran in the embassy before the revolution and afterwards dealt with Iran,” said Javedanfar. “They bent over backwards trying to reach out to the regime. They even lobbied the Americans” – who, under President Ronald Reagan, funneled their own weapons to Iran through Israel in an attempt to win the release of US hostages in Lebanon, an initiative that ended in the Iran-Contra scandal.“It wasn’t just for the love of Iran. They had shared interests, but they really wanted to re-establish relations with this regime. But at the end, they found out that the weapons they were giving to Iran to fire at the Iraqis were being transferred to Hezbollah and being fired at Israelis.“Iran did not want to have any rapprochement with Israel. It was impossible.”Yet unwillingness to mend fences may not have devolved into deadly enmity without the obduracy ofAyatollah Ali Khamenei, who became supreme leader after Khomeini’s death in 1989Khamenei exuded a greater commitment to Israel’s destruction than his predecessor, calling the country a “cancer” on the Middle East.At a 1991 conference, organised at a time when Israelis and the Palestine Liberation Organisation were embarking on negotiations in Madrid, the supreme leader sided with factions opposed to a peace deal with Israel – a position at odds with Iran’s president at the time, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.The result was an intensification of a proxy war that Iran had previously waged haphazardly, through Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas. The latter group embarked on a spate of suicide bombings that killed scores of Israelis and contributed, in 1996, to the election of the hardlineBenjamin Netanyahuas Israel’s prime minister, as faith waned in the Oslo peace accords signed three years earlier.There were domestic and foreign policy reasons for Khamenei’s anti-Israel crusade.“After the fall of the Soviet Union, he saw an opening in the Middle East for a new kind of superpower, an Islamic one, so he wanted to take that chance,” Javedanfar said.“But it also served the economic interests of his allies, because there’s billions of dollars to be made in keeping Iran isolated. That allows them complete monopoly over all sectors of Iran’s economy, from making tomato puree to cars. And one of the ways to make sure Iran always stayed isolated and western companies did not invest was to continue the anti-Israel line.”Milani argues that Khamenei’s animus has even deeper roots in anti-Jewish prejudice, displayed in commentary he provided to In the Shade of the Qur’an, a book by the Egyptian revolutionary and Islamic Brotherhood leader Sayyid Qutb which he translated into Farsi.“Many people, even within the regime itself, have asked why this is in the national interest, why do you think the destruction of the state of Israel is your responsibility?” he said. “The rhetoric and the reality of the policy of anti-Zionism is part of why Khamenei does it, but I think it is also an element of antisemitism.“Khamenei thinks Israel today is the same, or even worse than, those [Jews] who fought Muhammad at Medina. When you have that kind of antisemitic thinking guiding you, you can’t befriend Israel.”It is a minority view among Iranians, most of whom do not view Israel as an existential enemy and would accept normalized relations, says Milani.Soaring non-combatant casualties or massive damage to Iran’s civilian infrastructure resulting from prolonged Israeli bombardment could test such a rosy view, and instead deepen the enmity that Merhav foresaw nearly half a century ago.For now, Milani puts the onus on Khamenei, whom he accuses of failing to live up to years of rhetorical bellicosity when it mattered.“His devotion to the notion that ‘death to Israel’ must be part of every ritual of politics in Iran, then putting the country on the path of war, being absolutely unprepared for it when war is imminent is just criminal negligence,” he said. “To have all of this rhetoric and then to be so unprepared when Israel initially attacked – it’s just remarkable.”Explore more on these topicsIranIsraelUS militaryDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuMahmoud AhmadinejadAyatollah Ali KhameneifeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m not therefore someone easily categorised as a supporter of terrorism or criminal activity. The decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist group is beyond satire (Report, 20 June). I suspect that embarrassment over hilarious security failures at an RAF base may be clouding judgment and good sense.Proscribing a group for peaceful protest – albeit illegal – is a disgrace. It is nearly as disgraceful as the continued UK support for the apartheid, ethnic-cleansing Israeli state. If the home secretary is so keen to proscribe an organisation, why not proscribe the terror group known as theIsraelDefense Forces? They kill innocent people daily, and yet my voted-for government does absolutely nothing.Words mean nothing. Israel’s leadership ignores them, yet our government persists in arming it. The proposal to proscribe Palestine Action is undemocratic and, frankly, shameful. It is an abuse of an important law – one here being used to suppress support for Palestinians. The home secretary appears to have left reason behind.Meredydd HughesBradwell, DerbyshireThe plan to proscribe Palestine Action represents a failure of this government to engage in meaningful discussion with all those who deplore Israeli actions in Gaza and the West Bank, and our government’s support of those actions. The protest group has made it clear that their reason for using spray paint on two planes was to draw public attention towards RAF logistical support for Israeli actions.That logistical support has taken many forms, and the public is only aware of some. At the same time, the government has often condemned Israel’s genocidal policies. It should not be surprised when its support for Israel leads to alarming reactions. I recently joined a large, friendly and peaceful march in London in support of the Palestinian cause. I dearly hope the home secretary will consider the British history of tolerance of protest in her future policies.Simon BarberUttoxeter, StaffordshireThe government responds to a few people spraying paint and breaking windows by declaring them “terrorists”. If that is terrorism, then the word loses all meaning. Banning them – and their supporters – could be justified if they have carried out, or advocate, a campaign of murder and/or bodily harm. But unless the government can provide evidence of the latter, then proscribing a group that is protesting against a war is ludicrous, and sets a very dangerous precedent.Are the anti-frackers terrorists? Hunt saboteurs? Even last year’s rioters weren’t called terrorists, yet they caused mayhem in many towns and cities. No one is safe if proscription becomes the norm.Peter LoschiChadderton, Greater ManchesterSo now you’re a terrorist if you protest against the government supporting genocidal acts on innocent people? A small act of vandalism is hardly blowing people up, but this government is supporting murderous behaviour in Gaza in all our names, no matter how many times we take to the streets or write to our MPs. The suffragettes would have been branded terrorists if we used this criterion. I’m not a member of Palestine Action, but they sound just like my kind of people.Mary GildeaCharlton, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus, a letter byJohn LowrieSun 22 Jun 2025 11.50 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 11.51 EDTShareYour article (‘Ayahuasca tourism’ is a blight on Indigenous peoples and our environment, 17 June) brings up important concerns but it looks at a complicated issue too narrowly. It is worth remembering that the word “ayahuasca” itself is not a modern invention, but a Quechua term meaning “vine of the soul”. It is just one of many names used for the ceremonial medicine across different Indigenous cultures – others include yagé, kamarampi, caapi, oasca and daime. Suggesting that only “hayakwaska” is “correct” erases the diversity of ancestral traditions across the Amazon basin.The claim that ayahuasca is marketed as a “mystical shortcut” overlooks the reality: real work with this medicine is neither quick nor easy. True healing through ayahuasca involves deep inner effort, often accompanied by discomfort, surrender and courage – whether one is Indigenous or not.The criticism of cultural distortion and biodiversity loss is valid, especially that tourism encourages the illegal wildlife trade. But we must also acknowledge that many of the products sold to tourists (such as jaguar parts) are offered by local individuals. Given their cultural knowledge and connection to the forest, Indigenous communities can and should take leadership in educating both locals and visitors, promoting sustainable and ethical practices.To ask, “How are ‘ayahuasca tourists’ giving back?” is fair. Yet tourism – when done responsibly – can be a vital source of income for rural areas, offering alternatives to logging, mining and drug trafficking. It provides jobs and preserves cultural relevance for younger generations.Enrico MalatestaWanay Community Retreat Center, Mocoa, ColombiaI agree wholeheartedly with Nina Gualinga and Eli Virkina that ayahuasca tourism takes the shaman away from their sacred work, which is the community and the land. I know that as a UK-based shamanic healer, my work is with this land. This is what brings harmony to the soul.The plants and trees of any country are the wisdom keepers and healing cannot happen anywhere unless the land is being tended and healed. This involves releasing the souls of war and empire-building, reinstating the guardians of the sacred sites and bringing ourselves back to reciprocity.Knowing our roots and tending them brings us back into relationship with ourselves. This land and our hearts need our ancestral tending right now. For our healing to involve going toEcuadorfor spiritual tourism, when there is so much ancestral and earth tending to do on our soil, shows how disconnected we still are from land and mother.We cannot find that anywhere else. The plants of these sacred isles hold so much love and wisdom now in our return to the land as a mother, as a sentient loving source who holds us. The sacred plants of these isles are dandelions, thistles, dock and nettle – they support us and guide us. Our trees are oak, birch and rowan, hawthorn. It is our communication and relationship with the earth mother and the plant spirits. A sovereign connection between ourselves and our earth.Emily WebsterLancasterIt’s always fascinating to learn about such distant remote Indigenous communities, and yet find so much in common, such as their innate respect for nature. The onset of modern tourism – often appended with “eco”, “sustainable” and “responsible” by those exploiting Indigenous people – is a common phenomenon.However, is there a lesser of two evils? “Ayahuasca” in Ecuador, as described in your piece, or the wholesale taking-over of Indigenous lands, livelihoods and cultures that we see inCambodia? The forced assimilation in to the mainstream population was most violently imposed during the notorious 1970s Khmer Rouge regime but goes on insidiously ever since.John LowrieTa Khmau, CambodiaExplore more on these topicsIndigenous peoplesDrugsMental healthColombiaEcuadorEndangered speciesSouth America holidayslettersShareReuse this content"

And that such a business would be ideal for an entrepreneur.Ironically, it was only a few days before that letter, on 4 June, that Rachel Reeves made her transport funding announcement of £15.6bn from the premises of Mellor Bus in Rochdale, which, along with its sister company, Treka Bus in Brighouse, West Yorkshire, make a range of buses, including 16-seater ones suitable for rural routes.Mellor and Treka are both part of the Woodall Nicholson group. That group’s business was acquired in 2023 by a Belgian entrepreneur, Guido Dumarey, to add to his portfolio. So there are suitable buses and there is an entrepreneur – let’s hope he keeps those businesses manufacturing in the UK.It is a pity that the chassis used for the buses are of European origin (Mercedes and Iveco/Fiat) as there are no UK manufacturers of suitable chassis – now there’s an opportunity. But, as both Ford and DAF stopped making that type of chassis in the UK years ago, I can’t see any obvious candidate. Maybe Renault/Stellantis would or could make one available from their Ellesmere Port factory.Richard BramallSheffieldHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Most are passionate about public service. But the hierarchy means that only those who are able and willing to play by unwritten rules (created by white, middle-class, non-disabled men for their own benefit) can climb the ladder; civil servants are encouraged to focus more on what will please senior leaders than on what will benefit communities; and the civil service often values grade and seniority over knowledge, experience and expertise.To provide the best public services the civil service needs to reflect, at all levels, the communities it serves. At present it doesn’t, and diversity diminishes with seniority. The “back-office function” of experienced equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) specialists is essential: to identify barriers to under-represented groups; to ensure a working environment where everyone can thrive; and to rewrite the hidden rules so that they work for everyone. Senior leaders (including ministers) need to value the experience and expertise of specialists at more junior grades.In 2008 I joined theCrown Prosecution Serviceas an equality, diversity and community engagement manager. As well as EDI issues, my role involved engaging with local communities to understand their needs and build confidence in the criminal justice system. Engaging with communities improves the service provided and encourages those from under-represented groups to consider joining the civil service.In this country, we have always referred to EDI. Those who advocate doing away with “DEI” betray their slavish Trump worship.Caroline AirsNewcastle upon TyneHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission found in 2023 that two in three savers were missing out on bonus rates.As interest rates fall, could Australia be facing another house price boom? |  James Graham for the ConversationRead moreIt recommended banks be forced to warn customers at risk of breaching bonus conditions with real-time alerts and prompt savers to consider their bonus eligibility and whether other products may better suit their needs with annual notifications.An ING spokesperson did not share what proportion of customers received the company’s full rate of interest, but said the bank notified savers when their interest rates changed and helped customers check whether they would get their payments with an in-app feature.“We know that customers like having the ability to check their monthly eligibility criteria for the savings maximiser bonus rate as it’s one of the most used features in our app,” they said.The spokesperson declined to comment on why ING did not alert customers in real time, as recommended by the regulator.At 5% per annum, ING’s full rate is one of the highest interest rates offered to Australian households. But its base rate – given to customers who don’t qualify for the bonus rate – is among the lowest. The base rate is 0.05%.Customers miss out on the bonus rate if they do not meet the monthly requirements to deposit $1,000, make at least five transactions and add to their savings. A customer with a balance of $20,000 would get interest of just 80 cents at the end of the month if they missed a requirement, when they would have otherwise expected $80.The spokesperson said the bonus rate structure was designed to encourage customers to stay actively engaged with their finances and the bank adjusted the rates on offer to respond to broader market conditions.Guardian Australian spoke to one ING customer who received nearly no interest on a large portion of his savings because he breached the deposit limit, another feature of the account.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe customer put his money in an ING Savings Maximiser account and met the monthly requirements, but was not aware the account only paid bonus interest on the first $100,000 of a balance.His account surpassed that limit in 2020 and reached $185,000 in 2025, leaving him missing out on the equivalent of $4,000 a year in interest.“It just had never even crossed my mind that that would be something I had to be aware of, and obviously I never received any notification,” he said.“They notify you about everything else [except accounts] sitting there with $80,000 not earning interest, which is pretty outrageous.“When I did look back, I was like, ‘Oh my God’. I felt a bit sick.”ING’s spokesperson could not comment on individual cases but said the bank made it clear when customers sign up that the bonus rate was only available for balances up to $100,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have soared in popularity since 2010 but have grown far more complex, with much lower base rates, says Rachel Wastell, a personal finance spokesperson at loan comparison site Mozo.“If you don’t know the rate or the hoops you need to jump through, how are you supposed to get the bonus? It’s like studying for a test without knowing the subject,” she said.Daniel Mulino, a Labor MP, wrote in a 2024 report that savings rates needed regulatory tightening and recommended a notification trial, before the Albanese government committed to improving awareness of bonus rates.Mulino, now assistant treasurer, said the government was still working with the banks on reforms.Each of the big four banks said they prompted customers with push notifications and emails to help them qualify for bonus interest. Olivia McArdle, head of deposits and payments at Macquarie Bank, said complex monthly conditions were the biggest barrier to Australians earning bonus interest rates.Mozo’s Wastell said every bank should be forced to notify customers to improve transparency.“Australians deserve a heads-up when they’re about to lose a chunk of their returns,” she said.“[But] honestly, there’s not much motivation for banks to act here because if customers miss out, the bank can pocket the savings.”Do you know more?

But that’s quite different from rolling it back.”Freeman said that limiting sales of nicotine vapes to pharmacies was “not a big ask for a product that is highly addictive and dangerous”.“They are not a consumer good,” she said. “We made this mistake with tobacco products, why would we turn around and do the same thing with vapes?”Freeman said youth vaping rates in Australia were lower than in New Zealand, the UK and Canada, which allow the retail sale of e-cigarettes, and that new licensing requirements for tobacconists in New South Wales and Victoria were “long overdue”.“We have done an excellent job on demand reduction,” she said. “We haven’t controlled supply that well at all.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian economyHealthVapingSmokingTobacco industryTaxAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

For 40 years, Iran has been saying death to America, death toIsrael.”In a statement issued after Trump’s White House address, a federal government spokesperson did not explicitly endorse the strikes, but reiterated Australia’s position on the risk posed by Iran’s nuclear program.“We have been clear that Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile program has been a threat to international peace and security,” the spokesperson said.“We note the US president’s statement that now is the time for peace. The security situation in the region is highly volatile. We continue to call for de-escalation, dialogue and diplomacy.”A chorus of international lawyers and foreign policy experts labelled the US attacks unlawful under the UN charter, which only allows countries to use force to defend themselves against armed attack – not in anticipation of one.Ben Saul, the Challis chair of international law at the University of Sydney, argued the US strikes amounted to an “international crime of aggression”, which marked a “new low” in the ongoing erosion of international law.“What’s happened in Gaza over the past 18 months has crossed all kinds of red lines on disrespect for international law. It has weakened the capacity of international law to act as a politically restraining force in international relations,” he said on Sunday.Saul described the federal government’s response as “pretty weak”. He said Australia should stand up for the “red lines of international law”.Allan Behm, a special adviser at the Australia Institute thinktank, said the bombings were a “flagrant breach” of the international rules-based order.Behm, a former adviser to the foreign affairs minister,Penny Wong, said Australia should have “made clear we are a country that stands up … for the rules-based order”.The international law expertProfDonald Rothwellsaid it was “virtually impossible” to mount a case that the US strikes were legal under international law.Rothwell said the US attacks could set a precedent for other countries to use self-defence arguments as cover for pre-emptive attacks – a fear shared by Saul.“The really concerning aspect of this is the precedent it sets,” Rothwell said.“If the United States can do this, and this is a precedent that the United States is taking in terms of its interpretation of self-defence, or the way in which you can use force, then other states will take that into account in terms of how they consider their own future conduct.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nine other crew members and six guests – including Bacares – were rescued.About 70 specialist personnel had been mobilised to Porticello from across Europe to work on the recovery operation.Inquest proceedings in the UK are looking at the deaths of Lynch, his daughter and the Bloomers, who were all British nationals.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They had privately hired Disneyland Paris claiming it was a real wedding.”Four people were arrested and taken into police custody. Two were still being questioned on Sunday on suspicion of fraud and money-laundering.They included a man said to have been the fake groom, who is alleged to have organised the event. He is 22 and thought to be British, AFP reported. A 24-year-old Latvian woman was also being questioned.The young girl, who is Ukrainian, was not found to have suffered any “violence or constraint”, the prosecutor’s office said. Her mother, aged 41, was released from questioning, as was a 55-year-old Latvian man.Disneyland Paris is Europe’s most-visited theme park and can be hired for weddings at a very high price outside opening hours, with its Sleeping Beauty Castle as a backdrop.It was unclear why a fake wedding might have been staged there, and what the child’s role was. The local daily paper, Le Parisien, reported that extras who were to attend in the role of guests were taken by bus to the area.One of the extras who was hired to attend what she thought was a real wedding told France Inter radio: “I saw the panic of the Disney people, then, through the window, I saw a small child with a wedding dress on. A woman was carrying her in her arms and that’s when I understood that the child was really young.”Disneyland Paris told the station: “A private event booked at our destination was immediately cancelled by our staff after irregularities were identified. Police were called and arrived quickly.”The theme park said it was cooperating with authorities and had filed its own legal complaint.Explore more on these topicsFranceParisEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We kept taking cover behind the ruins of houses. Whoever doesn’t take cover is exposed to death,” he said.All last week, every night and most mornings, there weresimilar scenes across Gaza, as tens of thousands of hungry, desperate people converged on the GHF sites or waited at points where trucks loaded with UN flour were expected.Every day, somewhere in the devastated territory, these gatherings had a similarly lethal conclusion when Israeli forces open fire.Israeli forces kill 11 Palestinians awaiting food trucks, say Gaza officialsRead moreThe exact toll over the last 12 days is unclear. Medical authorities in Gaza say about 450 have died and thousands more have been injured. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) admit that some have been hurt by their fire but have not admitted any deaths in shootings, which they say are directed at “suspects” who have posed a threat to their forces and only ever follow warning shots.The GHF on Sunday said its model was working: “The Gaza health ministry, operated by Hamas, has been putting out false information on a daily basis which unfortunately media outlets have not verified before publishing.”But 10 witnesses interviewed by the Guardian last week all broadly corroborated reports of repeated lethal incidents involving high numbers of casualties, as do the records of medical aid groups working in Gaza.View image in fullscreenPalestinians with supplies from the GHF site at al-Bureij in the Gaza Strip on 8 June.Photograph: APA Images/ShutterstockWhen Ahmed came close to the GHF site north of al-Bureij, he heard “heavy but intermittent gunfire from tanks, artillery and quadcopters”. “As we got closer to the site, gunfire resumed and a shell fell just a few metres away from me, and then shrapnel scattered, some of which hit me in my chest, neck and leg,” Ahmed said.“I fell to the ground … I was trying to stop the blood flow from my neck using pieces of my clothes. My friends carried me a long distance until we reached the entrance of al-Bureij city, and there we found a car to take us to al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital.”The witnesses, many interviewed in hospital after being wounded, described similar scenarios.Between 27 May and 19 June, the Red Cross field hospital in Rafah received 1,874 “weapon-wounded patients” and recorded 18 “mass casualty incidents”, in which the vast majority of the patients reported to medical staff that they had been wounded while trying to access food at or near GHF sites.According to Médecins Sans Frontières, most of the 285 casualties treated at its primary health clinic in al-Mawasi, Khan Younis and the Red Cross field hospital in Rafah on 11 and 12 June had been seeking supplies at the GHF’s distribution sites. These included 14 people who were declared dead upon arrival or shortly after.EU cites ‘indications’ Israel is breaching human rights obligations over conduct in GazaRead moreFood has become extremely scarce in Gaza since Israel imposed a tight blockade on all supplies throughout March and April, threatening many of the 2.3 million people who live there with a“critical risk of famine”. A kilo of sugar now costs 60 times more than before the war and a 25kg bag of flour is up to $500. Fuel for cooking is scarce, fresh vegetables almost unobtainable for many and there is no fresh meat.Since the blockade was partly lifted last month, the UN has tried to bring in aid but it has faced major obstacles, including rubble-choked roads, Israeli military restrictions, continuing airstrikes and growing anarchy.Many of the deaths in recent weeks have occurred when rumours spread of the possible arrival of aid trucks sent into Gaza by the World Food Programme (WFP), which was recently given permission by Israel to use northern entry points to Gaza, allowing more direct access to the areas where the humanitarian crisis is most acute.But none of these deliveries have reached their destinations, all being stopped and offloaded, sometimes by criminal gangs but for the most part by desperate ordinary Palestinians, aid officials said.The WFP said on Wednesday it had beenable to dispatch just 9,000 tonnesof food aid into Gaza over the last four weeks, “a tiny fraction of what a population of 2.1 million hungry people needs”.Even those who obtain food are at risk. Once supplies at the hubs run out, some of those who came too late rob those leaving. Witnesses described adults beating and robbing children to take their food outside one of the three GHF hubs in Rafah. Thieves stabbed an older man in the arm when he tried to hold on to a sack of food, weeping that his children had no food, one said.Israel hopes the GHF will replace the previous comprehensive system of aid distribution run by the UN, which Israeli officials claim allowed Hamas to steal and sell supplies. A spokesperson said the IDF “will continue to facilitate humanitarian assistance in the Gaza Strip while making every effort to ensure that the aid does not reach the hands of the Hamas terrorist organisation”.UN agencies and major aid groups, which have delivered humanitarian aid across Gaza since the start of 20-month-long war, haverejected the new system, saying it is impractical, inadequate and unethical. They deny there is widespread theft of aid by Hamas.Aid workers in Gaza said some of the food provided by GHF was reaching Hamas, which has been seriously weakened but remains a significant actor in the increasingly fractured and chaotic territory. “They send people in to get it direct from the hubs, which is pretty simple because GHF are not vetting anyone,” said one senior UN official working in Gaza.Palestinian witnesses said Israeli troops fired to prevent crowds from moving past a certain point before the centres opened or because people left the road designated by the military.The IDF said its “operational conduct … is accompanied by systematic learning processes” and that it was looking into safety measures such as fences and road signs.In a statement on Sunday, the GHF said it had distributed 38m meals in Gaza “without injury or any fatalities at or near their site” though said there had been “unfortunate cases where some [seeking aid] have attempted dangerous shortcuts through active war zones or gotten lost.“Ultimately the solution is more aid, which will create more certainty and less urgency among the population. There is not yet enough capacity or food to feed everyone in need in Gaza. If the UN and other humanitarian organizations would join us we could scale aid across Gaza,” the GHF said.The war was triggered by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel, in which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage, of which 53 remain in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be still alive.The death toll in Gaza since the war broke out has reached 55,600, mostly civilians, according to the health ministry.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

They said their joint aim was to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and called on Tehran to address all concerns associated with the nuclear programme.“We stand ready to contribute to that goal in coordination with all parties,” the statement said. “We urge Iran not to take any further action that could destabilise the region. We will continue our joint diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions and ensure the conflict does not intensify and spread further.”Starmer warned earlier that the fallout from the conflict could reverberate beyond the region. “It is important that we now de-escalate the situation, stabilise the region and get the parties back around the table to negotiate,” he told broadcasters.Flights from London to Dubai and Doha were cancelled after a British Airways flight from Heathrow to Dubai was forced to divert to Zurich on Saturday night.Israelannounced on Sunday that it had closed its airspace to inbound and outbound flights.US bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities is Trump’s biggest gamble yet as presidentRead moreStarmer spoke to Donald Trump on Sunday night but the official readout of the call gave no hint as to whether the prime minister had called for the US to de-escalate.No 10 said Starmer and Trump “reiterated the grave risk posed by Iran’s nuclear programme to international security. They discussed the actions taken by the United States last night to reduce the threat and agreed that Iran must never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon.“They discussed the need for Iran to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and to make progress on a lasting settlement.”After Starmer spoke earlier on Sunday with the sultan of Oman and the king of Jordan, No 10 said the leaders agreed that “escalation of the conflict is in no one’s interests”.The US decision to join Israel’s offensive against Iran came after western leaders, including Starmer, had urged restraint. They are due to meet again on Tuesday at the Nato summit in the Netherlands.As recently as last Tuesday at the G7 summit, which Trump left early, Starmer said he did not have any indication the US was planning on joining the attack.Map showing location of Iranian nuclear facilities hit by US strikesThe business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, told Sky News that while the UK had preferred a different path, the outcome was in British interests. “We support the prevention of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. We had proposed a diplomatic course of action, as other European countries had done; the Iranians had rejected that.”Reynolds said people should be in no doubt that the Iranian regime did pose a threat to the UK, but that regime change in Tehran was “not the question” when it came to these strikes. “I wanted a different way to obtain this, but I cannot pretend to you that the prevention of Iran having a nuclear weapon is anything other than [in] the interests of this country,” Reynolds told the BBC.“This is very different to what we saw with the invasion of Iraq … I think stability for the region would come about through an agreement where Iran would acknowledge that, because of its behaviour, no country in that theatre or the wider world would be able to countenance it having nuclear weapons.”The chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Emily Thornberry, said the strikes were a “big mistake”. She told the BBC: “The concern is it will just become a wider conflict, and we are at a very dangerous moment. The war aim is supposed to be to stop the Iranians building a bomb, but this isn’t the way to do it. At best, it can slow down the Iranians. The way to stop them building a bomb is negotiation.”Labour and opposition MPs are likely to raise concerns in parliament when they return on Monday afternoon. The Green party co-leader, Adrian Ramsay,said: “We utterly condemn the reckless attacks on Iran by the United States that can only lead to further dangerous conflict in an already volatile region. There is no international legal basis for this unilateral action that poses a serious threat to international peace and security.”What a difference a week makes: Trump falls into the Netanyahu trapRead moreThe foreign secretary, David Lammy, had urged the US to pull back from the brink on a visit to Washington for talks with his counterpart, Marco Rubio, before attending talks with Iran on Friday alongside European allies in Geneva.Lammy also spoke to Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, saying on X that he had stressed the need for de-escalation.But Iran’s state news agency, IRNA, had a slightly different take on things, posting on X: “UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy expressed regret over the US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, categorically denied any involvement, and called for continued diplomacy.”The first part of the tweet prompted the UK Foreign Office to issue a response. A spokesperson said: “This representation of the foreign secretary’s phone call is inaccurate. The foreign secretary warned that this is a moment of extreme peril and that it is important we now de-escalate the situation, stabilise the region, and get all parties back around the table to negotiate. Iran must now immediately seek a diplomatic, negotiated solution to end this crisis.”Iran says US ‘must receive a response’ after Trump’s strikes on nuclear sitesRead moreThe Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said the US strike was “decisive action against a regime that fuels global terror and directly threatens the UK. Iranian operatives have plotted murders and attacks on British soil. We should stand firmly with the US and Israel.”Overnight, Iran launched a ballistic missile barrage against Israel in retaliation against the US action.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyKeir StarmerIranIran's nuclear programmeIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Everything off.’ I don’t want them to feel like they’re not the same as their friends,” he said in an interview with Men’s Health UK.France to use UK drama Adolescence to teach teenagers about toxic masculinityRead more“You get caught up in all of that stuff as a parent, but I feel like around the world this show has allowed parents to go: ‘Fuck that shit.Adolescencesays this could happen; now we’re going to start having this conversation.’ I think that’s a good thing.”The critically acclaimed television show, Netflix’ssecond biggest ever English-language series, tells the story of a 13-year-old boy who is arrested for the murder of a female classmate, and explores issues around so-called “incel” (involuntary celibate) culture, misogyny and online bullying.Walters said he would “love to” return to the show for a second series, but he thought that would involve “completely different characters with a completely different story” if it happened.He said his involvement in the show had had a direct impact on his parenting.

About 220,000 people with “greatest need” are expected to receive Mounjaro, also known as tirzepatide and made by Eli Lilly, on the NHS over the next three years.The drug works by lowering blood sugar levels and slows down how quickly food is digested.From Monday, GPs in England will be allowed to prescribe Mounjaro to severely obese people living with a range of other health problems. Patients previously needed to access the drugs through a special weight loss service.GP leaders said some family doctors had expressed concern about the additional workload, while pharmacy experts also said there could be pressure on supplies of the drug.In the first year of the programme, it will be offered to people with a body mass index (BMI) score of more than 40 who have at least four other health problems linked to obesity such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and obstructive sleep apnoea.Estimates suggest about 1.5 million people in the UK are already taking weight-loss drugs, which may have been prescribed through specialist weight loss services or via private prescription.Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “While we recognise the potential benefits of weight-loss drugs, we know many GPs are concerned about the implications of the rollout of weight-loss drugs into general practice, both in terms of workload and training to appropriately initiate and manage these treatments.“GPs and our teams are already working under intense workload and workforce pressures, and this must be factored into this rollout in order to guarantee it can be delivered safely.“More widely, while weight-loss medications have a lot of potential benefits for patients who are struggling to lose weight and who meet all the clinical criteria for a prescription, they mustn’t be seen as a ‘silver bullet’ to aid weight loss.“We also need to see a focus on prevention, stopping people becoming overweight in the first place so they don’t require a medical intervention later.”Olivier Picard, the chair of the National Pharmacy Association, said the demand for weight-loss jabs continued to rise sharply.“As the NHS is now moving to implement National Institute forHealthand Care Excellence guidance, and tirzepatide becomes prescribable to more patients, we expect to see prescription volumes increase rapidly,” he said.“However, NHS provision won’t meet demand straight away, so we fully expect that many people will continue seeking it privately from a pharmacy.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthObesityEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It promises a 10-year residence permit and a return to the controversial “remittance basis” of taxation, allowing cardholders to shield overseas income from UK tax and avoid inheritance tax entirely.In return, high-net-worth applicants would pay an upfront “entry contribution” of £250,000, which Reform UK said would be distributed in full to the bottom 10% of UK earners.Reform estimates this “Britannia workers’ dividend” could provide a tax-free annual payout of £600-£1,000 to roughly 2.5 million low-paid full-time workers, depending on uptake. The money would be delivered directly by HMRC at the end of each tax year.‘They feel betrayed’: how Reform UK is targeting votes in Britain’s manufacturing heartlandsRead moreUnder the plan, foreign nationals and wealthy British returnees would gain access to the UK through a tax-light regime that exempts all overseas income and assets from UK taxation for a decade. Inheritance tax would also scrapped entirely.In effect, Reform is proposing to sell exemption from the UK tax system – reinstating the abolished non-dom privileges in a simplified form but with a cash price attached. The party says the fee is not a “golden visa” but a way of ensuring wealthy newcomers “immediately contribute to British society”.Unlike Labour’s 2024 abolition of non-dom status, and the shift under former Tory chancellor Jeremy Hunt to a residence-based tax system for all new arrivals, Reform’s plan would restore tax breaks for the globally mobile– while simultaneously claiming to deliver for the British working class.Critics are likely to seize on what amounts to a structural loophole: the ability for millionaires to buy their way out of full UK tax liability, while ordinary residents remain subject to standard tax rules.Reform claims the policy will channel billions directly into the bank accounts of Britain’s poorest workers.Under its lowest-uptake scenario – 6,000 Britannia Cards issued a year – the scheme would generate £1.5bn, enough to fund a £600 tax-free bonus to 2.5 million workers. A higher-uptake scenario, with 10,000 cards, would raise £2.5bn and deliver £1,000 per worker.Only full-time workers in the bottom 10% of the income distribution would qualify, with payments issued automatically via HMRC. Reform said the boost would disproportionately benefit workers in Wales, Scotland and the north-east of England – regions where a greater share of jobs sit in the bottom pay decile.The party has yet to publish a clear threshold for who qualifies as a “high-net-worth newcomer” nor how the policy would be enforced or integrated into HMRC’s current tax framework. No legislative draft has been released.Since sweeping to power in more than 670 council seats in May and taking control of 10 councils and two mayoralties, Reform has emerged as a serious national contender. The party now leads in multiple polls: a recent Sky/YouGov tracker shows Reform on 34%, with Labour trailing at 25% and the Conservatives at just 15%.The move is part of Farage’s latest attempt toposition Reform as the party of working people, not through traditional wage policies or trade unionism, but via direct wealth transfers and blunt fiscal symbolism. The Britannia Card is his clearest move yet to dominate the “red wall” on economic terms.However the policy is likely to raise questions over who would be eligible with no confirmed income or asset threshold for applicants. It is also unclear whether HMRC could legally define and enforce the £250,000 fee.There are also concerns over it creating a two-tier tax system with British workers still paying full tax on global income while wealthy newcomers will not, and that it consists of a one-off fee and is not a recurring tax yet grants up to 10 years of preferential status.A Reform spokesperson said: “We are serious about repairing the social contract. It’s time workers feel the benefit of high-net-worth individuals entering the country.“We are taking policy formulation very serious internally, as can be seen by today’s announcement.”Responding to the trail of Reform’s non-dom policy, a Labour spokesperson said: “Nigel Farage can brand this whatever he wants – the reality is his first proper policy is a golden ticket for foreign billionaires to avoid the tax they owe in this country.“As ever with Reform, the devil is in the detail. This giveaway would reduce revenues raised from the rich that would have to be made up elsewhere – through tax hikes on working families or through Farage’s promise to charge them to use the NHS.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKTax and spendingNigel FarageImmigration and asylumMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

It examined all the official reviews of domestic abuse-related homicides and suicides published in 2024 and found that about 90% cited safeguarding failings by the NHS.Lack of domestic abuse training was the most frequent criticism identified. National Institute for Health and Care Excellenceguidanceadvises mandatory training for frontline NHS staff in identifying and properly caring for domestic abuse victims. But Stada’s analysis found that such training was “sporadic and inconsistent”.The report also highlights repeated failures by the NHS to record risks, share information and get victims help from other specialists such as alcohol and mental health services, and independent domestic violence advisers.Domestic abusers driving more victims to suicide, warn policeRead moreThe findings follow aseparate studypublished in the Lancet Regional Health Europe, which calculated that 26% of all women who died by suicide, and were known to secondary mental health services, had been a victim of domestic violence.The government is due to publish its strategy this summer on how to meet its pledgeto halve violence against women and girlsby 2034.But without urgent action, this ambition will not be achieved, the Stada report concludes. The NHS should fund mandatory, standardised domestic abuse training for frontline health professionals and specialist support such as mental health domestic violence advisers, the study recommends. Data recording and information sharing should also be improved.Cherryl Henry-Leach, the chief executive of Stada, said: “We call on the government to recognise domestic abuse as a public health issue.“Treating [domestic abuse] solely as a criminal justice issue costs lives. The NHS has more contact with victims and perpetrators than any other public service, making it uniquely positioned to address this crisis.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The level of physical and mental pain imposed on victims (and their children) by perpetrators is immense and we know that, for many, that mental torture becomes too great and they end up taking their own life.“I’ve calculated that 1,800 people a year could be dying in domestic abuse-related suicides every year. This is a tragically high waste of life, and a national scandal.”Andrea Simon, the director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: “Healthcare workers are often the first, and only, point of contact for victims of abuse and it is essential they are equipped to identify, signpost and safeguard victims who need support. As this report shows, the consequences of inaction can be serious harm, including death. It’s time the government took action on repeated recommendations in domestic homicide reviews and ensured all health professionals receive comprehensive training, including on the risk posed by domestic abuse-related suicides.”Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said given the trusted relationships GPs have with patients, “it is concerning to hear that opportunities to help victims might be being missed”.More training would be welcomed and valuable, she added, “as long as these are appropriately funded, take into consideration the existing training that GPs receive on safeguarding, and the workload pressures we face daily”.An NHS spokesperson said:“All NHS staff are required to complete safeguarding training on domestic violence and abuse to give them the skills and knowledge they need to support victims and survivors, and this training is currently being updated.”A government spokesperson said: “We remain resolute in our mission to tackle domestic abuse and put a system in place that protects victims, supports their journey to justice and holds perpetrators to account.“Healthcare professionals are often the first lifeline for domestic abuse victims – playing a vital role in supporting them to overcome trauma and rebuild their lives – and we have prioritised funding to deliver an additional 345,000 NHS talking therapies interventions to ensure survivors get the support they need.“Through our plan for change, we are developing a coordinated approach across government, underpinned by a new strategy to be published later this year, to prevent domestic abuse and protect victims.”In the UK, call the nationaldomestic abuse helplineon 0808 2000 247, or visit theMen’s Advice LineorWomen’s Aid.

Annabel was a truly wonderful woman. She touched the hearts of so many.“She gave her life to helping the vulnerable and the disadvantaged, whether it was in refugee camps in Africa, or setting up MamaSuze in London to enhance the lives of survivors of forced displacement and gender-based violence.”The family asked for their privacy to be respected.A 44-year-old man was arrested at the address on suspicion of murder. He was taken to hospital and later discharged and taken into police custody, the force said. Police have said they believed the incident was “domestic-related”.John Martin, the artistic director of Pan Intercultural Arts, where Rook worked with young refugees for 16 years until 2022, previously described her as “a larger-than-life character” who had joined the charity as a volunteer.In a personal tribute, Martin said: “Annabel’s energy brought a lot to the women and gave them new hope. This was her speciality, I think – a sort of boundless optimism, a boundless self-confidence, which she transferred on to other people.“She spent her life, certainly the 10, 12 years that I knew her, fighting [for] women who had been abused [and] fighting against violence to women.”MamaSuze said in a statement shared on Tuesday that it was “devastated by the loss of our beloved co-founder” and that she treated everyone with “warmth and kindness”.“Annabel was a profound force for good in the world, dedicating her working life to supporting women survivors,” it said.Police were called at 4.57am on Tuesday to reports of a gas explosion with a person trapped inside the property. Rook was found at the scene with stab wounds.The front bay window of the property was completely blown out, and debris including plants, wooden shutters and glass was scattered across the street.Two children aged seven and nine were taken to hospital as a precaution after the incident. They are not thought to have been inside the home when the explosion occurred.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Doctors determined she needed a shot of methotrexate to help expel her pregnancy but since Florida’s six week abortion ban had just taken effect medical staff were worried about losing their licenses or going to jail if they did.Cammack looked up the state law on her phone to show staff and even attempted to contact the governor’s office. Hours later, doctors eventually agreed to give her the medication.Women and men diverge more than ever on support for abortion rights, poll showsRead moreBut Cammack, who opposes abortion and co-chairs the House pro-life caucus,told the Wall Street Journalshe blames messaging from pro-abortion groups for delaying her treatment, which is not bannedunder Florida’s restrictive statutes, who have created fear of criminal charges.Over a year later and once again pregnant and due to give birth soon, Cammack says the politics of the incident have stuck with her.“It was absolute fearmongering at its worst,” Cammack told the publication, but acknowledged that abortion rights groups might interpret her experience differently and blame Republican-led, restrictive anti-abortion laws for the issue.“There will be some comments like, ‘Well, thank God we have abortion services,’ even though what I went through wasn’t an abortion,” she told the outlet.Florida’s strict abortion ban, whichtook effect on 1 May 2024, makes abortions illegal after six weeks, when most people aren’t even aware yet that they are pregnant.After months in which medical staff were concerned that the law’s wording made emergency procedures illegal, the state’s healthcare agencyissued official guidanceto “address misinformation” on permitting an abortion in instances where the pregnant person’s life and health are in danger.Cammack said she hoped that going public with her experience would help opposing political groups find common ground.Democrats introduce bill that aims to protect reproductive health dataRead more“I would stand with any woman – Republican or Democrat – and fight for them to be able to get care in a situation where they are experiencing a miscarriage and an ectopic” pregnancy, she said.Abortion rights activists say the law created problems. Florida regulators say ectopic pregnancies aren’t abortions and are exempt from restrictions, but Molly Duane, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told the Wall Street Journal the law doesn’t define ectopic pregnancy, which can be difficult to diagnose.Alison Haddock, the president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, told the outlet care in early pregnancy is a “medically complicated space” and that doctors in abortion-restricted states worry “whether their clinical judgment will stand should there be any prosecution”.Explore more on these topicsFloridaAbortionRoe v WadeRepublicansUS healthcareWomennewsShareReuse this content"

No one else was hurt in part because a church member ran the attacker over with a truck, said the CrossPointe Community church pastor Bobby Kelly Jr.The shooting happened at CrossPointe in Wayne, a city of about 17,000 people, at about 11am, Kelly Jr toldthe Detroit News.Kelly said the security guard had time to shoot the attacker because the attacker was run over by a church member driving a truck.“He was run over by one of our members who saw this happening when he was coming into church,” Kelly said to the newspaper.Police described the slain intruder as a 31-year-old white male. Ina statementshortly before noon on Sunday, authorities asked the public to avoid the area around the church, saying the investigation into the violence there remained under active investigation.About 150 people were attending the service, including children, Kelly said. Congregants’ startled reaction to the gunfire on Sunday was captured on the service’s online live stream.Kelly told the Detroit News that members of the CrossPointe church started a security team about a decade ago in response to violence at other places of worship around the US, although his congregation in Wayne had not received threats of violence.“We are sitting ducks to someone who wants to come and do harm,” Kelly said to the newspaper.Kelly reportedly added that the children in attendance on Sunday were “doing good” after the attack and that congregants were supporting each other.

The 22-year-old Tehran University student had believed Donald Trump when his administration said on Thursday that it would wait up to two weeks before deciding whether to attack Iran, apparently to give diplomacy a chance.And so at 4am when the newscaster announced the bombing on TV, Asal was in disbelief. She rushed to wake her father and the rest of the family, who huddled together in front of the set as the sounds of the news blended with those of bombings elsewhere in the city.“We weren’t expecting it yet. But we knew one way or another the US would take part in it,” Asal told the Guardian from Tehran. “We are dead worried. You know, sleep doesn’t come so easy these past few days.”Iranians woke to the news on Sunday morning that the unthinkable had finally happened: the US had attacked Iran. In the early hours of the morning, American warplanes dropped so-called bunker busters weighing 13,500kg (30,000lb) on the nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.The news was met with panic in Iran. It prompted a renewed wave of displacement in Tehran as people feared a more intensified assault on the city now that the US was involved.The question of whether the US would joinIsraelin its military campaign in Iran had hung over the heads of Iranians since the first Israeli bomb fell nearly 10 days earlier. Iranians watched with worry as Trump played coy with reporters, telling them “nobody knows what I’m going to do” about Iran.On 13 June, Israel had launched hundreds of airstrikes on Iran, an operation it said was aimed at preventing the country from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran quickly responded with a barrage of missiles and drones, kicking off an escalating tit-for-tat war.Israel asked the US to join its military campaign as it was the only country with the firepower necessary to penetrate the Fordow nuclear facility, buried up to 100 metres underground. On Sunday, the US granted its request.The Iranian government, incensed by the attacks, said it would do whatever was necessary to retaliate. The president, Masoud Pezeshkian, appeared in front of hundreds of protesters in a square in central Tehran, who raised their fists and chanted “Revenge, revenge!”.Asal has little appetite for revenge, she just wants the war to be over. To her and her friends, the US attack felt like a betrayal. “No one is rooting for either side to win. We just want peace. Not even those Iranians who wanted a regime change are happy. They expected Trump to take a different route or at least give us two weeks,” Asal said.Trump’s administration has said the strikes were in line with his “peace through strength” doctrine and has urged Iran not to retaliate but instead to return to the negotiating table. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, flatly rejected the request for talks, telling reporters in Istanbul on Sunday that now was not the time for diplomacy.To Navid*, Trump’s claims that the US bombing of Iran was a peace initiative rang hollow. The 28-year-old business owner in Tehran had been following international developments closely over the last 10 days, appointed the unofficial source of news for his family.“Who, exactly, cares about civilians?” he said. “The Israelis? Have they ever shown concern for civilian lives in Beirut or Gaza? The Americans? Did they show any in Libya, Afghanistan or Iraq?”Instead, he suggested the attack was less about strategy, and more about Trump’s ego. “He always wants to swoop in like Superman and do the things he claims no one else can.”US officials insisted that the strikes were a one-off and that they had achieved their goals in crippling Iran’s nuclear capabilities. Nonetheless, some Iranians feared that the apparent success of the US operation would inspire either Israel or the US to extend its aims and seek to change the regime in Iran – a fight they did not want to be caught up in, whether they support the government or not.Ava*, a 25-year-old accountant in Tehran, said: “We are angry, scared and frankly disgusted by not only the regime but also each one of you outside Iran who is sitting in the comfort of your homes and calling for US war on us. Who are you to decide for us?”*Names have been changed.Explore more on these topicsIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

So were parts of Arkansas, Tennessee, Louisiana and Mississippi.The temperature had already reached 80F (26.6C) in the Chicago area by 7.30am on Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. Forecasts called for heat indices of between 100 and 105F.The heat index in Pittsburgh was expected to top 105F. The temperature in Columbus, Ohio, was 77F at 8.30am. Highs there were expected to reach 97F with a heat index around 104F.Players and umpire fall ill during MLB games as heatwave grips USRead moreForecasts called for a heat index of 100F in Philadelphia on Sunday, with a 108F heat index on Monday.The city’s public health department declared a heat emergency starting at noon on Sunday and ending on Wednesday evening. Officials directed residents to air-conditioned libraries, community centers and other locations, and set up a “heat line” staffed by medical professionals to discuss conditions and illnesses made worse by the heat. At Lincoln Financial Field, officials said each fan attending Sunday’sFifa World Cupmatch would be allowed to bring in one 20oz plastic bottle of water.Forecasters warned the heat index in Cromwell, Connecticut, would reach 105F on Sunday, which could make life brutal for golfers Tommy Fleetwood and Keegan Bradley as they compete during the final round of the Travelers Championship.Elly De La Cruz, a Cincinnati Reds shortstop playing against the Cardinals in St Louis, and Trent Thornton, a Seattle Mariners reliever facing the Cubs in Chicago, got sick on Saturday while playing in the extreme heat.Sunday marked the second straight day of extreme heat across the midwest and east coast. Heat indices on Saturday hit 103F in Chicago and 101F in Madison, Wisconsin, turning that city’s annual naked bike ride into a sticky and sweaty affair.Lynn Watkins, 53, is the director of Sacred Hearts daycare in Sun Prairie, a Madison suburb. She said that she tried to sit outside on Saturday to grill but it was so hot she had to go inside. She plans to cancel all outdoor activities at the daycare on Monday with highs around 93F forecast.“I can’t stand being outside when it’s like this,” she said. “I just want to sit in my air conditioning.”Minneapolis baked under a heat index of 106F. The actual temperature was 96F, which broke the previous record for the date of 95F set in 1910, according to the weather service.Millions of people across central and eastern US under ‘heat dome’ warningRead moreThe heat is expected to persist into the coming week, with the hottest temperatures shifting eastward. New York City is expected to see highs around 95F on Monday and Tuesday. Boston is on track for highs approaching 100F on Tuesday, and temperatures in Washington DC were expected to hit 100F on Tuesday and Wednesday.Meteorologists say a phenomenon known as aheat dome, a large area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere that traps heat and humidity, is responsible for the extreme temperatures.Mark Gehring, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Sullivan, Wisconsin, said this level of heat is not uncommon during the summer months in the US, although it usually takes hold in mid-July or early August. The most unusual facet of this heatwave is the sheer amount of territory sweltering under it, he said.“It’s basically everywhere east of the Rockies,” he said, referring to the Rocky Mountains. “That is unusual, to have this massive area of high dewpoints and heat.”Explore more on these topicsUS weatherExtreme heatClimate crisisExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

But analysts were already predicting an spike of up to $5 before the result of the vote was known.“An oil price jump is expected,” said Jorge León, the head of geopolitical analysis at the energy intelligence firm Rystad and a former official at Opec, the group of major oil-producing nations. “In an extreme scenario where Iran responds with direct strikes or targets regional oil infrastructure, oil prices will surge sharply. Even in the absence of immediate retaliation, markets are likely to price in a higher geopolitical risk premium.”Brent crude, the traditional benchmark global oil price, could gain $3 to $5 a barrel when markets open, Ole Hvalbye, an SEB analyst, said in a note.JP Morgan has previously forecast that the oil price could rise as high as $130 in the event that a sustained Middle East conflict closes the strait of Hormuz for an extended period.Iranian officials have said they would block the strait if Tehran’s interests were threatened.A prolonged closure could have huge knock-on effects for the global economy. An oil price shock would risk a period of high inflation, as motorists pay more for petrol and the cost of transporting goods soars.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The all-time high for Brent crude is $147.50, set in July 2008 just before the global financial crisis sent prices plunging.Explore more on these topicsOilCommoditiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Its co-founder, the Trump donor Marc Andreessen, said earlier this month that the US was in a two horse race for AI supremacy with China. The US vice-president, JD Vance, recently said: “If we take a pause, does [China] not take a pause? Then we find ourselves … enslaved to [China]-mediated AI.”Horvitz said he was already concerned about “AI being leveraged for misinformation and inappropriate persuasion” and for its use “for malevolent activities, for example, in the biology biological hazard space”.Horvitz’s pro-regulation comments came despite reports thatMicrosoftis part of a Silicon Valley lobbying push with Google, Meta and Amazon, to support the ban on individual US states regulating AI for the next decade which is included in Trump’s budget bill which is passing through Congress.Microsoft is part of a lobbying drive to urge the US Senate to enact a decade-long moratorium on individual states introducing their own efforts to legislate, the Financial Times reported last week. The ban has been written into Trump’s “big beautiful bill” that he wants passed by Independence Day on 4 July.Horvitz was speaking at a meeting of thethe Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligenceon Monday when he said: “It’s up to us as scientists to communicate to government agencies, especially those right now who might be making statements about no regulation, [that] this is going to hold us back.“Guidance, regulation … reliability controls are part of advancing the field, making the field go faster in many ways.”Speaking at the same seminar, Stuart Russell, the professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, said: “Why would we deliberately allow the release of a technology which even its creators say has a 10% to 30% chance … of causing human extinction? We would never accept anything close to that level of risk for any other technology.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The recent college graduate – an employee in the IT industry – is at a mandatory team dinner.“I end up working late almost every day,” laughs Lee. “By the end of the day, I feel completely drained, like I’ve used up all my energy [and] I can’t really do anything on weekdays after work.”She begins the workday at 9.30am and ends most days at 10pm, sometimes pushing to midnight. On a single workday, Lee receives about 200 messages. With constant meetings and collaborative work filling the day, evenings are often the only time Lee has to catch up on individual tasks.This is far from unusual, according to new research. Microsoft’s 2025 work trend indexreportfound that many workers are increasingly grappling with “infinite workdays”, which start before sunrise and stretch late into the night. They are interrupted by some 270 pinging notifications along the way, about one every two minutes.Working from home? It’s so much nicer if you’re a man | Emma BeddingtonRead moreMany young professionals are struggling with this new reality. “If I pushed myself [too] hard one day, I try to leave work early the next day to get some rest,” Lee said. “There’s usually this unspoken pressure not to work from home, even if it’s allowed, but I do it anyway because I have so much work, [so] commuting feels like a waste of time, and I am just exhausted.”This traditional work culture is disillusioning gen Z as 94% of the generation are prioritizing work-life balance over climbing the corporate ladder, according toresearchby Deloitte.Sal, a New York-based compensation specialist who declined to provide his full name for privacy reasons, believes his generation is facing new hurdles in the workplace such as rising mental health concerns, and stagnant wage increases in the face of inflating living costs.Despite these challenges, Sal, 24, said he is still expected to conform to an outdated working structure, putting in long hours without the payoff older generations had. “We’re graduating with a high amount of debt [from university] and then working a job that is burning us out, and it’s not even paying for this debt,” he said. “A lot of people my age are job hopping because they’re burnt out or cannot find longevity in their roles.”Sal’s first year in his current role led him to seek therapy because the workload seemed to be a “constant queue” and he felt perpetually anxious despite “being in a spot that is better than most people in my generation”. He was diagnosed with a general anxiety disorder.Even in South Korea, a country known for its notoriously long working hours, gen Z is rejecting this lifestyle.“Young people really value their free time after work, and prefer having enough rest, flexible work environmentsand more freedom,” said Lee. “The younger generation believes working overtime, too, often can sometimes be seen as a sign of poor time management, so people don’t think working long hours is always a good thing.”For some, long working hours are inevitable. Others are choosing to endure them temporarily, in the hope of buying back their time later.Jane, who also declined to disclose her surname, is working two full-time jobs with the goal of escaping corporate life in four years, when she turns 30. Based in Toronto, she splits her 70-hour workweek between a 9-to-5 marketing manager role and a 5-to-11 call service representative position. Both are remote.“My first 9 to 5 internship experience in university was so horrible that it made me very anti-career and anti-work, to the point where I wouldn’t do this until I was 65,” Jane said. “The older management clearly expected employees to make work their entire life.”In Jane’s previous marketing role with a different company, she drowned in infinite workdays which ultimately led her into a spiral of depression. The management team scheduled meetings off-the-clock, chastised employees who left on time, and expected workers to check messages 24/7, including on holidays like Christmas.“I would just be very anxious all the time, and I would lose sleep over it,” Jane explained. “I feel like getting sucked into work and over-obsessing while thinking that that’s your life is definitely the wrong approach.Work-life balanceis so important.”Jane experienced burnout numerous times since entering the workforce after college. However, she now sets firm working boundaries and communicates her bandwidth to her team. She refuses to work off-the-clock and prioritizes time with loved ones instead.“What I’ve realized is that the only way to fix burnout is to leave the company, because if the environment makes you stressed, you cannot fully mentally protect yourself,” Jane said. “I’m working to live, not living to work.”Explore more on these topicsWork-life balanceWork & careersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Musk has told reporters that there may be fewer than a dozen cars in Austin on Sunday and that the vehicles will stick to specific neighborhoods. Some analysts believe that therobotaxis will only be availableto employees and invitees initially.For the CEO, Tesla’s rollout is slow. “We could start with 1,000 or 10,000 [robotaxis] on day one, but I don’t think that would be prudent,” hetold CNBCin May. “So, we will start with probably 10 for a week, then increase it to 20, 30, 40.”The billionaire has said the driverless cars will be monitored remotely, but it is unclear if a safety driver will accompany the vehicles – as is standard practice when other robotaxi companies have launched in new cities.Musk has been touting theAustinrollout since last summer, but the debut date has been a moving target. Over the past few months, the billionaire indicated the launch would be some time in June.Then, news reports floated that it would happen on 12 June. Just two days before that supposed launch, Muskreposted a video on X, the social media platform he owns, showing a driverless Tesla passing through an intersection in Austin. In response to questions about the video on X, Musksaidthe date was “tentatively” 22 June but that this launch date would be “not real self-driving”, which would have to wait nearly another week.“We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,” Musk added. “FirstTeslathat drives itself from factory end of line all the way to a customer house is 28 June.”Musk said he planned to have one thousand Tesla robotaxis on Austin roads “within a few months” and then he would expand to other cities inTexasand California.Despite a launch that Musk has described as scaled back, Tesla is already facing opposition from Texas lawmakers. A group of Democratic state senators and members of the housesent Tesla a letterlast week asking the company to delay the debut until a new autonomous vehicle law takes effect in September.“We believe this is in the best interest of both public safety and building public trust in Tesla’s operations,” the lawmakers wrote. It is unlikely their objections will throw up lasting roadblocks, though, as Republicans hold majorities in both chambers of the Texas legislature.Federal authorities have likewise taken note of the robotaxi launch. In May, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrationsent Tesla a list of questionsabout its robotaxi launch in Austin, which included how the company would intervene if something went wrong, how it would handle crash reporting and how it would deal with adverse weather conditions.An NHTSA spokesperson told the Guardian that the agency had received a response from Tesla and was in the process of reviewing it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The NHTSA is looking intonumerous crashesin which the agency says Full Self-Driving software was impeded by weather conditions like sun glare, fog, dust and darkness, including one crash that resulted in the death of a pedestrian.Tesla will be joining a crowded robotaxi market in the Texas city, which already has services from Waymo, owned by Google parent Alphabet.Amazon and Volkswagen are also testing driverless taxis in Austin. These companies have taken a slower approach in developing their autonomous vehicle technology by driving hundreds of thousands of miles to map city streets and working to train their software to avoid pedestrians, cyclists and unexpected happenings on the road.Tesla did not return a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsTeslaSelf-driving carsElon MuskAustinTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

Media reports recently indicated that many small businesses are challenged byTrump’s tariffs, ongoinginflation, labor shortages and higher financing costs. So how are small businesses doing so far in 2025? Not great. But not that bad either.In just the past two months, there have been no less than seven comprehensive surveys conducted by well-known companies and brands that altogether surveyed or drew from their internal data of tens – even hundreds – of thousands of small businesses. And they give a pretty good idea of how they’re doing.Wealth management firm Principal Financial’sWell-Being Indexfrom June found that 56% of the companies they surveyed reported business growth and 90% of employers have either maintained or grown their workforce over the past year, with 49% increasing wages in just the past three months.Tariff dodgers take big risks to cut small corners | Gene MarksRead moreHowever, optimism remains tempered by a weakening outlook on future economic growth and many have reported “significant declines” in the financial health of their business, their local economy and theUS economy, “eroding the sense of optimism expressed in years past”.According to a survey by accounting giant EY,95% of those polledwere “confident in business growth” over the next year. Additionally, 73% of entrepreneurs reported experiencing revenue growth this year compared with last year, with 29% reporting growth of 20% or higher. However, 43% said that current economic conditions are hurting them, but many still plan to pursue funding and strategic transactions, with investment in AI and M&A considerations leading the list.Software provider Intuit’sQuickBooks Small Business Indexdraws on actual information from its customers, derived from anonymized employment and payroll data. The company found that job growth among small businesses – the great majority of their customer base – was stable, with employment increasing in seven of the 12 sectors tracked. That’s good, but unfortunately the study also found that average real monthly revenue for small businesses with one to nine employees decreased about 0.06% from the month before.Like Intuit, HR services giant Paychex said in itsSmall Business Employment Watchreports that job growth derived from its 350,000-plus customer database in May “stayed flat” month over month and hourly earnings growth decreased to a four-year low. “Caution persists” in both wage and hiring trends.The closely watchedSmall Business Optimism Indexpublished monthly by the National Federation of Small Businesses reported a tick up in small business optimism in May to a level above its 51-year average. The survey found that the top concerns of the federation’s members shifted from inflation to taxation and that although sales expectations and hiring plans were “improving”, uncertainty remained.Finally, in its JuneSmall Business Perspectivereport, US Bank said that 96% of the small business owners it surveyed reported their business as currently successful and 88% saw growth in the past year. Two-thirds said the country’s economy was “moving in the right direction”, with only 18% saying it was going in the wrong direction.Interestingly, this sentiment was even stronger among younger business leaders (gen Z and millennial), with 74% saying it was moving in the right direction, versus 52% of leaders from older generations (gen X and boomer). Although four out of five owners felt at least “somewhat stressed” about tariffs, those leaders were “slightly more likely to anticipate a positive rather than negative impact”.My take? Despite all the headwinds and uncertainties such as tariffs, federal and local policies, geopolitical conflicts, inflation, labor shortages and other challenges – small businesses, so far, in 2025 remain optimistic about the future and are maintaining employment levels mostly reporting average financial results. Few are jumping for joy. But it seems that fewer are jumping off the ship.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessTrump tariffsTariffsInflationDonald TrumpUS economycommentShareReuse this content"

If the trade goes ahead it will be formally completed when the new league year starts on 6 July.News of the trade emerged when Durant was on stage at Fanatics Fest in New York City. Durant smiled as people in the crowd learned of the reports. “We’re gonna see, man,” Durant told fans at the event. “We’re gonna see.”The $10bn LA Lakers sale proves sports have outgrown even most billionairesRead moreDurant’s best years are behind him but he still averaged 26.6 points, 6.0 rebounds and 4.2 assists for the Suns in 62 games in 2024-25. He is a 15-time All-Star, four-time scoring champion and wasNBAMVP in 2014.The Rockets would be Durant’s fifth team after the Oklahoma City Thunder, Golden State Warriors, Brooklyn Nets and Suns. He won two titles with the Warriors and was also NBA finals MVP twice during his time in California.Last season was a disappointing one for the Suns, who finished with a 36-46 record, despite having the highest payroll in the NBA. The Rockets, meanwhile, finished second in the Western Conference but were eliminated by the Warriors in the first round of the playoffs. Despite that setback they are seen as a rising force in the Western Conference under the leadership of coach Ime Udoka and young stars such as Amen Thompson and Alperen Sengun, who was an All-Star for the first time this season. According to ESPN, the Rockets were Durant’s favored destination along with the Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs.Durant, who will turn 37 in September, has one year left on his current contract and is due to earn $54.7m next season. He can sign a two-year extension worth up to $122m when the new league year starts in July.Durant has played in Texas before: he was a member of the Texas Longhorns in college before he was taken as the No 2 overall pick in the 2007 draft.Explore more on these topicsNBAPhoenix SunsHouston RocketsBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, he said he would give $5,000 to each of the 50 fans who competed in the event and donate the rest to charity.“There is a competitive spirit that I have … I had to at least show up and not embarrass myself,” Brady said after his victory.The competitors in the games, which took place at the Fanatics Fest in New York, took part in seven events including quarterback throwing skills, baseball pitching accuracy, soccer shooting, a golf challenge and a UFC striking competition. Brady finished second in the quarterback skills content, behind Texans QB CJ Stroud.UFC fighter Justin Gaethje finished in second place overall and won a Ferrari. The highest-placed fan was Matt Dennish, a teacher from Pennsylvania, who ended the competition in third place. He won a rare LeBron James trading card, which he sold to Brady for $250,000.“I was in first for a while, but Brady came in and crushed my score,” Dennish told NBC. “That was kind of frustrating too because I felt like I left points out there.”NBA star James Harden and former New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning finished fourth and fifth respectively. They were the only other athletes to finish in the top 10.Brady jokingly ripped up Manning’s Giants jersey as part of his WWE-style entrance.

He drank a bunch of water. I mean a bunch,” Reds manager Terry Francona said, “and then he went right out and got rid of it.” The 23-year-old was well enough to stay in the game and hit a two-run homer in the seventh.Thornton pitched two-and-a-third scoreless innings for Seattle before departing in the eighth in his team’s 10-7 loss at the Chicago Cubs. The 31-year-old right-hander had to be helped from the field.Mariners manager Dan Wilson said Thornton had “a little bit of a heat-related illness”, adding: “It was a scary moment, for sure. He battled hard. But just really glad that he’s feeling a little bit better now and should be OK.”The gametime temperature for Reds at Cardinals was 92F (33C), and it was 94F (34C) for the first pitch of the Mariners’ loss to the Cubs.

Photograph: Sipa US/AlamyA poor Nations League and an injury troubled buildup has taken the shine off Marko Saloranta’s side after an impressive qualifying campaignByAri VirtanenSun 22 Jun 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 22.26 EDTShareThis article is part of the Guardian’sEuro 2025 Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 16 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two teams each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 2 July.OverviewFinland played well during the qualifying campaign, beating Scotland 2-0 on aggregate in the playoffs, and their performances raised expectations. However, the Nations League campaign that followed acted as a rude awakening. A draw at home to Serbia – after they conceded an 84th-minute own goal – meant they finished second in their group behind their opponents.The reason for the dip in form can largely be explained by the numerous injuries the team has suffered in the run-up to the Euros. Key players such as Natalia Kuikka, Elli Pikkujämsä and Jutta Rantala have been out for a long time.Kuikka, one of the most important players in the squad, is now back playing but has missed several months of the buildup. Pikkujämsä, one of the team’s most reliable defenders, has been out for a year with a knee injury.After the match against Serbia, the head coach, Marko Saloranta, said: “The players’ fitness and health are constantly monitored. It is clear that we cannot include too many players [in the final squad] whose fitness we are not sure about.”Rantala is a key player in attack. The Leicester forward has been out since October and Finland simply look a less dangerous side without her.As a team Finland have been able to develop their game in the past couple of years under the tutelage of Saloranta. They attack in a varied manner, keeping opponents on their toes, are able to keep possession well with a diamond formation in midfield and rely on their tireless full-backs who often run deep into the opposition’s half and also contribute with goals.The team’s success in recent years has been based on disciplined performances and being clinical in front of goal.FinlandThe coachThe 53-year-oldMarko Salorantahas been one of the key figures in the rise of women’s football in Finland over the past 20 years. He has had to pay a heavy price, though, for all the work he has put in and revealed that he went through a divorce during the qualifiers. “There are pros and cons to every job,” he said. “I can handle stress and criticism, but it’s draining that I don’t have enough time to be with my loved ones.” Saloranta has worked for the Finnish FA for more than 15 years and was the head coach for the under-17 girls’ national team when they qualified for the 2018 Euros and the World Cup the following year.Star playerNatalia Kuikkahas won the Finnish women’s player of the year award five times. She should reach the 100-cap mark at the Euros. The 29-year-old has spent most of her career in the United States. She won the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship in 2018 with Florida State and was nominated for the collegiate female athlete of the year award. She then became the first Finn to win the National Women’s Soccer League championship, with Portland Thorns in 2022. At one point, she seriously considered moving back to Europe but decided against it. “I just felt like I didn’t have to. I didn’t have to show anyone anything. This is my career and my life,” she said in an interview with the Finnish broadcasters Yle in January 2025. Kuikka is a cool-headed defender, physically strong and fast, and absolutely key for this team.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Halttunen is an exceptional striker and Joonas Sarelius, the sports director at the club where she learned her trade, HJK, says she has a good chance to develop into a top player. She is one of those rare players who seem capable of doing everything. “She is excellent at protecting the ball and can use that skill to win one-on-one situations in surprising places on the pitch,” he says. “She is really strong and can find the net from long range. These are the qualities that bring her a lot of scoring opportunities.”Probable lineupView image in fullscreenStatus of domestic top-flightThe Kansallinen Liiga could be called semi-professional but in reality it is still an amateur league. There were 245 players in the league last year and 70% were considered to be amateurs. A third were “professionals” with contracts that guaranteed them some payments, but only 10 players were actually professional in the true sense of the word with insurance cover and other necessities. In 2024 the average attendance was 357. The media coverage of the league is pretty good, to be fair, with all games streamed live on a major media platform.Realistic aim in SwitzerlandConsidering how well Finland has competed against better teams during qualifying it is fair to expect them to progress to the knockout round. That would be a good achievement for a team whose key players have been injured this year.The Finland team guide was written by Ari Virtanen forIlta-Sanomat.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euros 2025: Guardian Experts’ NetworkFinland women's football teamWomen's Euro 2025Women's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is important to have zero tolerance in these kinds of situations. Fifa now is investigating. That’s all I can say.”It was not immediately clear whether the alleged abuse came from the crowd or an opponent. Fifa has yet to comment on the allegations.Five minutes into stoppage time, referee Ramon Abatti crossed his forearms in front of his chest, which signals the activation of the anti-racism protocol, after a brief scuffle erupted after an apparent foul on Germany international Rüdiger.The preceding 90 minutes had seen Jude Bellingham and Arda Güler score late in the first half to help 10-man Real Madrid to a victory in a Group H clash played amid sweltering conditions on Sunday in Charlotte, North Carolina.Federico Valverde’s sliding volley in the 70th minute sealed Xabi Alonso’s first victory as Madrid manager. The result puts his side’s Club World Cup campaign back on track after adramatic 1-1 drawagainst Al-Hilal in Wednesday’s opener, and despite Sunday’s early dismissal of defender Raúl Asencio.Real Madrid can clinch a place in the last 16 with a win or draw against Salzburg on Thursday in Philadelphia.

But as in Pachuca’s 2-1 Wednesday loss to Salzburg, it was their opponents who had more quality in their attacks.Referee Ramon Abatti Abel showed no hesitation in dismissing Asencio in the seventh minute for denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity after the Madrid defender hauled down Salomón Rondón just beyond the penalty area.But after absorbing pressure for most of the opening half-hour, the Spaniards raced out to a 2-0 lead in the half’s final 15 minutes.In the 35th, Gonzalo García’s quick flick-on freed Fran García down the left. The latter then picked out the late run of Bellingham, who collected a square ball and slid his low finish past Carlos Moreno from 15 yards.In the 43rd minute, it was Güler providing the finishing touch from inside the area on another flowing Madrid move, this time with Gonzalo García providing the final square pass after Trent Alexander-Arnold’s first-touch cross.Pachuca continued to apply pressure after the break, with Courtois forced to push Bryan González’s early-second half effort over the bar and John Kennedy’s 61st-minute strike from distance well clear of his left post.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yildiz was instrumental in the opener as his angled shot forced Wydad defender Abdelmounaim Boutouil to turn the ball into his own net. Ten minutes later, Yildiz unleashed a spectacular strike from the edge of the box into the top-right corner to give Juventus a 2-0 lead, but a mistake by the Italian defence gifted Thembinkosi Lorch a goal to reduce the deficit in the 25th minute.Juve, however, extended their lead again through Yildiz’s brilliance, with the 20-year-old Turkey forward scoring their third goal from close-range in the 69th minute, with substitute Dušan Vlahović wrapping up their commanding win from the penalty spot deep in added time.The result eliminates Wydad, who lost their opening match to Manchester City.RB Salzberg 0-0 Al HilalAl Hilal dominated possession but Salzburg’s defence held in a scoreless draw in Washington that meant Group H will come down a pair of consequential upcoming matches.After Real Madrid’s win over Pachuca 3-1, the stalemate between Al Hilal and Salzburg meant the group’s spots in the knockout round remain up for grabs. Salzburg will face a challenging match against Real in Philadelphia on Thursday, while Al Hilal will face Pachuca in Nashville.Al Hilal, the runners up at the 2022 Club World Cup, pressured Salzburg from the start, with nearly 62% of possession during the first half. They took 10 shots, but had just one on target.It was clear that Al Hilal were missing the finishing touch of striker Aleksandar Mitrović, who has missed both of the team’s Club World Cup matches with a muscle injury.Al Hilal goalkeeper Yassine Bounou stopped a near-point blank shot from Salzburg’s John Mellberg early in the second half.

A conundrum facing Chelsea’s head coach, though, is that he will struggle to find space in his starting XI for everyone next season.Chelsea are not short of options in the middle. They have the £100m buys, Enzo Fernández and Moisés Caicedo, and the elegant, deep-lying Roméo Lavia. Yet starting them all in a midfield three is not easyif Cole Palmer plays as a No 10.‘Sorry, sorry, sorry’: Jackson apologises for red card as Flamengo stun ChelseaRead moreMaresca has had to be creative at times. Chelsea are smoother when Lavia is conducting play. The issue is that squeezing the Belgian into the same side as Palmer and Fernández has often meant moving Caicedo out of the central areas and over to right-back, where the Ecuador international’s ball-winning ability is not as pronounced and his lack of defensive nous can be exposed by better teams.This is where Maresca has to prove his worth. The head coach looked for a workaround when Chelsea faced Flamengo in their second game at theClub World Cuplast Friday, but the plan backfired in scorching conditions in Philadelphia. Palmer shifted to an inside-right role, Fernández played higher and, with Lavia’s fitness still being managed, Maresca tried Reece James next to Caicedo in defensive midfield. He dispensed with his usual ploy of using at least one inverted full-back, instead instructing Marc Cucurella to hold his position on the left and Malo Gusto to perform a similar function on the right.Fair enough, you might say, given the Club World Cup is sort of doubling as pre-season for Chelsea, who will have little time to prepare for the Premier League campaign if they reach the final next month. Still, it would have been better if the plan had worked. There has been no suggestion of Chelsea treating their time in the US as an inconvenience, so it was hardly encouraging to see them play so badly during their 3-1 defeat against Flamengo, which leaves them unable to win Group D and at risk of going out when they face Espérance in Philadelphia on Tuesday night.View image in fullscreenEnzo Fernández is a mainstay of Enzo Maresca’s midfield.Photograph: Kyle Ross/IMAGN Images/ReutersSupporters were particularly aggrieved about James’s role given that he is a superior right-back to Gusto, who has been out of form for a while, and does not have an extensive history of playing in midfield. Thomas Tuchel, the England head coach and former Chelsea manager, is probably on to something when he says that James is more suited to playing on the right. Few full-backs deliver a better cross than the 25-year-old.Meanwhile there is also the question of why Maresca opted for a right-back in the middle when he had four central midfielders – Lavia, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Andrey Santos and Dário Essugo – on the bench.Such competition for places can be interpreted in two ways. The first is that some individuals are bound to get frustrated with their lack of playing time. What if Willian Estêvão craves a central role rather than a spot on the flanks when he joins from Palmeiras? As for the here and now, fans are particularly worried about Santos not playing in either of Chelsea’s first two games in the US. The 21-year-old Brazilian had an excellent season on loan at Strasbourg last season, with 10 goals and four assists for the Ligue 1 side, and he has been talked up a lot by key figures at Stamford Bridge.Chelsea make Gittens top target and keep Kudus and João Pedro in sightsRead more“Last season was amazing because it was my first season competing in Europe,” Santos said before the Flamengo game. “I got made second captain and it was so important for me because I was [on loan] at Nottingham Forest, didn’t play and then the year at Strasbourg was so important for me.”It is to be hoped that Santos, who has been linked with Bayern Munich, is ready to be patient. Getting no minutes against Flamengo will be a disappointment given that the Brazil international played for their great rivals, Vasco da Gama, but it is important to maintain perspective. Santos is still a newcomer, after all, and will surely be given an opportunity to prove that he can compete with Fernández.He needs to remember that Chelsea are about to embark on a campaign in which their stamina will be tested by playing in the Champions League. Similar applies to Essugo, who will hopefully lessen the reliance on Caicedo. The 20-year-old Portuguese has joined from Sporting Lisbon for £18.5m and is hopeful of making his mark. Comparisons with Caicedo are flattering but Essugo wants to be his own man.View image in fullscreenRoméo Lavia is an elegant midfielder but will face competition next season as the games add up.Photograph: Dale Zanine/IMAGN Images/Reuters“It is good when they compare you with a very big player,” Essugo says. “But it is a mix of both because I want to try to go my way to reach the top. I am a defensive midfielder but I also like to go forward with the ball – box to box.”Essugo was 16 when he was handed his debut at Sporting by the “demanding” Ruben Amorim. He looked up to João Palhinha, Manuel Ugarte and Morten Hjulmand. Essugo’s hero was William Carvalho, who now plays for Real Betis.There was competition for Essugo, who spent last season on loan at Las Palmas. Chelsea got there first. They have been accused of scattergun recruitment but surely this is evidence of planning. In a way they are emulating Brighton by picking up Santos and Essugo early. The price goes up if those talents join mid-table Premier League teams first. Chelsea discovered that when they bought Caicedo from Brighton for £115m. Perhaps they are benefiting from two of their leading recruitment figures, Sam Jewell and Paul Winstanley, previously working at Brighton.There are plenty of pieces to the puzzle. Over to Maresca to make it look good.Explore more on these topicsChelseaClub World CupClub World Cup 2025US sportsShareReuse this content"

At 11.43pm on 21 June 2025, the man who was twice a European champion with the greatest generation Spain has ever seen, who has won at Wembley, the Camp Nou and the Santiago Bernabéu, was crouched at the side of the pitch at the Carlos Tartiere ready for one last run. And when the final whistle went – on this game and an entire era – he set off, 40 years old and a kid again leading them all on to the pitchand intoprimera.From the touchline they followed, let loose at last. From everywhere else they did too, the stands where 29,624 fans had been through it again emptying on to the pitch. A quarter of a century later,Real Oviedohad returned to the first division. “It’s been many years in the mud,” Cazorla said: they had disappeared down to the second, third and fourth tier, twice they had almost disappeared entirely; here, against Mirandés in the playoff final second leg, the match he called “the biggest of my career”, they had conceded early, two goals down on aggregate, and were taken into extra time, tension tearing at them, even as they knew it was never going to be easy, but now they had actually done it; now they were back. In their centenary year.View image in fullscreenFans of Real Oviedo on the pitch celebrating their team’s promotion to La Liga.Photograph: Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty ImagesCazorla was born in Fonciello, population barely 100 in the parish of Lugo de Llanera, 10 minutes outside Oviedo. Like his father, Jose Manuel, an ambulance driver who passed away in 2007, Cazorla was an Oviedo fan. He was tiny but there wassomething special about him: so special that when he and his mates Robi Toral and Piero Manso, ballboys and youth teamers, kicked about on the pitch at half-time people would watch, even if he likes to say his older brother Nando was better. He joined Oviedo at eight, saw them relegated at 16 and was forced to leave at 18, having never played a first-team game. When he finally did, it was in the second division,20years later – and that was better than it had been, if still not their place.Oviedo had been relegated at Mallorca in 2001. In 2003 they were relegated two divisions at once, all the way down totercera, a fourth tier made up of17divisions and almost 350 teams, in tiny grounds rarely much better than park pitches.Mudis literal, not just a metaphor. A financial crisis forced Cazorla out the door just when it might have opened. In 2005, they had been promoted toSegunda B, where 80 teams are spread across four regionalised divisions. And in 2015, they were promoted to the second division, but it had been almost a decade without even making the playoffs for the top flight.Cazorla had come to take them out of there, and while you wouldn’t know it, while it was what he wanted, it weighed. He also came on the minimum wage, no bonuses. “I would play for free but you’re not allowed,”he said. He made only one demand: that 10% of sales of the Cazorla No 8 shirts that are everywhere now go directly to the club’s academy. Kids like him – like Juan Mata and Michu – should never be forced to go again.View image in fullscreenOviedo’s players celebrate with supporters, the day after the promotion before.Photograph: JL Cereijido/EPAHe had been through an injury that kept him out of football for 636 days. He had been under the knife 12 times. Ten centimetres had been taken from his Achilles, an infection eating it up. His bone had gone as soft as plasticine. The tattooed skin on his arm had been cut in half and grafted on his heel, his daughter’s name split in two. It was, Arsène Wenger said, the worst injury he had ever seen. Doctors had told him to settle for being able to walk round the garden. It was a miracle that he played again at all, and that returnwas five years earlier. And now he was 38.In his first season Oviedo made it to the playoff final, where they were defeated by Espanyol. That, everyone assumed, was that. But he wasn’t going to leave this way. This year a Cazorla free-kick against Almería took them to the playoff final. He missed the first leg in Miranda, watching frustrated from a glass fronted press cabin with a knock on his knee as Oviedo lost 1-0. Against Mirandés in the second leg on Saturday night, when Mirandés took the lead again, he took control. When Oviedo got a penalty just before half-time, he took the ball, kissed it and scored, the place going wild.Ilyas Chaira made it 2-1, taking the game into extra time. Then, with Cazorla withdrawn, everything given, Francisco Portillo scored a superb goal that made it 3-1, 3-2 on aggregate. There was magic there too: Portillo has now won promotion from the second division to the first five times. Asked how the experience was, Cazorla said “nervous”, but it had finally happened: 24 years later, Oviedo were back in the first division.View image in fullscreenFrancisco Portillo and Real Oviedo celebrate after scoring his decisive goal.Photograph: Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty ImagesIn the crowd Cazorla was lifted on the shoulders of Diego Cervero. The club’s top scorerwhen they were down in the mud, Cervero is now the doctor. When Oviedo were relegated totercera, he had promised he would have to die to leave Oviedo without getting them back into professional football – defined here by the top two divisions – and he had been as good as his word; now he has helped taken them to the first.At the other end of the pitch when Oviedo won promotion to the second division in 2015 was goalkeeper Esteban Suárez, who had dropped from the first division to the third tier to bring them back. “I had a friend who needed my help,” he said then; on Saturday he was at the Tartiere. So too was Michu, who had been in the team that won promotion from the fourth tier in 2005and also returned, after anotherlong fight with injury, something about Oviedo. Now here was Cazorla, taking the microphone and singing the club’s unofficial anthem by Melendi, an Oviedo-born musicianwho was in the club’s academy. It is a song of hope and hurt: “We can’t live like this, seeing our team suffer,” it runs, “volveremos”: we will return. Will? Have.View image in fullscreenSanti Cazorla celebrates with teammates late into the night.Photograph: JL Cereijido/EPAThere were returns everywhere, meaning at every turn. The last time Oviedo played inprimera, it was in Mallorca in 2001. That day, Veljko Paunovic was a player; now he is the coach. “There is closure,” he said on Saturday night. “All of those that appear in that photo wanted this redemption, for the cycle to close. Oviedo are back where they should have been all this time. But I think of those who didn’t make it,like [Radi] Antic[the coach] and [Peter] Dubovsky.” Dubovsky had died in June 2000, at 28. This was for them and for Armando Barbon, who died in 2003 aged just 19 – his statue stands in the corner of the stadium – and Pelayo Novo, who passed away at 32.That day Esteban had played too, his own redemption made upon his return in 2015. At full time, the Mallorca coach, Luis Aragonés, who had been at Oviedo, tried to comfort him. “Whenever it rains, it clears up again,” he said. Yet no one expected it to take 24 years for the skies to clear andAragones too passedbefore it did. A whole generation of Oviedo fans have never seen them in the first division, and this was not just promotion. By the time Cazorla climbed on the stage by Plaza América, the streets were packed. “Without you, Oviedo doesn’t exist,” he told them.It wan’t a throwaway line. This is his club; it is all of theirs. For a long time there might not have been a club for him to come back to at all. In 2003, they were relegated twice in one summer: once on the pitch; the other off it, punished for their financial crisis, slipping into administration, after players denounced the club for not paying their wages. If there is an image of how bad it was, perhaps it is the coach setting up his office in the toilet, table literally alongside the urinal, because it was one of the few places there was natural light, after the electricity had been cut off.The local council tried to build a new club to take its place. They haven’t forgotten: the very last chant on Saturday night, before the final whistle, was dedicated to the mayor who left them to die. The fans wouldn’t, fighting back, rebuilding everything under the presidency of Manuel Lafuente, literally all hands on deck. Supporters did everything: they swept and cleaned and fixed and turned up in numbers that the grounds they visited couldn’t always hold. They marched and protested. A team was built from scratch too, from those left in the academy. On Saturday the pregametifosaid it all: “Proud of never abandoning.”View image in fullscreenReal Oviedo supporters celebrate on a famous night.Photograph: JL Cereijido/EPANever. Fans wouldn’t let them die then or again in 2012, when they were on the edge of the abyss once more, Interpol looking for their owner, a warrant out for his arrest on a charge of fraud. In the fight, something was gained, something changed; a resistance, an identity, a cause. A shared issue, one last desperate throw of the dice, saved them that second time, new supporters joining old:36,962 shareholders in 86 countriesand thousands more in Oviedo, queues stretching round the stadium. Some of those were there on Saturday too: Ipswich and Portsmouth and Stoke fans who are Oviedo supporters too. One of those shareholders, among the biggest the club had, a symbol of the rescue, was wearing 8 on Saturday night.He had waited a long time, they all had. He had made it so, they all had. “It’s mad, ridiculous really that the best moment of my life is this at 40,” he said, looking out over a crowd that filled Avenida Galicia as fairs as they eye could see. “I have been lucky to love great things; I have won titles, cups, but I have suckled on Oviedo since I was a kid, the feeling here is different. This is unique.”Explore more on these topicsReal OviedoLa LigaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Asked if he would like to be teammates with Lamine Yamal, Rashford said: “Yes, for sure. Everyone wants to play with the best. Hopefully … we’ll see.” Barcelona’s sporting director, Deco, told the Catalan radio station RAC1 in May that the club like Rashford.Rashford, whose own breakthrough at United came as an 18-year-old, with four goals in two games against Denmark’s FC Midtjylland and Arsenal in February 2016, said: “It’s difficult to put into words what [Lamine Yamal] is doing because he’s not supposed to be doing that at 16 or 17. I don’t think we’ve seen that before.”Unitedare hoping to sell Rashford, frozen out by Ruben Amorim and loaned to Aston Villa in January, to fund further summer transfer business beyond the £62.5msigning of Matheus Cunha. Alejandro Garnacho is another who may be sold. For Rashford, contracted until 2027, having stated his time at United is at its end, the asking price is understood to be £40m.Despite a productive spell at Villa, including a throwback performance in the club’s Champions League near-miss against the eventual winners, Paris Saint-Germain, he is unlikely to return to Unai Emery’s club, who have profit and sustainability concerns after missing out on a return to the competition. “Spain is nice, and it’s not too far from home,” Rashford said.Barcelona have made a wide forward a priority, with Liverpool’s Luis Díazalso linked. “As wingers we only have Lamine and Raphinha, because Ferran [Torres] is becoming more and more a striker,” Deco said.The No 1 target is the Athletic Bilbao winger Nico Williams, 22, for whom a buyout clause is set at €58m (£49.7m), and Barça are willing to pay it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Personal terms are reported to be agreed, but Barça’s own, precarious PSR position may delay that deal until July. Deco said: “The fact that Nico and Lamine are friends is good. But this is not a club of friends. We come here to work and try to win.

Only two sets of residents seem oblivious to the weather; those heading to the spa and the Wales Women squad. It is late May and with Rhian Wilkinson’s players flying to Switzerland for Euro 2025 at the end of June far too much is at stake for anyone wearing a national tracksuit to be at a loose end.Charlie Estcourt has travelled to the sprawling Vale Resort from the US where she plays for Washington’s DC Power, but the midfielder is not about to succumb to jet lag. Instead, she is focused on impressing Wilkinson as the team trains at the Welsh’s FA’s centre of excellence within the hotel’s verdant grounds. “We have a no-excuses culture now,” says Estcourt. “It’s something Rhian’s brought in and it’s really helped us get to the next level.”That change enabledWales to qualify for their first major tournamentwhile opening a window to social change. “A really big thing for us as a collective is that we want to leave a legacy for Welsh women,” says Estcourt. “To create the sort of opportunities for girls growing up in Wales today that we never had.”View image in fullscreenCharlie Estcourt warms up at the Welsh FA’s Vale Resort.Photograph: Ashley Crowden/FAW/AlamyThe squad’s Euro 2025 slogan is “For us. For them. For her”. They are entering a formidable group containing England, France and the Netherlands motivated by a desire to reach the knockout phase for not just themselves and their families but every aspiring female footballer in Wales.“We want to show how empowering women’s football can be,” says Estcourt, speaking with the assured fluency of having completed a sports broadcasting degree. “One of the most amazing things about the game is all the people you meet, the places you visit, the connections you make. So we’re trying to do our bit to grow women’s football here. We go out to schools and when you talk to the young girls in their replica kits they’re so excited. We don’t want them to lose that feeling.”View image in fullscreenMembers of Urdd Gobaith Cymru, Wales’s largest youth organisation, with players Rhiannon Roberts and Olivia Clark at the summit of Yr Wyddfa, or Snowdon, after the Euro 2025 announcement.Photograph: Nick Potts/PATo place this in context, it is only recently that Wales Women acquired parity with the men’s team in terms of not merely equal pay but training facilities and support staff. The squad did not acquire their first full-time manager until 2010 and wore shirts with numbers but no names on the back until 2019. Dave Adams, the Football Association of Wales’s technical director, says “We’re doing a lot of catch-up. You’d hope your daughter would be afforded the same opportunities as your son.”In Wilkinson’s case, the personal and the political are inseparable. Although the Wales head coach was born and brought up in Quebec her mother is Welsh and her late father was English. Between 1989 and 1991, the family relocated from Montreal to their beloved south Wales. Y Bont Faen primary school in Cowbridge is six miles from the Vale Resort, but it is where the move soured when it barred Wilkinson and her sister from playing football, a sport they had enjoyed in Canada.Although her parents, in Wilkinson’s words, “went into battle for us and took on the governors” only minimal changes were made and the family, reluctantly, returned to Quebec because the girls “weren’t going to get the same opportunities here”.View image in fullscreenRhian Wilkinson views the Wales job as more akin to a crusade.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAFor Wilkinson, that parental sacrifice paid dividends in the form of 183 caps for Canada, two Olympic bronze medals and the foundation of a coaching career that peaked in 2022 when Portland Thorns won the US’s National Women’s Soccer League title.It also dictates that she views the Wales job as more akin to a crusade than a mere entry on a CV that briefly became clouded when she and a senior Portland player informed the club they shared a mutual attraction but had done nothing inappropriate. Although an investigation cleared the manager of any wrongdoing while exonerating her conduct, Wilkinson resigned during a sanctimonious social media storm.“I was completely vindicated, but I was very hurt. I was made an example of,” she said when becoming Wales coach in February 2024. “It was very public and very painful. Safeguarding is critical but when anyone’s investigated people assume they’ve done something wrong because there’s so much wrongdoing in sport.”Returning to Wales has proved restorative. “This is a special team,” she says. “They’re strong and don’t quit on each other. I’ve never been prouder. But my arrival maybe came just at the right time to ask these players to do things that in the past they weren’t ready for.”After a morning on the training pitches, her squad return to the Vale Resort for lunch before disappearing into a series of conference suites repurposed as video analysis studios and media rooms. When Jess Fishlock emerges from one meeting and walks down a staircase into a public lounge a couple of guests sitting in the lobby quietly nudge each other.Fishlock remains the team’s most recognisable face and her enduring presence is at the centre of preparations for Switzerland where she is convinced Wales will escape their group of death.At 38, the Seattle Reign midfielder remains world-class, with her on-field partnerships alongside the Wales captain, Angharad James, a Reign teammate, and the former Chelsea enforcer Sophie Ingle key to shocking Europe’s elite. “Jess is so important,” says Estcourt. “She’s so experienced, so knowledgable. On the pitch she’s invaluable; she controls the tempo, she brings goals, she brings assists. She also brings that calm head when things get a bit chaotic.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rhian’s made us very adaptable; we can change our style depending on who we’re playing and we understand all the different systems so well. We’re such a tight‑knit group. We chat all the time; that closeness definitely pushes us on.”Fast forward one month to 9am last Thursday and it seemed fitting that Wilkinson named her final 23-strong squad on the summit ofYr Wyddfa, or Snowdon. While her staff and media ascended by a tourist mini railway the Wales coach marched up in 90 minutes.Significantly, the squad’s meeting and dining rooms at the Vale Resort are routinely studded with pictures of the Welsh mountain superimposed with the team badge and a fixture list. The former Real Betis defender Rhiannon Roberts explains that as Euro 2025 qualifying games were ticked off the badge was regularly re-pinned on its climb towards the summit.View image in fullscreenWales’s Olivia Clark is interviewed at the summit of Yr Wyddfa.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAIf some of the squad were sceptical when Wilkinson introduced the Yr Wyddfa metaphor after taking charge, they are now looking forward to images of a Himalayan peak at the training camp on Portugal’s Algarve and, then, their Swiss tournament base near Lake Constance.“The mountain was used as a theme because qualifying was always going to be an uphill battle, with setbacks,” says Wilkinson, who has also introduced a mental performance coach and invited the Wales men’s manager, Craig Bellamy, to address her players.In recognition of the scale of the challenge ahead, the squad’s Swiss base is every bit as high end as any occupied by Bellamy’s players. A luxury hotel has been block-booked by the FAW and a purpose-built training ground media centre constructed along with a new gym and freshly laid pitches.As Estcourt reiterates, there are no excuses for underachievement. “We’re so inspired by what Wales men did in reaching the semi finals of Euro 2016,” she says. “They also went as underdogs and I think we might surprise a few people, too.”Explore more on these topicsWales women's football teamWomen's Euro 2025Women's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was unbelievably skilled.”Brook fell in search of his hundredth run, hooking Prasidh Krishna straight to deep backward square leg to become the 14th Englishman to be dismissed on 99 in a Test, scored off 112 balls. But Pope insisted that for all his disappointment his teammate would not regret his choice of shot at that crucial moment. “He was pretty gutted to get out but he plays that shot pretty well,” Pope said. “I think he’d look to either keep it down or hit it for six next time.”Brook had been dismissed off a no-ball before he had scored, and was also dropped on 46 and again on 82. “I think fate had decided 99 for him,” said Jasprit Bumrah, who ended England’s innings with a five‑fer but had also been responsible for the overstep that rescued Brook on Saturday evening.“Not to take any credit from him, he played really well. He plays an aggressive style of cricket, but he can play an aggressive shot and sometimes he can shut up shop as well and try to negate if someone is bowling a good spell. You have to be really accurate and really clear in your plans here because if you are a little wayward run-scoring becomes very quick.“So full credit to him, he played really well. We’ll try to hopefully have better plans and try to negate his plans in the next innings.”View image in fullscreenJasprit Bumrah claimed five England wickets.Photograph: Matt West/ShutterstockPope stated that England’s total showed that criticism of Ben Stokes’s decision at the toss to put India in to bat had been wide of the mark. “When you see a score like [India’s] you think we should have batted first, but I don’t think it was the wrong decision at all,” he said.“We were good on day one and didn’t get our rewards. On another day we might get a few more wickets. We know we’ve had some success chasing at this ground too, so it’s easy to look at it and say, ‘You’ve got to bat first,’ but hopefully it will play out in our favour in the end.”Late-innings runs might yet prove key, and while in their first innings India lost their last five wickets for 24, England’s added 189. “It’s really important, especially in England where the ball gets softer and the pitch is probably playing at its best, so there are definitely runs to be had,” Pope said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He admitted that the slope at Headingley – like the more famous one at Lord’s – can be hard for visiting players to deal with, with occasional no-balls a symptom of their unease.“Mostly in India we are used to playing on simple, flat grounds that are not slopey,” Bumrah said. “One side is up, one side is down and it’s a little tricky sometimes because you start from a place up high, then it goes steep, and then you go back up. So it can be difficult as a bowler to find rhythm.”Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025Harry BrookEngland cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

After a third day that was cut short by late rain but still packed with more incident than a stag do ­taking on the Otley Run, another classic could be bubbling up.At stumps, the long-expected drizzle having finally swept in with 30 minutes still to play, India were 90 for two and the happier of the two sides to call it a night. They had earlier seen their hopes of a sizable lead dashed by Harry Brook’s incendiary 99 and some ruinous drops, with England 465 all out and thus just six runs behind on first innings.England v India: first men’s cricket Test, day three – as it happenedRead moreEven with India’s lead then swollen to 96, the history at Headingley makes this series opener too tight to call. If the tourists had cause for encouragement during the ­evening session, it was how comfortable KL Rahul had looked, the opener cruising to an unbeaten 47 and ­sending seven fours whistling across this rapid, cambered outfield.But then England could feel pretty buoyant themselves, and not just courtesy of the Brook special that had taken them within ­touching ­distance of India’s 471 and sent Mohammed Siraj slightly batty in the process. The latest Dukes ball had been doing a fair bit out there and two precious strikes had already been pocketed.The first was a player to certainly see the back of, Yashasvi Jaiswal following his first innings 101 with a cheap edge behind off Brydon Carse. Although it was not until a late booming inswinger from Ben Stokes removed Sai Sudharsan for 30 that India’s momentum had been checked. It was a well worked plan, the ball chipped to mid-wicket, and meant Ben Duckett’s earlier drop off the left-hander was not costly.Regrets? India had more, not least Jasprit Bumrah oversteppinglate on the second eveningand gifting Brook a life before his account had even been opened. Add two more chances on 46 and 82 on the third day – Rishabh Pant missing a feather induced by Ravindra Jadeja, Jaiswal clanging another at slip to deny Bumrah – and it was hard to argue that Brook was unlucky to fall one run short of a ninth Test century.Not that the agony was any less for it, Brook hooking Prasidh Krishna down long leg’s throat and ­throwing his head back like a dad who had just stepped on a stray Lego brick. As the Western Terrace let out a sigh, Brook had become England’s 14th Test ­cricketer to suffer a 99 flake and the first since Jonny Bairstow at Old ­Trafford eight years ago. No one before Brook had done it on their home ground.View image in fullscreenHarry Brook cannot hide his frustration after missing out on a century.Photograph: Matt West/ShutterstockAs New Zealand will attest, ­having grassed five catches during his 171 in Christchurch last year, Brook is not a guy to let slip. And here, even before Ollie Pope had edged behind first thing on 106, the ­Yorkshireman was in one of his tub-thumping moods, crashing 11 fours, two sixes, and ­treating the second new ball like a chew toy. Rarely has a bat sticker felt more apt than the Major League Baseball logo on Brook’s blade, not least when he drilled the increasingly incensed Siraj into the Football Stand.Brook could and probably should have had a frontline batter alongside him when the box of fresh Dukes was brought out to the middle. Stokes had come and gone for 20 after poking Siraj behind. Jamie Smith then fell for 40 with just three deliveries to go before its arrival, victim of a smart relay catch on the rope but also a battle of egos with PrasidhKrishna that he lost. At 349 for six, still 122 runs in arrears, it felt like a hammer blow.Enter Chris Woakes, England’s insurance policy at No 8 and paying out with 38 runs and some diligent defence against the whiplashed threat of Bumrah. Stands of 49 with Brook and 55 with Carse were central to India’s eventual Rizla-thin lead, while back-to-back sixes off Krishna – one hook, one ­uppercut – took him past 2,000 Test runs. In his 58th Test, Woakes became the fourth fastest Englishman to ­combine this with 150-plus wickets, even if his tally of 181 victims is worryingly still to increase.In the end it took the return of Bumrah to prise out Woakes, the ball angling in and nipping through the gate. And when India’s spearhead repeated the dose to Josh Tongue and shut things down, he walked off with his 14th Test five-wicket haul secured. Five for 83 from ­Bumrah, five for 356 from the rest. With ­Shardul Thakur sending down just six of 100 overs, India may wish they had picked ­Kuldeep Yadav’s wrist-spin.As it is, the touring side will be ­hoping the odd bit of ­inconsistent bounce already witnessed only increases towards the back end of the match, likewise the extra bite that Jadeja and then Shoaib Bashir had begun to find.Either way, despite finding themselves the right side of two ­Headingley classics in recent times, England will also need to overcome the ­remarkable Bumrah – a fast bowler who is in a league of his own.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025India cricket teamEngland cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Logan van Beek pondered the Kookaburra ball: “In Australia and New Zealand [it] is a good ball – here it feels very different, because the wickets are a touch slower and it just seems to get soft more quickly.”There was also a maiden first‑class century for Joe Cracknell, asMiddlesexfought back from 33 for three – happily for their new first-team coach Dane Vilas – againstNorthamptonshireat the County Ground.It was an uncharacteristically smooth day forSomerset’s batters againstWarwickshireat Edgbaston, after the openers Tom Kohler Cadmore (104) and Josh Davey put on 186 for the first wicket.

It included the caption: “When myMLBhusband abandons us on Mothers Day a week after [this video was taken] once I finally found out about his affairs and stopped putting up with his abuse, so I’ve been raising two boys alone.”She added hashtags that included #divorce and #cheating.“Obviously, we’re aware of it. He told me about it last night,” Melvin told reporters on Saturday. “We’ve talked to MLB, and at this point, it’s in their jurisdiction so we can’t comment on it any further.”MLB investigates such cases as part of its Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy.Hjelle said after San Francisco’s 3-2 win over the Boston Red Sox on Saturday that he and his wife are in the process of divorcing.“I don’t have an official comment right now,” Hjelle told reporters. “I would like to actually talk with my agent, my lawyer. This has been something that’s been going on for over a year now in terms of our relationship and our divorce and our separation and everything ... I just want to talk to the appropriate people and figure out what the steps are. Just kind of taking it in stride right now.“So no comment right now. I feel confident saying that I will have one eventually. I don’t have an exact timeline on that, but I would like to actually get with the people that are handling the situation with me and for me before I actually make an official statement.”The 28-year-old is in his fourth season with the Giants. A right-handed reliever, he is 1-1 with a 4.66 ERA in six appearances. He remains eligible to pitch during the investigation.Explore more on these topicsSan Francisco GiantsMLBBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

We’re not going to forget that it’s almost nine months since the sad day it happened. He has been out for a long time. He’s getting better. He can play 20 minutes, 30 minutes at a time.

Guardiola said: “The only thing we want from John is to be fit – to do his lovely job, playing football, consistently, and in a different way to especially last season. It’s the only thing we want. The rest, his talent and ability will do it and we’re going to help him and I’m pretty sure he’s going to do the rest.“There is no [player] who wants it more – for the fact that it makes him happy. Because with John, we have been together for almost one decade – since I arrived, he arrived. The many good things and the sad things we lived together, we share. He’s a sensitive person. He’s an incredible human being. And I see him suffer because he cannot be working for ages and ages and ages. But the important thing now is at training he feels better. But again with the game, it’s another issue, another rhythm.”Guardiola also hinted that Ilkay Gündogan,who is a target for Galatasaray, could leave. “I don’t know anything, I didn’t speak with him, and if he will not be part of our squad he would not be here,” said the 54-year-old. “But at the same time, we have a long squad, too many players, so we cannot go with 26, 27 players this season because there would be more without playing. But right now, Ilkay is absolutely part of my mind and the team.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityClub World Cup 2025John StonesClub World CupUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The defender, who joined City in the summer of 2016, has never made more starts for the club than the 23 he made in his opening campaign.Jobe Bellingham strikes as Dortmund edge 4-3 thriller while Inter avoid shock at Club World CupRead moreIn the buildup to facing Al Ain in Sunday’s secondClub World Cupgroup game in Atlanta, Pep Guardiola again said he does not want a “long” squad, meaning he wants to reduce its number. This has caused speculation that Stones, who is out of contract next summer, could leave because of his chequered injury record. But he said: “I’m here, I want to stay here, I love it. I’m here to help the team, and I don’t know if what’s been said or speculated, but I hope that kind of shuts it down.”Stones admitted considering if he wanted to continue playing. “There’s been points where you think, you’ve been giving all this effort, you dedicate all your life, especially how I approach or go about my life, and football, I give everything, on and off the pitch to be here or be ready to play games and [there] are the dark days,” he said. “Everyone’s been through them and think: ‘Why is this happening?’“You wish it would have gone a different path. All of us have been through different upbringings and challenges through life and what did we do within those situations, was it fight or was it give up? I was a fighter from a young age, in difficult moments, you have to look at the bigger picture and realise what are your morals, what you believe in, and fight to make it worthwhile.”Stones is not yet match-fit to face Al Ain at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium. “I feel great and I’m excited to get going,” he said. “It’s difficult when you’re injured, you almost work longer and more, so from that aspect I know the guys mentally and physically have had such a long season, [but] I suppose mentally for me it’s been difficult dealing with the injuries and the process.“Now I’ve put that behind me and will use this as a mini-introduction back before the new season and another trophy for us to hopefully win and get some game-time.”Stones is unsure why there have been so many physical setbacks. “I don’t know what the reason is, and we’ve sat with the medical staff, sports science, to try and figure out why,” he said. “Some things can’t be explained. Which is even more testing mentally when there’s not really an answer.“I’ve been unlucky with some of the injuries that I’ve had, they were very rare last season, after speaking to specialists. Sometimes I think, why has it happened to me? But I’ve got to deal with that and move forward and try to adapt with how my body’s adapting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The videos are going viralKari PaulSun 22 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 14.53 EDTShareIn April of this year, Daisy Yelichek was scrollingTikTokwhen something unusual appeared in her feed: a video of her 84-year-old father, George Tsaftarides, who runs an account sharing sewing videos from his small tailoring business in Ohio. But the video Yelichek was seeing was not from Tsaftarides’ actual page, which has nearly 41,000 followers – but instead originated from a profile of someone claiming to be a “sad old man” whose cat sanctuary was at risk of shutting down.“Please stay 8 seconds so I don’t have to shut down my cat shelter I poured my love into,” the text on the video said, adding that the sanctuary would be selling slippers to raise additional funds. The bid for sympathy worked on many viewers, garnering millions of views and tens of thousands of users leaving concerned comments. “Just ordered two! Sending love to these kittens,” wrote one. Another commenter said: “thank you for all you do for these babies.” Others even asked if there was a GoFundMe link to donate directly to the cat shelter.Yelichek and her father were shocked. Tsaftarides does not run a shelter. The account posting the plea for funds appears to be a front for a scheme seeking to sell mass-produced slippers. Several of Tsaftarides’ followers who actually ordered slippers complained that the fuzzy footwear came with “made in China” tags and did not, in fact, appear to be handmade by an elderly man with a struggling cat sanctuary.“These people are using my identity to make money and I don’t understand why,” Tsaftarides said. “It’s thieving, it’s stealing, and it’s not right.”Social media overtakes TV as main source of news in US, analysis findsRead moreTsaftarides is not the onlyTikTokuser who has had his likeness hijacked by such accounts. Charles Ray, an 85-year-old retiree based in Michigan, has also been targeted by accounts using doctored videos of his likeness. He started his actual TikTok account in January and uses it to share jokes with his followers.“Earlier this year, my pastor told me a joke about a frog, and I thought, ‘that ought to make people smile,’ so I figured out how to make an account and told the joke, and it took off from there,” he said.Ray’s videos all follow a similar template: filmed in selfie mode, he tells a short joke. He was frustrated to learn his content, which he makes only to “share joy” and not to earn money, was being lifted and edited to scam people. In one video, Ray is rubbing his eye, and the repost seems to imply he is crying. Another video uses a clip from a woman crying on TikTok about an unrelated issue, and another includes a user in a hospital bed.Since she first discovered the proliferation and manipulation of her father’s face, Yelichek has identified more than 100 accounts splicing his videos with other, unrelated users to sell mass-produced goods including slippers, headphone cases and blankets – all under the guise of independent sellers that need help. Some two dozen Instagram accounts and YouTube as well as a handful were pulling the same trick, according to a list compiled by Yelichek and a review of the accounts by the Guardian.At one point, Yelichek even made contact with the account manipulating her father’s likeness over direct message and pleaded with its owner to stop. The person behind the account claimed to be a poor 17-year-old boy based in Greece trying to make money for his family.“I totally understand your situation but I also want you to understand mine,” he said, proceeding to post more stolen videos.The con replicates arecurring genre of videoon TikTok that has boosted sales for some small businesses: user makes a heartfelt post about a local store or restaurant that is struggling, and online followers are moved to support it. One typical post mimicking a local plea for help reads: “Please just stay 15 seconds to save my pawpaw’s slipper small business.”In the case of videos Yelichek is seeing, many commenters who are moved by the fake story try to boost it by commenting names of celebrities and creating other engagement they believe TikTok prioritizes. “Fun fact,” a comment on one video of the type reads, this one using the same formula but claiming to be a struggling cow sanctuary. “Liking and replying to comments boosts more! Referencing popular things like Chappell Roan and Taylor Swift puts this video on the [for you page] of more people.” The video pulled in 1.4m likes and 26,000 comments before being taken down. Yelichek says these accounts lift videos from other TikTok users as well and recontextualize them to create a false narrative.Tsaftarides said his content being used to sell mass-produced goods is particularly frustrating, as he started his account to promote small businesses, including his own, and to encourage people to shop locally.“All we want to do is show people our store and teach them about sewing,” he said. “We don’t make money off of our TikTok account.”Yelichek said she and her father filed a police report to Jackson township police in Ohio, where their store is based, for identity theft and have made great efforts to get social networks to take the stolen content down – often to no avail. Yelichek said that while Instagram has removed a few of the profiles she reported, TikTok – the platform where the issue is more widespread – has been less responsive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Like Yelichek, some comments say that TikTok responds to their reports of a video by saying it does not violate its community guidelines.TikTok said in a statement that its community guidelines do, in fact, prohibit impersonation accounts and content that violates others’ intellectual property rights. Reports of copyright infringement concerns may require proof of ownership, including links to the original content and links to infringing content. Meta similarly stated itsInstagram terms of usedo not allow posting content that violates someone else’sintellectual property rights, including copyright and trademarks, and that violations can be reported on Instagram’shelp page.Ray, the 85-year-old jokester, said he tried reporting the videos to TikTok but got responses that the content he had flagged did not violate TikTok’s community standards. Like Yelichek, he said his comments on the videos alerting followers to the scam were frequently removed, and that he gets “no help from TikTok” and does not know how to further communicate with the company.Teenage girls’ TikTok skincare regimes offer little to no benefit, research showsRead moreTikTok said in a statement that it continuously takes action against such copyright violations. It added that 94% of all content removed for violating community guidelines on fake engagement in the fourth quarter of last year was removed proactively rather than in response to reports.Meanwhile, some users are catching on to this particular kind of sadness bait – with recent videosgoing viralalerting people to the fact that the posts begging for help with failing cat shelters, cow farms and other heart-wrenching fictions are not real.Though awareness may spread, the impersonating videos remain available. In lieu of takedowns, Ray said he has decided to continue to make his videos because many of his 13,000 followers have told him they look forward to his posts each day.“With everything that’s going on nowadays, people need to smile,” he said. “If my followers smile, even for a minute, they’ve forgotten their troubles for a minute. So that’s all I try to do – to make people smile. This is not going to stop me.”Explore more on these topicsTikTokSocial mediaOlder peopleDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is it actually fun, or just a bit like homework?Caitlin WelshSun 22 Jun 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 20.15 EDTShareThere are two kinds of readers: those who would choose death before dog-ears, keeping their beloved volumes as pristine as possible, and those whose books bear the marks of a life well read, corners folded in on favourite pages and with snarky or swoony commentary scrawled in the margins. The two rarely combine in one person, and they definitely don’t lend each other books. But a new generation of readers are finding a way to combine both approaches: reviving the art and romance of marginalia, by transforming their books and reading experiences into #aesthetic artifacts.“I keep seeing people who have books like this,”says one TikToker, their head floating over a greenscreened video of fat novels bristling with coloured sticky tabs. “What are you doing? Explain yourselves! Because this looks likehomework. But also … I do like office supplies.”Novel crimes: which is worst – folded corners, cracked spines, marginalia or cheese bookmarks?Read moreInBookTokand Bookstagram communities – where social media users post reviews, recommendations and memes about reading – there are subcommunities devoted just to annotating and “tabbing” books. The level of intensity and commitment varies; some BookTokkers have complex colour-coding systems (pink tabs and highlighters for romantic moments, blue for foreshadowing) or rules that are simply aesthetically pleasing. Some scribble in the margins to mark moments that are especially shocking or satisfying, or draw droplets or hearts around especially sexy passages. For some, annotation is as essential now as sharing shelfies or writing reviews.Marcela, a Melbourne-based Bookstagrammer originally from the US, posts about her reading habits online as@booksta.babe. She began doing it last year after more than a decade of being active in fantasy and young adult fandoms, as well as “studygram” and other groups dedicated to beautiful-looking and complex notes and lists, created on nice stationery.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

Now she annotates usingcolour-coordinated tabs and pens, in addition to herreading journals. She is selective with which books she puts this extra work into, sticking mostly to stories she knows she’ll reread – such as her current annotation project, Sarah J Maas’ Throne of Glass series.“It has really helped me enjoy the rich world-building and character development even more,” Marcela says. “You can clearly see my opinions on characters shift by following through my notes, and I love being able to refer back and see plot predictions I made at the beginning of the series either come true or be proven wrong.”The dominant fandoms represented in the annotating and tabbing communities, as they are on BookTok and Bookstagram more broadly, are the booming romance and romantasy genres. Academic and author Dr Jodi McAlister says this is in large part because of the mainstream success of bestsellers such as Emily Henry, Ali Hazelwood’s elevated-fanfic hit The Love Hypothesis, and Maas’ A Court Of Thorns and Roses series, which has helped to dispel much of the stigma that used to exist around reading romance novels. Fans are still working out ways to perform their fandom and find community, much in the same the way sci-fi and fantasy readers have been doing for decades.View image in fullscreenTikTok user Angel Zheng annotating books.Composite: Guardian Design/Angel Zheng/@angelzzheng“This is a community that is still figuring out what reading romance looks like in public because they haven’t had a model, and one of the ways it has manifested is this performance of love of the physical object of the book,” McAlister says; her latest romance novel, An Academic Affair, even includes a male scholar who “annotates his books like a BookTok girlie”.“When we think about the way that romance has been denigrated as trash for so long, what they’re doing is performatively turning it into this incredibly treasured, incredibly valued object … by annotating it, you’re making thatyourcopy, you are memorialising your experience of it,” she adds.It is what her fellow scholar Jessica Pressman calls“bookishness”: a post-digital behaviour that has developed among passionate readers. But that is not to say it is purely performative: annotating a novel can allow us to retrace our first journey with a book, as well as revisit our state of mind at the time. I think of the last book that made me cry,Meg Mason’s Sorrow and Bliss– what would my marginalia have looked like when I read it back in 2021, sobbing through the final pages at the reflections of my own struggles with mental illness? What would I see now in the notes I’d made then?Why Marlene Dietrich’s witty marginalia only add to her appeal | Steven PooleRead moreAnnotation has also become a way of connecting: some BookTokkers lavishly annotate a copy of their friend’s favourite book as a gift, stacking the margins with observations and jokes; Marcela is excitedly planning to do this for her best friend. A dear friend of mine inherited the habit from his late mother and he now treasures the precious “scribblings” in the margins of her history and poetry books. Some people specifically seek out books annotated by other readers in secondhand shops – a spark of connection with the past – or even by their authors; last year, Ann Patchett released an annotated edition of her novel Bel Canto,though she warnedthat with “constant interruptions” and spoilers it was not designed to be anyone’s first experience. But annotating her own work, she wrote, revealed “patterns in the book I’d scarcely been aware of … it helped me clarify the way I write”.I’m like McAlister, who says that while she annotates her academic reading, well, like an academic, she’s usually too immersed in books to annotate for fun. But this week I sat down with a pencil and got stuck into a biography of John and Sunday Reed I’d been passing over for more escapist fare. And I did, in fact, find myself jotting exclamation points in the margins at salacious details and scribbling in my judgy little asides as though I was whispering to a friend.If it feels a little like homework, maybe that’s not a bad thing. Even reading for fun alone could still be enhanced by the intentionality and slower pace required for annotation; the extra few seconds it takes to draw a star next to an especially satisfying paragraph lets you sit in that satisfaction, just a moment longer.Explore more on these topicsBooksTikTokInstagramfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Never Too Small is a media company that makes a magazine and an online documentary series dedicated “to small footprint design and living”. To me, Never Too Small is “the company that makes my favourite television show, which I watch while eating toast”.Episodes go live weekly and there are more than 100. Their length (generally less than 10 minutes) is perfect. The soothing graphics of ancient buildings and bustling metropolitan streets are so chic. The minimal music will make you feel as though your insides are in a warm bath. When you start watching these videos, you realise you need more than 100. Suddenly 100 feels like three. It’s like discovering chocolate for the first time then being told that it’s only a “sometimes” food.Am I gay? Take this quiz to find out (or not)Read moreOstensibly the series is meant to demonstrate that humans don’t actually need to build massive cathedrals to be comfortable. This is a fascinating message to receive in Australia, where we’re told daily that if we don’t own property on a parcel of land that takes a day and a half to trot across, we may as well be dead. (We have either Banjo Patterson or McLeod’s Daughters to blame.) Even the guy from Grand Designs saidAustralia’s obsession with huge houses is revolting! Well, he didn’t use those exact words but it was something like that. Never Too Small shows us that people around the world are taking tiny townhouses and shoebox apartments and making better homesteads than those McLeod girls could have dreamed of.Now, I love Never Too Small. I love things that are small. I want to fold myself up into sixteenths and place myself into an envelope and post myself off in a (tiny) letterbox belonging to a bunny in a minuscule beret. I gotta say, though: some of these homes do not feel small!“Is this small?” I’ll sometimes ask my partner, while we’re eating our toast. “Is this small?” he’ll say back because neither of us really know. What is small? Is small a trick of the mind? Some of these places have courtyards!Looking at the square footage – which is helpfully disclosed at the start of each video – theyareactually quite small. “I live in a small house and I don’t crow about it,” you might be thinking, but do you have a Wes Anderson-inspired display of precious stones? What about an airy community library? Or a cabin that separates in two so you can sleep under the stars (but still in your bed, you’re not a caveman)?

Sometimes there’s no bath, no oven, but there is a climbing wall.The subjects wear carefully steamed clothes, artful sneakers and have interesting jobs. Even their pets seem to know more about life than I ever will (you can just tell, something about the arch of the eyebrow). “When we host dinner parties, we can pull this custom bench seat out and accommodate eight to 10 people,” they say, gesturing to the most beautiful block of wood you’ve ever seen. Imagine being the sort of person who hosts dinner parties! Imagine knowing eight to 10 people!The writer, scientist and serious-looking guy Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once wrote: “He is happiest, be he king or peasant, who finds peace in his home.” Which, sure.

Adolescence, she says, has become like the wild westSun 22 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTShareReactions to Lauren Greenfield’s documentary seriesSocial Studiestend to fall into two categories. Young people think it is validating; adults think it’s a horror show. After all, the screen of a teenager’s smartphone is a shiny black hole to which access is rarely granted. “Our kids are right there,” as Greenfield puts it, “and yet we don’t really know what’s going on in their lives.”Her five-part series, which tracks the online and offline lives of a group of teenagers and young adults – the first generation of social media natives – is beingtipped for an Emmy. Under the noses of their parents, she captures teenagers climbing out of bedroom windows to spend the night with boyfriends, posting sexually explicit images, tracking their longest-ever fast (91 hours) and living out their experiences of rape, cyberbullying, whitewashing, the tyranny of Caucasian beauty standards and suicidal ideation. She makes adolescence look like the wild west.I was blaming my son for his screen time, and ended up feeling that’s like blaming an opium addict for their addiction“I really tried to go into this as a social experiment,” says Greenfield, speaking on a video call from the Fahey/Klein Gallery in Los Angeles, which is hosting a Social Studiesphotographic exhibitionuntil July. Initially she conducted more than 200 mini-interviews in high schools in LA, and then whittled these down to a cohort of about 25, who let her shoot them at home, at school, at parties, and in discussion groups over the course of the 2021-22 high school year. Crucially, they agreed to screen record, thereby sharing their online lives with Greenfield in real time. The result is a frenetic, immersive collage of a documentary, in which screens are overlaid on in-person lives. It is sometimes hard to keep pace, and hard to know where to look – but that is the point.Greenfield started out in anthropology; her first commission was for National Geographic, photographing Maya people in Mexico. Her mother, Patricia Marks Greenfield, a psychologist, was the writer. But after the project was dropped, she turned her gaze closer to home, to LA, where she grew up. Since her first monograph,Fast Forward: Growing Up in the Shadow of Hollywood, her work has focused on consumerism, extreme wealth, addiction and youth culture.The idea for Social Studies partly came from observing her youngest son Gabriel’s phone habits. He was 14 when she started filming the series. “We had constant battles about screen time.” Arguments? “Yes,” she says. “I never could control his access or see the content on his phone. He was super private about his phone, which is probably why I was so obsessed with getting into phones and really seeing what was in there.”View image in fullscreenGoing viral … Bella and Holly in Social Studies.Photograph: Lauren Greenfield/Institute/FXAlongside about 1,000 hours of documentary footage, Greenfield also captured 2,000 hours of screen-recorded content. Her son “helped to figure out the tech”. He was a year younger than most of the young people featured – and filming was personally confronting for Greenfield as a parent. Not least when she ran into him at a party she was filming.Making Social Studies has triggered her own evolution as a parent. “I was blaming my son for his screen time,” she says. “And I ended up feeling that’s like blaming an opium addict for their addiction.Social mediais made to be addictive – purposefully, for maximum engagement, and without any concern for the consequences.” Social Studies “brought me together with my teenager”, she says.Greenfield has previously said that she went into her 2002 monographGirl Culturewith an open mind “and came out a feminist”. (She later directed the#LikeAGirlSuper Bowl commercial.) Was the experience of filming Social Studies transformative too? Did she come out an activist?“I definitely came out thinking that we were giving a very unsafe environment to our young people and we needed to do something about it,” she says. “I did come out of it wanting to spread the word, raise awareness. It’s about collective action.”She hadn’t planned to include parents, which is interesting because those who do feature come off pretty badly. “All of the parents?” she asks me. All except Vito, who lovingly supports his children through transition and alternative education. But others come across as missing in action or nonplussed. A mother, whose daughter films thirst traps in her bedroom, says: “I really don’t want to look at Sydney’s TikTok.” A father stops his daughter using the app – by paying her $50 a day.View image in fullscreenRevelation after revelation … Lauren Greenfield at the Fahey Klein Gallery.Photograph: Jessica Pons/The Guardian“But they really represent all of us,” Greenfield says. “And not in a way where we can point a finger at them, but in a way where hopefully we are urged to reflect on ourselves. I mean, I didn’t know a lot of the questions to ask my own kids until I did this project.” When working on the project, she would go home and ask her sons – the eldest was 20 and already at college – “Have you heard of this BDSM trend?”For all the devastating revelations, there is humour here, too, as when one female participant says: “We don’t judge each other for [foot pics] but we also don’t feel super-empowered.” It is hard to tell if the teenagers are incredibly worldly or incredibly naive. “You start a TikTok to be in that TV show, movie-type life where everything comes easy for you,” says 17-year-old Keshawn, who soon after becomes a father.The shadow of Kim Kardashian looms large. Fittingly, her career tracks the arc of Greenfield’s own, since Greenfield shot a then unknown 12-year-old Kardashian for Fast Forward. In Social Studies, to nods of agreement, one girl announces: “I would release a sex tape if it made me viral.”Into the vacuum of adult regulation young people step, such as 20-year-old vigilante Anthony, who collects evidence from victims of assault and outs the perpetrators on social media. As he says, wisely and dispassionately: “I’m part of cancel culture. It kind of works. It kind of doesn’t work.”Greenfield implicates herself in the dynamic of absent adults. She asks the teenagers questions such as “Who here has been sent a dick pic? Who has gone viral?” (Pretty much everyone.) Dressed in unobtrusive navy, she is a peripheral presence, and the only adult hearing, receiving, capturing revelation after revelation.When kids set their parents’ screen time rules: ‘I hit my limit before I even get out of bed’Read moreShe initially thought about casting a therapist or teacher but “I realised it had to be me.” Though, she says: “I don’t like being in an authoritarian role at all.” Indeed, her presence sometimes feels like an absence, as when Sofia recounts her experience of being raped. Anthony helped her to gather evidence, but she hadn’t felt heard and validated by adults. In the most moving scene, Sydney reaches out and hooks Sofia’s fingers with her own.I wonder how Greenfield felt hearing a young woman share her experience of rape. Her attentive silence, while Sofia weeps, is notable. “Don’t I say, ‘Are you OK?’ and she says ‘Yeah, I’m OK’?” she asks.Greenfield does ask “OK?”, but as check-ins go, it’s pretty minimal. Given that she’s a parent, did it feel hard not to step into the space of the circle? “I mean, I thinkthatfelt very natural. If I could have avoided being in it altogether, I would have,” she says.So she didn’t go home burdened by the emotional weight of the stories she had documented?“It’s an interesting question.” She pauses. “I really love doing this work. It is so hard to get access and gain trust. When I’m hearing the stories, I’m so … fulfilled. My frustration is often if I can’t tell the story. When I can actually tell it, I’m so happy. A lot of the young people participated because they wanted to tell a story. And they got to tell that story.”View image in fullscreenVeronika, Tiffany and Michael on their way to the prom in Greenfield’s documentary Generation Wealth.Photograph: Lauren Greenfield/Courtesy of the Fahey/Klein GalleryGreenfield has also documented her own addiction to work. At one point in 2018’sGeneration Wealth, her 16-year-old son Noah tells her she’s a workaholic and a 10-year-old Gabriel holds up a piece of paper to the ever-present camera that says: “You have a problem.”In Social Studies, there is a sense in which Greenfield is present as a person who intimately knows, and was herself a childhood victim of, the addictive comparison culture she documents. In Girl Culture, she writes about her experience, aged six, of looking in the mirror and “realising that I was unimaginably ugly, and crying hysterically. I understood the pain and shame of not measuring up as a girl.” Maybe this girl, too, is in the circle in Social Studies.“That was also when my parents were splitting up,” she says. “So I think that was … maybe my origin trauma.” She would have found social media very hard as a teen. “I was super insecure as a teenager about my body, about fashion, about fitting in. And I was really looking to other kids. So I zeroed in on this [in Social Studies]. I think the 24/7 comparison culture is not just the end of innocence but the end of joy. You’re never happy with yourself.”It’s a trap to blame parents. The tech companies could make this completely different if they wanted to“What keeps me honest in my work is really coming from things that have affected me,” Greenfield says. Honesty is her medium – but not for too long on the subject of herself. When I ask about her arguments with her son, she says: “I feel it’s a trap to blame the parents. Really, the tech companies could make this completely different if they wanted to. These [apps] are made by humans, engineered to do exactly what they’re doing. They know so well what kids love, what will addict kids, they even know brain science, which I think used to be unethical – to use brain science in the creation of products for young people. We know from theTikTok research that was leakedthat [the app] is addictive in less than 35 minutes.“And I was really struck when I saw last year the Jim Henson movie, Idea Man,” she says. “The founder of Sesame Street – Joan Ganz Cooney – is talking about how they brought together artists who knew what kids loved – like Henson and the Muppet people – with educators who knew what kids needed to learn, and knew what was good for kids. And I was so moved by that,” she says. “It almost makes me want to cry.” Given her unflinching calm in the most emotional documentary scenes, I am surprised to see that her eyes are pink and she looks as if she really might cry. “Because it’s another time. When people cared about what young people were getting.”View image in fullscreenSydney in Social Studies.Photograph: Lauren Greenfield/FX/InstituteA few weeks ago, shewent to Sacramentowith some of Social Studies’ protagonists, to talk to senators. She has taken the series into schools. “I do feel [making Social Studies] has activated me,” she says.She mentions how the Australian government has banned social media for under-16s, and Common Sense Media’s campaign forhealth warnings on platforms. As Sydney points out in the series, once governments knew the dangers of smoking, they applied warnings. “In the US, it is unlikely that [regulation] will be done by government or tech, but there is a critical mass of parents and educators who are getting concerned,” Greenfield says.In the final episode of Social Studies, the group reflects on the experience of taking part. For many, holding a conversation without a phone – they had to leave them in a different room – was a rare liberation. “We all need to delete social media!” someone says – to the biggest round of applause. But the handclaps falter under existential questioning: “How do you get off social media without people forgetting that you exist?”We’ve given our communication to companies that are just thinking about their own profit“That really resonated with me,” Greenfield says. “They are showing us there’s a problem. They’re giving us a roadmap for how to solve it. But they can’t solve it on their own.” So what’s the roadmap? “We’ve given our communication to companies that not only don’t have our best interests in mind and are just thinking about their own profit but maybe have a political agenda. And that is terrifying. We need an independent form of communication where our information is not being marketed, sold.”Some kind of public platform, like a public utility? “Exactly. It’s a radical move to just say, ‘I’ll be off of [social media].’ As a person in the world, I can’t be off of it, either.” A public-service communication platform sounds like a pipe dream. Is it possible? “I feel like my job is to let people know what’s going on. I’m not a tech entrepreneur so I don’t know if it’s possible,” she says.But she is too invested to leave it there. “I do think it’s possible, actually,” she adds. “I absolutely think it is possible.”Social Studies is streaming on Disney+Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsLauren GreenfieldSocial mediaSmartphonesChildrenMobile phonesDigital mediainterviewsShareReuse this content"

Now history is repeating itselfSun 22 Jun 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 19.57 EDTShareIn May 2003, George W Bush landed on the deck of a US aircraft carrier to deliver a triumphant speech, declaring that majorcombat operations in Iraqhad ended – six weeks after he had ordered US troops to invade the country. Bush spoke under a now infamous banner on the carrier’s bridge that proclaimed, “Mission Accomplished”. It would turn into a case study of American hubris and one of the most mocked photo-ops in modern history.As Bush made his speech off the coast of San Diego, I was in Baghdad covering the invasion’s aftermath as a correspondent for a US newspaper. It was clear then that the war was far from over, and the US was likely to face a grinding insurgency led by former members of the Iraqi security forces. It would also soon become clear that Bush’s rationale for invading Iraq was built on a lie: Saddam Hussein’s regime did not haveweapons of mass destructionand was not intent on developing them. And Iraq had nothing to do with the September 11 terrorist attacks on the US, despite the Bush administration’s repeated attempts toconnect Hussein’s regimeto al-Qaida.Today,Donald Trumphas dragged the US into another war based on exaggerations and manipulated intelligence: the Israel-Iran conflict, which began on 13 June when Israel launched a surprise attack killing some of Iran’s top military officials and nuclear scientists, and bombing dozens of targets across the country.The Guardian view on Trump bombing Iran: an illegal and reckless act | EditorialRead moreThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, claimed that Israel had to attack because Tehran was working to weaponize its stockpile of enriched uranium and racing to build a nuclear bomb. “If not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time,”Netanyahu said, as the first wave of Israeli bombs fell on Iran. “It could be a year. It could be within a few months.”Before dawn on Sunday, US warplanes and submarines bombed three major nuclear facilities inIran. In a speech from the White House, Trump declared the operation a “spectacular military success” and said the sites had been “totally obliterated”. Trump added that his goal was to stop “the nuclear threat posed by the world’s number one state sponsor of terror”.But does Iran pose the immediate threat that Netanyahu and Trump have claimed?US intelligence officials, along with the UN’s nuclear watchdog and independent experts, say that while Iran has dramatically increased its supply of uranium enriched to nearly weapons grade, there is no evidence it has taken steps to produce a nuclear weapon. In March, the US director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard,told Congressthat America’s intelligence agencies continued “to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon”. She added that Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, “has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003”.Gabbard also noted that Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium was “at its highest levels” and “unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons”. That’s largely because, in 2018,Trump unilaterally withdrewthe US from the Iran nuclear deal that was negotiated in 2015 between Tehran and six world powers. Under that agreement, Iran agreed to limit its uranium enrichment in exchange for relief from international sanctions. A few years after Trump tore up the deal that was signed by his predecessor, Barack Obama, Iran began to enrich uraniumup to 60% purity– a short step away from the 90% level required for a nuclear device.Still, in a report issued last month, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN watchdog that has monitored Iran’s main nuclear enrichment sites for years, said it found no evidence that Tehran was actively developing a weapons program. The agencycriticized Iranian officialsfor failing to provide access to some sites and to cooperate with UN inspectors, especially over Tehran’s past secret nuclear weapons program, which is believed to have ended by 2003. Despite these criticisms, theIAEA report saidit had “no credible indications of an ongoing, undeclared structured nuclear program”.Recent US intelligence assessments found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon and was up tothree years awayfrom being able to develop an actual warhead and deploy it on a missile. (Under pressure from Trump, who said twice last week that Gabbard’s testimony to Congress in March was “wrong”, the intelligence chief changed course on Friday to say that Irancould producea nuclear weapon “within weeks to months”.)Of course, there’s one state in the Middle East that has an active nuclear weapons program: Israel, which doesn’t acknowledge having anuclear arsenal. But in January, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute identified Israel as one of the world’s nine nuclear-armed states, and estimated that it currently has90 warheads.Despite all the evidence to the contrary, Netanyahu continues to insist that Iran was dashing to produce a nuclear weapon. “The intel we got and we shared with the United States was absolutely clear – was absolutely clear – that they [the Iranians] were working in a secret plan to weaponize the uranium,”Netanyahu toldthe Fox News anchor Bret Baier (who hosts one of Trump’s favorite news shows) inan interviewon 15 June. “They were marching very quickly. They would achieve a test device and possibly an initial device within months and certainly less than a year.”Netanyahu’s statements echo the exaggerated intelligence and sense of fear peddled by the Bush administration ahead of the US invasion of Iraq – and it’s exactly the kind of open-ended conflict based on lies that Trump promised voters he would avoid as president. In September 2002, Bush’s national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, said in aCNN interviewthat “there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly” the Iraqi regime could acquire nuclear weapons. “But we don’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud,” she added in a reference that would be repeated by other US officials, includingBush himself.Not surprisingly, Netanyahu had also lobbied the Bush administration to attack Iraq – and insisted that the Iraqi regime was developing a nuclear bomb. After his first term as Israel’s prime minister,Netanyahu testifiedbefore Congress as a private citizen in September 2002, warning of the danger posed by a nuclear-armed Iraq. “There is no question whatsoever that Saddam is seeking and is working and is advancing toward the development of nuclear weapons,” Netanyahu confidentlytold Congress. He added: “Once Saddam has nuclear weapons, the terror network will have nuclear weapons.”Netanyahu, who has always had a flair for the extravagant soundbite, also claimed that Hussein no longer needed one large reactor to produce nuclear fuel, but could do so “in centrifuges the size of washing machines” that could be hidden throughout Iraq.The Israeli leader was not only wrong about Hussein developing weapons of mass destruction, but he also insisted that a US war on Iraq would be a boon for the Middle East and would inspire Iranians to rise up against the Islamic republic. “If you take out Saddam’s regime, I guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region,”Netanyahu said. “I think that people sitting right nextdoor in Iran, young people and many others, will say the time of such regimes, of such despots, is gone.”It’s also important to remember that Netanyahu has practically made a career out of warning that Iran is years (or months) away from developing nukes. Over the past 30 years, he regularly issuedsome variationon this threat – and often wildly overestimated how close Iran was to having a bomb. In 1992, as a member of Israel’s Knesset, Netanyahu cautioned that Iran was “three to five years” away from developing a nuclear weapons capability. In 1996, as prime minister, he addressed a joint session of Congress andurged the USto “stop the nuclearization of terrorist states”. He added, “The deadline for attaining this goal is getting extremely close.”In February 2009, as leader of the Likud party and a candidate for prime minister, Netanyahu told a congressional delegation visiting Israel that Iran was “probably only one or two years away” from developing a nuclear weapons capability – attributing the claim to Israeli “experts” without offering other evidence. The conversation was summarized in a US state department cablereleased by WikiLeaks.Later in 2009, when he was back in office as premier,another leaked cablerevealed that Netanyahu told a separate group of visiting members of Congress that “Iran has the capability now to make one bomb” or it “could wait and make several bombs in a year or two”.No matter what Trump says, the US has gone to war – and there will be profound and lasting consequences | Simon TisdallRead moreBut the most memorable example of Netanyahu exaggerating the threat of Iran’s ability to develop a nuclear weapon came in September 2012, when the Israeli leader took tothe UN general assemblypodium armed with a cartoon-style drawing of a bomb with a lit fuse. Netanyahu warned the world that Iran was enriching uranium so quickly that it was on track to be able to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear devicewithin months. He then used a marker pen to draw a red line across the cartoon bomb, to highlight the stage of the nuclear process where he claimed Iran had to be stopped. Netanyahu warned that Iran could produce a working weapon by thefollowing springor “at most by next summer”.Nearly 13 years after Netanyahu stood before the world to cry wolf about Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons, he used the same pretext – that Iran is“within a few months”of having a bomb – to launch a devastating war against Tehran. Netanyahu then successfully pulled the US into the conflict, promising Trump a quick victory if the US used its 30,000-poundbunker buster bombsto destroy Fordow, Iran’s most heavily fortified nuclear facility.Unfortunately, Trump heeded the siren call of a US ally who has spent decades manipulating intelligence and public fears to exaggerate the nuclear threat posed by Iran. And the people of the Middle East will pay the highest price for yet another reckless war built on a lie.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies and an associate professor of journalism at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyOpinionDonald TrumpIrancommentShareReuse this content"

He may imagine he has scored an easy win, but the world is likely to pay a steep priceSun 22 Jun 2025 13.11 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 21.30 EDTShareDonald Trump was predictably quick to claim victory followingthe illegalUS strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities: “Completely and totally obliterated,” he crowed. Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel and sycophants at home rushed to fawn over his “courageous” and “brilliant” decision. The most senior US military official, Dan Caine, offered amore muted assessment: it was “way too early” to know the full outcome despite severe damage. We cannot yet know whether the blow has ended Iran’s nuclear aspirations – or will spur it to pursue the bomb. It may be weeks or months, too, before Iranian retaliation plays out, with all its potential repercussions.Two nuclear-armed states have gone to war on the unevidenced claim that a third state is on the verge of acquiring its own nuclear arms. In March, the US director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, said Iran was not building weapons (though she has now scrambled to align with Mr Trump).Israelis clear that its attacks will continue, and has increasingly talked of regime change. The price is being paid not only by a reviled regime but by the Iranian people.Senior administration figures insisted that the US is solely focused on the nuclear programme. As a candidate, Mr Trump vowed to “stop the chaos in the Middle East” and “prevent world war three”. Yet the risk of regional conflagration is growing, and now he warns of “either peace or … tragedy for Iran” if it does not end uranium enrichment. Mr Netanyahulured him into this attackand may lead him into more, paying gushing tribute to a history-making president and thanking him on behalf of “the forces of civilisation”. Mr Trump described them as working together “like perhaps no team has ever worked before”.Iran has been notably cautious since Israel’s attack began. The pillars of its security – its regional networks, missiles and nuclear programme – haveall suffered punishing blows. To do nothing invites further attack; to hit back – particularly by targeting US personnel in the region – courts disaster. Closethe strait of Hormuzand oil prices would soar. But that would hit Iran’s own exports and risk involving Gulf states. Russia and China condemned the US strike but are hardly rushing to offer Tehran assistance.Israel’s strike – and the US’s – on Iran cannot bejustifiedunder international law’s self-defence doctrine. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, rightly warns of catastrophe in the Middle East, urging diplomacy as the only solution. Yet Mr Trump walked away from the Obama-overseen deal that slowed Iran’s programme, and now has struck Iran when it sought negotiation despite Israel’s attacks. Sir Keir Starmer, too,called for de-escalation and negotiation, though he backed the US strike. The US did not request British assistance – but the fear remains that European powers may be drawn into another criminal and disastrous war in the Middle East.In rejecting diplomacy and choosing war, not only in breach of international law but at the behest of a country pursuing annihilation in Gaza, the US has delivered a resounding blow to the architecture of global affairs. It has signalled that countries that negotiate (Iran) face stark consequences, which those which rush to own the bomb (North Korea) can avoid. Its embrace of pre-emptive strikes is handy for Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and any leader who might want to carry out their own. Even if the immediate crisis in the Middle East can be contained, the cost of this reckless act may not be fully felt or comprehended for decades.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionIranNuclear weaponsBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelAntónio GuterresKeir StarmereditorialsShareReuse this content"

Media reports recently indicated that many small businesses are challenged byTrump’s tariffs, ongoinginflation, labor shortages and higher financing costs. So how are small businesses doing so far in 2025? Not great. But not that bad either.In just the past two months, there have been no less than seven comprehensive surveys conducted by well-known companies and brands that altogether surveyed or drew from their internal data of tens – even hundreds – of thousands of small businesses. And they give a pretty good idea of how they’re doing.Wealth management firm Principal Financial’sWell-Being Indexfrom June found that 56% of the companies they surveyed reported business growth and 90% of employers have either maintained or grown their workforce over the past year, with 49% increasing wages in just the past three months.Tariff dodgers take big risks to cut small corners | Gene MarksRead moreHowever, optimism remains tempered by a weakening outlook on future economic growth and many have reported “significant declines” in the financial health of their business, their local economy and theUS economy, “eroding the sense of optimism expressed in years past”.According to a survey by accounting giant EY,95% of those polledwere “confident in business growth” over the next year. Additionally, 73% of entrepreneurs reported experiencing revenue growth this year compared with last year, with 29% reporting growth of 20% or higher. However, 43% said that current economic conditions are hurting them, but many still plan to pursue funding and strategic transactions, with investment in AI and M&A considerations leading the list.Software provider Intuit’sQuickBooks Small Business Indexdraws on actual information from its customers, derived from anonymized employment and payroll data. The company found that job growth among small businesses – the great majority of their customer base – was stable, with employment increasing in seven of the 12 sectors tracked. That’s good, but unfortunately the study also found that average real monthly revenue for small businesses with one to nine employees decreased about 0.06% from the month before.Like Intuit, HR services giant Paychex said in itsSmall Business Employment Watchreports that job growth derived from its 350,000-plus customer database in May “stayed flat” month over month and hourly earnings growth decreased to a four-year low. “Caution persists” in both wage and hiring trends.The closely watchedSmall Business Optimism Indexpublished monthly by the National Federation of Small Businesses reported a tick up in small business optimism in May to a level above its 51-year average. The survey found that the top concerns of the federation’s members shifted from inflation to taxation and that although sales expectations and hiring plans were “improving”, uncertainty remained.Finally, in its JuneSmall Business Perspectivereport, US Bank said that 96% of the small business owners it surveyed reported their business as currently successful and 88% saw growth in the past year. Two-thirds said the country’s economy was “moving in the right direction”, with only 18% saying it was going in the wrong direction.Interestingly, this sentiment was even stronger among younger business leaders (gen Z and millennial), with 74% saying it was moving in the right direction, versus 52% of leaders from older generations (gen X and boomer). Although four out of five owners felt at least “somewhat stressed” about tariffs, those leaders were “slightly more likely to anticipate a positive rather than negative impact”.My take? Despite all the headwinds and uncertainties such as tariffs, federal and local policies, geopolitical conflicts, inflation, labor shortages and other challenges – small businesses, so far, in 2025 remain optimistic about the future and are maintaining employment levels mostly reporting average financial results. Few are jumping for joy. But it seems that fewer are jumping off the ship.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessTrump tariffsTariffsInflationDonald TrumpUS economycommentShareReuse this content"

A mostly unremarkable game livened up by a hit batsman that led to a near-brawl between the two teams. But the real action took place well before the first pitch. Federal agents were seen attempting to enter Dodger Stadium’s parking lot earlier in the day,accordingtoseveralreports. When asked, the agentsdeclared they were withthe Department of Homeland Security (DHS). After the Dodgers said they had turned Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents away, Icedenied being at the stadium at all, while DHS said Customs and Border Protection vehicles “were in the stadium parking lot very briefly, unrelated to any operation or enforcement”. Yes, but what about, you know, the videos? The eyewitness accounts? All thatevidence? Never mind that, I suppose.We’ve become quite immune to the confused realitiesof this administration. They could say the sky is purple, horses can carry on cocktail party conversation à la Mr Ed, and Justin Bieber is a recent Nobel laureate in physics and we’d respond: “Well, of course, carry on. Congrats to Justin, I suppose.” They’ve been doing it sinceDonald Trump’s first term, but really ratcheted up the bullshit during the immigration protests in Los Angeles. The administration’s party line is that Los Angeles was tipping into full-on, RoboCop-style anarchy and the only solution to that problem was a deployment of the national guard and the marines, against the wishes of the Los Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, and California’s governor, Gavin Newsom. This, despite the protests occurring within about 1 sq mile of a city that is, by my last count,absolutely enormous. Or, for those who don’t live here, 500 sq miles (1,300 sq km). To be exact.From LA to Paris, the populist right hates cities – and it’s fuelled by a sense of bitter defeat | Andy BeckettRead moreThe protests have largely wrapped up, even as Ice has become more brazen in its activities – snatching peopleoutside a Home Depot in Hollywoodand dropping by our baseball stadium for unknown reasons. Despite the lack of conflagration, a federal appeals courtrecently affirmedTrump’s right to deploy the guard for this particular purpose, though going to the trouble of reminding the administration that such actions are not above judicial review. Of course, for the immigrant denizens of LA, this city does feel like a war zone, with the constant fear, anxiety and stress that comes with all of that. Public transitridership is down significantly, businesses have to close to prevent their employees from being captured andstories of Ice raids trickle through communitieslike drips of poison. That’s our shared reality, but it’s not the one outsiders seem to care about. They’remore interested in the Waymos, I suppose.Despite the ongoing mischaracterization of the situation on the ground, Trump seems unable to manage to get the widespread clashes and chaos he so clearly desires. The military deployment in LA wasn’t much more remarkable than his birthday-party-cum-bring-your-army-to-work-day thatnearly put Marco Rubio to sleep. Trump might have been asleep too, but his eyes have narrowed into such baggy slits that one can no longer make an accurate judgment. His eyelids now resemble two fluffy hamburger buns, with nothing but a layer of mayonnaise in between.Perhaps the president’s burger eyes are partially to blame for his lack of awareness of what is actually happening in Los Angeles. Our schools are in summer break, leaving the roads slightly less congested. A recent heatwave has me canoodling with my air conditioner, like two drunk celebrities in the back of the Met Gala dining room. Juneteenth celebrations in my area carried on as usual. Downtown, the site of the protest actions, is back to being a great place to urinate in an alley without being pelted byrubber bullets. I still can’t get my agent to call me back about that script. All is well here. And yet, the pretense of simmering violence is continuing to be used to justify a wholly unnecessary deployment of the armed forces.Speaking of armed forces, the Los Angeles police department totals nearly 9,000 officers, with tanks, riot gear and heavy weaponry. The LAPD is, in many ways, a little mini-army to patrol those aforementioned 500 sq miles ofenormousness. When Bass said the LAPD could handle it, she meant it. This is another way in which perception taints the reality on the ground. LA has taken the place of countless other conservative boogeymen – San Francisco, Portland, New York City – as the pre-eminent scourge of so-called liberal lawlessness. Of course, LA, like those other cities, spends money on its police force like I do on The RealReal after one too many martinis. The most recent LAPD budget topped $2bn, which, while less than the purchase price of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team, is still quite a lot. It’s a billion dollars more than is spent on homelessness programs bythe entire state. A city politician can hardly get elected without at least some support from the police unions, like our new district attorney,Nathan Hochman, who trounced the incumbent by running on a law-and-order platform.Will the public side with the protesters in LA? Here are some lessons from history | Musa al-GharbiRead moreBut the American conservative media apparatus can and routinely does tell a different story ofLos Angeles. That it’s a liberal hellscape where God has been given his two-weeks’ notice and everyone gives each other anal beads for Christmas. If only that were true. Maybe this would be a more exciting place to live. In reality, AKA that thing that happens when you go outside, this can be a terribly boring place to live, especially when your agent doesn’t call you back. To be honest, I quite like how boring it is. It’s a lot easier to complain about mundane things, like every good restaurant closing on Mondays. Can we spread that out? Maybe some of you close on Sundays, so I don’t have to subject myself to Sweetgreen when I’m too lazy to cook. Just try it out. I could complain about how the DMV kiosk that’s supposed to make it faster to renew your car registration is actually becoming just as long of a line as the normal window because the payment system is constantly going down. Or that the San Diego Padres are the dirtiest team in baseball and their entire franchise should be sold to the Saudi royal family for scrap and moved to Riyadh. You know, normal things to complain about. The only time it’s not boring to live in Los Angeles is whensomeone(you know who) decides to send the marines in to walk around in a circle for two months. If the federal government could promise to let Los Angeles be boring again, I’ll promise to stop handing out anal beads during the holidays.

His reckless gamble makes a nuclear weapon for Iran more, not less, likelySun 22 Jun 2025 07.28 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 11.46 EDTShareBombing will not make Iran go away. US bombs will not destroy the knowhow needed to build a nuclear weapon or the will do so, if that is what Tehran wants. Thehuge attackordered by Donald Trump will not halt ongoing open warfare between Israel and Iran. It will not bring lasting peace to the Middle East, end the slaughter in Gaza, deliver justice to the Palestinians, or end more than half a century of bitter enmity between Tehran and Washington.More likely, Trump’s rash, reckless gamble will inflame and exacerbate all these problems. Depending on how Iran and its allies and supporters react, the region could plunge into an uncontrolled conflagration. US bases in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere in the region, home toabout 40,000 American troops, must now be considered potential targets for retaliation – and possiblyBritish and allied forces, too.Trump says he has not declared war onIran. He claims the attack is not an opening salvo in a campaign aimed at triggering regime change in Tehran. But that’s not how Iran’s politicians and people will see it. Trump’s premature bragging about “spectacular” success, and threats of more and bigger bombs, sound like the words of a ruthless conqueror intent on total, crushing victory.Trump, the isolationist president who vowed to avoid foreign wars, has walked slap bang into a trap prepared by Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu – a trap his smarter predecessors avoided. Netanyahu has constantly exaggerated the immediacy of the Iranian nuclear threat. His alarmist speeches on this subjectgo back 30 years. Always, he claimed to know what UN nuclear inspectors, US and European intelligence agencies and even some of his own spy chiefs did not – namely, that Iran was on the verge of deploying a ready-to-use nuclear weapon aimed at Israel’s heart.The warmongers were wrong about Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. Now watch them make the same mistake about Iran | Owen JonesRead moreThis contention has never been proven. Iran has always denied seeking a nuclear bomb. Its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,issued a fatwabanning any such programme. Netanyahu’s most recent claim that Iran was weaponising, made as he tried to justify last week’s unilateral, illegal Israeli attacks, was not supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) or US intelligence experts. But weak-minded Trump chose to believe it. Reading from Netanyahu’s script, he said on Saturday night thateliminating this incontrovertible nuclear threatwas vital – and the sole aim of the US air assault.So, once again, the US has gone to war in the Middle East on the back of a lie, on disputed, probably faulty intelligence purposefully distorted for political reasons. Once again, as in Iraq in 2003, the overall objectives of the war are unclear, uncertain and open to interpretation by friend and foe alike. Once again, there appears to be no “exit strategy”, no guardrails against escalation and no plan for what happens next. Demanding that Iran capitulate or face “national tragedy” is not a policy. It’s a deadly dead-end.Iran will not go away, whatever Trump and Netanyahu may imagine in their fevered dreams. It will remain a force in the region. It will remain a country to be reckoned with, a country of 90 million people, and one with powerful allies in China, Russia and the global south. It is already insisting it will continue with its civil nuclear programme.These events are a reminder of how profound is official US ignorance of Iran. Unlike the UK, Washington has had no diplomatic presence there since the revolution. It has had few direct political contacts, and its swingeing economic sanctions have created even greater distance, further diminishing mutual understanding. Trump’s decision to renege on the2015 nuclear accord(negotiated by Barack Obama, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the EU) was a product of this ignorance. Ten years later, he is trying to do with bombs what was largely, peacefully achieved through diplomacy by his wiser, less impulsive, less easily led predecessors.View image in fullscreenA 2025 satellite image shows the Fordow nuclear enrichment plant, north-east of Qom, Iran.Photograph: Maxar Technologies Handout/EPAPeace seems more elusive than ever – and Netanyahu is celebrating. The US cannot walk away now. It’s committed. And, as Netanyahu sees it,he and Israel cannot lose. Except, except … Iran cannot somehow be imagined away. It still has to be dealt with. And the reckoning that now looms, short- and long-term, may be more terrible than any of Netanyahu’s scare stories.Iran previously warned that if the US attacked, it would hit back at US bases. There aremany to choose from, in Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan and elsewhere. The Houthis in Yemen say they will resume attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. The strait of Hormuz, so important a transit point for global energy supplies, may be mined, as happened in the 1980s during the Iran-Iraq war. The result could be a global oil shock and markets meltdown. And Iran is still reportedly firing missiles into Israel, despite claims in Jerusalem that most of its ballistic missiles bases have been destroyed.Reacting to Trump’s attack, Iranian officials sayno options are off the tablein terms of retaliation. And they say they will not negotiate under fire, despite acall to do sofrom the British prime minister, Keir Starmer. Rejecting Trump’s unverified claims about the total destruction of all nuclear facilities, they also insist Iran will reconstitute and continue its nuclear programme. The big question now is whether that programme really will be weaponised.Trump, Netanyahu and Khamenei – three angry old men who could get us all killed | Simon TisdallRead moreTwo radical longer-term consequences may flow from this watershed moment. One is that Khamenei’s unpopular regime, notorious for corruption, military incompetence and economic mismanagement, and deprived of support from Lebanese Hezbollah and Hamas in Gaza, may crack under the strain of this disaster. So far there has been little sign of an uprising or a change in government. That’s not surprising, given that Tehran and other cities are under bombardment. Butregime collapsecannot be ruled out.The other is that, rather than surrender the cherished right to uranium enrichment and submit to the Trump-Netanyahu ultimatum, Iran’s rulers, whoever they are, will decide to follow North Korea and try to acquire a bomb as quickly as possible, to fend off future humiliations. That could entail withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and rejection of the UN inspections regime. After years of trying to play by western rules, Iran could reallyfinally go rogue.The supposed need to acquire nukes for self-defence is a grim lesson other countries around the world may draw from these events. The proliferation of nuclear weapons is thebiggest immediate dangerto the future of the planet. What Trump just did in recklessly and violently trying to eliminate an unproven threat may ensure the proven danger of a nuclear-armed world grows ever-more real.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsIranOpinionTrump administrationIsraelUS foreign policyDonald TrumpUS militaryMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s what the US left can learn from itLuke BerrymanEffective opposition calls for a laser focus on change, no matter how small. We should consider these activists’ examplesSun 22 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTShareAround the end of 2022, I had an idea for a book about the history of resistance toNazism. I wanted to show that Nazism has faced nonconformity, refusal and protest ever since it was born in 1920. I also wanted to explore beyond a handful of famous heroes and cast a spotlight on people who changed history without entering popular memory. When I began my research,Donald Trumphad just announced his candidacy for the Republican ticket in 2024. When I gave the manuscript to the publisher a little over two years later, he was president-elect.His comeback, the darker version of Maga that came with him, and the Democratic party’s collapse gave fresh relevance to the stories of resistance to far-right extremism that I was finding. Even as I was piecing them together, they began to intrude on the present. It was a haunting transformation – and it helped me to understand why the resistance to Trump has been flawed from the moment he stepped on to the political stage.We’ve never been shy about broadcasting our opinions. We’ve wornpussy hats, put uplawn signs, andtrolled Trump and his supporters, both online and off. But while such acts may get attention, their capacity to create change is less certain.This can even be true for mass protests. Americans have sometimesunderestimatedthe effectiveness of protest – recent demonstrations inLos Angelesandacross the countryare an importantpart of resistance. In the era of social media and the 24-hour news cycle, though, protests can risk becoming a spectacle. And when the government is given a chance toportray them as violent, their effectiveness is extinguished – because they end up benefiting the forces they mean to challenge.Welcome to a new ‘gloomcycle’ of news. Here’s how to stop compulsive scrolling | Margaret SullivanRead moreThe resisters that I researched, by contrast, were laser-focused on creating change. Whether they were satirists drawing anti-Nazi cartoons in 1920s Germany or former neo-Nazis becoming peace advocates in the 21st-century US, they sought to improve life for themselves and others in the here and now, in any way that they could, no matter how small.The German activist Emmi Bonhoeffer is a powerful example. She built a support group for the Holocaust survivors who testified in the 1960s Frankfurt Auschwitz trials, where Nazis were tried for their roles at the death camp. In doing so, Bonhoeffer resisted the Nazis’ desire for both their crimes and their victims to be forgotten. Her group – most of them homemakers – ultimately helped nearly 200 people as they took the stand. They inspired similar groups to form around other war crimes trials in Germany, too. But they didn’t advertise. They didn’t have a slogan or an outfit or a flag. They didn’t even bother to give their group a name. Their first and only concern was to clear a path toward justice for at least some of the Nazis’ victims. For Bonhoeffer, resistance wasn’t about getting attention. It was about creating change.What’s more, the resistance to Trump has always been stained by a judgmental streak. Whether we’re denouncing them as a “basket of deplorables” or mocking them on social media, we invariably devote too much energy to belittling his supporters. This has convinced us of our own moral rectitude. In turn, this has made us complacent, and complacency only deepens our inaction.The resisters that I learned about pulled no punches when it came to judging Adolf Hitler and his inner circle. But they spent more time judging themselves than his supporters. Consider the German émigré Sebastian Haffner. In the late 1930s, he wrote anextraordinary autobiographical bookabout his life as a so-called “Aryan” in Hitler’s Germany. It was only published in 2000, posthumously, after his son discovered it hidden in a desk drawer. For Haffner, publication didn’t really matter. The book was, first and foremost, an imaginative space in which he subjected his own behavior and thinking and privilege to relentless scrutiny. Through this process of self-scrutiny, he grew into one of the Nazis’ most effective critics in exile.The judgmental streak has also given some of our attempts to resist Trump a holier-than-thou quality that diminishes our capacity for empathy. We’re too quick to believe that 77 million Americans voted for Trumpout of stupidity, notdesperation or disenfranchisement. By contrast, I was always struck by the sense of shared humanity among the resisters that I discovered – like the lower-level British intelligence officials who persuaded members of the German public to help them smoke out Nazi war criminals after 1945; orLeon Bass, the Black American soldier who drew on his own experiences of segregation to deepen his understanding of the suffering of the Jewish people he liberated from Buchenwald.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Will they change their minds? | Tayo BeroRead moreLike every far-right leader in history, Donald Trump has intoxicated his supporters with nostalgia for a past that never existed in order to push a corrupt and hateful agenda of his own. Eventually, many will realize that he’s lied to them. Perhaps they’ll lose their jobs because of hiseconomic policies, or see law-abiding friends and family deported because of hisimmigration policies. Perhaps their children will suffer from measles because of hishealth policies. Whatever the case, when their moment of realization comes, we must be ready to embrace them, and to weep with them for what they’ve lost. If there’s one thing that I learned while writing my book, it’s that effective resistance to the far right is never just about defeating the enemy. It’s about creating a better future for everyone.What’s giving me hope nowTeachers and librarians arechampioning the written wordas a tool of resistance. Colleagues in the field of Holocaust education are collaborating onfree and innovative eventsto inform the public about the collapse of democracy in early 20th-century Europe – and to establish what we can learn from it today. And, as I argue in my book, the arts can connect us to our own humanity, and to the humanity in others. Supporting your local art museum, attending a concert or joining a book club should all be cause for hope – because in a divided, partisan society, such acts constitute resistance.Luke Berryman, PhD, is an educator and author of the forthcoming book ResistingNazism, to be published by Bloomsbury in 2026Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationFighting BackUS politicsDonald TrumpNazismDemocratsProtestcommentShareReuse this content"

The Albanese government must continue itSun 22 Jun 2025 18.55 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 21.40 EDTShareAmerica’sbombing of Iranian nuclear facilitieshas no legitimacy under international law and carries significant implications for Australia. This is especially the case given how an Israeli/American/Iranian conflict could escalate, Australia’s longstanding military alliance with the United States and the delicate current state of Australian-US relations under the Trump presidency including anxiety over Aukus.TheUnited Nationscharter recognises the right of all states to self-defence following an armed attack. However, certain conditions need to be met before a state can exercise self-defence which traditionally have been interpreted narrowly. Such an approach is essential if the UN charter prohibition on the use of force is to be maintained, and any legitimate use of military force is to be the absolute exception in the conduct of international relations. Use of force in self-defence is only permissible following an armed attack by one state against another, which has been extended to attacks from non-state actors. In this instance, there is absolutely no evidence that the United States suffered an Iranian armed attack.‘I think you and I are at war’: the Australians suddenly united in grief over the Israel-Iran conflictRead moreThere have been ongoing incidents since the commencement of Israel’s 2023 military campaign in Gaza of Iranian-backed Houthi rebels attacking international shipping in the Red Sea, including US flagged shipping. Those incidents have been dealt with on a case-by-case basis and military responses have been directed at the Houthi forces. Importantly, there has been no recent attack on American-flagged shipping that could have triggered a US right of self-defence.The US since 1945 also advanced a right of anticipatory and pre-emptive self-defence. Both concepts – which are framed around notions of the imminence of an armed attack occurring – are controversial in international law, are not directly referred to in the UN charter and have never been endorsed by either the UN security council or the international court of justice.The Bush administration’s 2002 US national security strategy advanced a version of pre-emptive self-defence in direct response to non-state actors possibly acquiring weapons of mass destruction. That doctrine was developed following 9/11 in response to the emergence of Osama bin Laden and the Islamic State group, and their possible access to Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. This doctrine was partly relied upon by the Bush administration to support its 2003 military invasion of Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein and rid Iraq of WMD. While the US did achieve regime change no WMD were ever found.The Trump administration could argue it has come to the aid of Israel through an act of collective self-defence which is recognised in Article 51 of the UN charter. There are prominent examples of such conduct such as the 1991 Gulf War when the US-led “coalition of the willing” came to the defence of Kuwait following Iraq’s 1990 invasion. However, any legal argument supporting collective self-defence must be founded on whether Israel had a right of self-defence when it launched its initial 13 June strikes onIran. This raises similar issues to those noted above and ultimately returns to an argument of Israel seeking to exercise a version of anticipatory or pre-emptive self-defence which irrespective of the weak law on the facts is also very dubious.Legally, politically and diplomatically this places Australia in a very difficult position. Australia came to America’s military aid in 2001 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The Howard government famously invoked the Anzus treaty and joined in the military intervention in Afghanistan alongside the US. That was legally an example of collective self-defence that had been given implicit United Nations security council endorsement. The 2003 Australian military intervention alongside the US in Iraq was much more controversial and generated intense domestic political and legal debate. The Howard government’s legal justification was framed around United Nations security council resolutions permitting Iraqi weapons inspections and the need for Australia to join other UN members in militarily disarming Iraq. There are no such security council resolutions authorising the disarmament of Iran.No matter what Trump says, the US has gone to war – and there will be profound and lasting consequences | Simon TisdallRead moreIn the absence of the US being the subject of an attack on its homeland and requesting Anzus alliance military support akin to 2001, it is unlikely that the Albanese government would confront the type of scenario the Howard government faced. There is a real prospect that if events in the Middle East continue to escalate and Iranian and Houthi attacks are launched against US shipping and US military assets that Australia could be asked to come to America’s military aid irrespective of any Anzus obligations. With the Albanese government remaining firm in its support of Aukus, to turn down any US request for Middle East military support could spell the death knell for not only the Anzus military alliance but also Aukus.Labor governments have a proud history of supporting the UN charter. The Albanese government consistently references its support for international law and international institutions. The US strikes on Iran require a firm Australian response supporting the rules-based international order. Any US requests for military support arising from these incidents should be declined.Donald Rothwell is professor of international law at the Australian National UniversityExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyOpinionMiddle East and north AfricaIranAustralian politicsIsraelUnited NationscommentShareReuse this content"

From the slow shuffle at the supermarket checkout to the more profound waiting between a medical test and its result, wait we must. Yet in a society hellbent on speed and efficiency, waiting has become the enemy.Historically, the act of waiting had spiritual meaning: waiting for the Messiah or the second coming, waiting for sacred rain, or the return of the Sun God. But in today’s world, where time is money and productivity is a virtue, we’ve developed a pervasive impatience.Waiting raises our anxiety – not just mentally but physiologically, as stress hormones flood our systems. We experience it as a gap to be filled, a void to be plugged.How Charlie discovered that time wealth can be the key to a slower, happier life | Modern mindRead moreIt also heightens our awareness of uncertainty, and uncertainty activates the same neural pathways as pain, fear and threat detection. But while these neurological facts explain our psychological responses to waiting, explanations do not necessarily change these responses.There are different forms of waiting, each demanding something unique from us. Everyday waiting – traffic jams, slow wifi – tests our patience and requires frustration tolerance. Interpersonal waiting, where we are asked to match the pace of someone more vulnerable, calls us to slow down and inhabit a better version of ourselves. And then there is existential waiting, which is particularly challenging as it relates to matters of life and death. Existential waiting can lead us into the abyss: catastrophic thinking, free-floating anxiety, the unravelling of our defences, even the fragmentation of our sense of self.Navigating these moments requires the capacity to bear difficulty with grace and to cultivate faith and hope that transcend the immediate without slipping into denial and unreality. It means tolerating anguish, slowing down and navigating suffering, not only with tolerance but with purpose and hopeful endurance.Religious traditions have long valorised such states. Christianity focuses on the redemptive power of suffering through Christ; Sufism sees longing and anguish as paths towards union with the divine; Buddhism teaches us to sit with pain, to observe and detach.Some secular philosophies also mirror these insights.What are we waiting for? What does it teach us?Viktor Frankl, writing from the depths of a concentration camp, emphasised the importance of finding meaning even in suffering. The contemporaryrise of death cafes, where people gather to reflect on mortality, speaks to a desire to confront and grapple with the existential unknowns. These cafes offer a space to explore death as a way of enhancing life, inviting us to see waiting not as lost time but as time forbecoming– individually, and in resistance to the commodification of time itself.Existential waiting also raises important questions. What are we waiting for? What does it teach us? What are we becoming in the process? But before we can engage with these larger questions, many of us need help simply learning to tolerate the anxiety that waiting provokes.Take Michael*, a high-achieving software developer who came to therapy after experiencing a panic attack prompted by a routine health check. Rational and successful, Michael found himself unravelling in the face of uncertainty as he awaited the results. He described himself as feeling “out of control” and “spiralling”. He couldn’t sleep. He compulsively checked his email. He imagined worst-case diagnoses. Physically, he experienced heart palpitations, stomach tightness, restlessness and persistent anxiety.Digging deeper, it became clear that Michael’s difficulty with waiting was rooted in a familiar psychological pattern. He had grown up in a family that prized achievement and productivity. He had lived a life mapped out by goals – goals that he usually met. But recently, he had been shaken by the sudden death of a close friend his own age during a routine jog. Since then, his health anxiety had escalated.In Michael’s case, the medical test – and the waiting it required – was the trigger for a common psychological pattern. His automatic thought was: “It’s probably bad news.” This gave rise to anxiety and dread, which led to physical symptoms like tightness in the chest and a racing heart. His response to this was rumination, compulsive checking, Googling and avoidance of sleep. These behaviours brought temporary relief but ultimately reinforced his anxiety. Underneath it all lay a core belief: that not knowing is dangerous. He struggled to hold multiple possibilities in mind; for him, uncertainty collapsed into catastrophe.A moment that changed me: I went to a death cafe – and learned how to live a much happier lifeRead moreTherapy began by helping Michael recognise this cycle. We worked to challenge his catastrophic thinking and to open space for alternative outcomes. He was encouraged to delay checking his email and to soothe his anxiety in more helpful ways. He practised guided body scans to anchor himself in his body’s present safety. He learned mindfulness and breathing techniques. Gradually, he began to see waiting not as a void to be feared, but as an opportunity to observe.Over time, Michael’s anxiety lessened. “Waiting still sucks,” he said. “But now it doesn’t own me.”To live slowly and to wait well is an act of quiet rebellion – a refusal to see time as a thief. It is a form of resistance against a culture that equates speed with worth. Waiting will never be easy, but if we develop the capacity to wait with presence and intention we may discover that waiting is its own form of becoming. In the words of CS Lewis, waiting can become “the scent of a flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard”.*Michael is a fictional amalgam to exemplify similar cases we see.

It’s vital we fight this alarming attack on free speechSun 22 Jun 2025 10.19 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 15.36 EDTShareOn 20 June, in what has now become an appallinglyfamiliarstory, Israeli forces once again opened fire on Palestinians at an aid distribution site, this timekilling 23 people. The same day, it was revealed that activists affiliated with the UK group Palestine Action hadbroken into an RAF baseand defaced two military aircraft in an act of protest. One of these actions involved the intentional use of lethal violence against civilians, resulting in the deaths of 23 loved and irreplaceable human beings. The other involved no violence against any living things and resulted in no deaths or injuries. The UK government has now announced its intention to deal with one of these incidents as a terrorist offence.Guess which.International organisations could hardly be more unanimous in their assessment that Israel is committing extremely grave war crimes in Gaza. In November last year, aUN special committeefound that Israel’s campaign in Gaza was consistent with the characteristics of genocide. In December, anAmnesty International investigationconcluded that Israel “has committed and is continuing to commit genocide”. Now, a series of unprovoked and illegal Israeli attacks on Iran have succeeded in drawing the USdirectly into war with Iran, in violation of US and international law. While massacres continue in Gaza, Israeli aggression threatens to ignite a major regional and perhaps even global conflict.Don’t believe the doubters: protest still has power | Jan-Werner MüllerRead moreAnd yet the UK continues to provide Israel with military intelligence, and British companies continue to sell lethal weapons to the Israeli state. In a poll conducted last year,56% of British voterssupported a complete embargo on arms sales to Israel. Across the UK,hundreds of thousands of peoplehave attended demonstrations mourning those lost to the conflict and demanding an end to the slaughter. But the government stubbornly persists in its support for Israel’s military campaign. Mass peaceful protest, even with majority support among the wider population, has yielded no results. In the face of state support for genocide, what are conscientious people supposed to do?The activists who broke into the RAF facility at Brize Norton knew, of course, that their actions were illegal. From the suffragettes to the gay rights movement to the anti-apartheid struggle, genuine political resistance has always involved intentional law-breaking. AsMartin Luther King Jr wrotefrom a Birmingham jail: “One has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.” And the provision of weapons to facilitate genocide is more than unjust: it is an abyss of moral horror. Those brave enough to break the law in protest – many of whom are alreadyserving time in prisonfor their actions – deserve our highest respect.But proscribing an entire organisation under the Terrorism Act is not the same thing as prosecuting particular individuals for specific transgressions. If the government follows through with its intention to designate Palestine Action as a terror organisation, mere membership of the group would constitute a crime. In fact, even supporting the group purely in words – as I am doing now – could also constitute a serious legal offence, punishable with a sentence of up to14 years in prison. Financial dealings with members and supporters may also be illegal, even if the individuals concerned have done nothing against the law other than belong to or express support for a protest movement.View image in fullscreenA Palestine Action activist approaches a military aircraft at RAF Brize Norton before spraying it with red paint, 20 June 2025.Photograph: Palestine Action/ReutersUnder UK law, the home secretary has broad discretion to proscribe any organisation “concerned in terrorism”. Until now, this process has only ever been used against militant groups either directly involved in or actively advocating violent armed struggle. But crucially, the act defines terrorism vaguely enough to include mere property damage and disruption of electronic systems – even in the total absence of a threat to human life or public safety. If the government proceeds down this path, any ordinary person in the UK could in theory be sent to prison simply for expressing verbal support for non-violent activism. Quite aside from the broader principle, this would represent an alarming curtailment of free speech.Palestine Action is not an armed group. It has never been responsible for any fatalities and does not pose any risk to the public. Its methods do involve property sabotage, which is, obviously, illegal. But if killing 23 civilians at an aid distribution site is not terrorism, how can we possibly be expected to accept that spray-painting a plane is? Law-abiding protest has so far failed to stop the genocide. More than50,000 innocent childrenhave been killed or injured. In what circumstances could civil disobedience ever be justified if not now?I can only say that I admire and support Palestine Action wholeheartedly – and I will continue to, whether that becomes a terrorist offence or not.Sally Rooney is an Irish writerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

No wonder they are scared about where this all might leadSun 22 Jun 2025 08.29 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 15.13 EDTShareEarlier this month, theNew Statesman publisheda long and fascinating article by its newly installed editor, Tom McTague, about the prime minister. Much of it was an account of a dogged hunt for something that never really materialised: some idea of what Keir Starmer believes in. The closest McTague got was an answer to a question about ideals Starmer thinks of as sacrosanct. “Human dignity,” he said. “The dignity of the individual. And the respect that goes with it.”Successful politicians are often distinguished by their ability to hold completely contradictory beliefs, and Starmer is clearly no exception. After months of outrage and protest – and whispers about ministerial resignations, given more credence by the return to the backbenches of theLabour whip Vicky Foxcroft– he and his government are seemingly more committed than ever to reforms to disability and sickness benefits that will soon come to a vote in the House of Commons. The people these changes will tip into an everyday nightmare are already terrified. Quite where a belief in human dignity fits into all this is a question that answers itself.A huge part of the government’s plans centres on the tightening of eligibility for the part of personal independence payments (or Pip) known as the daily living component. Assessments are based on acumulative score, which adds together ratings for “descriptors” of living activities based on a scale from zero to eight. They include such bald representations of abilities as “can prepare and cook a simple meal” and “needs physical help to be able to manage toilet needs”. In thenew system, people will have to score at least one rating of four to qualify for the daily living component, which will rule out thousands who experience complicated but very real issues – autism and learning disabilities, for example, tend to be manifested in lots of twos and threes – and threaten to tip their lives into financial freefall.Asummaryfrom Citizens Advice speaks volumes: “Someone who needs assistance to cut up food, wash their hair and body below the waist, use the toilet and dress/undress their lower body wouldn’t receive Pip under the new rules.” These changes are grim enough, but there are more: chiefly, thehacking backof the so-called health element of universal credit. The Pip reforms will have knock-on effects for people’s eligibility for this benefit: many who are refused one are likely to be denied the other. The rate for new claimants whose applications are granted will be cut from £97 a week to £50, and then frozen for four years. The entitlement age is also being raised,from 18 to 22.And so, as the government insists that “those who can work should work”, this cruelty charter goes on. Reduced Pip entitlements look set to affect whether lots of people’s family members are entitled to carer’s allowance, which is now £83.30 a week. After rumblings about partial retreats, the only clear change to what was originally floated is an increase in the transition period from people forced off Pip from four to13 weeks. The arrival point, needless to say, will remain the same: huge losses of income for hundreds of thousands of households – some of whom, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, will be as much as£12,000 a year worse off.Amid predictions of a big parliamentary revolt and wild speculation that the vote could even be pulled, it is worth thinking about how Labour’s collective belief in the dignity of labour regularly curdles into two toxic ways of thinking. One is a belief that paid employment is the only reliable gauge of people’s esteem; the other is a queasiness about disability that sometimes lurks just below the surface. There is also an apparently desperate need to counter any suggestion that Labour ministers are liberal fainthearts. In March, the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, offered acurt explanationof why the government was set on its plan: “This is the Labour party. The clue is in the name. We believe in work.”Such banal obstinacy gets in the way of any deep understanding of the issues swirling around this story. Since the pandemic, the number of Pip awards hasmore than doubled. Much of this is to do with an epidemic of anxiety and depression, not least among the young. That shines light on something politicians rarely talk about, which also includes the kind of long-term health conditions that blur into disability: the fact that millions of people were damaged by both Covid-19 and the lockdowns it triggered. Research by theNew Economics Foundationalso suggests that although many disabled people usually claim no benefits at all, the cost of living crisis pushed them into applying for Pip, and therefore shoved up the benefits bill. These, needless to say, are all complex stories that demand careful answers; what the government is proposing, by contrast, amounts to the insane idea that you can immiserate people out of their problems.Meanwhile, a very convenient theory is gaining ground. Over the past six months, we have heard more and more about the alleged modern scourge of “overdiagnosis”. Words of sympathy and support for such ideas have come from – among others –Nigel Farage, Kemi Badenoch and theheath secretary, Wes Streeting. And this school of thought now has a set text:The Age of Diagnosisby the consultant neurologist Suzanne O’Sullivan, which has receivedrave reviews, and become one of this year’s most fashionable books.It presents as a measured and nuanced exploration of everything from Lyme disease to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but it can easily be read as an elegant justification for taking some people’s claims of disability and illness with a pinch of salt. She insists, for example, that “a psychosomatic explanation for people with long Covid has not featured nearly enough in public discourse”. This point is surrounded by caveats and qualifications, and reminders that illness triggered in the mind can be just as debilitating as ailments with physical causes. But her book makes it far too easy for bad actors to strip those nuances away, and lean into a cruelly dismissive attitude that perfectly suits culture warriors, and politicians who want to hack back public spending.A lot of what she has to say about human psychology, moreover, reflects themisplaced ideathat particular conditions sit on a simple continuum that goes from severe to mild, and it might be in everyone’s interests to tell those on the “mild” end that the labels they claim are doing them more harm than good. As O’Sullivan sees it, diagnoses of autism (which she describes as a “brain disorder”) “might become a self-fulfilling prophecy as some will take the diagnosis to mean they can’t do certain things, so won’t even try”. There is a strong whiff here of the crass logic the government wants to apply to the benefits system, and the same implied message: buck up, be resilient, get back to work.People are scared. For many, the prospect of disabled people being so impoverished is part of what made last week’s vote for assisted dying more than a little unsettling. Changes to special needs education will materialise in the autumn, and there have been whispers and briefings about the restriction of disabled children and young people’s most basic legal rights. It all seems to confirm that whatever a progressive approach to disability and human difference looks like, Starmer and his people are speeding off in the opposite direction. The idea that the people at the top believe in “the dignity of the individual”, in other words, is looking more threadbare by the day.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDisabilityOpinionBenefitsWelfarecommentShareReuse this content"

Yet immigrants are still fighting to be seen that wayDiane AbbottThis week’s Windrush Day reception at No 10 was joyous – but also a reminder of the ugliness behind the ‘island of strangers’ rhetoricSun 22 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 04.04 EDTShareThis week I went to a Windrush Day reception in the gardens of 10 Downing Street. Standing in the brilliant sunshine, with a steelband tinkling away in the background, it was great to see this generation ofCaribbeanmigrants finally being honoured as their bravery and enterprise deserves.The excited guests – Windrush-era Caribbean migrants, their friends and family – were thrilled to be at No 10, and the absolute highlight was being addressed by the prime minister, Keir Starmer. Fortunately on this occasion, he refrained from telling his guests that they were turning Britain into an “island of strangers”. In any case, it would have been nonsense.Nobody identified more strongly with Britain than that generation, many of whom had a picture of Queen Elizabeth II on their living-room wall. When the Empire Windrusharrived at Tilbury docks in Essex,its occupants did not see themselves as “immigrants”, but citizens of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth come to help rebuild the “mother country” after the war. Most of the passengers gave their last country of residence as the Caribbean, including Jamaica, Trinidad, St Lucia, Grenada and Barbados. Some had served in the British armed forces, but others had responded to the British government advertisements for workers.While it is good to see the contribution of migrants to Britain in the postwar period commemorated, it is possible to get too sentimental about the Windrush era and forget the brutality of the racism they faced when they disembarked from those ships. They had been so very proud to come, but Britain’s reception was cooler than they might have expected.One issue was employment. The Windrush era spanned from 1948 to the early 1970s, but the first Race Relations Act was not until 1965. So, in the early years of the Windrush era, employers could brazenly refuse to employ someone because they were black and not even pretend there was another reason. Accordingly, most Windrush migrants went into sectors hit by postwar labour shortages like transport or factory work.Windrush-era women often went into the NHS. It was not an easy way to make a living. Nurses, in particular, were often on permanent nights or put into grades where there was plenty of backbreaking work but no promotion. Instead, they had to train younger white nurses and watch them climb the ladder. Despite all that, they were hugely proud of their jobs. Some people nowadays like to talk about the pressure immigrants put on the public services. But my mother’s generation helped to build the NHS.View image in fullscreenJamaican immigrants are welcomed after the Empire Windrush docked at Tilbury in Essex, 22 June 1948.Photograph: PAAnother problem was housing. Windrush-era migrants owned their own homes to an extent that might seem remarkable now. But it was not because they earned a lot of money. They had little choice. Before the 1965 Race Relations Act, many councils simply would not let to black people. The private sector was even worse. A notorious slum landlord of the time was Peter Rachman, who would charge double or treble the normal rent. He specialised in Caribbean tenants because they could get so few mainstream landlords to rent to them.My father, like very many Caribbean migrants of the time, bought a house in what was then a shabby part of west London. He accumulated the deposit using an intra-communitysaving scheme called “pardner”. But he paid the mortgage by having a tenant or a family in every room. We ourselves were in one room in that house with a cooker on the landing. When my father bought his house, there was an Irish family, headed by “Uncle Jimmy”, as sitting tenants in the basement. I don’t think Uncle Jimmy had encountered a black baby before. When I was born, he promptly fell in love. Every morning, my mother would give me breakfast. Then she would take me down to Uncle Jimmy and he would give me another breakfast.Yvette Cooper reinstates Home Office unit for post-Windrush culture changeRead moreIn the Windrush era, black people were often the victims of violence by bad actors such as teddy boys or fascist organisations such as the BNP. There was a backdrop of fear. The Notting Hill race riots were the culmination of years of teddy boys attacking black people. My mother used to tell a story about teddy boys storming down our west London road. They knocked on every door and if they found a black family inside, they beat them up. My parents waited petrified as the noise of the teddy boys grew nearer. Then out from our basement emerged Uncle Jimmy. He said very firmly “they are not getting our Diane” and when the teddy boys knocked on our door, he opened it. Seeing a white man, they assumed a white family lived inside and moved on to the next house.No one should ever underestimate the courage of the Windrush generation. Travelling from the Caribbean countryside to one of the biggest cities in the world in order to build a new life was an act of extraordinary daring. Nor could my parents, and that whole wave of Caribbean migrants who came here in the 1950s on the Empire Windrush and all the other ships, have ever guessed that their achievements would one day be celebrated with so many splendid events.

As ever, Dickinson spends much of the set on top of the backline, acting out characters, Steve Harris machine-guns the audience with his bass while playing his “galloping” lines, and Janick Gers, when not swinging his guitar around, sticks his left leg in the air and rests it on the stage side speakers. No idea why. But he always does it. And, of course, the song subjects are the contents of a 12-year-old’s head: the Battle of Britain (Aces High); crazy mental powers (The Clairvoyant); Satan (The Number of the Beast). You get the picture.The one deviation from usual, Dickinson informs us, is that this is as near as Maiden get to a greatest hits show: the most recent song tonight, Fear of the Dark, dates from 1992. For the less committed, that is a good thing. Maiden have a tendency to be windy, and this format – their early songs were generally shorter and sharper – helps with that, though it doesn’t eliminate it entirely. Rime of the Ancient Mariner lasts nearly as long as a cross-channel ferry, and you can’t even buy duty free to pass the time.Age is starting to show, too: Dickinson’s famous “air-raid siren” voice is still a thing of range and power, but it is more “car-alarm voice” now. And in this echoey, sweltering arena, some of the complexities of the sound are lost (the mix leaves new drummer Simon Dawson so low at times that one loses the beat; guitar solos are mixed so high the rest of the band sometimes disappear behind them), which is frustrating.But what an institution: a band whose career has been constructed absolutely on their own terms without a single compromise, something few artists can manage. And, of course, Birmingham screams for them, long and loud.Iron Maiden tour England and Ireland until 30 JuneExplore more on these topicsPop and rockIron MaidenreviewsShareReuse this content"

Adolescence, she says, has become like the wild westSun 22 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTShareReactions to Lauren Greenfield’s documentary seriesSocial Studiestend to fall into two categories. Young people think it is validating; adults think it’s a horror show. After all, the screen of a teenager’s smartphone is a shiny black hole to which access is rarely granted. “Our kids are right there,” as Greenfield puts it, “and yet we don’t really know what’s going on in their lives.”Her five-part series, which tracks the online and offline lives of a group of teenagers and young adults – the first generation of social media natives – is beingtipped for an Emmy. Under the noses of their parents, she captures teenagers climbing out of bedroom windows to spend the night with boyfriends, posting sexually explicit images, tracking their longest-ever fast (91 hours) and living out their experiences of rape, cyberbullying, whitewashing, the tyranny of Caucasian beauty standards and suicidal ideation. She makes adolescence look like the wild west.I was blaming my son for his screen time, and ended up feeling that’s like blaming an opium addict for their addiction“I really tried to go into this as a social experiment,” says Greenfield, speaking on a video call from the Fahey/Klein Gallery in Los Angeles, which is hosting a Social Studiesphotographic exhibitionuntil July. Initially she conducted more than 200 mini-interviews in high schools in LA, and then whittled these down to a cohort of about 25, who let her shoot them at home, at school, at parties, and in discussion groups over the course of the 2021-22 high school year. Crucially, they agreed to screen record, thereby sharing their online lives with Greenfield in real time. The result is a frenetic, immersive collage of a documentary, in which screens are overlaid on in-person lives. It is sometimes hard to keep pace, and hard to know where to look – but that is the point.Greenfield started out in anthropology; her first commission was for National Geographic, photographing Maya people in Mexico. Her mother, Patricia Marks Greenfield, a psychologist, was the writer. But after the project was dropped, she turned her gaze closer to home, to LA, where she grew up. Since her first monograph,Fast Forward: Growing Up in the Shadow of Hollywood, her work has focused on consumerism, extreme wealth, addiction and youth culture.The idea for Social Studies partly came from observing her youngest son Gabriel’s phone habits. He was 14 when she started filming the series. “We had constant battles about screen time.” Arguments? “Yes,” she says. “I never could control his access or see the content on his phone. He was super private about his phone, which is probably why I was so obsessed with getting into phones and really seeing what was in there.”View image in fullscreenGoing viral … Bella and Holly in Social Studies.Photograph: Lauren Greenfield/Institute/FXAlongside about 1,000 hours of documentary footage, Greenfield also captured 2,000 hours of screen-recorded content. Her son “helped to figure out the tech”. He was a year younger than most of the young people featured – and filming was personally confronting for Greenfield as a parent. Not least when she ran into him at a party she was filming.Making Social Studies has triggered her own evolution as a parent. “I was blaming my son for his screen time,” she says. “And I ended up feeling that’s like blaming an opium addict for their addiction.Social mediais made to be addictive – purposefully, for maximum engagement, and without any concern for the consequences.” Social Studies “brought me together with my teenager”, she says.Greenfield has previously said that she went into her 2002 monographGirl Culturewith an open mind “and came out a feminist”. (She later directed the#LikeAGirlSuper Bowl commercial.) Was the experience of filming Social Studies transformative too? Did she come out an activist?“I definitely came out thinking that we were giving a very unsafe environment to our young people and we needed to do something about it,” she says. “I did come out of it wanting to spread the word, raise awareness. It’s about collective action.”She hadn’t planned to include parents, which is interesting because those who do feature come off pretty badly. “All of the parents?” she asks me. All except Vito, who lovingly supports his children through transition and alternative education. But others come across as missing in action or nonplussed. A mother, whose daughter films thirst traps in her bedroom, says: “I really don’t want to look at Sydney’s TikTok.” A father stops his daughter using the app – by paying her $50 a day.View image in fullscreenRevelation after revelation … Lauren Greenfield at the Fahey Klein Gallery.Photograph: Jessica Pons/The Guardian“But they really represent all of us,” Greenfield says. “And not in a way where we can point a finger at them, but in a way where hopefully we are urged to reflect on ourselves. I mean, I didn’t know a lot of the questions to ask my own kids until I did this project.” When working on the project, she would go home and ask her sons – the eldest was 20 and already at college – “Have you heard of this BDSM trend?”For all the devastating revelations, there is humour here, too, as when one female participant says: “We don’t judge each other for [foot pics] but we also don’t feel super-empowered.” It is hard to tell if the teenagers are incredibly worldly or incredibly naive. “You start a TikTok to be in that TV show, movie-type life where everything comes easy for you,” says 17-year-old Keshawn, who soon after becomes a father.The shadow of Kim Kardashian looms large. Fittingly, her career tracks the arc of Greenfield’s own, since Greenfield shot a then unknown 12-year-old Kardashian for Fast Forward. In Social Studies, to nods of agreement, one girl announces: “I would release a sex tape if it made me viral.”Into the vacuum of adult regulation young people step, such as 20-year-old vigilante Anthony, who collects evidence from victims of assault and outs the perpetrators on social media. As he says, wisely and dispassionately: “I’m part of cancel culture. It kind of works. It kind of doesn’t work.”Greenfield implicates herself in the dynamic of absent adults. She asks the teenagers questions such as “Who here has been sent a dick pic? Who has gone viral?” (Pretty much everyone.) Dressed in unobtrusive navy, she is a peripheral presence, and the only adult hearing, receiving, capturing revelation after revelation.When kids set their parents’ screen time rules: ‘I hit my limit before I even get out of bed’Read moreShe initially thought about casting a therapist or teacher but “I realised it had to be me.” Though, she says: “I don’t like being in an authoritarian role at all.” Indeed, her presence sometimes feels like an absence, as when Sofia recounts her experience of being raped. Anthony helped her to gather evidence, but she hadn’t felt heard and validated by adults. In the most moving scene, Sydney reaches out and hooks Sofia’s fingers with her own.I wonder how Greenfield felt hearing a young woman share her experience of rape. Her attentive silence, while Sofia weeps, is notable. “Don’t I say, ‘Are you OK?’ and she says ‘Yeah, I’m OK’?” she asks.Greenfield does ask “OK?”, but as check-ins go, it’s pretty minimal. Given that she’s a parent, did it feel hard not to step into the space of the circle? “I mean, I thinkthatfelt very natural. If I could have avoided being in it altogether, I would have,” she says.So she didn’t go home burdened by the emotional weight of the stories she had documented?“It’s an interesting question.” She pauses. “I really love doing this work. It is so hard to get access and gain trust. When I’m hearing the stories, I’m so … fulfilled. My frustration is often if I can’t tell the story. When I can actually tell it, I’m so happy. A lot of the young people participated because they wanted to tell a story. And they got to tell that story.”View image in fullscreenVeronika, Tiffany and Michael on their way to the prom in Greenfield’s documentary Generation Wealth.Photograph: Lauren Greenfield/Courtesy of the Fahey/Klein GalleryGreenfield has also documented her own addiction to work. At one point in 2018’sGeneration Wealth, her 16-year-old son Noah tells her she’s a workaholic and a 10-year-old Gabriel holds up a piece of paper to the ever-present camera that says: “You have a problem.”In Social Studies, there is a sense in which Greenfield is present as a person who intimately knows, and was herself a childhood victim of, the addictive comparison culture she documents. In Girl Culture, she writes about her experience, aged six, of looking in the mirror and “realising that I was unimaginably ugly, and crying hysterically. I understood the pain and shame of not measuring up as a girl.” Maybe this girl, too, is in the circle in Social Studies.“That was also when my parents were splitting up,” she says. “So I think that was … maybe my origin trauma.” She would have found social media very hard as a teen. “I was super insecure as a teenager about my body, about fashion, about fitting in. And I was really looking to other kids. So I zeroed in on this [in Social Studies]. I think the 24/7 comparison culture is not just the end of innocence but the end of joy. You’re never happy with yourself.”It’s a trap to blame parents. The tech companies could make this completely different if they wanted to“What keeps me honest in my work is really coming from things that have affected me,” Greenfield says. Honesty is her medium – but not for too long on the subject of herself. When I ask about her arguments with her son, she says: “I feel it’s a trap to blame the parents. Really, the tech companies could make this completely different if they wanted to. These [apps] are made by humans, engineered to do exactly what they’re doing. They know so well what kids love, what will addict kids, they even know brain science, which I think used to be unethical – to use brain science in the creation of products for young people. We know from theTikTok research that was leakedthat [the app] is addictive in less than 35 minutes.“And I was really struck when I saw last year the Jim Henson movie, Idea Man,” she says. “The founder of Sesame Street – Joan Ganz Cooney – is talking about how they brought together artists who knew what kids loved – like Henson and the Muppet people – with educators who knew what kids needed to learn, and knew what was good for kids. And I was so moved by that,” she says. “It almost makes me want to cry.” Given her unflinching calm in the most emotional documentary scenes, I am surprised to see that her eyes are pink and she looks as if she really might cry. “Because it’s another time. When people cared about what young people were getting.”View image in fullscreenSydney in Social Studies.Photograph: Lauren Greenfield/FX/InstituteA few weeks ago, shewent to Sacramentowith some of Social Studies’ protagonists, to talk to senators. She has taken the series into schools. “I do feel [making Social Studies] has activated me,” she says.She mentions how the Australian government has banned social media for under-16s, and Common Sense Media’s campaign forhealth warnings on platforms. As Sydney points out in the series, once governments knew the dangers of smoking, they applied warnings. “In the US, it is unlikely that [regulation] will be done by government or tech, but there is a critical mass of parents and educators who are getting concerned,” Greenfield says.In the final episode of Social Studies, the group reflects on the experience of taking part. For many, holding a conversation without a phone – they had to leave them in a different room – was a rare liberation. “We all need to delete social media!” someone says – to the biggest round of applause. But the handclaps falter under existential questioning: “How do you get off social media without people forgetting that you exist?”We’ve given our communication to companies that are just thinking about their own profit“That really resonated with me,” Greenfield says. “They are showing us there’s a problem. They’re giving us a roadmap for how to solve it. But they can’t solve it on their own.” So what’s the roadmap? “We’ve given our communication to companies that not only don’t have our best interests in mind and are just thinking about their own profit but maybe have a political agenda. And that is terrifying. We need an independent form of communication where our information is not being marketed, sold.”Some kind of public platform, like a public utility? “Exactly. It’s a radical move to just say, ‘I’ll be off of [social media].’ As a person in the world, I can’t be off of it, either.” A public-service communication platform sounds like a pipe dream. Is it possible? “I feel like my job is to let people know what’s going on. I’m not a tech entrepreneur so I don’t know if it’s possible,” she says.But she is too invested to leave it there. “I do think it’s possible, actually,” she adds. “I absolutely think it is possible.”Social Studies is streaming on Disney+Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsLauren GreenfieldSocial mediaSmartphonesChildrenMobile phonesDigital mediainterviewsShareReuse this content"

Passionate about the theatre,Charles Dickens, then just 20, wrote to the famous Covent Garden theatre actor-manager George Bartley seeking an audition, saying he believed he “had a strong perception of character and oddity, and a natural power of reproducing in my own person what I observed in others”.Bartley responded saying they were producing “the Hunchback” and arranging an appointment. Dickens planned to take his sister, Fanny, to accompany him singing on the piano.Then Dickens fell ill “with a terrible bad cold” and missed the audition. By the time the next season came around he had embarked on the parliamentary reporter job that would firmly set him on his path to novelist. Would the world have been deprived of his literary canon but for the timing of that cold?Yet Dickens never abandoned his love of theatre, which is examined in detail in a new exhibition, “Showtime!”, opening on 23 July at theCharles Dickens Museumin London, highlighting his fondness of drama and the dramatic impact of his works.It was evident in how he constructed stories, published as weekly serials with a cliffhanger.In public readings he would physically act out episodes on tours around Britain and America. His most famous one, of the gruesome murder of Nancy by Bill Sykes in Oliver Twist, was so intense it is said it contributed to his death, aged 58, in 1870.View image in fullscreenPages of Charles Dickens’s reading copy of The Story of Little Dombey.Photograph: Lewis Bush/Charles Dickens MuseumThe dramatic quality of his stories has lent them easily to innumerable adaptations over two centuries, from those brazenly pirated by the Victorian dramatist Edward Stirling at the Adelphi in London during Dickens’s lifetime to The Muppets Christmas Carol in 1992.The actor Simon Callow, who has played many Dickensian characters on stage and screen, said: “Performing was central to Dickens’s life from a very early age. His father used to take him as a five-year-old to the local pub where he would recite and sing.“Perhaps the pivotal moment of his life was his cancellation because of illness of an audition with the greatest actor-manager of his day. Instead he took a job as a parliamentary reporter and then the course of his life was set.”But Dickens never stopped writing, directing and performing plays, said Callow, a patron of the museum. “All this came to a head in the public readings, which he performed for massive and astounded audiences on both sides of the Atlantic.”One such astounded spectator was Mark Twain, who wrote of one Dickens reading of a “spry, (if I may say it,) thin-legged old gentleman, gotten up regardless of expense, especially as to shirt-front and diamonds … the very Dickens came! He did not emerge upon the stage – that is rather too deliberate a word – he strode.”Emma Harper, the exhibition’s curator, said: “I don’t think many are aware of the extent of Dickens’s theatricality. And particularly that ‘sliding doors’ moment. I don’t know had he gone into acting as his main career whether writing would have been that side hustle for him. It’s a great ‘what if?’.”View image in fullscreenAnother page of Dickens’s reading copy of The Story of Little Dombey.Photograph: Charles Dickens MuseumDickens wrote to his friend John Forster of the missed audition: “See how near I may have been, to another sort of life.” He said he still thought of the theatre. “I begin to be once more of opinion that nature intended me for the Lessee of a NationalTheatre– and that pen ink and paper have spoiled a (Theatre) Manager.”Harper said: “His drama comes through. We have his reading copies where he is taking his own work, he’s editing it, he’s striking through on the book, glueing pages together, highlighting, writing in his own stage directions to make it as dramatic as possible.”He said Dickens’s daughter Mamie, telling of watching him work, “describes how he jumps up from his desk, goes towards the nearest mirror and he acts out what he’s just written; he does all the faces, the voices and then he rushes back to the desk to write it back down again, so to check that his description matches what he wants his audience to experience.”The exhibition, funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, explores 200 years of performances of Dickens’s stories, from his own edited reading copies to letters, posters, playbills, programmes, photographs and props. Yes, and even including from the Muppets. “Can’t do this without the Muppets!” said Harper.Showtime! is on 23 July 2025 – 18 January 2026 at theCharles Dickens Museumat 48 Doughty Street, Holborn, London.Explore more on these topicsCharles DickensTheatreExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She has little to hideLloyd GreenSun 22 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 08.02 EDTShareAt his wedding to Marla Maples inDecember 1993, two months after the birth of their daughter, Tiffany, Donald Trump got talking to Howard Stern.Accordingto the shock jock, Trump allegedly opined, charmingly: “Vagina is expensive.” Trump and Maplessplitin 1997. Nearly 30 years later, E Jean Carroll, an adjudicated victim of Trump’s verbal and sexual abuse, might at least in one way concur with his crude and sexist analysis.Carroll was assaulted by Trump in a changing room at Bergdorf Goodman, the New York department store. Thanks to court cases arising from that encounter, Trump owes her “slightly over $100m”, Carroll writes.Subtitled One Woman vs a President, at 368 pages her book – Not My Type – is a breezy read, packed with revenge, joy and barbed wit. Carroll is a former writer for Elle and Saturday Night Live, a biographer of Hunter S Thompson. At 81, she has little to hide.In court, Alina Habba, a Trump lawyer (now US attorney for New Jersey) said: “I hate to ask you this, but – approximately – how many people do you think you’ve slept with?“Eight? Could you list me those people?”Carroll approached it all with a disarming smile. But scars remain. There is venom in her book, however sweetly draped. Her contempt for Habba, for example, is unvarnished.Not My Type by E Jean Carroll.Photograph: St Martin’s PressIn May 2023, a federal civil juryfound Trump liablefor sexual abuse, forcible touching, and defamation. The jury awarded $5m in damages, rejecting Trump’s defense that Carroll was not his “type”. In a deposition, though, Trump mistook her for Maples. After the decision, Trump lashed out. That was a colossal mistake.“While I am sleeping, Trump has his CNN town hall and cracks everybody up with jokes about sexual assault and repeats every single thing that a unanimous federal jury just declared he has to pay me $5m for saying,” Carroll writes.“And, after I wake up? I sue him again.”It cost him. In January 2024, a second federal jury handed down another adverse verdict. The price tag topped $83m.Justice grinds on. So does interest accruing.“What am I gonna do with the $100m?” Carroll asks, quickly answering: “I,E Jean Carroll, pledge to make Trump very, very mad by giving most of the $100m to all things he hates. If Trump despises it … I’m gonna be giving money to it.”Think reproductive freedom, voting rights and combating the climate crisis.Trump haslosttwo rounds of appeals of the $5m judgment, the latest in early June. Review by the US supreme court seems likely. The second circuit intermediate appellate court, in Manhattan, is set to hear arguments in the $83m case later this month.Gleefully, Carroll takes a hatchet to Trump and a stiletto to his legal team. She homes in on Trump’s age, girth and flamboyance. Her prose is colorful and memorable. Though she is not above using simple words, to trash Trump as merely “old” and “fat”, in one very long and colorful sentence, she describes what she believes jurors witnessed:“Some are masked, all are upright, and, no way in God’s hell – whether they love Trump or loathe Trump – are they gonna miss telling their kids and grandkids that they saw the famous old geezer, with his peacock-blue tie jumping out in front of his shirt and his hair twirled across his forehead like Bette Davis in Now, Voyager, raise his small right hand and swear to tell the truth.”God, Trump, Bette Davis and peacocks. That’s writing.Habba, lead defense counsel at the second trial, earns particular scorn:“Wow! Alina Habba, Esq looks so pretty with her dark hair pulled into a low bun – the humble-brag of a beauty! – with her tremendous high heels, and her very tight, white sweater, and her electric-blue pantsuit hugging her round bottom, and her diamonds glittering from her ears.”The chaser: “At one point, when [Carroll’s counsel] is standing and objecting, Alina Habba, Esq smiles at the jury like Tiffany Haddish in Girls Trip, then turns to Judge Kaplan and asks: ‘Why is she objecting?’“His Honor replies: ‘This is not my law school examination.’”Kaplan and Carroll are not alone in their dim assessment of Habba. To quote the author Michael Wolff, she was “a lawyer with little relevant experience … hopelessly mismatched by Carroll’s legal team”.Carroll sheds light on prospective evidence that her team ultimately declined to introduce at trial, concerning Wolff, Trump and the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. She reminds us that in his book Too Famous, published in 2021, Wolff wrote that Trump “regaled” Epstein with “torrid details” of what passed between Trump and Carroll.Given the dramas of the Access Hollywood Tape and “Pussygate”, and Trump’s trial testimony that “unfortunately or fortunately” stars can grab women, Wolff’s tale carried at least a whiff of credibility. On the other hand, problems surrounding admissibility and hearsay might have been insurmountable. Furthermore, as Carroll writes, the “two words ‘Jeffrey Epstein’ are so flamingly prejudicial”. In the end, her legal team punted on injecting Epstein into the case.Hearteningly, Carroll is able to conclude her book on an upbeat note.“So, Friends, it looks like we are doing a bit of good here,” she writes. “We prove Trump is a liar. We changethe rape lawin New York.”At the first trial, the jury found that Trump had not raped Carroll because it determined that he had not penetrated her with penis. But after Judge Kaplandeterminedthe rape claim was “substantially true” in a 7 August 2023 decision, the statute wasamendedin early 2024. The “rape is rape” bill expanded the law to include nonconsensual anal, oral, and vaginal sexual contact.That victory belongs to Carroll alone.Not My Type: One Woman vs a Presidentis publishedin the US by MacmillanExplore more on these topicsBooksE Jean CarrollDonald TrumpreviewsShareReuse this content"

Fans resplendent in costumes inspired by their idol milled around the concourse, and groups of women took selfies, jigging with excitement.But among the jollity, specialist Met Officers interspersed in the crowd were on the hunt for something different: “We’re here to spot predatory men.”On the lookout for offences ranging from upskirting to sexual assault, seven specially trained officers stood on standby as scores of female fans, most of them aged between 14 and 30, filtered into the venue. They were there as part of an initiative billed as “the first of its kind” by the Met.The idea is to combat violence against women and girls in real time. According to the force, reports rose by more than a third between 2018 and 2023. By putting officers in places where women may be vulnerable, while they are distracted while dancing with friends or having enjoyed a drink at a concert, officers are hoping to bring down numbers by stopping attacks before they happen.View image in fullscreenOfficer Sherelle Jones hands a Dua Lipa fan a leaflet about the new initiative.Photograph: Andy Hall/The GuardianOne of the officers on patrol at the Lipa concert was 23-year-old Sherelle Jones. “I’d like to be the help that I wish I had if I was in that situation,” she said, watching a sea of pink cowboy hats and selfie sticks outside the stadium.The patrol was first rolled out on 5 June during Beyoncé’s sold-out Cowboy Carter tour at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and will provide an increased police presence at 51 large-scale concerts throughout the capital this summer. According to the Met, it has already led to the removal of one man on suspicion of stalking and threatening behaviour, and the arrest of another for upskirting.“I’m quite new to the job, but it’s been eye-opening,” said Jones, who joined the Met last year. “Even behaviour I witnessed at the Cowboy Carter tour when I was off duty made me see that this is really needed.”Many female concert-goers were inclined to agree: hours before the singer was due on stage, friends Maya Somerville and Anneka Terrance, who had travelled from Scotland to the stadium, had already planned their route home after dark.“As a woman, there are so many things that you automatically do that you shouldn’t have to,” said 28-year-old Somerville. “Like I sometimes walk home with my keys between my knuckles.”An increased police presence, said Terrance, means “you don’t have to be constantly looking over your shoulder every two seconds”.According to the group, there were 17 reports of violence against women and girls at London’s large-scale music events last year, but with the number of such events more than doubling in 2025, and 3 million people expected to attend events at Wembley alone, police fear the number could grow.View image in fullscreenAlicia Long (left) and Alyx Spanton (right).Photograph: Andy Hall/The GuardianNot everyone was quite so convinced that more police meant better protection for women. “Generally seeing a lot of officers puts me on edge,” said 24-year-old Alyx Spanton. “But especially when they’re male.”Of the seven officers on duty on Friday, just two were women. “This is a female-dominated event – there are so many other women around you that you generally just feel safe. Women support women better than police support women,” Spanton added.Her friend Alicia Long, 25, was similarly cynical: “When I hear the Met police, I automatically think of Sarah Everard.“For me, more police isn’t the solution. It’s bizarre – this is not the environment where I feel unsafe. A football event? That’s the one that needs this. Not a concert by a female artist attended by women.”Explore more on these topicsViolence against women and girlsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

For actors, it’s giving the opportunity to have a leading role in a film. For crew, if you’re in with a production company or in with a producer, you could work pretty much full-time at the moment because there’s so many being produced in the UK.”A key difference with conventional drama is production pace. Löwenstein says it is normal to shoot three pages of script a day on a standard feature, but with a vertical drama he has gone as high as 25. Obsessed is shooting 77 pages in seven days, cramming in lines like “I’m about to be engaged, you’re about to be married. One last round?” and “Wayne! You and your lawyer bitch are dead – you hear me? DEAD.”Löwenstein acknowledges the gap in quality between fast-moving, telenovela-style vertical dramas and conventional TV fare.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onreelshort.com.

But as a director it’s interesting to battle that, and still keep the quality in a way that keeps moving the story forward and keeps production value.”But there is still a “taboo” around the genre in the UK, he says. “Some people frown upon it still … Within the filming community, some actors, some crew, it’s not for them. And sometimes it’s not for me either. It depends on the script. But it is becoming more legit. As times goes on the scripts are getting better. ”He adds that he likes experimenting with new formats and finds vertical dramas an “interesting new space to play in” although he is also developing multiple feature films.Demand for vertical content is increasing rapidly, with a significant audience in the US. Global downloads of vertical drama apps like ReelShort and FlexTV rose 460% last year, while monthly user numbers for those apps have reached nearly 600 million so far this year, up 131% on the same period in 2024, according to data from Sensor Tower.View image in fullscreen‘Vertical drama filled a gap in my work,’ says the hair and makeup artist Zoey Edwards.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianObsessed has a crew of 22 and the budget comes within the typical range of vertical dramas of $150,000-$250,000 (£110,000-£185,000).Zoey Edwards, a hair and makeup artist who worked on Löwenstein’s Pride and Prejudice and whose previous experience includes Bridgerton, has worked on five vertical dramas in the UK. She says the work came at a time when the whole UK TV and film industry was struggling with the impact of the 2023 Hollywood writer and actor strikes.“It was nine months that I didn’t work in film and TV. But once film and TV production came back the industry did not get back to the level it was at before. Vertical drama filled a gap in my work.”She adds: “It’s not the most exciting of jobs or most gripping of scripts but it was still fun to do what you are qualified to do and be around people who understand your profession”.Tom Walder, who was worked as a director of photography on more than a dozen UK-shot vertical dramas over the past year including the Austen adaptation, says vertical dramas have been a vital addition to an industry that he says has been stuck in a post-Covid lull.“Vertical dramas have definitely helped me become more financially free,” he says, adding they have provided a “multitude” of film professionals with more opportunities as vertical drama filming has taken off this year.“It’s a pleasure to be one of the pioneers of such a novelty,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mega Matrix forecast last year that the short drama market, worth $5bn in 2023,could reach $36bn by 2027.Han admits there have been problems on shoots. Vertical dramas got off to a bad start when they first started shooting in the UK, she says, with issues such as inexperienced producers and crew.“At the very beginning a few of the companies were not very professional and there were safety concerns,” she says.From Lost Heiress to Royal Highness.A British TV crew member who has worked on vertical dramas over the past year said there was “an element of the wild west” about this industry niche, amid concerns over safety, long hours and low pay. Another says vertical dramas can be “rushed film sets” and “accidents always happen when you are rushing”. But, says another crew professional, the choice is sometimes between working on a vertical drama or a “pub job”. The Guardian has also been told of one UK-shot vertical drama where crew members are still awaiting payment.Pengyu Lyu, a producer on Obsessed for FlexTV, says the reason for shooting in the UK is simple. The target audience is located in the west so you shoot “anywhere the mother language is based.” There is the option to useChinaas a “western” location but it “looks like China”, he says. FlexTV has shot three vertical dramas in the UK over the past year.Asked about safety, hours and pay, he adds: “Whichever country we film in, we will follow the local law and working requirements, so unsafe filming conditions, low pay and long working hours are not really happening.”Wenting Yuan, a head writer and producer at FlexTV, says the reasons for shooting in the UK can depend on the theme of the drama as well. From Lost Heiress to Royal Highness, a FlexTV drama, was shot in Britain because the UK is “more suitable for themes related to royalty and aristocracy. Currently filming costs in the UK are somewhat lower than in the US,” she adds.Some in the industry see a direct link between the rise of the cheap dramas in the UK and the long-running crisis in traditional television production,which has seen many experienced people out of work.According to one senior producer, “there’s definitely a swing to cheaper alternatives as fewer people are actually watching broadcast TV and vertical dramas are a good example. But for people in the industry who are used to their work paying for their mortgages and feeding their children, there’s just not enough money being earned from them.”In the meantime, Löwenstein says vertical dramas are a medium worth getting a “grasp on” because of the sheer amount of phone use in modern society.“There are two end goals: to drive up the quality level of vertical dramas and to work on films and high-end TV more often.”Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe news on TVTelevisionFilm industryChinaTelevision industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

John Palmer has a galloping cocaine habit and dozens of angry pensioners to deal with in Tenerife. Charlie Miller is finding that exile in Costa Rica doesn’t offer total protection. And Kenneth Noye has attracted the attention of the police for a brutal and brand new crime. The story is labyrinthine and the cast, led by Hugh Bonneville, Jack Lowden and Charlotte Spencer, is excellent.Phil HarrisonCapital’s Summertime Ball 20255.30pm, ITV1A week after the event, here are highlights from Capital’s big Wembley pop gig, and the lineup is impressively starry. As well as Jade, Lola Young and Renee Rapp are veteran chart-toppers including Jessie J, Will Smith and the regal headline act, Mariah Carey.Jack SealeDeath Valley8.15pm, BBC OneNothing about this cosy crime drama is groundbreaking and the premise of this episode feels strikingly familiar: a murder mystery event that turns into a real-life crime scene. Surely a situation in which Timothy Spall’s crime-fighting thesp John Chapel will be in his element? If only he wasn’t distracted by the prospect of romance.PHThis Cultural Life: Sheku Kanneh-Mason9pm, BBC FourView image in fullscreenAll things strings … This Cultural Life: Sheku Kanneh-Mason on BBC Four.Photograph: BBC StudiosAhead of a repeated Proms performance from siblings Sheku and Braimah Kanneh-Mason, this documentary finds Sheku talking to John Wilson about his influences.

His Hollywood screenwriter Dixon Steele is sardonic and bitter, with a history of getting into fights. And when he is suspected of the murder of a hat-check girl, his blithe indifference raises the hackles of the cops. That doesn’t stop new neighbour Laurel (a superb Gloria Grahame) falling for him, but as she gets to know Dixon better her suspicions rise. An edgy mystery, with Bogart an opaque, menacing presence.Simon WardellStagecoach, 12.45pm, 5ActionView image in fullscreenA bumpy ride … Stagecoach on 5Action.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyCelebrated for making stars of John Wayne and its chief location, Monument Valley, John Ford’s 1939 film also showed that the western could allow for moral complexity in between shootouts. With renegade Apache Geronimo on the warpath, an assortment of ill-matched passengers find themselves on a dangerous journey. These include Wayne’s escaped convict, a sex worker, a drunken doctor, a cavalry officer’s wife and a thieving bank manager. Naturally, the rough and ready types prove more reliable than their social betters when push comes to shove.SWHappy Gilmore, 9pm, Comedy CentralJust in case the upcoming Netflix sequel doesn’t quite live up to expectations, here’s Adam Sandler’s 1996 slapstick comedy to prove where most of its best jokes originated. Sandler’s Happy is a dreadful ice-hockey player with a hair-trigger temper but he possesses a stupendously hard shot, which when adapted to the game of golf proves an unlikely boon. The disconnect between the etiquettes of the two sports is fertile ground for laughs, as is Sandler’s man-child shtick.SWSaltburn, 10.30pm, BBC OneView image in fullscreenBurning up … Saltburn on BBC One.Photograph: Courtesy of PrimeWriter-director Emerald Fennell has her gateau and eats it in this dark comedy thriller, satirising the British aristocracy while revelling in their massive houses and insouciant confidence.

The subsequent intrigue and flagrant rug-pulling as Oliver struggles to fit in make for a vivacious, vicious experience.SWExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is it actually fun, or just a bit like homework?Caitlin WelshSun 22 Jun 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 20.15 EDTShareThere are two kinds of readers: those who would choose death before dog-ears, keeping their beloved volumes as pristine as possible, and those whose books bear the marks of a life well read, corners folded in on favourite pages and with snarky or swoony commentary scrawled in the margins. The two rarely combine in one person, and they definitely don’t lend each other books. But a new generation of readers are finding a way to combine both approaches: reviving the art and romance of marginalia, by transforming their books and reading experiences into #aesthetic artifacts.“I keep seeing people who have books like this,”says one TikToker, their head floating over a greenscreened video of fat novels bristling with coloured sticky tabs. “What are you doing? Explain yourselves! Because this looks likehomework. But also … I do like office supplies.”Novel crimes: which is worst – folded corners, cracked spines, marginalia or cheese bookmarks?Read moreInBookTokand Bookstagram communities – where social media users post reviews, recommendations and memes about reading – there are subcommunities devoted just to annotating and “tabbing” books. The level of intensity and commitment varies; some BookTokkers have complex colour-coding systems (pink tabs and highlighters for romantic moments, blue for foreshadowing) or rules that are simply aesthetically pleasing. Some scribble in the margins to mark moments that are especially shocking or satisfying, or draw droplets or hearts around especially sexy passages. For some, annotation is as essential now as sharing shelfies or writing reviews.Marcela, a Melbourne-based Bookstagrammer originally from the US, posts about her reading habits online as@booksta.babe. She began doing it last year after more than a decade of being active in fantasy and young adult fandoms, as well as “studygram” and other groups dedicated to beautiful-looking and complex notes and lists, created on nice stationery.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continue“Before I technically realised I was ‘annotating’, I would scribble little reactions and messages in the margins, so I could remember what I was thinking when I was experiencing a story or world for the first time,” Marcela recalls. Now she annotates usingcolour-coordinated tabs and pens, in addition to herreading journals. She is selective with which books she puts this extra work into, sticking mostly to stories she knows she’ll reread – such as her current annotation project, Sarah J Maas’ Throne of Glass series.“It has really helped me enjoy the rich world-building and character development even more,” Marcela says. “You can clearly see my opinions on characters shift by following through my notes, and I love being able to refer back and see plot predictions I made at the beginning of the series either come true or be proven wrong.”The dominant fandoms represented in the annotating and tabbing communities, as they are on BookTok and Bookstagram more broadly, are the booming romance and romantasy genres. Academic and author Dr Jodi McAlister says this is in large part because of the mainstream success of bestsellers such as Emily Henry, Ali Hazelwood’s elevated-fanfic hit The Love Hypothesis, and Maas’ A Court Of Thorns and Roses series, which has helped to dispel much of the stigma that used to exist around reading romance novels. Fans are still working out ways to perform their fandom and find community, much in the same the way sci-fi and fantasy readers have been doing for decades.View image in fullscreenTikTok user Angel Zheng annotating books.Composite: Guardian Design/Angel Zheng/@angelzzheng“This is a community that is still figuring out what reading romance looks like in public because they haven’t had a model, and one of the ways it has manifested is this performance of love of the physical object of the book,” McAlister says; her latest romance novel, An Academic Affair, even includes a male scholar who “annotates his books like a BookTok girlie”.“When we think about the way that romance has been denigrated as trash for so long, what they’re doing is performatively turning it into this incredibly treasured, incredibly valued object … by annotating it, you’re making thatyourcopy, you are memorialising your experience of it,” she adds.It is what her fellow scholar Jessica Pressman calls“bookishness”: a post-digital behaviour that has developed among passionate readers. But that is not to say it is purely performative: annotating a novel can allow us to retrace our first journey with a book, as well as revisit our state of mind at the time. I think of the last book that made me cry,Meg Mason’s Sorrow and Bliss– what would my marginalia have looked like when I read it back in 2021, sobbing through the final pages at the reflections of my own struggles with mental illness? What would I see now in the notes I’d made then?Why Marlene Dietrich’s witty marginalia only add to her appeal | Steven PooleRead moreAnnotation has also become a way of connecting: some BookTokkers lavishly annotate a copy of their friend’s favourite book as a gift, stacking the margins with observations and jokes; Marcela is excitedly planning to do this for her best friend. A dear friend of mine inherited the habit from his late mother and he now treasures the precious “scribblings” in the margins of her history and poetry books. Some people specifically seek out books annotated by other readers in secondhand shops – a spark of connection with the past – or even by their authors; last year, Ann Patchett released an annotated edition of her novel Bel Canto,though she warnedthat with “constant interruptions” and spoilers it was not designed to be anyone’s first experience. But annotating her own work, she wrote, revealed “patterns in the book I’d scarcely been aware of … it helped me clarify the way I write”.I’m like McAlister, who says that while she annotates her academic reading, well, like an academic, she’s usually too immersed in books to annotate for fun. But this week I sat down with a pencil and got stuck into a biography of John and Sunday Reed I’d been passing over for more escapist fare. And I did, in fact, find myself jotting exclamation points in the margins at salacious details and scribbling in my judgy little asides as though I was whispering to a friend.If it feels a little like homework, maybe that’s not a bad thing. Even reading for fun alone could still be enhanced by the intentionality and slower pace required for annotation; the extra few seconds it takes to draw a star next to an especially satisfying paragraph lets you sit in that satisfaction, just a moment longer.Explore more on these topicsBooksTikTokInstagramfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It could be any amateur choir in any town hall, but this motley group first meet to be among fellow lesbians and then embark on a quest to perform on the main stage of the Pride festival in a national competition.For a while, Iman Qureshi’s comic musical drama follows an “against-all-odds” trajectory, in the mould of a good, old-fashioned underdog endeavour warmly reminiscent of The Full Monty or Calendar Girls. It is exuberant and uplifting, accomplishing the extraordinary feat of being broad and universal in its appeal, yet speaking to and about the lesbian and queer community.Directed by Hannah Hauer-King, characters are comic but run clear of cliche; everyone is flawed but lovable, more and more as they reveal who they are. Shuna Snow infuses her part as conductor and Older Wiser Lesbian (OWL) with adorable physical comedy; Leah Harvey is excellent as Lori who is only half out of the closet; Georgie Henley’s performance, as Lori’s partner, Ana, grows from strength to strength. The frisson between Fi (Liz Carr) and Bridget (Mariah Louca) feels delicious until it turns into ideological schism, while Fanta Barrie is charming as the group’s lothario. Serena Manteghi is charming as Dina too, although her storyline (a woman in a controlling heterosexual relationship) is the only one which feels under-written. Zak Ghazi-Torbati, acting all marginal male parts, brings great comic froth.The interpersonal gripes and tensions are not huge in the first hour of the drama but, like paper cuts, surprisingly painful for something so small. There is sentiment but it is never sugary or manipulative. The serious brushes closely alongside the comic and vice versa. Connie, as the OWL is sent up for her old-school language, but so is Ana for the tyranny of her political correctness while there are passing, playful, digs at pronouns.To add to the mood-transforming magic are the songs, which are by turns funny (especially in a Bizet, Charli xcx and Lady Gaga mashup), full of feeling, and heart-stoppingly lovely in a cappella.There is a sharp left turn after the interval when the play re-orients its tone and purpose, so it seems, to turn audaciously into something different. Its arc is no longer that of the uplifting endeavour. Now it talks more directly about issues around these women’s identities and sexualities, from the attenuation of public spaces for lesbians to everydayhomophobia. At the centre is acrisis-point over trans identity that hits this choir.But drama is never sacrificed on the altar of sincerity.Story takes primacy and like best “heart warming” narratives, it wriggles its way in your heart to take residency there, weaving its delicate balance between the silly, sweet and serious. Having had a first run at Soho theatre in 2022, this is a second incarnation. Let’s hope for a third. Genuinely heart warming, and utterly winning with it.At Kiln theatre, London, until 12 JulyExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreLGBTQ+ rightsKiln theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Within three songs of appearing at theRoyal Albert Hallshe had invited her 5,000-strong audience to sing along with her. You and Me on the Rock’s evocation of family life became the best wedding karaoke ever.Carlile has been a voice for the marginalised in the rural roots scene for two decades. But her largest headline show in the UK – part of a five-date UK and Ireland tour climaxing at Glastonbury – suggests her outlier-country is now legitimately mainstream here. Her No 1 album withElton Johnplayed no small part and this setlist paid gracious tribute to her collaborator. She even serenaded him with a yearningly harmonised version of its title track as he sat in his box like a silent angel.Despite his retirement Elton seemed a constant presence on stage, from the 80s pop-rock of Swing for the Fences to his protege’s patter about a recent dinner with David. He even approved the tie to go with her natty black suit, although not her cover of Joni Mitchell’s A Case of You. She sang it anyway – sparingly solo, with woozy panache.Elton may have encouraged Carlile towards her recent rockier sound but it’s a gear she has always had. Few artists are so authentically versatile they could open with a lush and timeless crooner ballad, entreating us to Stay Gentle, then immediately unleash the hot-rubber-and-leather vibes of Broken Horses.Her clarinet-smooth voice stretched to ever greater technical feats throughout the night, until ululations turned to screams and individual notes threatened to hang forever in the ceiling. A fingerpicking acoustic medley paired two her greatest songs about motherhood, and their Art Garfunkel tenderness unleashed waves of catharsis in the largely female audience.On their feet for Hold Out Your Hand – half Lumineers, half Charlie Daniels Band – the mom rockers were less confident as Carlile ventured into grungier territory and by the time she was duelling guitars with the Hanseroth Twins they seemed a little lost. The show’s landing was its sole stumble: a dazzling but late interlude by violin and cello duo SistaStrings indicated that Carlile was on the move, and up she popped up in Elton’s box, spotlit by a condenser mic, her BFF sitting silently beside her.Was it worth the effort? By the time she had raced back for her closer, the show had lost momentum and an expected encore (the house lights staying defiantly down) never came. Still, a minor quibble of an artist who shines just as bright without the reflected sparkle of her diamond-bright duetting partner.Brandi Carlile is touring the UK and Ireland until 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsPop and rockBrandi CarlileElton JohnRoyal Albert HallreviewsShareReuse this content"

The least monumental of the symphonies, though still clearly long, it lent itself well to being scaled down, with each of the 14 instruments plus soprano in the last movement treated as soloists and the listener being given a new aural perspective on even the most familiar passages.In the hands of the top players that David Adams and Alice Neary bring together for their annual Penarth festival, the clarity and eloquence both of Mahler’s flowing contrapuntal writing and of his harmonies seemed to emerge newly minted. Schönberg himself had conducted that first concert; here, Ryan Bancroft was a quietly animated presence, alert to the teeming detail and to the irresistibly dancing lilt. Yet, in what is sometimes only characterised as the child-like innocence of this symphony, lurks the grim reaper figure, said to have been inspired byArnold Böcklin’s self-portrait, the scordatura mis-tuning of the violin giving death’s devilish waltz its grotesque edge. And even in the last movement’s setting of Das Himmlische Leben from Des Knaben Wunderhorn, always Mahler’s conscious destination for the work, the litany of saints have a delicious touch of anarchy about them. SopranoRebecca Evanscaptured both the mischievous excitability of the child’s vision of heaven and also the ethereal joy.Programming the two movements of the String Octet Op 11 by the young Shostakovich was a clever pointer to the affinity he would always have with Mahler. The drama and mystery of the Prelude and the whirling wildness of its Scherzo certainly made for an arresting opening to the evening.By contrast, the Clarinet Quintet Op 115 by Brahms that followed traced the late reflection of this composer’s life-long concerns with richly expansive line and a mellowness of sound, the two violas darkening the colours. The almost concertante flourish of Robert Plane’s clarinet in the Adagio second movement was vivid while, in the theme and variations of the final Con Moto, each individual player – and notably cellist Rebecca Gilliver – could relish their moment in the sun, beautifully played.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicGustav MahlerPenarthFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Madrid, 1982. Photograph: Marisa Flórez.Five decades of pictures by the Spanish photojournalist Marisa Flórez are celebrated in the austere confines ofSala Canal de Isabel II. A veteran of the Informaciones and El País newspapers, her work comprises a fascinating chronicle, spanning politics, showbusiness, art and culture, of the initially male-dominated spaces of the post-Franco years.Flórez was on hand to cover the implementation of the country’s new constitution; she saw the motorcade return to Spain of Pablo Picasso’s exiled Guernica; she covered the terrorist attacks of the Eta years; and she documented the growth in newly permissible street demonstrations. She even photographed Margaret Thatcher opening a Marks & Spencer store.More broadly, Flórez’s pictures, and indeed her own presence in the newsroom, testified to a cultural shift within the nation. “What happened during this period of time: we had the incorporation of women in every sphere – because women before that were limited to the home,” she said. “There was a mother, a daughter, a wife, and nothing more. Finally, we had not only women in the army, but everywhere else.”View image in fullscreenWomen in Yeserías Prison, Madrid 1981.

Plus, a letter byJohn LowrieSun 22 Jun 2025 11.50 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Jun 2025 11.51 EDTShareYour article (‘Ayahuasca tourism’ is a blight on Indigenous peoples and our environment, 17 June) brings up important concerns but it looks at a complicated issue too narrowly. It is worth remembering that the word “ayahuasca” itself is not a modern invention, but a Quechua term meaning “vine of the soul”. It is just one of many names used for the ceremonial medicine across different Indigenous cultures – others include yagé, kamarampi, caapi, oasca and daime. Suggesting that only “hayakwaska” is “correct” erases the diversity of ancestral traditions across the Amazon basin.The claim that ayahuasca is marketed as a “mystical shortcut” overlooks the reality: real work with this medicine is neither quick nor easy. True healing through ayahuasca involves deep inner effort, often accompanied by discomfort, surrender and courage – whether one is Indigenous or not.The criticism of cultural distortion and biodiversity loss is valid, especially that tourism encourages the illegal wildlife trade. But we must also acknowledge that many of the products sold to tourists (such as jaguar parts) are offered by local individuals. Given their cultural knowledge and connection to the forest, Indigenous communities can and should take leadership in educating both locals and visitors, promoting sustainable and ethical practices.To ask, “How are ‘ayahuasca tourists’ giving back?” is fair. Yet tourism – when done responsibly – can be a vital source of income for rural areas, offering alternatives to logging, mining and drug trafficking. It provides jobs and preserves cultural relevance for younger generations.Enrico MalatestaWanay Community Retreat Center, Mocoa, ColombiaI agree wholeheartedly with Nina Gualinga and Eli Virkina that ayahuasca tourism takes the shaman away from their sacred work, which is the community and the land. I know that as a UK-based shamanic healer, my work is with this land. This is what brings harmony to the soul.The plants and trees of any country are the wisdom keepers and healing cannot happen anywhere unless the land is being tended and healed. This involves releasing the souls of war and empire-building, reinstating the guardians of the sacred sites and bringing ourselves back to reciprocity.Knowing our roots and tending them brings us back into relationship with ourselves. This land and our hearts need our ancestral tending right now. For our healing to involve going toEcuadorfor spiritual tourism, when there is so much ancestral and earth tending to do on our soil, shows how disconnected we still are from land and mother.We cannot find that anywhere else. The plants of these sacred isles hold so much love and wisdom now in our return to the land as a mother, as a sentient loving source who holds us. The sacred plants of these isles are dandelions, thistles, dock and nettle – they support us and guide us. Our trees are oak, birch and rowan, hawthorn. It is our communication and relationship with the earth mother and the plant spirits. A sovereign connection between ourselves and our earth.Emily WebsterLancasterIt’s always fascinating to learn about such distant remote Indigenous communities, and yet find so much in common, such as their innate respect for nature. The onset of modern tourism – often appended with “eco”, “sustainable” and “responsible” by those exploiting Indigenous people – is a common phenomenon.However, is there a lesser of two evils? “Ayahuasca” in Ecuador, as described in your piece, or the wholesale taking-over of Indigenous lands, livelihoods and cultures that we see inCambodia? The forced assimilation in to the mainstream population was most violently imposed during the notorious 1970s Khmer Rouge regime but goes on insidiously ever since.John LowrieTa Khmau, CambodiaExplore more on these topicsIndigenous peoplesDrugsMental healthColombiaEcuadorEndangered speciesSouth America holidayslettersShareReuse this content"

Long summer evenings, with temperatures rarely topping 30C, form the backdrop for rooftop bars thrumming with live DJs, as well as alfresco concerts in leafy parks, while the beautiful sandy beaches of seaside Jūrmala are just a half-hour bus ride away.Any visit should begin with a wander along the banks of the city canal and down Alberta Street, lined with ornate art nouveau mansions. Stop to refuel at the sprawlingCentral Market, housed in five former German Zeppelin hangars, offering dozens of local cheeses, smoked meats and classic dark rye breads – perfect sandwich fare.The streets kick into life in summer, with free weeklyconcerts on Wednesdaynights in Dzegužkalns park and in theVērmanes gardens on Fridaysin August, while jazz and world music fans should visit between 2 and 5 July for theRīgas Ritmimusic festival.Where to stayBehind an art nouveau frontage,Hotel Neiburgs(from €114 B&B) combines the flexibility of self-catering apartments with hotel add-ons such as an excellent restaurant, fitness room and small spa.Antwerp, BelgiumView image in fullscreenMAS Antwerp, a striking museum on the River Scheldt.Photograph: Random Lights/AlamyAnyone who thinks Belgium is a bit boring has never been to Antwerp – an artsy, quirky city packed with cocktail bars, coffee shops and independent art galleries that sparks into alfresco life in summer. On sunny weekends, Sint-Anneke beach (on the left bank of the River Scheldt) fills up with locals dipping their toes in the water and lunching on mussels at one of the many bistros that line the riverbank. Parks and open spaces become venues for street theatre, circus acts and open-air cinema, particularly during theZomer van Antwerpenarts festival (19 June to 31 August).To get an idea of the city’s rich history, visitMAS, an architecturally striking museum on the river, with each floor charting Antwerp’s history as a global trading port, topped with a huge rooftop terrace that gives spectacular 360-degree views.Antwerp runs on its stomach, with microbreweries, chocolate shops andmoules friteson every corner. The latest addition isWolf, a food market with 10 restaurants. Pick up a picnic to eat in the gardens ofMiddelheim Museum’sworld-class sculpture park. It features six zones exploring the relationship between humans and nature through abstract installations and strikingly innovative pieces, such as Erwin Vurm’sboat curving off a jetty, Misconceivable.Where to stayIn the historic centre,Hotel Matelote(from €115 B&B) features chic, minimalist design within the framework of two 16th-century buildings.Bolzano, ItalyView image in fullscreenBolzano offers a fusion of German and Italian influences.Photograph: Prisma by Dukas Presseagentur/AlamyThe capital of the South Tyrol – a fusion of Germanic architecture and history with Italian culture and food, set among the spectacular peaks of the Dolomites – is a gem. Surrounded by vineyards and lush mountain plateaux, it has one of the best summer music scenes in Europe. Jazz fans should visit between 27 June and 6 July, when theSüdtyrol jazz festivaloffers more than 50 concerts across the region, while theBolzano Festival Bozen(5 August-7 September) is a treat for classical music lovers, with performances held in some of the city’s most beautiful buildings, including Dominican cloisters and the 13th-century Castel Mareccio.Most visitors to Bolzano head out to explore the spectacular scenery – at its loveliest in the summer months – either on foot along the city’s greenways or by taking a cable car up to theRitten plateau. The Guncina Promenade is a 2.8-mile (4.5km) walk from the centre of the city out into the hills, with lovely views back across the skyline, while hiking trails unfold from the 1,227-metre high cable station at Oberbozen, along with the South Tyrol’s only surviving narrow-gauge railway. The big historic draw in Bolzano is Ötzi, a 5,300-year-old mummified iceman found by hikers in 1991 and sensitively displayed at theSouth Tyrol Museum of Archaeology.Where to stayGoldenstern Townhouse(doubles from €149 room-only) is set in the city’s medieval arcades and makes a wonderful base.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Näsetbadet and Askimsbadet beaches are short bus rides away, while a tram to the ferry port opens up the tranquil waters, unspoilt villages and long sandy beaches of the Gothenburg archipelago. Explore by kayak or island-hop by ferry, with the waterside deck atTullhusetrestaurant on Hönö island a great spot for a seafood lunch, before a paddle on the long stretch of sandy shoreline on Rivö island.Gothenburg is famed for its oysters and seafood, best sampled atFeskekörka, the city’s waterfront fish market hall, which houses a clutch of excellent restaurants and a sunlit outdoor terrace. The city also has a centuries-long history of craft brewing and 40 independent breweries, many with tap rooms and restaurants. Sink a couple atPoppels Citybryggeri, or try the innovative brews atSad Robot, open on Friday and Saturday nights.Need to clear a thick head?

Popular spots for a swim include the artificial beach at Eaux-Vives on Lake Geneva (including a doughnut-shaped overwater deck and central pool), the floating “beach platform” at the Quai de Cologny and the Genève-Plage, where all manner of watersports, from yachting to paddleboarding, are on offer alongside a straightforward dip.A great choice for vinophiles, the lattice of streets in the Vieille Ville (old town) are dotted with wine bars, from sleekly modernSoul Winesto the more traditionalVino Olio Caffe. Most roads lead to theCathédrale Saint-Pierre, where the imposing vaulted exterior is a precursor to the spectacular lake views from its towers. After sightseeing, there’s plenty more to enjoy; truffle out vintage finds at the Plainpalais flea market (Wednesdays and Saturdays), learn about the city’s watchmaking history at thePatek Philippemuseum, or soak up live music at the Genève-Plage with three nights of alfresco performances at theOrchestre de la Suisse Romande festival(21-23 August).It’s a pleasingly indulgent city, too, filled withfromageriesand farmers’ markets (the best are at the Plainpalais on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday and Eaux-Vives on Wednesday and Saturday). For the ultimate treat, snag a table atLe Gruyérienfor fondue, best worked off with a hike across the green slopes of Mont Salève – just a five-minute cable-car ride from the city.Where to stayIn a city of ruinously pricey hotels, theTiffany by Fassbind(from 122 Swiss francs/£109 room-only) is a relative steal, tucked away on a quiet street in the Les Bains neighbourhood with a chic terrace restaurant.Accommodation prices correct at time of going to press.

One bite later, I regretted my generosity: crunchy, buttery and filled with sweetcorn and salty, stringy cheese, I could easily have polished off the whole thing without any help.These, I later learned, were Colombianarepas de choclo, but arepas – flat, unleavened maize patties that pre-date European settlement – are found in many forms and flavours in many other countries, too, most notably Venezuela, but also Bolivia, Ecuador and parts of Central America. AsJ Kenji López-Alt noteson Serious Eats, to think of arepas like thick tortillas “is the equivalent of a Colombian native hearing about bread and saying: ‘Oh, it’s that European wheat cake, right?’” Within the first three days of his first visit to the country, he says he sampled more than a dozen different variations: “Arepas stuffed with cheese and baked on hot stones in coal-fired ovens. Arepas with sour milk cheese worked right into the dough. Arepas de choclo, made like a pancake with sweetcorn on a hot griddle.Arepas de huevo, golden yellow deep-fried puffy arepas split open and stuffed with an egg. Tinyarepitaseaten as a snack. Even packs of arepa-flavoured corn chips.”View image in fullscreenRipping success: Felicity’s perfect cheese arepas. All thumbnails by Felicity Cloake.So much to eat, so little time, but here I’ve chosen to remain loyal to my first love and focus on the Colombian cheese-stuffed version. Even so, seeing as that country alone is estimated to have 75 kinds, this can only ever be a very partial survey. Still, it’s a good start, and an even better breakfast.The cornmealThis is likely to be the trickiest aspect of the whole process, because arepas are made from dried cooked cornmeal (these days sold ready-made), rather than the dried raw corn sold in the UK as cornmeal or polenta, or the masa harina used to make tortillas, which has been nixtamalised (treated with an alkali to remove the hull and make it easier to grind, as well as increasing its nutritional availability). AsSharon Glascoe of the Certified Pastry Aficionado blognoteswith commendable firmness: “Masarepa is the most important ingredient. There is no substitute for the specific cornmeal used for arepas. If you’re unsure if you have the right kind, check the package. It should say what the flour can be used for. Also, most masarepa packages have an arepas recipe on the back, so if you see that, you got the right kind.”Though it comes in yellow, too, I’m assured that white masarepa is most commonly used for Colombian arepas. Those in major cities should be able to source it quite easily, but, it is also available online – the two major brands seem to be PAN andGoya.The liquidNaturally, the flour must be wetted to become a dough, and in such a simple recipe (the one on the back of the PAN packet is simply flour, water and salt), the ratio of dry to liquid ingredients is of primary importance. López-Alt’s dough is the driest, using two parts flour to one part water, “plus more as necessary”.Patricia McCausland-Gallo’sSecrets of Colombian Cooking,Erica Dinho’s blogMy Colombian RecipesandMaricel Presillain the New York Times all opt for equal parts. Others recommend using more liquid than flour – PAN most of all, with one and a half parts of water to every one of flour.View image in fullscreenPAN’s packet arepas turn out to be a little ‘austere’.López-Alt reckonsthat the “key is to use only as much moisture as is necessary to get a dough that doesn’t crack when you shape it. Too much water, and you’ll end up with dense, gummy arepas.” I obediently follow his lead and add another good splash of water, too. But, though the dough feels smooth and supple as instructed, it still cracks slightly on shaping, leading me to tend it anxiously with water as it cooks (which,an old eGullet thread claimsactually helps to crisp up the outside, which is no bad thing).While López-Alt’s arepas are certainly crunchy rather than gummy, I find wetter doughs far easier to work with, especially given that the dough continues to solidify as the flour absorbs the water. Presilla rests hers for as long as 15 minutes, which I think is helpful, though an even better tip is heating up the liquid before use, which seems to make the resulting dough far more pliable and easy to work with. Glascoe suggests scalding it, but Presilla and Dinho’s lukewarm water does the trick fine, too.Glascoe is also the only one to employ milk in her dough; though not strictly necessary, it does make the arepas fluffier, with an almost crumpet-like interior, and slightly more flavourful, too, though you could just use the same amount of water if you prefer.The fatView image in fullscreenAccording to Sharon Glascoe, ‘masarepa is the most important ingredient. There is no substitute.’When I ask Sandra atCafe Terrace, the Colombian cafe down the road from me, if she has any tips for arepas, she tells me to add butter to the dough, whether or not the recipe on the packet calls for it. Glascoe, Presilla and McCausland-Gallo agree, though López-Alt opts for vegetable oil instead, and the austere PAN packet recipe is fat-free, though its high moisture level means it’s still flexible, if rather less tasty than the rest. Because of the fat in the milk, I’ve decided to skip this step, too, in favour of buttering the arepas as soon as they come out of the pan. However, you might like to add a tablespoon or so, particularly if you’re not using milk, or adding cheese, of which more below.The fillings and flavouringsAs with any bread, salt is a must. Presilla includes a little sugar as well, which helps give his arepas a golden colour, but isn’t strictly necessary from a flavour perspective. You could leave it at that, but why would you when you could add cheese as well? The most common choice isqueso frescoorblanco, which McCausland-Gallow says is “sold in large 30-pound blocks at the entrance of many supermarkets, fresh for people to buy as much as they want, or packaged in the dairy sections”. A British version can be bought online fromYorkshire Dama Cheese, though López-Alt suggests substituting Mexicancotija, Italian ricotta salata or (most easily accessible for most Brits) Greek feta or a similar white salty cheese; I used Turkishbeyaz penir, but Balkan white cheese and so on would work just fine. López-Alt, Glascoe and Presilla knead this into the dough, which I’m very pro as a concept: the cheesier, the better as far as I’m concerned. (Vegans could easily adapt this recipe using plant milk or plain water and appropriate plant-based cheeses.)View image in fullscreenJ Kenji López-Alt’s arepas are ‘delicious, but finicky for an amateur’.Sandra stuffs her arepas with mozzarella, a popular choice for that all-important stringy molten centre (the New York Times also mentions manchego or parmesan, and the comment section is predictably incredulous). Like Dinho, she splits them like a sandwich to fill them with cheese, while Glascoe folds the dough around it and Presilla grates it in with the white cheese. López-Alt makes my life difficult by forming his arepas like ravioli, covering one with cheese and sticking another on top – there’s so much cheese, in fact, that mine bulges like a flying saucer. Delicious, naturally, but finicky for an amateur; I’m going with Glascoe’s method, which feels a lot more forgiving.The shaping and cookingArepas, even cheese-stuffed ones, come in a range of thicknesses, as evidenced by those I try, which vary from Presilla’s chunky little discs to McCausland-Gallo’s almost pancake-like 6mm. If you’re intending to split and fill them, slightly thicker is preferable, but go for whatever thickness you like. The only thing to bear in mind is that thicker arepas will, of course, take longer to cook through; it should be only the cheese that’s gooey in the middle.View image in fullscreenMaricel Presilla grills her ‘chunky little discs’.The method by which you do so is similarly up to you and dependent on the equipment you have to hand. PAN, Glascoe and Dinho cook their arepas in a pan in the traditional fashion, López-Alt starts his in a pan, then transfers them to the oven to cook through fully, while Presilla grills them, which looks great, but involves a lot of careful work with a spatula to dislodge them from even a well-greased baking tray. The simplest option is a lightly greased pan: keep the heat medium-low and cover the pan for the first few minutes to help the arepas cook through before they burn on the outside – the crust should be crunchy and golden with charred spots, rather than charcoal. Finish with a generous helping of butter and eat hot, or freeze. (They can also be stored uncooked in the fridge under a damp cloth for a day or so.)Perfect cheese arepasPrep10 minCook10 minMakes6100ml milk, whole milk, ideally½ tsp fine salt200g masarepa, or white pre-cooked cornmeal100g salty white cheese(eg, queso fresco, feta or similar), crumbled60g firm mozzarellaOilButter, to finishView image in fullscreenPut the milk and salt in a large bowl with 220ml hot water.

These three different restaurants share DNA. Yes, 10 years have passed, but very little in the pared-back, pan-European anchovies-on-a-plate-for-£12 dining scene has moved on.No-frills decor, bare-brick walls, earnest small plates, staff with statement moustaches despite it not being remotely near Movember. We all know the drill for such places. There will be those exemplary anchovies on some sort of crostini, asparagus because it’s in season, some beans, maybe green, perhaps white, fancy French cheese and a tart of the day for afters. While Ellory merged into Leroy via a move from London Fields to Shoreditch, Leroy has become Duchy, it seems, via a simple change of the sign above the door. Front-of-house Alex Grant and chef Simon Shand met at Leroy and have now made this restaurant their own. In pop music terms, visiting Duchy is like going to see Bucks Fizz at Butlin’s and the only remaining member isDavid Van Day, and you’re pretty sure he was actually in Dollar, but hey, it’s fine, whatever, because they’re now cranking through Making Your Mind Up anyway.View image in fullscreenDuchy’s take on vitello tonnato features meat presented tartare-style and shoestring fries that look a bit like a rösti.Still, clearly this “things on plates, served sporadically” concept isn’t broken, and Duchy don’t need to fix it, because by 5pm on a Tuesday night, this new/old restaurant is filling up nicely, and by the time we leave two hours later, it’s absolutely heaving.The UK restaurant world is patently nowhere near the end of its “three ravioli dressed in olive oil and a scattering of podded peas” era, of “Hey, guys, can I start you off with some comté gougères” and “Yes, we are playingTalking Heads’ Stop Making Sense”. There has, admittedly, been a surge of “authentic French” restaurants in the capital recently –74 Duke,French Society,Marjorie’s,Joséphine– where beret-wearing British restaurateurs seem to be draping onions around their necks and serving up hearty soups, souffles, trotters and Paris-Brests, and very nice they are, too. But this thing that Ellory, then Leroy and now Duchy does, and which was once so edgy, shows no sign of relenting.View image in fullscreen‘A highlight’: Duchy’s Italian flat beans with gorgonzola, loquats and ‘pleasing’ almonds.Two anchovies on two crostini dotted with marjoram leaves arrive for £5, followed by a pile of rather soft, chunkily cutpanisse– polenta fries – enrobed in a thick grating ofmeuledes Alpesfrom Savoie. Avitello tonnatowith the veal served tartare-style is topped with what are reportedly shoestring fries, but have tangled into what looks like a deep-fried potato rösti. A highlight is a bowl of al dente Italian flat beans served cold in some type of vinaigrette, and with the pleasing addition of fresh almonds, blobs of rather pungent gorgonzola and a few slices ofloquat. Surely loquats are just kumquats with aspirations of grandeur, you might be thinking. Well, you would be very wrong: loquats are bigger, more like a sharp pear in flavour and wholly suitable for matching with a stinky, oozy Italian cheese and some crunchy veg.A bowl of fresh spaghetti with sage is as memorable as the chorus of Britain’slast Eurovision entry, and I am truly puzzled by what appears to be Duchy’s signature dish: some very damp smoked trout on a bowl of vivid greenspätzlethat have been cooked until mushy.View image in fullscreenDuchy’s ‘delicious’ poulet au vin jaune.Thank heavens for the final main course, then,poulet au vinjaune, served on a silky butterypomme puréewith a scattering of outstanding morels. Delicious, although there is always a moment, when I have been fooled again into sharing a plate of chicken and mash, that I think, “Surely sharing mash and gravy is the type of thing you should only need to do in a national emergency and you’re huddling around a brazier with other survivors. Why am I paying £28 for this pleasure?”But, as I say, we are too far down this route to back out now; those brick walls that make conversations bounce around deafeningly, the slice of perfectly fine apricot tart with creme fraiche for afters, the £130 bill without drinks for an adequate, perfectly of-its-ilk, London small-plates dinner. Stop Making Sense is reaching its final track as we pay up, and I’m not entirely sure if the food world ever truly started making sense.Duchy18 Phipp Street, London EC2, 07874 310612.
