It is understood that this visit, where the king plans to become the first British sovereign to address both houses of the Italian parliament, is expected to go ahead as planned.The king had been due to meet ambassadors in audiences at Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon and to travel to Birmingham on Friday, but these were postponed.The king visited the London Clinic, the same hospital where he was treated for an enlarged prostate in January 2024, on Thursday morning.It is understood the side-effects, the specifics of which have not been disclosed, were temporary and not uncommon with many medical treatments.He was not joined by the queen during his brief stay, and travelled to and from the hospital by car.After he returned home to Clarence House, the king was said to be on good form, and was reported to be working on state papers and making calls from his study.A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: “His majesty was due to receive credentials from the ambassadors of three different nations this afternoon.“Tomorrow he was due to undertake four public engagements in Birmingham, and is greatly disappointed to be missing them on this occasion.“He very much hopes that they can [be] rescheduled in due course and offers his deepest apologies to all those who had worked so hard to make the planned visit possible.”The announcement from the palace was made late on Thursday evening because the king needed time to consult his staff and medical team after he returned to Clarence House.Since his diagnosis last year, the king’s diary of engagements is understood to have been developed in full consultation with his medical team at all stages to protect his recovery.It was decided on balance that it was wiser to cancel the visit to Birmingham, which involved four back-to-back engagements, as a precautionary measure.Sources told PA Media the hospital visit was not a major development and no further updates were expected on the king’s health, with any minor alterations to his diary that may be required next week being announced in due course.Charles became king on 8 September 2022after the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II.When announcing his cancer diagnosis last February, the palace asked for privacy and only confirmed it was a “form of cancer”.The king was diagnosed after a “separate issue of concern was noted” and investigated while he was being treated for a benign prostate condition.In December 2024,the palace said the king’s “treatment has been moving in a positive directionand as a managed condition the treatment cycle will continue into next year”.When asked how he was that month during a visit with the queen to Walthamstow in north-east London, the king smiled as he replied: “I’m still alive.”Explore more on these topicsKing Charles IIIMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

It is the third year running that child poverty has increased.Food poverty and hunger also rose, according to official surveys, with 300,000 more children in households reliant on food banks over the previous 12 months, and an increase in children in food insecure families, meaning they struggled to afford regular and healthy meals.Just under a third of UK children (28%) experienced material deprivation, a measure designed to assess whether households are able to afford basics that constitute a minimum acceptable standard of living, such as food, clothes, toys and school trips.ChartSeparate analysis by a leading thinktank has found living standards for lower-income households are on track to fall further by the end of the decade as a result of the chancellor’s spring statement.A combination of weak economic growth over the next five years and benefit cuts that fell disproportionately on lower-income households would result in an average annual loss of £500 in 2030 for those in the poorest half of the population, according to theResolution Foundation.Campaigners warned poverty would continue to increase underLabourunless it took firm action to reverse the trend such as by axing the two-child benefit cap in its child poverty strategy, expected in June.Labour’s general election manifesto promised an “ambitious strategy to reduce child poverty” alongside a commitment to end “mass dependence” on food banks and charity food handouts, which it called “a moral scar on our society”.Alison Garnham, the chief executive of ChildPovertyAction Group and vice-chair of End Child Poverty, said: “Today’s grim statistics are a stark warning that the government’s own commitment to reduce child poverty will crash and burn unless it takes urgent action.”Silvia Galandini, of the poverty charity Oxfam, said: “We live in the sixth-richest country in the world where billionaires alone saw their wealth soar by £11bn last year. It is morally repugnant that children, disabled people and carers are the ones who are taking the hit.”The annual poverty figures were published by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) a day after the government cameunder fire from its own backbenchersover the impact of itscuts to disability and incapacity benefits, which willpush 50,000 childrenand 200,000 disabled adults into relative hardship by the end of the decade.Just over 370,000 people who currently claim Pip will lose eligibility asa result of the cuts, while another 430,000 who would have been eligible for the benefit in the future will not now get it. On average they will lose £4,500 a year.The annual households below average income report shows that even before these cuts come into effect, disabled families are already experiencing high levels of poverty – 44% of all children living in poverty were living in a household where someone has a disability.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Holyrood missed its 18% poverty figure target, though experts said its rates would be higher without its child poverty programme.Prof Ruth Patrick, a professor in social policy at the University of York, said: “The progress Scotland has made on driving poverty rates down shows another way is possible. The UK government could lift 700,000 children out of poverty overnight by matching Scotland’s fiscal commitment to driving poverty down.”Peter Matejic, the chief analyst at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “The inheritance of the new government was a third consecutive year of rising child poverty and a second year in a row of falling incomes, both alarming symptoms of a deep crisis in living standards.”At a protest outside parliament on Thursday morning, Liv Eren, a youth ambassador for the End Child Poverty coalition who grew up in poverty, said the government’s cuts were “an act of self-harm”.“We know that more children are going to be pushed into poverty, but they’re choosing to do it anyway. I feel quite angry,” she said. “This was a government that said they wanted to bring change, and stood at the dispatch box time and time again, having a go at Tory politicians for the child poverty rate, and yet at the earliest opportunity, they’re not bringing change.”A DWP spokesperson said: “No one should be living in poverty, and we know that the best route out of poverty for struggling families is well paid, secure work. That is why we are reforming our broken welfare system so it helps people into good jobs, boosting living standards and putting money in people’s pockets.”Explore more on these topicsPovertyFood povertyChildren's healthSocial exclusionConservativesLabourFood banksnewsShareReuse this content"

Starmer said: “It’s clear the Russians are filibustering. They are playing games and then playing for time. It is a classic from the Putin playbook.”2:50'Volodymyr, you have our support': Starmer details key outcomes of Ukraine summit – videoPutin last night suggested Ukraine could be placed under a form of temporary administration to allow for new elections and the signature of key accords with the aim of reaching a settlement, Russian news agencies reported.In a separate briefing, the German chancellor,Olaf Scholz, said lifting sanctions on Russia would be a grave mistake and “makes no sense” as long as peace had “not actually been achieved – and unfortunately we are still a long way from that”.Zelenskyy said Russia “does not want any kind of peace” but instead “wants to divideEuropeand America”, and there should be “no lifting of any kind of sanctions until Russia stops this war”. Instead, there should be “more packages of sanctions”.Zelenskyy added after the summit that he felt the US should respond to what he called Moscow’s violation of a commitment not to strike Ukrainian energy targets. “I think there should be a reaction from the US,” he said.The meeting sought to define the security guarantees the European and other allies could offer Ukraine once a ceasefire was agreed to end the three-year-old war – including the possible deployment of military forces by some of its members.Facing political and logistical constraints and possible Russian and US resistance, coalition members are far from agreed on the latter option. Anglo-French plans for a post-truce “reassurance force” had not won universal backing, Macron said.The force was “a British-French proposition, desired by Ukraine”, he said, adding: “It does not have unanimity, but we do not need unanimity to do this.” Nonetheless, an Anglo-French delegation would soon travel to Ukraine to discuss needs, he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I remember Noel denied that he had said anything of the sort. I said to him: ‘Why would Maya make that up?’”The producer said he had not believed Clarke, 49, during what he told the court was a “combative” conversation.“Noel was very resistant and belligerent during this conversation,” the producer said. “When Noel said that we would need to get a different actress to replace Maya. I distinctly remember saying to him words to the effect, ‘You’ve been saying we’re going to fuck later to her – surely you can see where that leads? Do you really want to end up on the front of a national newspaper? As that’s the way this is going.’ In response, Noel told me to ‘fuck off’.”The producer was giving evidence as a witness for Guardian News and Media (GNM), the publisher of the Guardian, in its defence against a libel claim by Clarke relating to seven articles and a podcast published between April 2021 and March 2022 accusing him of sexual misconduct.Clarke denies putting pressure on Maya over the sex scene or acting inappropriately. He has said he apologised to her in a phone call for one comment in which he recalled saying something like, “don’t worry, you look great”, in order to “boost her confidence”.Cross-examining the producer, Philip Williams, representing Clarke, suggested the account was not true and asked why it was that Maya went on to send Clarke friendly messages after working with him. The court heard that Maya had also thanked Clarke for making her feel “at ease” during an initial audition.The producer responded that he was not aware of what happened after they had worked together but that he would have been “pleased” if they had been reconciled.A female producer on the same production said she had also been informed by Maya that Clarke was pressuring her to be naked during the sex scene and that she felt he was “coming on to her because he was being leery and suggestive”.Asked about the later apparent friendliness in messages between Clarke and Maya, the producer responded that it did not surprise her as “that’s how it was” for women in the business when dealing with powerful people.A female runner on the same production told the court that Maya had told her that Clarke was “bullying her and undermining her, saying to her she would ‘never make it’, and insinuating that he could ruin her career and that she was only in this show because of him”.She added: “Maya said she felt she was in a #MeToo situation with Noel.”Clarke’s barrister suggested that Maya was already a successful actor by that stage and that the former runner had been mistaken in her evidence, which she denied.He asked whether she was a “driver” of the #MeToo movement. “I’m supportive of it but I don’t engage on a daily basis,” she said.The court also heard from Lisa Graham, who claimed that Clarke had “put his hand over my thigh and in-between my legs” while she had been assisting him as a volunteer at a convention centre in Bournemouth in 2016.Graham claimed that his hand had gone “an inch or two from my panty line”, forcing her to physically move her chair away from him.She further claimed that Clarke had repeatedly proposed that they “go upstairs and have sex” and ranked passing women on their sexual attractiveness, including a pregnant woman who he said he would “bang” because “you can’t put another baby in them”.Clarke denies the claims. His barrister accused Graham of misinterpreting the conversation and jumping on a bandwagon.She denied the accusation, telling the court that she had been forced to “relive things that I did not want to have to relive” but that she had decided that speaking out was the “right thing to do”.A final witness, Garry Moore, an amateur film-maker, told the court that Clarke had shown him a clip of a female actor named as Florence in a scene in which she was naked. He said he had been “shocked” that Clarke had the footage on his phone.Put to him by the claimant’s junior barrister, Arthur Lo, that this was part of the process of selecting an actor for a part, Moore said they were not at that stage and that he believed Clarke simply wanted to “show that he could get actresses to do anything that he wanted”.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianGuardian Media GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

It comes after a three-and-a-half-year investigation into theresignation of Prof Kathleen Stock, who was the target of protests at Sussex over her views on gender identification and transgender rights.The university intends to challenge the size of the fine – 15 times larger than any previous penalty levied by the OfS – through tribunal, and also seek a judicial review of the judgment.Sasha Roseneil, who joined as vice-chancellor a year after the investigation began, said she was initially shocked by the OfS’s judgment but was confident the courts would find in the university’s favour.“I think our position is extremely strong, and I think they will lose a judicial review. But I’m not surprised that they’ve dug in, because [the OfS] has been so determined to pursue this, and so unwilling to engage,” Roseneil said in an interview with the Guardian.University of Sussex fined £585,000 for failing to uphold freedom of speechRead moreRoseneil said Sussex had substantially overturned sections of the OfS’s interim judgment, delivered last year, which would have fined the university £1m for a string of additional allegations.She said: “The provisional decision was much, much worse, and we rebutted it at length. We sent back a 2,000-page response, and they have reduced the fine from the provisional decision – a million-pound fine – to £585,000 and they’ve dropped quite a lot of what they were alleging against us.“They haven’t explained why they’ve dropped any of it but one has to imagine they realised that they weren’t on strong legal grounds, and we produced a lot of evidence against what they were saying, including evidence against what they’re still saying.”An OfS spokesperson said: “We are confident in the decisions made in this case and will vigorously defend any legal action.”Roseneil said the OfS refused to meet the leadership team at Sussex or interview those involved, with the exception of Stock, and instead relied on thousands of pages it requested from the university. She said that when she arrived at Sussex in 2022 she sought a meeting with OfS executives to discuss the investigation but was turned down.Arif Ahmed, the OfS’s director for freedom of speech and academic freedom, defended the regulator’s methods. He said: “There may have been occasions where [Sussex] wanted to see somebody, and in fact that was done in writing instead, I’m quite sure that could well have happened. But the engagement would nevertheless have happened in the sense that we communicated with them and they communicated with us.”But Roseneil said the OfS had refused to tell Sussex if its amended policies had met its conditions. She said: “We have been up for working with the OfS on these difficult issues but they have just wanted to prosecute us, even persecute us, on this. It’s a very sorry state for a regulator to be doing this rather than actually trying to help the sector work better.”The OfS’s final ruling focuses on a trans and non-binary equality policy statement passed in 2018, which the regulator argued had “a chilling effect” that could result in self-censorship by staff and students.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is a really small statement, of which we have many dozens, if not hundreds, of similar policies and statements. Whereas the governing documents of the university are its charter and statutes and regulations. So that’s the core of the problem.”Roseneil said the OfS policy was a “sort of libertarian, free speech absolutism” that meant universities were unable to apply rules for anything other than unlawful behaviour or speech.“We can’t now say that we will remove or take down antisemitic or anti-Muslim propaganda because not all such propaganda is illegal,” she said.Explore more on these topicsUniversity of SussexHigher educationFreedom of speechOffice for StudentsStudentsUniversitiesEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The government is targeting a 15% cut in “admin” costs of the civil service by 2030, saving £2.2bn and leading toabout 10,000 job losses.Blockers, checkers, bats and chainsaws: don’t talk like Musk, Starmer is warnedRead moreAt the same time, a £350m fund has been launched to cover the costs of redundancies and a £3.25bn “transformation fund” is available to help with the costs of public service reform, particularly with the use of artificial intelligence and new computing systems.One Whitehall source said the amount of money intended to be saved each year “hasn’t really been worked out yet” and the expectation is that “big savings won’t kick in” until the end of the forecast period of 2028-29.Another senior Whitehall figure said spending billions on technology to create productivity savings in the civil service was a “huge gamble” as it was far from clear that savings would be made quickly – pointing to IT changes that often ran over their allocated time and budget in government.Spending in Whitehall is due to rise over the next five years by an average of 1.2%, but much of this increase will go to the NHS and defence, while unprotected departments could see cuts of about 0.8% each year from 2026.Alex Thomas, a programme director at the Institute for Government, said: “If you want to make the state more effective, sometimes that does take a little bit of money and that can release more savings. On the civil service side, the win is not loads of extra money. You can save a bit – £1.5-2bn over the spending review period – but the real win is making the civil service more effective.“With the money for civil service redundancies, it’s worth paying to get rid of some people you think aren’t the most effective people. The private sector wouldn’t think twice about it … but I don’t think that, in the short term, will release loads of money and the transformation fund is likely to cost a bit.”He added: “It’s about productivity, better decision making, better advice, better organisation of public services. You need good people to do that, and deconflicting or delayering some of the growth of the centre, where you’ve got lots of people and too many chiefs. You can have fewer people and clearer direction.”Gray made her intervention in the House of Lords after leaving Starmer’s government in the autumn as part of a shake-up in which she was replacedby the Labour campaign expert Morgan McSweeney. She wasgiven a peerage by Starmer in Januaryand her first speech in the House of Lords focused on her career as a civil servant and the future of the civil service.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Back then, I worked with truly heroic and committed people, striving every day, in very difficult circumstances, to help people in even more challenging situations.“They were the civil service at its best: on the frontline, as far away from Whitehall’s machinations as it is possible to be. Today, I see the same sort of brilliance. What these and other civil servants are doing is central to the government’s – and the nation’s – mission to bring growth back into our economy and security to our society. That is why I would caution all of us to be careful, not only about our decisions but our language also. When we hear phrases with ‘blobs’, ‘pen-pushers’, ‘axes’, ‘chainsaws’ and other implements, they hear it too.“Difficult decisions are needed, of course, and the civil service will be keen to be part of any reform journey, but we need them and other public servants to succeed. I will continue to support a progressive civil service. I hope others will do the same.”Explore more on these topicsCivil serviceSue GrayKeir StarmerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Long gone is the tetchiness on display in London in the aftermath of the Ukrainian leader’scatastrophic trip to the White House. In its place was a degree of optimism so high that it could only be interpreted as political positioning.Though he complained about comments made by Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump’s special envoy, that four Ukrainian regions wholly or partly occupied by Russia consisted of people who wanted Moscow’s rule in an “overwhelming majority” – these were “in line with the messages of the Kremlin”, Zelenskyy said – he insisted that had advantages too.Over time, Zelenskyy reasoned, the White House team would appreciate the Kremlin was not acting in good faith. It would become clear that “the Russians don’t want” an unconditional ceasefire as they threw up more and more objections as the peace talks developed. “People,” he said, meaning Trump’s top team “will not believe the Russians more and more with every day”.Though Zelenskyy signed up Ukraine to theenergy and maritime ceasefire proposed by the US, he knew there were Russian qualifications. Within hours, the Kremlin said its participation in a maritime ceasefire was conditional on agricultural sanctions relief, while reports on Thursday of a power outage in Kherson after Russian shelling suggest the energy ceasefire is not entirely being honoured either.2:50'Volodymyr, you have our support': Starmer details key outcomes of Ukraine summit – videoUnequally applied ceasefires may not obviously be to Ukraine’s advantage, but Zelenskyy acknowledged many details were left vague in the two statements put out by the US (one negotiated withUkraine, one with Russia) because the Trump White House was in a rush to get some sort of deal.“It does not say what happens if somebody violates the ceasefire; the US did not want it to break down,” the president said, suggesting during his briefing “don’t delve too deeply”. For its part Ukraine would document any Russian violations and share them with the US and the world, though the impact on Kremlin behaviour may be limited.Keir Giles, a Russia expert at the Chatham House thinktank, said: “Zelenskyy has assessed that it is better to go along with what is being cooked, rather than to attempt to inject reality into the process, because he has seen what happens if he does the latter.”European leaders agree now ‘not the time’ to lift sanctions against RussiaRead moreWhen, at the beginning of the month, a tired Zelenskyy, still reeling from the Oval Office ambush, said at some point during an hour-plus press briefing in London, that a deal to end the war “is still very, very far away” it was used as justification by the White House to halt military aid and intelligence sharing.That was only restarted when Ukraine committed to a full ceasefire in Saudi Arabia a week or so later, a commitment that Russia has yet to match, arguing, in the words ofVladimir Putin, that any ceasefire should lead to “the elimination of the root causes of the conflict” and therefore more negotiation while the land and air war continues.The problem for Zelenskyy’s strategy is that if there are significant Russian attacks against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, or some other inequality emerges in the Black Sea, it is unsure how long Kyiv will be able to turn the other cheek. On the day of the ceasefire announcement, it was notable that Ukraine’s defence minister immediately warned Russia not to use the ceasefire as a cover for manoeuvring its navy out of the eastern Black Sea, where it has been penned in.Nor is it obvious that the White House would be willing to ramp up the pressure on the Kremlin if the peace talks show only negligible progress. That would represent a sharp change of White House strategy. So far, the US has offered concessions to Moscow, such as ruling out Ukraine’s Nato membership, while Trump appears far more comfortable talking to Putin than Zelenskyy.Putin and his Russian colleagues, said Giles, “will be calculating just how far they can go and how much they can extract from the Americans, before it becomes so embarrassing that even Trump, with no sense of shame or humiliation, says enough is enough”. On Monday in Saudi Arabia, the US and Russia talked about Ukrainian territory, though nothing concrete emerged. Zelenskyy did not make much of that on Tuesday – saying simply that he was “worried” – but in the coming weeks, the president’s newfound patience is likely to be tested again.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeDonald TrumpVladimir PutinanalysisShareReuse this content"

That, coupled with seemingly acute embarrassment over the sensitivity of his disclosures, helps explain the animus displayed towards Goldberg by multipleadministrationofficials and surrogates.Mike Waltz, the national security adviser who assembled the group chat to discuss the military operation, called Goldberg “a loser”, “the bottom scum of journalists” and insinuated that he may have tricked his way into the group, in a Tuesdayinterview with Laura Ingraham on Fox News.Remarkably, given the personal antipathy, Waltz insisted that he did not know Goldberg, adding insinuatingly: “I wouldn’t know him if I saw him in a police lineup.”The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, labelled Goldberg a “deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who has made a profession of peddling hoaxes”.The ad-hominem attacks appeared to be orchestrated and aimed at discrediting the source of a story that threatened to puncture the air of invincibility that surrounded Trump’s first two months back in the White House.It is hardly the first time that the US president and members of Trump’s circle have attacked Goldberg for work that has deeply angered them. In fact, he and his magazine have a lengthy record of publishing such pieces.During last year’s presidential election campaign, Trump reacted furiously to an Atlantic article written by Goldberg that cited John Kelly, the former White House chief of staff, as describing how Trump wanted to have military generals who would be personally loyal in the same way he believed German commanders had served Hitler.Trump already harbored grievances about an earlier Goldberg piece from 2020, also sourced to Kelly, in which he was said to have disdained dead US military servicemen buried in a French cemetery as “suckers and losers”.Trump vehemently denied the allegations, even after Kelly told Goldberg: “There are many, many people who have heard him say these things.”Compounding the rightwing hostility is the reputation Goldberg gained asBarack Obama’s go-to interviewer.Obama granted Goldberg five interviews over the course of his presidency that were widely praised as authoritative by Washington insiders.While Goldberg’s invitation to the Trump group chat remains unexplained, there is something fitting in it being related to the Middle East and Israel, which has been on the receiving end of missiles fired by the Iran-backed Yemeni Houthis that were the target of the US strikes being decided on.Born in Brooklyn to Jewish parents, Goldberg, 59, studied at the University of Pennsylvania,but left before graduatingto move to Israel. He joined the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), serving as a guard at a prison that held Palestinians detainees during the first intifada of the late 1980s and early 1990s. In hismemoir he describedwitnessing the beatings of detainees.His Israeli connections, have resulted in some eye-catching stories. These included an Atlantic cover story in 2010 – based on sources in the upper echelons of the country’s military and intelligence community – that predicted that Israel would strike Iran’s nuclear facilities within a year to stop Tehran’s Islamic regime acquiring a bomb.No attack subsequently happened but the article’s impact may have spurred the Obama administration into intensifying pressure on Tehran to negotiate limits to its nuclear programme, which eventually led to a deal in 2015 that Trump later renounced.Despite his pro-Israel sympathies, Goldberg gained a reputation among some fellow journalists for bravery for being prepared to interview Islamists classified as terrorists by western governments.Twoarticlesin the New Yorker in 2002, entitled In the Party of God, explored the Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah, and were based on face-to-face interviews conducted in the Bekaa valley.But he also drew criticism over another New Yorker piece in the same year, which suggested that Saddam Hussein posed a significant threat to the US with weapons of mass destruction that were subsequently never found after the 2003 American-led invasion of Iraq.The accusation of having made the case for invading Iraq has been cited this week by Goldberg’s present-day pro-Trump critics as part of the effort to discredit him.But some of Goldberg’s peers say his talents and courage as a journalist and editor have been on clear display in the most recent scandal as the magazine navigates incredibly tricky national security turf and a hostile administration desperate to keep it quiet.“As is pretty clear in his Atlantic article, he doesn’t give away any top secret information, anything that would endanger the participants,” said Jay Tolson, editor of a cultural review magazine at the University of Virginia and a cohort of Goldberg’s when they were both covering religion and politics in Washington in the early 2000s.“He’s a very brave guy, and, you know, eager to tell the truth.”Explore more on these topicsSignal group chat leakUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationMagazinesIsraelUS national securityprofilesShareReuse this content"

Sadly, the important thing in TV is to be firstLucy ManganThu 27 Mar 2025 18.20 EDTLast modified on Thu 27 Mar 2025 18.23 EDTShareIt is possible to make a cynical piece of television without anyone who appears on screen having a drop of toxicity in their veins. Documentaries with subjects ripped from the headlines are particularly likely candidates; documentaries centring the recently, appallingly bereaved even more so.We turn, then, to Brianna: A Mother’s Story. Brianna is Brianna Ghey, the 16-year-old who in 2023 wasmurdered in a premeditated attackby two 15-year‑olds – Scarlett Jenkinson, whom Brianna considered a friend, and Jenkinson’s friend (if that is the correct word for what seems more accurately to have been a murderous partnership between two disturbed individuals) Eddie Ratcliffe. They lured Brianna to a park, then stabbed her 28 times. Det Supt Adam Waller of Cheshire police says he still wrestles with “the level of depravity” on display in the attack. Brianna’s friends, still in their teens, remember that “she was kind, funny, could always make you feel better” and how “she brought me comfort”. They share videos full of giddy, youthful energy and laughter.The mother is Esther Ghey, who now campaigns for online protections for young people and better mental health support in schools. Brianna had transferred to a new school in February 2020 after being bullied. According to the headteacher, Emma Mills, Brianna was keen to make “a fresh start”.Then came lockdown. Esther describes Brianna retreating into an online world – using several accounts, so Esther could never quite be sure what was going on – and talking to people and accessing material that made Esther “afraid I was going to find her and Alicia [Brianna’s sister] raped and murdered”. Then Brianna “started growing her hair and came out as trans just before going back to school”.Esther’s grief is still so raw – she has not reached the stage where she can talk about Brianna without crying – that it makes you wish there was someone campaigning for greater television regulation, too. It should be forbidden to film someone when they are clearly still in the throes of the most awful misery. Clearly, though, the decision to take part was Esther’s – and she felt able to do so, as she did when she gavean in-depth interviewto the Guardian in February.‘I forgive the girl and boy for what they’ve done. If I didn’t, the hate would eat away at me’: Esther Ghey on life after the murder of her daughter BriannaRead moreBut the important thing in television is to be first. And the rawer the pain, the better it plays, in production terms. So what we get is that on parade. Anything that could add depth or meaning, or allow us to learn or draw conclusions, is not included.We do not learn what or whom Brianna was exposed to online. The coverage of the court case is minimal. We learn that Jenkinson was obsessed with torture videos and are left with the impression that Ratcliffe was more of a follower than a leader (although it was his clothes that were covered in Brianna’s blood and his house in which the murder weapon was found), but no proper parsing of their roles is undertaken. Ratcliffe’s anti-transgender messages are quoted and there is footage of the judge citing hatred of trans people as a secondary motivation, but it is not made clear that this was attributed to Ratcliffe only. Jenkinson seems to have been fixated on Brianna and said after her conviction that she tried to kill her (at first by poisoning her with painkillers in a McDonald’s milkshake) because she was afraid her friend was going to leave her.Knowing how to weight and sort the parts played by the various issues is impossible. There is a powerful interview with a former senior engineer at Meta,Arturo Béjar, who resigned when his warnings about the harm being done by the algorithms serving up ever darker content to curious children and teens were ignored. He says that, with the will to do so, feeds could be appropriately circumscribed by companies “within a year”. But his segment is brief and there is no time given to how this will can be inculcated, nor to looking at governments’ unwillingness to regulate the internet for the public good.In short, there is nothing that makes this documentary worthwhile, or that makes it feel like anything but an exploitation of a family’s unutterable sadness. The best that can be hoped is that it is so anodyne that there is no backlash that hurts these suffering people further.Brianna: A Mother’s Story aired on ITV1 and is on ITVX nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewKnife crimeCrimeNorth of EnglandDocumentaryreviewsShareReuse this content"

But today England’s biggest lake is, some campaigners say, a shadow of its 19th century self: its waters blighted by algae and its wildlife threatened by pollution, in a symbol of all that is wrong with the privatised water industry.This month the environment secretary, Steve Reed, vowed to break with the recent past, standing on its shores andpromising that Labour would “clean up Windermere”. The lake is showing the impact of sewage pollution from United Utilities treatment plants and increased pressure from climate change-induced temperature rises.Reed’s promise was welcomed as a historic moment by Matt Staniek,a campaignerwho has almost singlehandedly brought the lake’s plight to national consciousness. But Staniek, who formed the group Save Windermere, added that it was just the beginning of the mission to save the lake.He said he wanted to see an end to sewage releases into Windermere, something that has been achieved elsewhere in the world, including at Lake Annecy andLake Geneva.The difficulty of that mission was exposed byofficial figures released by the Environment Agencyon Thursday. Windermere, they reveal, was the dumping ground for 6,327 hours of raw sewage discharges from six United Utilities treatment works in 2024.Guardian analysis of the past five years of raw sewage releases reveals more than 32,000 hours of untreated effluent has been discharged into the Unesco world heritage site.‘It’s a national disgrace’: fury at sewage-filled Windermere over toxic algae and dead fishRead moreThe lake is almost entirely enclosed, its waters moving so slowly that a single drop of water takes nine months to go from the north side of Windermere to the south. It is also subject to dischargesfrom 1,900 private septic tanks and from agricultural runoff, but the sewage pollution is considered the most significant contributor of phosphorous entering the lake, causing more frequent intense algal blooms, which reduce dissolved oxygen levels and harm water quality and aquatic life,in some cases driving them to extinction.In 2022 a category one incident, the most serious, led to a mass fish killin Cunsey Beck, a site of special scientific interest, which feeds into Windermere.Four years after he began his campaign, Staniek has succeeded in putting its plight at the top of the environment secretary’s inbox. But raw sewage is still pouring into the lake.“Today’s data release reveals the true extent of the exploitation of England’s largest lake,” he said. “The nation is watching what is happening to the people’s lake, and they want to see it protected – both for now and for future generations. We want to see a legally binding commitment that will eliminate sewage discharges into Windermere once and for all. We want ambition to be turned into action.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We’re already on with delivering £200m of investment to ensure we treat wastewater to even higher standards alongside significantly reducing discharges from the six storm overflows that discharge into the lake.“The government’s announcement looks at a long-term plan for only rainfall entering Windermere and we will be working with the other partners involved to support this.”Explore more on these topicsPollutionLake DistrictWater industryUnited UtilitiesEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Someone get her an espressoJohn CraceIt was a morning from hell for the chancellor. After the spring statement and Trump’s overnight tariffs, time for a kickingThu 27 Mar 2025 11.35 EDTLast modified on Thu 27 Mar 2025 13.56 EDTShareThat screeching noise you can hear? It might just be the government trying to avoid making contact with reality.You know the saying. Go to sleep on it. Things will look better in the morning. Well, that didn’t quite work out forRachel Reeves. She went to bed on Wednesday with everyone from all sides of the political spectrum giving her a hard time for the spring statement that definitely wasn’t an emergency budget. Because an emergency budget would suggest that something had gone wrong in the last six months. And Rachel was certain that everything was tickety-boo.If anything, the world looked even bleaker for Reeves on Thursday morning. First thing she did was check her phone. She quickly wished she hadn’t. If anything, the newspaper headlines were even more brutal than the day before. Rachel closed her eyes. Wishing she could melt away. Wishing she could restart the day in an alternative reality.This wasn’t how she had ever imagined herself as chancellor. She had wanted to be the woman who grew the economy. Who saved the nation’s finances. Instead, all she got was a kicking. She wasn’t used to failure. And this was before she had made the entirely pointless journey to a Cardiff building site for a series of hostile interviews with the media. She didn’t know if she was feeling ready for yet another punishment beating.The BBC’s Nick Robinson was in no mood for taking prisoners on the Today programme. What had gone so wrong that she had been forced into making benefit cuts? You could hear the defensiveness in Reeves’s voice as she cut into auto-pilot. Trying to stick to the set script her advisers had prepared for any hostile questions. Everything was more or less normal, she said. Just tinkering round the edges. Global headwinds. Sticking to the fiscal rules. Look on the bright side. There was no longer a £22bn black hole and the changes to the welfare system were long overdue. Would that do?It wouldn’t. Robinson chose to remind her of her changes to national insurance at the previous budget. That had definitely been a budget. What had that done to business confidence? Had that contributed to the growth forecasts being downgraded by 50%? Rachel decided to answer a different question. NHS waiting lists were down. Why did everyone ignore all the wonderful things she had achieved?We then got down to the specifics of the benefit cuts. Nick played a tape of a man with brain injuries who was having his allowance cut by £900 a month and would soon be homeless. Was this what a Labour government was elected to do? Reeves sounded desperate. As if she realised she was cornered. Just in front of her she could see one of her team gesturing to slit his throat.“I want to make everyone richer,” Rachel said. The denial was cutting in big time. “Everyone is going to be £500 richer.” The disabled people didn’t know how lucky they were to be made to work even if they couldn’t. Robinson suddenly realised the chancellor might he having a major meltdown. She didn’t seem to understand that the whole point of making benefits cuts was to save money. Just saying that everyone would suddenly have jobs that would make them richer was a fantasy. In any case, the Resolution Foundation had calculated that those on the lowest incomes would be £500 worse off.Moving on. What about Donald Trump and the overnight car tariffs? Now the desperation turned to something close to panic. Nick had dared to mention He Who Cannot Be Named. She crossed herself as a precaution. No one in government was allowed to say anything that might offend the Sun-Bed God. Trump was to be praised for his great wisdom at all times. He could do no wrong. Even when he moved in mysterious ways.“Um,” said Reeves. “We don’t have a trade surplus with the US.” Fingers crossed that everything will be OK. Intense negotiations with the greatest president who had ever lived. Nick’s mouth open and closed. It was dawning on him that the UK had a chancellor who wasn’t aware there was an Orange Lunatic in the White House. Someone who really didn’t give a shit about the UK. Who only might take notice if American cars were threatened with the same tariff. The UK is now officially a supplicant at the court of King Donald.Time to bring the interview to a close. Robinson suggested that we could all be back in the same place in six months’ time. The fiscal headroom again vanishing beneath the combined effects of Trump, Putin and the government’s own policies. This was too much for Reeves. Doing all this all over again? No. It was going to be fine. Something good would happen. The Office for Budget Responsibility had forecast nearly 2% growth in five years’ time. Nick didn’t have the heart to tell her the OBR was often wrong and that 2% was nothing to get excited about.Rachel Reeves says she will not accept free concert tickets in future after criticismRead moreIt was much the same on LBC, where Nick Ferrari seemed so concerned for the chancellor’s wellbeing that he went relatively easy on her. Up to a point. He didn’t avoid the tough questions but he allowed her non-answers to hang. The listeners could draw their own conclusions. It was the most polite of roughing ups. He started with her own words. Last June she had promised to be the most pro-growth chancellor ever. Now look at us. What had gone wrong?Ferrari covered much the same ground on cuts and tax as Robinson. The best that Reeves could manage was that she wasn’t Kwasi Kwarteng. Or Jeremy Hunt for that matter. Be thankful for small mercies. He ended by asking about the free tickets to the theatre and Sabrina Carpenter concert. Rachel was caught in the headlights. Unable to explain why she hadn’t offered to pay the going rate for top-price tickets. These things aren’t hard. Especially when you were caught up in a freebie scandal only a few months earlier. No one had ever said she shouldn’t receive preferential treatment. Just pay for it.The media ordeal ended with Rachel appearing on ITV’s Good Morning Britain. Even here, she didn’t come away unscathed as Kate Garraway and Richard Madeley, not usually the fiercest of interviewers, piled in. How did she feel about making disabled people’s lives so much worse? Reeves didn’t feel very much. That was her defence mechanism. Her means of survival. Battered. Bruised. Looking no further than to get out of the morning still in one piece. One day at a time. Just for today.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchSpring statement 2025Rachel ReevesEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

But the even bigger problem? Bafta’s Adolescence issueStalking saga Baby Reindeer leads 2025 TV Bafta nominationsMark LawsonThu 27 Mar 2025 10.24 EDTLast modified on Thu 27 Mar 2025 14.22 EDTShareThe latest Bafta TV awards again show the range of talent across UK television. Though drama characteristically dominates, the shows with most nominations – Rivals, Mr Bates vs The Post Office, Slow Horses and Baby Reindeer – represent a range of genres and source material (from real events via a 36-year-old Jilly Cooper bonkbuster to a solo theatre show) suggesting that the 2025 voters have largely avoided historical snobbery, long a problem in these prizes.Stalking saga Baby Reindeer leads 2025 TV Bafta nominationsRead moreThe awards also continue a belated honouring of overlooked talent. After improbably having to wait until last year for his first main Bafta nomination, David Tennant gets a rapid second, for his thrilling turn as a Richard III of the TV industry in the raunchy Cooper adaptation Rivals.It also seems rudely overdue that performers as great as Jonathan Pryce and Sharon D Clarke have had to wait until now: honoured for Slow Horses and Mr Loverman respectively. Danny Dyer also makes his debut in the lists, though oddly not for his career-transforming wigged romantic in Rivals but for Sky Max’s Mr Bigstuff.As always, we have our own regretted omissions. James Corden and Ruth Jones, for Gavin & Stacey: The Finale, feel cruelly overlooked in the scripted comedy section, as does Peter Straughan in the scripted drama category for Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light, a masterclass in the distillation of the 883 pages of Hilary Mantel’s novel into punchy dialogue that sounded plausibly 16th century while still comprehensible now.And in an international category with only six places, the number of omissions is becoming ridiculous. Although some shows made by streamers (Rivals, Slow Horses, Supacell) are judged British enough to compete in the main categories, the chosen international half-dozen – including Shōgun, After the Party and Colin from Accounts – crowds out Pachinko, Nobody Wants This and Disclaimer.View image in fullscreenThe Richard III of regional television … David Tennant as Lord Tony Baddingham in Rivals.Photograph: Sanne GaultIn awards covering the first political cycle since 1964 that UK and US elections have fallen in the same year, there will be some concern in journalism departments at the lack of recognition, although the director of the BBC election night gets a craft nod.Although the BBC remains the leading nom-magnet – with 49 nods in the television awards and 26 in the parallel craft awards – its director general and chairman may be alarmed at an apparent vertiginous tilt in the industry’s balance of power.The oldest British broadcaster’s almost half-century in the main television awards is well beaten by the 69 for other broadcasters, with Channel 4 (18) and ITV (15) having very strong years – the former helped by great comedy and current affairs, the latter by its dramas, Mr Bates and Until I Kill You – and the streamers growing in power.Bafta TV awards 2025 nominations: full listRead moreMost alarming for the corporation, ahead of renegotiations of its Royal Charter and funding system from 2027, is that 26 nominations are shared by shows that fulfil a key BBC remit – drama about contemporary Britain – and yet were not made by the BBC: Mr Bates (ITV), Baby Reindeer (Netflix), Slow Horses (Apple TV+) and Rivals (Disney+).There can be some sympathy for the BBC excuse that it doesn’t have the money: the awards ceremony on 11 May will take place in the context of warnings that British TV production and careers are becoming unsustainable due to pressure on budgets from streamer competition and UK tax breaks originally intended to help the industry. (Now renamed “expenditure credits”, these benefits can favour big budget projects that are more likely to be made by foreign broadcasters.)Even so, with Adolescence – another British story made with Netflix money – currently setting ratings records, candidates applying to replace the departing Charlotte Moore as BBC Chief Content Officer must surely be asked at interview: should you/would you/could you have made at the BBC Adolescence, Mr Bates, Baby Reindeer, Rivals and Slow Horses. And if not, what is the point of the BBC drama department?An Adolescence issue for Bafta is that, weirdly, this is the second year running that there is a sense of a deafening television conversation elsewhere: a TV drama that everyone is talking about but has to wait a year for Bafta recognition. Because the qualifying period is the previous calendar 12 months, Mr Bates vs the Post Office (premiered 1 January 2024) is only honoured now, 15 months later. And Netflix’s Adolescence (dropped 13 March this year) will only come into contention this time next year.View image in fullscreenWill voters be happy to wait this long? … Mr Bates vs the Post Office.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockAcademy voters have been happy to wait to vote for Mr Bates, although as at this week’s RoyalTelevisionSociety awards – where the Post Office drama won no trophies despite nominations – the show may suffer in voting rooms from a sense of being so early last year.It’s probably impractical to change the Bafta nominations window so shows that really want the gold mask on their shelves should arrange winter or autumn transmission: Wolf Hall: The Mirror and The Light (BBC One, from 10 November) and Rivals (mid-October) may have benefitted from transmission close to the filling in of ballots. (Disclosure: I am a Bafta voter, though with no insider knowledge of the voting process.)Another issue for the organisers is that while best soap clearly doesn’t have enough contenders – it is now effectively a matter of choosing three from four, with Hollyoaks missing out – the international category clearly has too many, calling either for more international categories or further redefinition between “domestic” content (the five terrestrial networks plus Sky) and “international”, a category invented to contain (in every sense) the streamers but which is stretched by the growing number of British stories they tell.Next year, Adolescence will surely have to be classified as British and will surely sweep the awards, continuing the sense that, for purely logistical reasons, Bafta is a year off the pace.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionBaftasAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Does the prospect of sudden ageing frighten you?BenderRodriguezIt’s not sudden. I was in [King] Lear when I was 64 and said: “I need a wig that’s grey because he’s supposed to be 80.” Now I’m 73 and I still think inside I’m a brunette. This is the 54th year of my career. The last decade has just galloped past. I waited for something like this – a project that I latched on to. There’s been a lot of stuff that I turned down. I’m now being very pernickety about what I commit three or four months of my life to.No doubt there was also a lot of work behind it, but was playingHector Barbossain the Pirates of the Caribbean filmsas much fun as it looked? Have you everreinhabitedthe character for a brief moment, to amuse yourself or others?Liam01Yeah, it was fun. [Director] Gore Verbinski had a kind of pop cultural sense of anarchy. Anyone who liked the Pirates films should also check out Rango, which has his cinematic fingerprints all over it. I’ve reinhabited the character for brief moments, for the Disney ride in Anaheim, and I think Shanghai, and maybe in Florida. I remember having to go and voice some lines after a day on another film, and rolling my eyes going: “Oh my God, will this never go away?” It’s the vanity of being a moment of cinema folklore. It’s fun.View image in fullscreenGeoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End.Photograph: Photographer Peter Mountain/Disney/AllstarHave you had much experience of care homes?BenderRodriguezMy mum died in 2022, quite sweetly on Valentine’s Day, which was very moving. She’d been in a care home for about three or four years. The last year there was a noticeable decline. She was in her 90s. My mother-in-law, also. So, yes, once you turn 60, the time is coming up for you to thank your carers.How did it feel having a Nobelprize winner playing your conscience? (Harold PinterinThe Tailor of Panama.)UrrurrshIt was three of the greatest days of my life. He was a hero to me when I was studying English theatre in the late 60s in Brisbane. And suddenly he was there. They’d done a painting of Harold in a three-piece, blue pencil-stripe suit with a tailor’s measure around his neck. He came in, a little sweaty and a little prickly, and he saw that painting and tears just welled in his eyes. He said: “My father worked in the East End as a tailor, like many Jewish émigrés did. So I find that overwhelmingly powerful.”Pinter told me that when he got his first royalty cheque for The Homecoming, he went down and said: “Dad, you’re coming home and you don’t need to come back here any more.”The Rule of Jenny Pen review – John Lithgow pulls the strings in care home horrorRead moreYou’ve played a lot of real-life characters includingTrotskyand nowGroucho Marx. How does your approach to these roles differfrom fictional characters?hubbahubba,Haider3, WomanofWolfvilleI have played a number of what people would sniff their noses at and call biopics. And we all know that, for some biopics in commercial Hollywood, you’re gonna get the Wikipedia tropes. With Elizabeth, the director Shekhar Kapur – being a man from India – never spoke to me like he was from the RSC. He just spoke about Krishna. He spoke about Elizabeth and Walsingham as being like gods: mythical as well as big political figures. So that’s always been a useful way to go. Even playing Einstein [inGenius] or Trotsky [in Frida], you’ve got to find what’s inside that character that has some kind of contemporary relevance you can portray without denying the historical context.Quills (2000)is a favourite and your performance was superb. What was it like working withPhilip Kaufman?BicuserI went into a meeting with Philip to say that I couldn’t possibly do the part and that Marlon Brando should do it, because in 1808, the Marquis de Sade was 300lb and I’m not.I learned a great lesson from that because he said: “No, the Marquis that Doug has written is the fantasy in the Marquis’ head. It’s as if he’s the hero of the story: a wry, lithe, elegant, muscular god in his own attic.”View image in fullscreenRush as the Marquis de Sade in Quills.Photograph: Cine Text/Sportsphoto/AllstarI very much enjoyedThe Best Offerin which you andDonald Sutherlandwere both excellent. It should have been a bigger success. Any other films you’ve done which deserved more than they got?pconlFilms get what they deserve. I would’ve liked The Warrior’s Way, originally called Laundry Warrior – which I thought was a much more kitsch and honest title – to have done better. It was struck down by the big financial crisis in 2008. The fact that the lead character was a baby, too, didn’t help. I thought they’d written a fantastic eastern western where what was at stake was the survival of the baby who was the last of the clashing clans. I thought it could have gone gangbusters, but yeah, not so much.What memories do you have ofToowoomba?DidgebabaWhen I was eight, my single mum and my sister and I went to live with my grandparents there. It was kind of artistic wasteland in regional Australia. But it also wasn’t.George Sorlie had created this travelling variety troupe which had been picked up again by his widow and a great clown, Bobby Le Brun. By night, they would do a variety show with jugglers and dancers and songs and speciality acts. And then by day, that whole troupe would do a panto.These people were deeply rooted in the smell of sawdust, the greasepaint, putting the tent up. There was also the Toowoomba Philharmonic Society, which gave me a lifelong love of Broadway musicals because their production in 1959 of Oklahoma is still deeply etched into my psyche.View image in fullscreenRush as Philip Henslowe in Shakespeare in Love.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyLantanais one of my favourite neo-noirs. Is noir an Aussie genre, or is can-do, sunny optimism more in line with the national psyche?StevefromNottinghamI’m always surprised that’s the film the gen Z audience knows me for.Both pessimism and optimism happen. When I did Shakespeare in Love, the young guys were all staunchly regional and proud of it, no longer the generation who had to crush their regional dialect into PR. They were proudly scousers or northerners. But they could do their stuff. Every afternoon we’d watch Neighbours and they were all really great at what they thought was a fantastic Australian accent. And I said: “No, that’s a television Australian accent. No one exists that actually speaks like that. It’s much more nuanced.”I think that is the sunny can-do image of Australia. There’s a cultural reality to theTen Pound Poms. But Australia also has films likeWake in FrightandNitram, the film that Justin Kurzel did about the Port Arthur massacre. We come from a country that has a lot of skeletons in the closet, a lot of regrets, a lot of difficulties, from white settlement onwards. The good film-makers don’t shy away from that. I think that’s why our boisterous, rough-edged sardonic sense of humour can be quite biting and quite satirical. A way of acknowledging that we’re just not surf culture.Was John Lithgow as scary as he looked [in Jenny Pen] and how do you rate his Aussie accent?BenderRodriguezYes! The first conversation we had on a Zoom he said: “I’ve got this guy to make some special teeth.” And I went: “You’re my kind of actor.” He’s got aDe Palmadegree in horror acting. And he had silver-grey contacts made and said: “The moment I put them in, the character was 98% there.”I did tell him to beware the New Zealand accent. It’s a trap for English-speaking people. Kate Winslet is the only person I know who has the kind of dialect chops to do it. Her impression of Jane Campion was forensic in its detail. John and I talked about what one of my voice tutors used to call having an “idiolect”, which is the distinct sound of your voice. And John went for something nasty and dry and deceptive and duplicitous, just in the nature of the character.What is your favourite Peter Sellers film? After preparing for your great performance as him [in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers], would you agree with his very sad assessment that outsidehis roles, he had no real sense of his own identity?Bauhaus66I was so lucky. I was in LA doing Pirates and at the end of Sunset Boulevard there were a lot of extraordinary DVD and VHS shops. We found pretty much every Peter Sellers film. So I did watch everything. He was blessed with a kind of extraordinary genius. But with success and fame and drugs and swinging London and everything, you have to confront a lot of stuff. I think that happened to him.I don’t care that Caravaggio murdered people. I don’t mind that Ripley murders people, because I thought Andrew Scott made that characterso alarmingly truethat I sort of hoped he got away with it. A lot of what was going on around him was privileged and he’s going: “Fuck off! You are dead, east coast rich people!”View image in fullscreenSwinging time … Rush in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers.Photograph: United Archives GmbH/AlamyYou’ve portrayedLionel Logue(inThe King’s Speech),Donovan Donaly(Intolerable Cruelty),Hans Hubermann(The Book Thief),Sir Andrew Aguecheek(Twelfth Night), and even voicedBunyip Bluegum(The Magic Pudding). Is it purely coincidental, or are you secretly drawn to alliterative characters?VerulamiumParkRangerThis made me actually go through my IMDb list, and my theatrical list, to see if they’d missed anything. I avidly read Superman comics as a child and I was obsessed by the LL syndrome: Lois Lane, Lana Lang, Lex Luther. I found that kind of phenomenal when I was 10 as I did when I read Ulysses inShakespeare and Company, where I was fortunate enough to blag a room for six weeks when I first moved to Paris.I have played a “Harry” more times than any other character – in The Tailor of Panama, The Banger Sisters, in some short film. I’ve been ‘Harried’. Michael Caine has the same thing. Caine would only ever call Joaquin Phoenix “Joe-a-quin”; “You read it, Geoffrey,” he’d say. “And it’s notRafeFiennes, it’s Ralph.” He was hilarious like that.View image in fullscreenRush as Lionel Logue in The King’s Speech.Photograph: Publicity image from film companyKia ora!What attracts you to roles first – the story or the character? I love your performance inHouse on Haunted Hill,even though it’shardly Proust. You seem to have a whale of a time, though, and that comes through every scene.WilfyFrederickI never assumed it was Proust. I liked the fact that it was a William Malone horror piece, avoiding CGI, with all of the old William Castle techniques to create a netherworld and creepy scenarios. I’d been in tights or period costume for so long and I thought: this is the ideal role to do because, as one of the producers – Robert Zemeckis or Joel Silver – said: “It’s low budget. We’ll make it for $15m and it will do two bumper weekends for Halloween.” Which it did; it made $40m. So they were like: “Hey, we just made $25m. Let’s move on to the next chapter.” There was something nice about that.When you get home and are not working, what do you do for entertainment?AwightmateMy obsession apart from Superman and vaudeville is the Mercury Seven [astronauts] and the James Webb telescope. I’m intrigued that it’s now however many million miles at a certain point in orbit around the sun, so that it can be at the right temperature. And that they ingeniously had to develop this massive shield which is made up of hexagons. And that was all folded up mathematically, like a chrysalis, like a moth in a cocoon. And it went up into space and then it opened itself and we’re now seeing stuff in the dark.I’m just completely obsessed by the otherness of what’s out there. Everyone says one day they’ll suddenly go: “There’s been definite communication with beings or creatures or overdeveloped insects that went into a different direction. They’re making contact with us.” The magnitude of it all! But that may not even happen. It may have happened millions of years ago and come and gone.So just be happy that we actually evolved on this bit of rock and became relatively sophisticated. But notthatsophisticated, because this is probably the worst time the planet’s ever really been through. There’s an edge, and in Jenny Pen audiences tap into that. What would it be like to be in that home in the last chapter of your life, to know that there’s really no hope?I also like dogs and cryptic crosswords. I have a greyhound and a regular series of generational pugs. The one we’ve got at the moment is nearing her end. The look in her eyes is becoming bewildered and lost and I tell her: “You’re a honey.”The Rule of Jenny Pen is in UK and Irish cinemas now, and on digital platforms from 28 MarchExplore more on these topicsFilmThe reader interviewGeoffrey RushSpaceinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But after misfiring albums, a legal drama involving bright hopes NewJeans and with domestic fans getting bored, the South Korean music industry is nervousShaad D'SouzaThu 27 Mar 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 27 Mar 2025 14.22 EDTShareEarlier this decade, it seemed as if the long-vaunted South Korean takeover of American pop was finally happening. In summer 2020, BTS’s Dynamite became the first K-pop track to top the US chart, and in 2023, girl group Blackpink became the first K-pop act toheadline Coachella. But just two years later, the story looks very different.RubyandAlter Ego, recent solo albums by Blackpink members Jennie and Lisa, each debuted at No 7 on the US album chart before dropping out of the Top 10 after one week, and neither album produced a single that peaked higher than No 68. Relative newcomers such as Tomorrow X Together, Ateez and Twice have achieved solid first-week chart positions, thanks to strong physical album sales, before facing precipitous drop-offs. NewJeans – a young, critically acclaimed new K-pop group who looked to be the genre’s strongest hope in the US after Blackpink and BTS – have been bogged down by controversies and legal dramas in South Korea, stopping them from capitalising on the success of their 2023 single Super Shy.Even back home the genre is struggling. “K-pop has lost a lot of market traction in South Korea – the music is not being written to appeal to a Korean audience, but more to this homogenised, globalised audience,” says Sarah, the host of the Idol Cast podcast, who uses a pseudonym for fear of reprisal from K-pop fans. “It’s trying to be all things to all people, and ends up being sort of nothing to no one.”Sarah says thatK-popmade by obsessed-over “idols” – performers hot-housed in training camps by entertainment agencies – is no longer seen as cool in trend-conscious South Korea. “A lot of older fans have entered the fandom, including older women. I’m not bashing them, I’m one myself,” she says, but these newcomers have alienated young would-be fans. K-pop has also, she says, “become a lot more siloed” away from the rest of South Korean culture. “You’re not seeing idols in TV dramas or variety shows; a lot of content is moving on to gated [online] platforms like Weverse.”View image in fullscreenBTS in 2020, around the release of hit single Dynamite.This shift coincides, says US reporter Tamar Herman, with a move away from Korean lyrics. “It’s built to be exported,” she says. “Because of Dynamite’s success as an all-English song, K-pop started leaning into English.”This also alienated Korean listeners – while more innovative acts such as Le Sserafim and Aespa, without the forceful marketing push thatBTSand Blackpink received, haven’t found a footing in the US market. “The US loves to invest attention into certain artists – once you have it, you become the [sole] representative of [K-pop],” says Herman. “We don’t care for the hottest thing – we want the artists we’ve followed since high school, like Taylor Swift.”The UK has only fitfully embraced K-pop, though there’s enough of a fandom for Tomorrow X Together to play London’s huge O2 Arena this week, and for Stray Kids to book two nights at Tottenham Hotspur’s stadium in the summer. But artists like these, Sarah says, could be losing traction in South Korea because they have “pivoted their focus from the domestic market to the global K-pop market”. The South Korean charts are filled out instead with J-pop acts, Korean rap and “2D idols” like Plave, a virtual boyband. Meanwhile, Bang Bang Bang, a 2015 hit by boyband BigBang, “has consistently been one of the most-streamed K-pop songs globally over the past few months, which is not great for K-pop,” Sarah says. “Where are the new songs?”In the US, one of the few genuine hits by a K-pop star in recent months has beenAPT, by another Blackpink member, Rosé. But it sounds nothing like K-pop, instead taking its cues from pop-punk and new wave, and is a collaboration with the eternally popular Bruno Mars. “Take him out of the song and I doubt it’s nearly as successful,” says Joshua Minsoo Kim, a critic who reviewed Jennie and Lisa’s albums for Pitchfork.View image in fullscreenFans watching Le Sserafim at Coachella in April 2024.Photograph: Christina House/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images“[Rosé] has done everything she can to separate herself from the brand of K-pop,” says Sarah. “She’s even moved her copyrights to an American company – so that should speak to her confidence in the South Korean industry to handle an actual global hit song.”The teen five-piece NewJeans were one of the biggest success stories in K-pop’s western expansion. Their breakout EP, Get Up, featured collaborations with the alt-R&B singer-songwriter Erika De Casier and experimental Norwegian duo Smerz, and their innovative sound found acclaim among fans and critics. “[Producer] Min Hee-jin’s creative direction was very strong,” says Kim, and the music “was often produced by Korean producers privy to stuff happening in the underground and internationally”.Here was an act that actually felt cool to gen Z and younger millennials – but over the past year, NewJeans have been stuck in a bitter war with Hybe, the K-pop company that formed them. The group attempted to terminate their contract with Ador, the Hybe subsidiary that formed them in 2022, alleging mismanagement. The group were also angry over the fact that Min Hee-jin was dismissed as Ador’s chief executive. Ador subsequently sued NewJeans, alleging that the band had no grounds to terminate their contract – though in February the label stated they “regret the escalation of this matter to court and believe that most claims advanced by NewJeans members thus far have arisen from misunderstandings”.The band are the rare K-pop act to break ranks from the genre’s rigid corporate system; last year, they aired a bombshell livestream in which they spoke directly to fans about their perceived mistreatment. The spat has since bloomed into a media storm, fuelling discussions around the rights of K-pop stars as workers,a status they have been legally denied.View image in fullscreenNewJeans in July 2024 in Incheon, South Korea.Photograph: The Chosunilbo JNS/ImaZins/Getty ImagesThe potential ramifications are grave – a coalition of trade bodies warned in February that the spat could “collapse” the K-pop industry – and NewJeans have continued to act as whistleblowers. This month, member Danielle said that when she was a trainee in one of the idol boot camps, she was constantly surveilled and had to have all meals approved by management (Ador and Hybe have not commented on those allegations).Last week, a South Korean court ruled infavour of Ador, granting a preliminary injunction that will stop NewJeans from working outside their Ador contract until the main lawsuit hearing in April – they had recently been performing as NJZ. Ador has said that it is “fully committed to supporting the artists going forward” so long as they perform as NewJeans; the band, posting as NJZ, have said they can “no longer remain with a management that has disrespected our identities and undermined our achievements”. They are now on hiatus and planning to challenge the injunction, saying in a statement to Time magazine: “It almost feels like Korea wants to turn us into revolutionaries.”The UK may be waning as a pop superpower – but a new generation is being nurturedRead moreKim is pessimistic about a new K-pop group breaking the genre’s losing streak in the west, and Sarah says K-pop companies have started milking fanbases more intensely than before to make up for the decline in new artists breaking, with fees to access elements like fanclubs and exclusive videos. “At a certain point, the audience becomes tapped out: you can only pay so much for your hobby, especially looking at a recession coming around the corner,” she says. “You can’t ask fans to sustain this multimillion-dollar industry. It’s a losing strategy in the end.”But Herman still believes there is great K-pop going untapped in the US – “certain groups who are huge in other parts of the world”, such as girl group Twice, “arguably the biggest K-pop girl group of this generation, if you look at money and album sales. I don’t know if they’re going to cross over or not, but I’m here for everything.”Explore more on these topicsK-popPop and rockSouth KoreaBTSfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It seemed the antithesis of management-school custom and practice. But it worked, to be imitated after a fashion by Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and other digital tycoons with similar success.Donald Trumpis now seeing if it works in government.The smart money in Washington was that after the fiasco of Trump’s first term, his second would see a more emollient president, one careful of his reputation. He would reach out, consult, become a peacemaker, in his desperation to become aNobel presidentlike Barack Obama.How wrong that has proved. Trump is doing what few leaders dare do. He is being a cultural revolutionary, a Mao Zedong, a grandiloquent system smasher. He wants to reorder Washington’s role in the US and the US’s role in the world. He knows that he may have just two years before “the system” – the electoral cycle, the judiciary and state governments – blocks his path. If he truly wants revolution he must break things, and fast.The historianArthur Schlesingersaid the US needed occasional shocks to wipe away the cobwebs, the bureaucracy and the dirt of an ever more cumbersome union. Should it get out of hand and disaster threaten, the constitution was designed to pull the country back from the brink. Thus it rid itself of Richard Nixon, but not before his radicalism towards China achieved the US’s exit from Vietnam. Might this apply to Trump?Already a dose of the so-called new realism has torn through Nato’s cobwebs. Trump simply does not regard Russia as a threat to the US and western Europe. It is merely obsessed, as it has been throughout history, with its frontier states, with the Baltics, Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia and the “stans”, nations that Trump has little interest in defending. Yet ever since the end of the cold war – and during most of it – Nato’s rationale has relied on a thesis, a conventional wisdom, that Russia is set on the conquest of western Europe. If Keir Starmer really thinks, as he appears to, that Russia’s assault on Ukraine threatens Britain, Trump’s message is that Britain should pare down its welfare state and rearm quickly. American taxpayers are not going to be taken for that ride.It was indeed a Republican, Dwight Eisenhower, who warned against exaggerating the Russian threat to sustain Nato, which was already the biggest and richest military establishment the world had ever seen. The defence lobby demanded deterrence to be infinite. Trump has called that bluff. To him the US’s defence is just that: to guard its own borders. So should be Europe’s. It is hardly an outrageous view. No one was screaming for war when Russia invaded Georgia or Ukraine in 2014. It is one thing to disagree with this argument, another to dismiss it as 1939-style appeasement, as western defence lobbyists have done.Meanwhile, on the subject of borders Trump is hardly out on a limb. The US gainsabout 150,000Mexican immigrants a year, to join the11 million already there. Mexico and Canada bombard the US with imports, as does China. To Trump, Americans should pay for their goods what it costs Americans to make them. If they want Chinese cars they candonate 25%of the price to the government as a tariff. As for fentanyl, the way to get countries such as China to stem the flow and the deaths that follow is againwith tariffs, massive tariffs. Sometimes in diplomacy only force talks – force backed up with uncertainty.Almost every president comes to Washington promising to cut the bureaucracy. Thus did Warren Harding, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George W Bush. The reality is that an activist president breeds bureaucrats. The power of the centre in a democracy attracts more power. Trump knows he has no time for a long fight. It is Musk and the chainsaw or it is nothing. Education is not a federal function but a job for the states. So shut theUS Department of Education. Ditto USAID. Also slash the state department. Raid the Treasury. Sure, things will get broken, but it is no worse than doing nothing. That is what cultural revolution means.Let’s put it in language the Signal leakers will understand: what a bunch of pathetic sleazebags | Emma BrockesRead moreTrump and his administration’s actions have been in many respects appalling. To renege on Joe Biden’s aid to Ukraine in mid-battle, to call Volodymyr Zelenskyy a dictator, to insult Canada, to threaten Greenland, to stop famine relief to Africa, to propose a Gaza beach resort, to bully lawyers, toleak security meetings, all beggar belief. Trump and his team are like playground thugs in their crudity and rudeness.But this is the sound of things breaking. It illustrates why Washington develops a defensive “swamp”, to guard against inexperienced presidents. As it is, the chance of Trump succeeding in his radicalism is small. You cannot stage much of a revolution in two years.There will be a counter-revolution. Greenland is unlikely to be an American Ukraine. Tariffs will come back down. The Democrats will recover their nerve. Many of Trump’s “broken things” will be patched together. But in among the chaos are challenges to convention that were overdue. Nato could become realistic. A forever war in Ukraine – or wider – could be avoided and Russia readmitted to the community of nations, as China was after Nixon.This is at least possible. More to the point, the US may review its role in the world, a role that has meant a quarter of a century of moral belligerence, with appalling cost and slaughter. It should revert to being what it is, another nation among nations. That may even be the result of someone moving fast and breaking things.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

They assault you and your neighbours, throw stones at your house, beat you. If you try to defend yourself, or document the violence, they attack you. When the military arrive, they detain you. Some of themjoin inwith the violence. This harrowing scene is not a story from Tsarist Russia or Jim Crow America. Last Monday, this was exactly what occurred in the Palestinian village of Susya in the occupied West Bank.The attackers who arrived in Susya were neither Cossacks nor Klansmen but Jewish-Israeli settlers accompanied by soldiers. Indeed, when the attacks commenced, three Palestinians were seized by the Israeli military, detained, and then subjected to police interrogation. Such violent raids are far from unique inWest Bank, especially in the areas of South Hebron Hills, Masafer Yatta and the Jordan river valley. Since the start of this year, the Centre for Jewish Non Violence has documented more than 40 violent settler attacks in the village of Susya alone.Most go unnoticed by the rest of the world. But this time was different. One of the Palestinian victims was the award-winning director Hamdan Ballal, whose film,No Other Land,which covers the destruction of Palestinian communities in the occupied West Bank, won best documentary at the recent Academy Awards. For hours, the military didn’t officially disclose his whereabouts, and attempts to locate him failed. When the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) finally issued a statement, theyabsurdly labelledhim and his fellow villagers terrorists.This facade of justice, when law is nothing but an empty shell, is typical of how the Israeli occupation works. Under its veneer of legality, the most brutal savagery is legitimised and the role of criminal and victim inverted. In the past three years I have submitted numerous complaints to the Israeli Ministry of Defence and Israel’s attorney general about settler violence. Nothing has ever happened. My experience is only one of many that indicates how the Israeli legal system makes a farce of justice and allows settlers to terrorise Palestinian communities with impunity.After the attack on Gaza began in 2023, the reign of terror in the West Bank has only intensified. According toB’Tselem(the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories), settlers have forced at least 18 Palestinian communities – more than 1,000 people – to flee their homes since October 2023. The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has found that settler violence, intimidation and harassment havedisplaced at least 300 Palestinian households, including hundreds of children.Benjamin Netanyahu’s government hasn’t just stood by passively and allowed this to happen. It has actively allocated funding and weaponry to illegal settlers. Last June, the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data initiative (Acled) found that armed settlers, some of whom have formed their own quasi-military forces, had received a “considerable amount” of weapons and munitions, including thousands of pistols, M-16 semi-automatic rifles and machine guns from the Israeli military, while regional councils had coordinated with the IDF and the national security ministry to buy hundreds of additional rifles. As that report put it: “the lines between settlers and the military are increasingly blurring”, and “the difference between civilian aggressors and the Israeli state apparatus is fading even further”.While civilian security squads are supposed to act only in self-defence, the truth remains that Israel is unwilling to tackle those vicious gangs, and that senior government ministers advocate in their favour. Only last week, Israel’s security cabinet approved a plan to recognise 13 Jewish settlements in the West Bank as independent. “We continue to lead a revolution of normalisation and regulation in the settlements. Instead of hiding and apologising – we raise the flag, build and settle,” said theIsraeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich.The atrocity that happened in Susya is only one example of the countless injustices committed under this criminal occupation. It shouldn’t take an Oscar winner for international audiences to notice these acts of violence. The Palestinian people deserve safety and liberation from the occupation, and sovereignty and independence. The international community must play its part in pursuing this. In recent months,a numberof governmentshave issued sanctions against Israeli settlers. This is a good start, but these sanctions must be far stronger if they are to have an effect.The sanctions should include established illegal settler municipalities. Those imposed by the UK, for example, only targetthree illegal settler outposts and four organisationsthat have supported the settlers. The established municipalities, such as Shomron regional council, which oversees 35 settlements that are home to an estimated 47,200 people, are the driving force behind violent attempts to take control of more Palestinian territories. Personal sanctions against government ministers who block counter-terrorist measures against violent settler groups are also essential. The UK can play a leading role in coordinating this response, particularly given the moral depravity of Donald Trump’s administration. As Washington DC cancels sanctions against violent settlers, London could present the world with a different and more righteous path.When I arrived in Susya on Tuesday after the attack, I knew exactly what I wanted to tell its people. I said that we want to live together, Arabs and Jews, as brothers and sisters. That we are not the enemy of one another, as we struggle together for freedom. A mere day after a gang of criminal Israeli settlers terrorised this village, its villagers welcomed me,an Israeli member of the Knesset, and my message for peace. This proves that the real conflict is not between nations, but between those who seek justice and those who vow bloodshed. The government of Israel has chosen the path of bloodshed, ethnic cleansing and war. It is up to all of us – and to you – to choose a different path.Dr Ofer Cassif is a member of the Knesset, representing the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality (Hadash) since 2019Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Can the UK really be both?Nils PratleyThe government’s plan to ramp up defence spending means relying on carbon-intensive industries – and those won’t be the only policy compromises they have to makeThu 27 Mar 2025 14.46 EDTLast modified on Thu 27 Mar 2025 14.48 EDTShareThe UK will become a “defence industrial superpower”, said the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, inWednesday’s spring statement, an ambition that will involve using much more steel, one assumes.Now comes news that the Chinese owner of the UK’s second largest steel plantmay close its two blast furnaces as early as June, which would further erode the UK’s already-thin steel-making capabilities. Indeed, closure of Scunthorpe would also mean an end to domestic steel-making from scratch using traditional carbon-intensive blast furnaces – the other two, at Tata’sPort Talbot site, closed last year.To make the timing worse, the crisis at Scunthorpe has arrived while the government is still pondering its strategy for steel. A consultation, including an expert review of alternative technologies to make primary steel, closes next Monday. “The central mission of this government is growth. Steel can, and will, have an enormous role to play in driving that growth,”wrote Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, in his introduction. Fine, but what are you going to do about Scunthorpe?There are probably three broad options. None will look attractive.First, the government could offer Jingye, the Chinese owner, a bigger support package than the reported £500m to underwrite the intended switch to an electric arc furnace (EAF) – the greener tech that is being adopted at Port Talbot and uses mostly recycled steel. The problem with that idea is that talks with Jingye have already been running for two years and the funding gap is said to be enormous.US tariffs on steel importshave compounded existing problems, such as high energy prices.Second, the government could allow the blast furnaces to close and hope another steelmaker would accept a support package to build an EAF facility. That sounds risky. The only guaranteed outcome would be that the blast versions would close permanently (these things never reopen) and any newcomer might also want more than £500m.The fall-back option is nationalisation. Sheffield Forgemasterswas nationalised by the last government in 2021because it is a critical supplier of parts to the Royal Navy’s ships and submarines. But the aim of the steel consultation was to attract “new private investment” to expand UK steelmaking capability. A detour via temporary nationalisation, as happened after2019’s insolvency at British Steelat a cost of more than £600m to the taxpayer, is not meant to be part of the script.The stakes are even higher when you take a step back and ask whether spending more on defence is compatible with another of the government’s big ambitions – the one to be a “clean energy superpower”. Sir Dieter Helm, leading energy economist and former adviser to previous Labour and Conservative governments, asked the question ina lively paper(andaccompanying podcast) last week and its title – Defence and the Retreat from Net Zero – gives away his conclusion.Spending more on defence inevitably involves investing in heavy stuff that explodes, uses chemicals or is made in carbon-intensive ways. “Think steel, shells, fighter planes and support ships,” said Helm.One of his examples of the strategic challenges is worth quoting at length.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Imagine, then, that, as a defence policy, we close Port Talbot and the rest of the primary steel production in the UK. We still need the steel. Where will we get it from? Step forward China.“Now remember that the PM wants to keep very close to the US. Now imagine China invades Taiwan, and the US calls on Britain to support it – as it did in Afghanistan and Iraq. Perhaps the PM will follow Harold Wilson’s brave rejection of participation in Vietnam. Perhaps not. If the PM does want to stand ‘shoulder to shoulder’ with the US over Taiwan, it is hardly a safe assumption that the supply chain for defence, including the steel from China, is going to stand up.”His point is that a serious defence policy needs secure supply chains and energy- and carbon-intensive industries that don’t pass the green test. The Scunthorpe plant itself may be destined for a cleaner furnace eventually, but the mix of steel, defence and net zero ambitions raises deep questions. Setting aside £2.5bn to revive steelmaking in the UK may be easy bit. If Helm is right, there will also be policy compromises.Explore more on these topicsSteel industryNils Pratley on financeDefence policycommentShareReuse this content"

That’s a very big deal, and while the president insists this hefty import tax on cars is going to be good for “anybody who has plants in the United States”, his move – like a car in desperate need of a tune-up – could easily backfire.Nearly half of the cars sold in the US are imported, and Trump’s 25% tariff will add at least $6,000 to the sticker price of the average car, industry experts say. Domestic auto producers will be able to jack up their sticker prices because the new tariffs will make US automakers face considerably less price competition from imported cars. This expected sticker shock could anger America’s inflation-weary consumers and voters, especially since candidate Trump had pledged to battle to bring down prices. These higher car prices could cause a quick drop in auto sales in the US, and that could translate into a downturn in auto production, too.Trump’s big hope, as well as the United Auto Workers’ big hope, is that the tariffs will encourage automakers – especially GM, Ford and Stellantis (the successor company to Chrysler) – to bring lots of their car production back into the US long term. Shawn Fain, the UAW’s president applauded Trump “for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working-class communities for decades”. Fain, an outspoken supporter of Kamala Harris, added: “Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today’s actions.”What the accidentally leaked war group chat reveals about the Trump administration | Moira DoneganRead moreThe UAW has been one of the leading critics of the three-decade-old North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). That union warned that the agreement would do grievous damage to US manufacturing by giving Mexico, a country with far lower wages, free access to the US market. The UAW cautioned that Nafta would be a boon for profit-hungry US corporations, but a bane for US factory workers. The UAW proved correct about that. The Economic Policy Institute, a progressive research group, estimates that the US lost 682,000 jobs because of Nafta. (Stellantis makes several models of its Ram pick-up truck in Mexico, while GM makes the electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox there.)In a statement released on Wednesday, Fain said: “With these tariffs, thousands of good-paying blue collar auto jobs could be brought back to working-class communities across the United States within a matter of months.” But many industry experts are dubious about that, in effect saying that the UAW should be careful what it wishes for. Trump’s aggressive trade war as well as his on-again, off-again deployment of tariffs has badly shaken consumer and corporate confidence, caused stock markets to tumble and made many economists warn that the strong economy Trump inherited from Biden could sink into recession.Slumping consumer confidence, together with soaring sticker prices, could take a serious bite out of US car sales and cause production to sink. In an unhappy forecast, Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, a market research firm, said that as a result of Trump’s auto tariffs, US plants would churn out 20,000 fewer cars per week, about a 30% drop compared with before Trump imposed the tariffs. “By mid-April we expect disruption to virtually all North American vehicle production,” Smoke said in a Wednesday conference call with clients and journalists. “Bottom line: lower production, tighter supply and higher prices are around the corner.”As for Trump’s dream that his tariffs will result in far more domestic auto production long term, that could prove elusive. During Trump’s two months back in office, he has disconcerted and discombobulated corporate executives by sowing uncertainty and instability – by his and Elon Musk’s tearing up of the federal government; by his repeatedly flouting federal law and the constitution; and by his imposing tariffs one day, then suspending them the next day, and then reimposing them a few days later. Moreover, Trump has executives fearing an economic downturn, with his commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, saying Trump’s policies are “worth it” even if they cause a recession.When CEOs are feeling so uncertain due to Trump’s volatility, capriciousness and antics – as well has him changing his mind every few days on trade policy – that Trump-induced sense of instability means auto executives are unlikely to do what Trump wants: to rush to invest a billion or two to build a new auto plant. If Trump and his team had gone about imposing tariffs with a far steadier hand and had made their case in a more thoughtful, non-Trumpian way, then many executives would be far more open to building auto plants and other plants in the US in response to tariffs.The Canadian Chamber of Commerce warned that Trump’s auto tariffs could backfire badly. In a statement, the chamber said: “Throwing away tens of thousands of jobs on both sides of the border will mean giving up North America’s auto leadership role, instead encouraging companies to build and hire anywhere else but here. This tax hike puts plants and workers at risk for generations, if not forever.”Trump’s sudden announcement on auto tariffs will certainly help him in one way – it made tariffs the nation’s lead news story and pushed to the side those hard-hitting stories about the Trump administration’s acutely embarrassing leak on bombing Yemen. On the other side of the ledger, the tariffs will hurt Trump and the US in a profound way. By imposing a 25% tariff on auto imports from Canada and Mexico, Trump, many trade experts say, is blatantly violating the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a free trade agreement that Trump signed in his first term. (Trump once called it the “best and most important trade deal ever made by the USA”.) Brad Setser, an expert on global trade at the Council of Foreign Relations, said this breach of the USMCA would hurt the US’s credibility and “may raise questions about the value of any future deals Trump signs”.For decades, the UAW has been right about the need for Washington to do more to prevent the loss of manufacturing jobs (and to help those workers who lost their factory jobs). But with Trump, the UAW seems to be betting on an unsteady, capricious – and anti-union – general to win a trade war, but as veteran racetrack bettors will tell you, unsteady horses rarely win the race.Steven Greenhouse is a labor reporter.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionDonald TrumpUS economycommentShareReuse this content"

Shyness was comparative, and, in my family of origin, there was always someone shyer than me.I didn’t notice my shyness until I split with my first long-term partner when I was 26. He’d been my boyfriend from the age of 14, so – by the time we parted – almost half my life. This first boyfriend was gregarious, always ready for a chat. He had a way of walking into a room and cracking a joke, so by the time I entered on his tailwind, everyone was already laughing. He’d warmed the room and I’d felt welcome. I’d never been an adult without him, so didn’t have any awareness of how he’d held me under his wing.In the aftermath of our split, I became conscious of how difficult I found certain aspects of socialising. Simple things like how to enter and exit a room. Beginnings and endings: how to start a chat and how to finish one. How to mingle in a crowd of people. Parties or gatherings of any sort suddenly became fraught.I’m scared of being the granny everyone avoids. How do I get over this? | Leading questionsRead moreI’d always assumed my ex-partner was simplyfriendlybut, in 2013, a decade after our split, I readSusan Cain’s, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talkingand realised he wasan extrovertand I wasan introvert. According to Cain, shyness and introversion often cross over but they aren’t the same thing.Extroversion and introversion exist along a spectrum but they are mostly viewed as traits we’re born with rather than develop. It seemed odd that I had to get to 36 to learn this about myself. My chattiness one-on-one had worked as a distraction. In fact, I found bigger groups overwhelming and needed lots of alone time to recharge. Like the shyness, my obvious introversion took some time to become obvious to me.My granddaughter came in to this world so vivacious that her extroversion was impossible to miss. Even from before she was mobile, she was throwing her arms up in welcome and squealing with delight at the sight of a visitor. Everything displayed, everything shared. She’s so friendly out in public that I often come up against my own shyness when I carry her around. When she started talking, she’d motion to someone in the queue ahead and say – “I shy” – but what she meant was,I would like to connect with that person and I’m not sure how.Striking up conversations with strangers is not my forte but she seemed to want my help. She was not yet two but she was already pushing me out of my comfort zone. One day, while I was wheeling her along the main street of my country town, an unknown woman called out, “Hey, party girl!” This was clearly not aimed at me and I had to laugh. My granddaughter’s social networks were already larger than mine and she was still in nappies.What is a shy person to do with such gregariousness?My eldest son, her father, had been the same. Throughout his life I’d watched him making enthusiastic small talk with strangers. As a teen he’d start up chats with elderly people at the checkout, spying dogfood in their trolleys and asking what type of dog they had. Often, they’d brace at first – the dissonance of this friendliness with his teenage attire – but a few minutes in and they’d be smiling. When he was young, before I’d read Cain’s book, I’d tried to force rest days on him to catch up from the kind of socialising that left me drained. He never seemed to need it but I did.On these home days all his games involved imaginary “parties”. I found his outgoingness baffling; he wondered why I was always so tired. When my second born came on the scene, dreamy and internal, he made perfect sense. He cried when I took him out in the world, all that overwhelming sound and colour. He nestled into me, staying close. As a toddler, his favourite game was snuggling on the couch. Our needs in perfect sync.In my family, introvert-extrovert pairings are common. Both my sons have paired up with their opposites. Now I understand the terminology, it all seems so clear! My introvert son’s partner once declared, “I hate having a shower, it’s so boring!” and I realised it was the only time she ever spent alone. I watch them all navigate their differing needs: the introverts enjoying recharging in quiet, the extroverts wanting chats in the shower.My granddaughter is now just past two but she can talk up a storm. I was out with her a few weeks back and we bumped into a friend I hadn’t seen for years. I was immediately awkward but my granddaughter came to my aid. “You have a blue dress!” she said to my friend, “and mine is pink!” The ice was broken. It was a beginning. I was holding my granddaughter on my hip but she had me under her wing.My younger son and his partner have a fifteen-week-old baby. A new granddaughter! Thus far, she’s expressive and smiley. My older son’s partner gave birth last week. A grandson! In this genetic lottery, I wonder what we’ll get. Introverts who’ll snuggle on the couch, or extroverts who’ll help us make new friends.

One can only imagine what other information has been as recklessly handledThu 27 Mar 2025 14.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 27 Mar 2025 14.39 EDTShareOver the past six months or so, the Atlantic has been assembling more and more reporting talent, including by poaching some of the biggest stars from the troubled Washington Post.One of the best intelligence reporters in the country is Shane Harris, who moved from the Post to the Atlantic last summer.Harris shared the byline this week on the Atlantic’s shocking scoop, in which top editor Jeffrey Goldberg inadvertently was given access to a group text where top US officials were planning a strike in Yemen.Before they published and at every step along the way, the Atlantic conferred with knowledgable lawyers about how to proceed. The journalists revealed what they had in stages, and carefully.The Atlantic thus was a model of caution and good judgment.“Jeff Goldberg and The Atlantic handled the whole thing perfectly,” Martin Baron, the renowned editor who led the Washington Post newsroom until 2021, told me in an email on Thursday.The journalists’ actions “could be a college journalism class in careful, ethical handling of sensitive information”, said David Boardman, dean of Temple University’s media school.The contrast was sharp between those well-considered measures and the dangerous negligence at the highest level of theTrump administration. One awful thing is that this incompetence is baked in; in a very real sense it is intentional. Just as “the cruelty is the point,” as writer Adam Serwer said years ago of Trump World, so is the bumbling.It’s an offshoot of the only thing that really matters to Trump: loyalty.“Carelessness – or any of the injurious attributes of clowns, idiots and buffoons – is something Trump can trust,” noted John Stoehr, who writes The Editorial Board, a politics newsletter. “When things go south, as they will, he can trust them to cling to him more tightly, as by then, he might be the only thing standing between them and a jail cell.”Here’s one telling detail. When Tim Miller on the Bulwark’s daily podcast asked Goldberg about the covert CIA operative who was named in the text thread, the Atlantic editor said he purposely withheld her name.“I didn’t put it in the story because she’s under cover. But, I mean, the CIA director put it in the chat.”Yet, inevitably, Trump loyalists responded by trashing Goldberg and the Atlantic. Always attack, as Trump learned decades ago at the knee of the disgraced lawyer Roy Cohn.Thus, Goldberg was described as sleazy, and the magazine itself as hyper-partisan and failing.The press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, called the story “another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin”.You would have to be plenty credulous or truth-averse to buy that, and much of Maga Nation is just that, including those who relied on Fox News – where, soon after the story broke, prime-time host Jesse Watters made himself part of the defense team: “Journalists like Goldberg will sometimes send out fake names with a contact with their cells to deceive politicians. … This wouldn’t surprise me if Goldberg sneaked his way in.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Margaret SullivanFree newsletterSign up to get email alerts every time Margaret Sullivan publishes a new column.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just so.Shining a bright spotlight on this mess was a public service. One can only imagine what other information has been as recklessly handled.Maybe this revelation will prevent future lapses, though with this crowd in charge I wouldn’t count on it. Instead, we’ll see punitive leak investigations and even more efforts to control information.Still, this chapter does show the value of conscientious journalism in an increasingly dangerous environment.There has been plenty of sleaziness on display in recent days – but it has nothing to do with the Atlantic’s exemplary reporting.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS politicsPete HegsethDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

(This is not the first time he has referred to Musk this way. Right before the election last year,Walz told a crowd: “Look, Elon’s on that stage, jumping around, skipping like a dipshit.”)Parking for a moment the perfection of the phrase “skipping like a dipshit” to capture Musk’s very particular style of movement and speech, the range of what can and can’t be said in politics has clearly, radically changed. When you look back on the phrase that caused Hillary Clinton so much trouble in 2016 – “basket of deplorables” – it sounds like a quote from an 18th-century novel. “Take that, sir! You and your basket of deplorables!” Now we have Trump referring to Jeffrey Goldberg, the Atlantic editor mistakenly added to the Signal chat, as a “sleazebag”, and Hegseth, the US defense secretary, telling JD Vance that he fully shares the vice-president’s “loathing of European free-loading”. We are millimetres away from someone shouting “asshole” across the floor of the Senate.The Signal chat, obviously, wasn’t supposed to be public, and responding to the leak this week has put the White House in a delicious bind – or rather, a bind that we might have enjoyed as delicious had it not underscored just how petrifyingly stupid Trump’s team really is. On Wednesday, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, had simultaneously to dismiss further revelations from the Atlantic designed to expose the White House lie that none of the information discussed was classified, whileslamming the magazinefor leaking “sensitive information”. Well, Karoline, which is it?The new information shared by the Atlantic on Wednesday was, to use government-approved language, freaking MIND-BLOWING. Two hours before the Yemeni bombing raid, Hegseth, Vance and national security adviser Mike Waltz went intoextraordinary detailas to the exact timing, nature and target of the bombings. “1345: ‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME – also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s),” wrote Hegseth, followed by a stream of similar details. After the release of the information on Wednesday, retired military brass lined up in the US to tell cable news channels: “There is no question this is classified.”The Guardian view on the Signal war plans leak: a US security breach speaks volumes | EditorialRead moreAnd while it remained deeply unfortunate for theTrump administrationthat, of all the people they might have mistakenly cc-ed into the group, it happened to be a serious journalist like Jeffrey Goldberg, given the frat boy tenor of the exchange, it could also have been a lot worse. We should, surely, be grateful that Mike Waltz, the national security adviser who organised the group on Signal, didn’t do that thing – look, we’ve all done it – where you inadvertently send a bitchy message about someone to the person in question, or in this case a message outlining a plan to drop a bomb on their head to the Houthi rebel commander target. Or as Waltz described him, in the style of a man shooting the breeze at the water cooler, “their top missile guy”. One assumes the only reason that guy wasn’t in the chat, too, is that he hadn’t gotten around to signing up for Signal.It’s not the rudeness, of course, it’s the flippancy that terrifies. The tone of the messages flying between the most powerful people in the world via an unsecure messaging app and on subjects of vital national security was that of someone idly texting with one hand while throwing and catching a hacky sack in the other. At one point, per Wednesday’s new trove, Mike Waltz wrote “typing too fast” and it must have taken every shred of collective will power in the group for no one to reply, “Sausage fingers!”Waltz, by the way, is the figure who has come closest to saying sorry for the mess, remarking on Fox News on Tuesday that he took “full responsibility” for the error. But then he ruined the vanishingly rare moment of appearing to be the only adult in the room by referring to Goldberg – a hero without whom none of us would know any of this had happened – as “scum”. And, sadly, back we went to square one.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSignal group chat leakOpinionTrump administrationUS national securityPete HegsethUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

This appalling situation can’t go onThu 27 Mar 2025 14.41 EDTLast modified on Thu 27 Mar 2025 17.22 EDTShareArecord 4.5 million children in the UK weregrowing up in povertyin the year to April 2024, according to figures released on Thursday, which provide a chilling backdrop to the government’s newly announced benefit cuts. Staff at a Blackpool charity, Disability First, have received “terrified phone calls” as claimants struggle to understand how the disability benefit reductions in the chancellor’s spring statement will affect them.About a third of childrenlive in deprivation. Those with lone parents, or two or more siblings, or in families where someone is disabled are overrepresented among the poorest households. This is hardship of a scale and severity that can be hard to comprehend for those who have not experienced or seen it. Recent research from the Trades Union Congress revealed that 17% of workers surveyed hadskipped a mealto save money over a three-month period. As well as shortages of food, the poorest families face problems with housing and essentials such as clothing, toiletries and furniture. Headteachers have reported pupils being exhausted due to lack of sleep, and distressed by feelings of shame, among poverty’sdetrimental effects.Speculation that thetwo-child benefit limitintroduced by George Osborne could soon be abolished, or made more generous to families with pre-school-age children, evaporated in the run-up to Wednesday’s speech. The government’s child poverty strategy is not now expected for months – perhaps around the time of June’s spending review. But these figures are the shocking baseline from which Sir Keir Starmer’s government must advance.Some experts had anticipated less bleak data from the final year of Rishi Sunak’s government, due to the boost fromcost of living payments. The combination of the 2023-24 figures with the anticipated effect of Rachel Reeves’s£4.8bn cuts to social securitymeans that the outlook for the poorest households is bleak. The government’s own assessment is that 250,000 more people, including 50,000 children, will be in relative poverty by the end of the decade as a result of the squeeze on welfare. Critics argue that thetrue number could be 100,000 higher.Ms Reeves’s insistence in a round of media appearances that she wants people to be richer, not poorer, rang hollow. Investment in job centres should help some benefits claimants into work in due course, if done well. The small uplift in the basic rate of universal credit is welcome. But the chancellor’s decision to prioritise arbitrary fiscal rules above the livelihoods of the poorest people was the wrong one. Any suggestion that cuts on this scale will not hit the living standards of vulnerable families, including children, must be dismissed as nonsense.Only in Scotland is there any relief from grim predictions. There,child poverty fell to 22% in 2023‑24– the lowest figure of the UK’s four nations – mainly due to the introduction of the Scottish child payment. The UK government should demonstrate a similar – if belated – commitment to protecting the youngest citizens when its child poverty strategy appears.A change of direction and a restatement of what ought to be among Labour’s first principles – that millions of children in one of the world’s richest countries should not be going hungry – is needed. But the signs are that ministers, backbenchers and campaigners who want it will have to fight for it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Trump White House boasts of being the most transparent administration in history – though commentatorshave suggestedthat the inadvertent leak of military plans to a journalist may have happened because senior figures were using messaging apps such as Signal to avoid oversight. Last week, itreleased thousands of pages of documentson John F Kennedy’s assassination. Donald Trump hasdeclaredthat Kennedy’s family and the American people “deserve transparency and truth”.Strikingly, this stated commitment to sharing information comes as his administration defunds data collection and erases existing troves of knowledge from government websites. The main drivers appear to be the desire to remove “woke” content andglobal heating data, and the slashing of federal spending. Information resources are both the target and collateral damage. Other political factors may be affecting federal records too. Last month, Mr Trumpsacked the head of the National Archiveswithout explanation, after grumbling about the body’s involvement in the justice department’s investigation into his handling of classified documents.The impact is already painfully evident.Cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationhave affected not only climate records but also anextreme weather risk tool. The purge’s results are absurd as well as damaging. A webpage on the Enola Gay, the aircraft that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, appears to have beenmarked for deletionbecause it was mistaken for a reference to LGBTQ+ issues.Yet the disparity between the data dump on the Kennedy assassination and the removal of other material is not a contradiction. It speaks volumes about the administration’s approach to truth and knowledge, which it regards as contingent and a matter of convenience. (Tellingly, it is alsoaxingthe body that provides most federal funding to libraries.)The 1963 presidential assassination is not only an event around which multiple theories circle but one that helped feed a broader culture of conspiracy theorising and distrust in authority. That has metastatised to the bizarre and extreme claims embraced and even promoted by Mr Trump or figures around him, includingbirtherism,PizzagateandQAnon. These increasingly fantastical narratives have had real-world consequences. Facts, science and rationality itself are under attack.In his first term, Mr Trump’s aides shamelesslypromoted “alternative facts”while decrying actual facts as “fake news”. The Washington Posttallied more than 30,000 false or misleading claimsover those four years. This time round, his administration is removing existing sources of information. Websites, datasets and other informationvanished from federal health websites– such as that for the Centers for Disease Control – last month, though some has since reappeared. One scientistcalledit “a digital book burning”. The Union of Concerned Scientistshas warnedthat “critically important science conducted at many US agencies, institutions, and universities [is] under increasing assault”.Ad hoc preservation of essential national information and records is usually the work of those faced with the destructive force offoreign invasions,jihadist insurgenciesor dictators. But as this bonfire blazes, a motley but committed array of individuals – “nerds who care”,in the words of one– are fighting back by preserving data before it is deleted. Their admirable effort to defend the truth deserves support.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We are now beginning to wonder why we bothered. Labour in opposition promised to ensure that the public would see a significant improvement in essential public services and in their economic wellbeing, but there is a fundamental flaw and inherent dishonesty in this government pretending it can achieve this while adopting an economic policy clothed in a self-imposed straitjacket.Rachel Reeves’s spring statement (Rachel Reeves accused of balancing books on back of UK’s poorest, 26 March) further exacerbates the chasm between her party’s ambitions in opposition and its achievements in government. A year ago, Frances Ryan asked:What’s the point of Starmer’s Labour if it won’t stand up for poor, sick or disabled people?That is just one of the questions that many of us are beginning to ask.Peter RiddleWirksworth, Derbyshire“Welfare savings from withdrawing or cutting incapacity benefits”; “Thousands of public sector jobs to go”; “Government departments facing major cuts to their budgets”.Sound familiar? Headlines from George Osborne’s spending review in 2010. That went really well, didn’t it? Good job Labour has learned lessons from that. Still, at least it saved money by copying and pasting from it.Peter LoschiOldham, Greater ManchesterSo all disabled people who want to work will be supported in obtaining secure and well-paid jobs as part of Labour’s drive to reduce welfare costs and get Britain working. I recall a previous Labour government targeting disabled people bywithdrawing financial support to some Remployfactories under the guise of helping those people affected to secure work in open employment. As feared at the time by disability groups, the reality was that the scheme was really about reducing welfare costs.The majority of people who lost their job at a Remploy factory faced long-term unemployment and loss of independence and self-worth. History will repeat itself with this Labour government’s shameless attack on disabled people.John MaherLiverpoolI am sickened that a Labour chancellor, confronted with an unfavourable financial forecast, thinks the only course of action is to expect the poorest in society to have their income reduced to fill the gap. Our system is awash with tax breaks for the better-off.Rachel Reevesis behaving exactly as I would expect a Tory chancellor to, which is not what I, or the rest of those who voted Labour, wanted out of a new government.John RennieGerrards Cross, BuckinghamshireLike Jon Burnell (Letters, 25 March), I too am appalled by this Labour government. As a member since 1960, I see a party that is led by a former human rights lawyer who cannot tolerate dissent, that echoes the cruelty of the last Conservative government, and that implements economic policies which seek to penalise the most needy and vulnerable. I have started to ask myself when does loyalty become an endorsement of the unacceptable? I am going to find it very difficult to renew my membership next year.George RedmanNew Eltham, LondonDo you think Keir Starmer, Rachel Reeves and the rest of this welfare-cutting cabinet can wash the lower halves of their bodies themselves? I just cannot believe that it is a Labour government that is targeting disabled people in such a shameful way. We would have been a better society under another Rishi Sunak government – and I have been a Labour voter all my long life. I can’t vote Labour now, not while this lot are in power.Pat StaplesSouthamptonI have been a Labour supporter all my life, but I am appalled by the spring statement. I know that Rachel Reeves loves savings, so I have today resigned my Labour membership and will be donating the money saved to Save the Children instead.Nick RozanskiLondonIf that’s not austerity, I’m a spring onion!Jol MiskinSheffieldDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

ButFawzi Ibrahimsays sovereignty is pricelessThu 27 Mar 2025 13.46 EDTLast modified on Thu 27 Mar 2025 14.25 EDTSharePolly Toynbee (Rachel Reeves is all about growth. So why won’t she admit that Brexit is its worst enemy?, 25 March) demonstrates conclusively how much self-inflicted economic damage the UK is suffering from Brexit. She could also have mentioned the critical loss of investment from the EU’s long-term financing bank, the European Investment Bank (EIB).During the UK’s EU membership, the EIB invested some £150bn in mainly infrastructure projects in the UK, representing actual investment of two to three times that amount, taking account of the EIB’s ability to attract other long-term co-financers. This key stream of investment and growth ceased with Brexit, and the successor regional investment banks established by the government havenot come remotely nearto replacing the EIB’s level of finance. If, as Toynbee urges, the government were bold enough to face down the Brexiters, there would be at least an opportunity to renegotiate access to EIB finance. No other source of significant investment is in prospect.Brian UnwinPresident,European Investment Bank, 1993-2000Polly Toynbee asserts that leaving the EU has cost the country “huge sums”. This may or may not be true. But I do remember being told by the same people that voting to leave would crush the economy and cause the pound to plummet, turning sterling into junk.Immediately after the BBC projected a leave win on referendum night, the pound did dive, to a chorus of “I told you so” from politicians and pundits. But, like a phoenix, it soon rose up as the markets and people across the world realised that there is something to be said for independence and national sovereignty.If one is to follow Toynbee’s logic, the Canadians better agree to be the 51st state of the US if they are to avoid their economy wrecked by tariffs from across their southern border. But Canadians know that independence and sovereignty cannot be weighed against pounds and pence; they are priceless.Fawzi IbrahimNational officer, Trade Unions Against the EUDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Goals from Sandy Baltimore, Nathalie Björn and Mayra Ramírez saw off City in style to set up a mouthwatering semi-final against the Champions League holders, Barcelona, who earlierdispatched Wolfsburg 10-2 on aggregate.Sonia Bompastor marvels at Chelsea’s mental strength on ‘perfect night’Read moreThe Chelsea manager made five changes to the team that scored astoppage-time winnerat the Etihad Stadium on Sunday and it was this ability to freshen up her team that many predicted would make the difference. Sure enough the Blues were able to maintain an intensity that a depleted and limited City squad could not match.Much has been made of City’s injury crisis, with Khadija Shaw, Aoba Fujino, Rebecca Knaak, Lauren Hemp, Alex Greenwood, Laura Blindkilde Brown and Ayaka Yamashita all out and only five players named on the bench for the trip to Stamford Bridge.However, the home team also had absentees; Naomi Girma, Sam Kerr, Guro Reiten, Maelys Mpomé, Kadeisha Buchanan and Sophie Ingle all injured and Zecira Musovic pregnant.Such is the quality and number of players available to Chelsea it is easy to forget who is not there and overlook the work done to ensure they remain competitive. City’s injuries are a valid excuse for failure on the pitch but they are not an excuse for a club that should be investing more in its playing group.View image in fullscreenNathalie Björn rises highest to head Chelsea level in the tie from a corner.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAThere was a frenetic energy to Chelsea from the off as a result of the fresh legs, a fire in the bellies and belief emanating from the players. Bompastor stood in a power stance in her technical area, living every pass and every run, one step away from racing on to the pitch to do the job herself.Their pressure was relentless and although the crowd was half the size of that which graced theEmirates Stadium a night earlier, the 10,769 fans absorbed the fight of the players in blue and fed back with the same intensity. Goals were coming and they were only going one way, the contrast between the game in London and the phenomenal and battling City performanceeight days priorwas stark. It took 14 minutes for Chelsea to capitalise on their dominance, a relentless Lucy Bronze driving into the box from the right and launching a shot off the post that Baltimore was there to follow up on, blasting into the corner from the left.City regrouped, somewhat, in the immediate aftermath of the goal, Mary Fowler and Kerolin forcing straightforward saves from Hannah Hampton, and then the Chelsea show resumed. They were level on 37 minutes and ahead just before the break for the first time in the tie.First, Baltimore’s corner was met by Björn, who sent a looping header past Khiara Keating, the Chelsea duo returned to the starting XI for this fixture, then Lauren James escaped on the right before pulling the ball back for Ramírez to turn in. The visiting team looked shell-shocked, unable to cope with or adapt to the terrier-like pressure of their opponents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were still the more potent side, Johanna Rytting Kaneryd and Erin Cuthbert forcing saves from Keating minutes apart just after the hour.Cuthbert would go closest in the second half, another effort coming back off the bar earning a collected gasp of disappointment from the crowd that had chanted “we want four” at half-time.City tried to muster some sort of challenge, the one-goal margin providing some hope for Nick Cushing’s team, but it left them exposed at the back and Chelsea were a constant threat on the break.Bompastor’s side have emerged from the four back-to-back games against City with three wins and one defeat – that one defeat, in the first leg, the game they could afford to lose. They march on with a first trophy under their belts, the League Cup, and, arguably, their best form ahead of them.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueChelsea WomenManchester City WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A second motion brought by the RFU, proposing greater devolution of powers to the regions to address local issues, was passed with an 80% majority.Richard Wigglesworth: ‘I’ll be honest … and think of nothing but the Lions’Read moreThe RFU interim chair, Bill Beaumont, called for unity after the vote and described the outcome as “emphatic” in his closing address, but the wounds of this long-running dispute will take some time to heal. The trigger for this revolt led by the Whole Game Union, an alliance of Championship, grassroots clubs and refereeing bodies, was the revelation in November that Sweeney received a £358,000 bonus last year, taking his overall remuneration to £1.1m, despite the RFU reporting losses of £37.9m.“This is not a time to argue, but to pull together,” Beaumont said. “The time for division is past. Now is the time to unite behind an opportunity to renew English rugby.“Let us put behind this period of in-fighting and modernise the union. Let’s get back to focusing on the many positives in our game. Every single player who puts that white shirt on started off in community rugby – every single one of them.”The final decision on Sweeney’s future lies with the RFU board, but it has backed him throughout and after he received almost 66% of the vote, the RFU views the result as an endorsement of his position.Sweeney did not speak during or after the meeting, but received the strong backing of the former international referee and RFU board member Wayne Barnes.“One thing that rugby has always told me is that if there are two sides to an argument, when the referee makes a decision, you move on,” Barnes said. “What we’ve seen tonight is a decision being made by the members. And quite a strong decision, 66% of the vote saying that Bill Sweeney should remain.“We’ve had a clear instruction to move on with what we’ve learnt over the last few months. Sir Bill Beaumont has been around the clubs, listening, understanding what the concerns of the game are. We want to action them. We will challenge our executive team to do exactly what they have been tasked to do.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Nottingham chair, Alistair Bow, welcomed the devolution of power and said the clubs would continue to hold the RFU to account, with 11 proposals for further governance changes to be presented at their AGM in June.“I think the result was not as important as what comes next,” Bow said. “What I think we have seen is a very strong support for change. When you look at the numbers [in support of Sweeney] I think that clearly shows you that there’s a big problem in the game.“If it was in the corporate world, as a CEO you would be in a spot of bother, you wouldn’t be surviving. What has been said tonight is that clubs want change and they are expecting to see change.“I think the strong message from speaking to Bill Sweeney and Bill Beaumont afterwards is that we’re going to see change.

Yet while it was neither unexpected nor particularly surprising, there is more to it than simple dissatisfaction with an underperforming driver. Replacing him with Yuki Tsunoda was a U-turn that indicates fundamental problems the team are facing, ones to which they are unlikely to find a quick fix, and that Max Verstappen is unhappy at their performance and indeed their prospects for the new season.Lawson, who had already looked shell-shocked by the close of the second race in China last weekend, was left entreating the team to give him just a little more time.Red Bullwere not forthcoming. On Thursday morning they announced he would be replaced by Tsunoda from their sister team, RB, the Japanese driver having originally been passed over for the seat in Lawson’s favour at the end of last season.Verstappen makes feelings known after Red Bull drop Lawson for TsunodaRead moreThe New Zealander was less experienced but expected to be better able to come up to speed and to come closer to matching Verstappen, the defending world champion, but it really did not go to plan. He endured the worst sequence of qualifying in the team’s history, 18th in Australia, 19th for the sprint in China and 20th for the GP. He crashed out in the Melbourne race and went pointless in both races at Shanghai.Far from being close to Verstappen he was not even that close to the midfield, flailing with a car he could barely manage and with no obvious indication that he was going to come to terms with it, although two races is a very short time for anyone with only 11 grands prix under his belt to have a handle on a brand new ride.So Red Bull pulled the trigger. Yet it is impossible not to surmise there was more to it than Lawson not being up to scratch. The team are simply not where they expected to be at the start of this season. Having endured the second half of last year with a car that was unstable and sorely lacking in balance – which Verstappen nonetheless still managed to drag to the title – the target had been to address the issues over the winter and come back with a solid drive for the Dutchman’s defence and to vie for the constructors’ championship.In the statement announcing the switch,Christian Hornerconceded as much. “We acknowledge there is a lot of work to be done with the RB21,” the team principal said. Which in F1 terms is a seismic admission from a man in his position. The expected development of the car has not been achieved and even in Verstappen’s hands it is at best still well behind the McLaren and perhaps struggling to match the Mercedes.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen is unhappy with Red Bull’s performance and their prospects for the new season.Photograph: ShutterstockWhen they took Lawson on, this was not expected to be the case but given it is then Tsunoda, with 89 grands prix under his belt, suddenly looks the better option to help work through the problems, as Horner acknowledged. “Yuki’s experience will prove highly beneficial in helping to develop the current car,” he said.Red Bull enjoyed a hugely dominant car in 2022 and 2023, especially, but the direction it has gone in since has not proved beneficial, while the opposition has caught up and in McLaren’s case leapt ahead. Verstappen has been making this point for no short time now and doubtless is not satisfied that the shortcomings remain. That he is less than impressed with the team’s handling of the situation might be gauged by the fact that he liked a post on Instagram by the former F1 driver Giedo van der Garde, who described Red Bull’s treatment of Lawson as “closer to bullying or a panic move”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tsunoda must be seen as part of the process of addressing this, and Lawson almost as collateral damage. Yet in mitigation for the New Zealander, there is another fundamental hurdle for any number-two driver at Red Bull and that is that the car has long been designed to suit the strengths of their world champion.Verstappen enjoys a very pointy front to the car, with oversteer, to enjoy a sharp turn-in to the corner, ramped up as far as possible. “That’s where [he] excels,” said Horner in China. “That’s where he’s able to live on a knife’s edge of adhesion and he’s just constantly asking for more and more front out of the car.”The side effect of this, as Horner noted, is that it makes the rear of the car unsettled, loose on corner entry, which can be enormously hard to control and adapt to, especially if you are new to it. Which, in turn, can grind away at the confidence, leaving drivers bereft and questioning their own abilities. Sergio Pérez was nowhere near as woeful a driver as his performances for the last two years at Red Bull suggested but he simply could not handle the car. Lawson replaced him only to find himself in similar deep water and now Tsunoda has a shot at this poisoned chalice.He will face a similarly tough challenge, a huge test of his skill and his mettle, but for Red Bull his appointment is part of a far bigger picture. They need to adapt, to develop and to do it fast, and it is Tsunoda’s potential ability to cope with the fundamental frailties of the car and deliver feedback on how to fix it that has put him in the hot seat. If he too is found wanting, Red Bull have very few options left.Explore more on these topicsRed BullMax VerstappenChristian HornerFormula OneMotor sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

I expressed that I wanted to quit athletics.”A few days later Ingrid, who is now 18, said she had broken down in tears in front of producers of the fly-on-the-wall series.“They asked me a normal question, about the future of my career,” she added. “Then I saw no future. Then I broke down brutally. I couldn’t control it. They looked at me with their backs turned and were horrified. The interview ended.”The documentary series is the most successful show in Norwegian TV history, but Ingrid told the court that it didn’t always reflect the reality of family life.“I was five years old when the recording began,” she said. “This is something I grew up with and lived with, without having had a real choice myself. You could easily notice that something changed when a camera came along. I think they probably got a lot that wasn’t included.“The entire series is not rigged, but certain situations and conversations could have been rigged,” she added. “We were placed in the kitchen and ‘now we’re going to talk about this’. But the conversations we had were real.”According to the indictment, Gjert is alleged to have used threats, coercion and violence against his daughter, as well as restricted her freedom of movement.Gjert, who is facing six years in jail for abusive behaviour towards Jakob and Ingrid, denies all allegations of violence.On her second day of her evidence, Ingrid also told the court that her father had put his finger in her face and whipped her with a wet towel when she asked to go out with friends.She said that the relationship with her father had broken down after she had decided to stop running the previous autumn, and that she had been forced to stay at home during her free time against her will.“He could ignore me completely,” she said. “I felt like he was mad at me. And one day he said that he didn’t see me as his daughter any more.”Asked about the incident in January 2022, Ingrid said she had pushed back when he refused to let her hang out with friends between 5pm and 6pm, only for him to put his finger in her face.“I had felt trapped in my own home for so long,” she said. “I was pretty determined that today I would make it happen. I didn’t accept the ‘no’ I got from him.“I had been so depressed and ignored for several months, I simply felt bullied. I pushed his finger away. To this day I don’t understand how I dared to do it, but I was probably pretty upset and angry.“He had a small towel that he had been sweating in, so it was wet. He whipped it at my face. First once without hitting. Then he did it once more, and then he hit me on the cheek.”Ingrid told the court that she then ran to the wife of her brother Henrik, who lived two doors away. Afterwards she said her father called her “many times and said that if I didn’t come, he would kind of come and get me”.Under cross-examination, Ingrid was shown a series of text messages between her and her father in 2021, which she agreed showed that she had never asked for a day off from training before she quit running.The court was also shown a text message from Gjert on 6 January 2022, after he was alleged to have hit her with the towel. “I apologise with all my heart,” it read. “I promise that I will never raise my voice against you again in my entire life.”On Monday the court was shown a photograph of the mark on Ingrid’s face.The incident led to Jakob and his two brothers ending their training relationship with Gjert and going public with their allegations. The trial, which is due to last until 16 May, continues.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Abi Burton, who can play across the back row, is in line to win her first cap from the bench.The vast amount of changes comes as the head coach, John Mitchell, is testing out different combinations during the Six Nations with the World Cup in mind.Deacon said when asked if consistency is hard to achieve with so many changes: “To be honest we have trained with both combinations for the last few weeks. So it is not like we need a huge amount of cohesion, it has always been the plan to go with two combinations for the first two games.“From a training perspective they have spent a lot of time together.

It was Andy Farrell and as much as Margot was not happy that her father was on the phone, it was a call he had to take. England’s storming finish to the Six Nations may not be the only reason Wigglesworth has beenseconded to the British & Irish Lionsbut it can only have helped, and so the 41-year-old completes Farrell’s lineup, the first England coach to do so since Steve Borthwick in 2017.It is easy to forget that more than two years ago, Wigglesworth was still playing for Leicester Tigers. He was a player-coach when Borthwick got the call from England in December 2022 and as a result, Wigglesworth immediately hung up his boots and took interim charge at Welford Road.Andy Farrell opens Lions door for son Owen and other France-based playersRead moreBy the end of the season, after losing a Premiership semi-final to Sale, he had joined up with Borthwick at England, first as attack coach before graduating to senior coach in October last year. When explaining why he selected Wigglesworth, Farrell spoke effusively of how the former scrum-half had thrown himself into coaching, off the deep end, and theirs is a relationship that goes back a while. “I love his story, I know him, I know what makes him tick,” said Farrell. “I love the determination, the courage, the ambition that he had from being a player-coach, to having the balls to take on a head coach job when he had no clue what that entailed.”Farrell was just cutting his coaching teeth with Saracens when Wigglesworth was persuaded to join the north London club as a player and the pair were reunited when Farrell was appointed as Stuart Lancaster’s defence coach with England. Indeed, Farrell was a significant influence in convincing Wigglesworth to join Saracens.“He was part of the coaching staff that signed me in 2010,” recalls Wigglesworth. “I’d come down from Sale and didn’t expect to sign, but he along with the others were really persuasive. He’d shown me round where you might live. I remember getting out of the car and the last thing he said was, ‘Wiggy, have you got the balls to do it?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, I have!’ That was my first memory of Big Faz.”View image in fullscreenRichard Wigglesworth says he is looking forward to sounding out Steve Borthwick about his experience with the Lions.Photograph: Ian Walton/ReutersWhen the call came last Monday, there was not nearly as much persuading to do. “It was last Monday and I was back on duty after the Six Nations and Margot was wanting to play outside, so I was picking up the ball around with her and saw Faz’s name pop up and thought, ‘let’s answer this’. Yeah … an incredible moment.”Wigglesworth did not tour with the Lions as a player – of Farrell’s five-strong coaching staff only Simon Easterby did – but in Borthwick he has the perfect sounding board. The England head coach was part of Warren Gatland’s staff for the series draw with New Zealand in 2017 and Wigglesworth will go to Australia with his blessing. “It was brilliant for me and accelerated my coaching, so I’d love as many other people from the England group to be in there as possible, and I’ll be fully supportive of them all,” said Borthwick.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He knew before me but was obviously waiting for me to get the call and offer from Andy. He was delighted for me. He’s been a big part of my coaching journey so I thanked him for that. I’ll be picking his brains on what it looks like, but he did say that one of his rugby highlights was coaching the Lions as an assistant, so I’m looking forward to catching up with him about that.”Now that Farrell has named his assistants he can look forward to his squad announcement on 8 May with his coaches recuperating after the Six Nations before casting an eye over domestic matches in the coming weeks. Wigglesworth is adamant he does not see it as his job to bang the drum for England players’ selection but certainly Farrell will be aware of what his new assistant was able to achieve, rounding off the recent campaign with a10-try win in Cardiff.“I’m a Lions coach, my responsibility is to every player from the British Isles and Ireland, to work as hard as I can to get up to speed with their strengths and what they could bring,” says Wigglesworth. “It’ll be the same for any player. I will be as honest as I can because it is going to require us all to put everything aside and think of nothing but the Lions to have a chance of success.”Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsRugby unionEngland rugby union teaminterviewsShareReuse this content"

Helpfully, the EPA’s site provides a template for these requests, including pointers as to how to successfully ask for an exemption.Trump pledged as a presidential candidate to repeal environmental lawsif he got $1bn in campaign donationsfrom oil and gas companies. While he didn’t reach that figure, Trumpdid receive tens of millions of dollars from the industryand has said that the US needs to “drill, baby, drill” through unfettered fossil fuel expansion, rejecting the scientific consensus that burning coal, oil and gas is causing a worsening climate crisis.As president, Trump has set about dismantling pollution rules. Dozens of rollbacks by the EPA have targeted regulations that wereintended to save nearly 200,000 lives in the US by 2050, as well as prevent millions of asthma attacks, heart and respiratory problems and other public health harms.Rewriting these rules will take time, however, meaning that Trump has turned to an obscure and rarely used corner of the Clean Air Act to suspend pollution rules in the meantime. Under the act, presidents can exempt a business from pollution requirements if the technology necessary to meet the standard is not available and that this is in the US’s national security interests.Environmental groups said that power plants had used technology to lower pollutants for years and that the new emailed exemption was an outrageous attempt to side-step clean air laws. “These safeguards protect the health and wellbeing of our communities and there is no legitimate basis to suspend them,” said Laurie Williams, director of the Sierra Club’s beyond coal campaign.“The EPA must abandon this ridiculous proposal now, and do its job of holding fossil fuel companies to current air pollution standards.”The decision to set up the email by Lee Zeldin, administrator of the EPA, was “an extreme and improper abuse of Clean Air Act authorities that only allow for exemptions from vital pollution protections in very narrow circumstances,” said Vickie Patton, general counsel for the green advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We’ve made fossil-fuel licensing front page news and kept over 4.4bn barrels of oil in the ground, while courts have ruled new oil and gas unlawful.“But it’s time to change. We are heading for 2C of global heating in the coming decade, resulting in billions being killed, mass civil unrest and social collapse. Meanwhile, we are seeing corporations and billionaires buying political power and using it to punch down on the weak and the vulnerable.”Hunt said the group was creating a new strategy to tackle current realities but that “nothing short of a revolution is going to protect us from the coming storms”.A source within Just Stop Oil said the campaign would continue taking actions until a final protest in Parliament Square on 26 April. After that, the campaign would continue to exist “in the courts and in the prisons”, but not on the streets. Any new protest movement devised by supporters would appear under a new banner with a new strategy.Just Stop Oil said in a statement: “Just Stop Oil was intended to be a campaign to prove the effectiveness of disruptive tactics in bringing about necessary change, and we have been incredibly successful in that aim, but it’s now time to change.”Will McCallum, the co-director of Greenpeace UK, said: “Just Stop Oil paid a heavy price for raising their voices at a time when politicians and corporations are trying to silence peaceful protesters – in the streets and in the courts. We must not allow our hard-won right to protest to be stripped away, because it is the right that all other rights depend upon.“Greenpeace and many others will continue to defend this proud tradition of taking action on issues that matter to make change possible.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Forcing shipowners to pay a small charge for every tonne of carbon dioxide their vessels produce has been touted as a key way to raise some of the hundreds of billions of dollars needed for climate finance.A proposal for such a levy, which has the support of scores of developing countries, the EU and the UK, is under discussion at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in London, in talks that started last month and resume next week before finishing on 11 April.But the levyfaces fierce oppositionfrom China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and about a dozen other countries that have strong interests in exports or fossil fuels, and argue that it would raise prices for consumers. Some members have argued that a majority vote could push through the levy, but China has made it clear it would not accept such an outcome and has threatened to effectively withdraw from the IMO if the issue was forced.Brazil asks UN to ditch proposed levy on global shippingRead moreArsenio Dominguez, the secretary general of the IMO, does not want to enforce a majority vote if it can be avoided. “We work on consensus, that’s always the focus of the IMO,” he told the Guardian. “During adoption of the rules, member states can express their concerns, they can express their support to one proposal or another. My objective is always to work with the member states to get an agreement, a consensus approach, and if there are any concerns raised during that consensus approach, to continue to work on that, to address it. But to keep the house together.”The EU, which held an emergency meeting on the issue on Thursday, will still formally state its preference for a simple levy. But the Guardian understands that the bloc will concede key ground by falling back on a compromise proposal involving carbon trading, tabled by Singapore, provided that it aims to raise as much cash as a levy would.Analysis by Smith and other experts suggests the Singapore proposal would provide perverse incentives for shipowners to use short-term solutions to cut their carbon, such as heavy investment in biofuels, rather than seek long-term solutions in the form ofnew fuels, such as ammonia.“Carbon trading is uncertain and volatile, and not investable,” said Smith. “It will not result in more investment for long-term technologies.”Biofuels are often environmentally unsustainable, as they compete with food crops for scarce agricultural land.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Ships would pay a charge for their carbon output, but it would be more flexible than a levy, would represent a single flat fee and, because it would fall under technical regulations on fuel standards, would not face problems with adoption by countries such as the US that require legislative approval for taxes.Proponents of the ICS plan, including some developing countries, argue it should be acceptable to China, Brazil and their allies, because it uses a standard for fuels that they have already agreed to and starts at a low cost that can be scaled up later.Andrew Forrest, the Australian mining billionaire turnedgreen advocate, who is investing in hydrogen-powered ships, had harsh words for those who seek consensus. “I challenge anyone who advocates for a consensus, because they’re not actually advocating for a consensus, they are a wolf in sheep’s clothing intending to hold the status quo of fossil fuel and accelerate the pollution of our environment and the inefficiency of our shipping industry,” he told the Guardian.Friederike Roder, the director of theGlobal Solidarity Levies Task Force, said: “In two weeks’ time, we could have theworld’s first international levyon shipping emissions. This would be a milestone in our efforts to raise climate finance, hold polluters to account and support the global south. We need a strong agreement which delivers climate ambition and decarbonisation for the shipping sector, while shielding the most vulnerable economies.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentShipping emissionsGreenhouse gas emissionsEuropean UnionEuropeShipping industryCarbon offsettingnewsShareReuse this content"

CO2 made up about 78% of the 2024 total.DESNZ has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsGreenhouse gas emissionsClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

A month later during the pandemic, in May 2020, SG Recruitment was awarded a second contract,for £26.1m, to supply hand sanitiser.The two contracts for a total of £50m were processed via the then Conservative government’s “VIP lane”, which gave high priority to companies introduced by people with political connections. Chadlington, a Tory peer since 1996, is a former adviser to Cameron and John Major when they were prime ministers. He had a financial interest in SG Recruitment – he was the chair, a paid director and a shareholder in the parent company, Sumner Group Holdings (SGH), registered in Jersey. The new messages show that Cameron referred Chadlington to another Tory peer, Andrew Feldman, a close friend of Cameron’s, who was advising the Department ofHealthand Social Care on PPE procurement.Covid inquiry: ex-minister defends VIP contract lane despite ‘one or two crooks’Read moreChadlington’s involvement in introducing SG Recruitment to Feldman was investigated twice previously by the House of Lords commissioner for standards, in 2022 and 2023, after reporting by the Guardian. The commissionercleared Chadlingtonboth times of breaking the rule that prohibits peers from seeking to profit from Lords membership by approaching ministers or officials in return for payment or financial incentive.The new investigation will examine again if Chadlington broke that rule when introducing the company to the government, and another rule prohibiting peers from lobbying for companies in which they have a financial interest.Chadlington told the Lords commissioner in writing in August 2023 that he did not “facilitate an introduction” of SG Recruitment’s majority owner, David Sumner, to Feldman.However, in an email published by theCovid inquiry, and disclosed previously to the Guardian in response to a freedom of information request, it appears Chadlington directly introduced Feldman to Sumner.“David,” Chadlington wrote, addressing Sumner, copying them both in. “This is my friend Andrew Feldman. He can help you with PPE we discussed this morning. Drop me off chain. Peter.”The announcement of the third investigation states that the commissioner will also examine whether Chadlington has breached paragraph 9 of the Lords code of conduct, that: “Members of the House … should act always on their personal honour in the performance of their parliamentary duties and activities.”The messages sent by Chadlington were published ina written submission to the inquiryby the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, a group of 7,000 families whose relatives died of the coronavirus. The inquiry is now examining the circumstances in which ministers and civil servants set up the VIP lane, and awarded its prioritised companies £3.8bn in contracts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Despite the £50m deals, in December 2023 the company, which had been renamed,was put into liquidation, owing unpaid taxes to HMRC. The parent company went into liquidation in October 2022.

Along with the 27 confirmed dead, four people are still missing. Two survived.At least 130 more migrants have lost their lives in the Channel since the November 2021 incident, according to the UN’sInternational Organization for Migration, but incident Charlie remains the largest single loss of life since small boat crossings of the Channel began in 2018.The inquiry has heard a litany of failings, including poor communication and understaffing at the Dover coastguard on the night, and a failure of Home Office intelligence sharing.Charlie was confused by authorities with another dinghy named “incident Lima”, from which 35 people were successfully rescued, meaning that efforts to continue searching for Charlie passengers were halted. The incident was mistakenly marked as “resolved” and nobody came to their rescue.On Wednesday and Thursday the inquiry heard impact statements from bereaved relatives who spoke about their grief and sense of deep loss, compounded by uncertainty in the early days about whether or not their relatives had survived.Some said they wished they had died at the same time as their loved ones instead of living in pain, and many said they were struggling to keep going without the people they had lost. Relatives of those still missing they described the pain of not being able to have closure.Issa Mohamed Omar from Somalia, one of the two survivors, described the scene when the dinghy capsized at about 1.13am.“It was very cold, people were screaming, there was darkness all around,” he said. “We all thought we were dying. If rescue had come quickly, I believe half of these people would still be alive today. We have been seen as refugees. That’s the reason I believe the rescue did not come. We feel we are treated like animals.”Ali Areef, the cousin of Halima Mohammed Shikh, 33, a mother of three, had spoken to Omar from his hospital bed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is estimated that the passengers went into the water at 3.12am or 3.13am.In concluding remarks on Thursday, Sonali Naik KC, representing bereaved families and one of the survivors, said: “The tragedy of 24 November was preventable and it should never have happened.

He has since been convicted of drug trafficking.Pegg also denied one count of possessing criminal property, a £12,000 black Mercedes that jurors at Preston crown court heard Saunderson had bought using 34kg of amphetamines and given to Pegg as a gift.A former “rising star in the prison service” who was promoted from graduate entrant to governor of HMP Kirkham in just six years, Pegg is accused of failing to disclose county court judgments about her debts, as well as allegedly becoming too close to Saunderson.Barbara Webster, opening the case for the prosecution, told the jury: “Despite her success, she didn’t play by the rules that everybody else had to follow.“Her downfall was twofold – the first, despite having a good income, she lived beyond her means.“She spent all her income and more, incurring debts, and she had county court judgments made against her.“As a consequence, she became vulnerable and open to exploitation.”Pegg “became very involved” in a plan to release Saunderson from HMP Kirkham, a former colleague told the court.It is alleged she signed off Saunderson’s temporary release without proper authority in May 2019. By early 2020, Saunderson was using an EncroChat-encrypted mobile phone, used by serious organised criminals to send messages and secretly communicate, the court heard.Detectives found Saunderson’s DNA on items – size 10 Hugo Boss flip-flops and a toothbrush – at Pegg’s home in Orrell, a suburb of Wigan. Law enforcement agencies also discovered messages on Saunderson’s phone that revealed the “ongoing nature” of his relationship with Pegg, it is alleged.Both he and Pegg used burner phones to keep in touch, and there were 80 calls and texts from his phone to hers in the space of a month, the court heard. The only other numbers dialled on Saunderson’s phone were to “prostitutes and escorts”, retired detective constable Kevin Byrne, of the National Crime Agency, told the court.He added that in February 2021, Pegg was arrested at her home and this was coordinated, with North Wales police and Merseyside police, with arrests of what he said was the drug gang led by Saunderson.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He went on to suggest that Reform attracts men because they are more impulsive than their female counterparts.Asked if the men who fill 80% of top jobs in business were all there based purely on merit, he said: “I think the truth is that in many cases women make very different life choices to men. If you look at business, men are prepared to sacrifice family lives in order to pursue a career and be successful in a way that fewer women are. Those women that do probably have more chance of reaching the top than the blokes.”Reform is dominated by men at the top, with Farage as leader, Richard Tice as deputy, Nick Candy as treasurer and Zia Yusuf as chair, along with two more male MPs. Its press and policy teams are also staffed by men. Pressed on whether there should be more women at the top of his party, he said: “I’m very pro-women, don’t worry about that,” and listed several candidates who are female.Farage’s comments appear to echo those widely circulating in the online “manosphere” where views are commonly expressed that men are being too “feminised”. He said he was not a fan of the misogynist influencer Andrew Tate, but that people should try to understand why he had 10 million young male followers. He has previously spoken of Tate being animportant voice for young men.The Labour MP for Bolsover, Natalie Fleet, said: “Nigel Farage seems to be stuck in the 1970s. He clearly has no idea about the sacrifices women make, how on Earth can his party represent them?”In a wide-ranging question and answer session, Farage also:Lifted the lid further on his row with Elon Musk, saying the billionaire adviser to Donald Trump had tried to push him too much on supporting the far-right activist Tommy Robinson. “You can’t bully me,” he said. “I’ve got my principles, I stand by them good or bad.”Said the idea of a $100m (£77m) donation from Musk had been “massively overexaggerated”, but insisted they were now on “perfectly reasonable terms” by text message.Dismissed the idea of a pact with the Tories, saying Reform “despises” the party. He suggested its leader, Kemi Badenoch, was lazy and referred to her leadership rival Robert Jenrick as Robert “Generic”. Of Tory MPs, he said: “I’ve never met a more stuck up, arrogant, out of touch group of people. At least half of the Conservative MPs are stuffy, boring old bastards.”Blamed net zero policies rather than the threat of Trump tariffs for theplanned closure of Scunthorpe’s steel plant, and claimed the US president had wanted to do a trade deal during his previous term, but that the Tories had “blown it” by delaying Brexit.In his comments on men and women, Farage said it was wrong that boys were “being told not to be boys” with advice not to shout, sing songs or drink more than two pints of beer at football tournaments.“I mean, no point going, really, but, you know, we try and sort of feminise men. And that’s why people like Andrew Tate have picked up the support they have … I’m not a Tate supporter. I’m identifying a truth that young men feel that they’re not allowed to be blokes.”In relation to Reform’s support, which was stronger among young men at the last election, he said: “I think men are more impulsive. I think men say ‘I like that, I’m going to do it.’ And I think women think, hang on a second, and are more cautious.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ve seen all these diary pieces and gossip columns say that I’m a chain smoker,” he said.“Others have written that my drink intake verges on alcoholism. Others have said I spend my entire life spending with bookmakers at race events. Some have said that I’m a womaniser on a level that’s not been seen in modern political history. And you guys have written all this about me. I had to live with … The trouble is, it’s all true. Well it was true, but as you get older it becomes less important.”Farage’s Q&A came ahead of Labour’s NHS action day of campaigning on Saturday, where the health secretary, Wes Streeting, will unveil an anti-Reform advertising campaign. He will attack Farage in run-up the local elections and the Runcorn byelection, saying he has “no plan for the country beyond fawning over Putin and plotting to dismantle our health service”.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageReform UKGendernewsShareReuse this content"

Martha’s death led to the adoption ofMartha’s rule, which gives families the right to a second opinion on medical treatment.Hewes, who was studying politics and history at Leeds University, died of meningococcal septicaemia at Homerton hospital in eastLondon, where his mother, Dr Deborah Burns, was a consultant paediatrician.Burns told the inquest she had been unable to work at the hospital since her son’s death because offeelings of “betrayal” towards colleagueswho ignored her warnings about his treatment.Hewes, a “fit and healthy” Arsenal fan 1.98 metres (6ft 6in) tall, who loved to cook and sing, began feeling ill while trying to write a university essay on 20 January. When his condition worsened his mother took him to Homerton’s A&E just after midnight and told colleagues she suspected he had meningococcal sepsis.Burns repeatedly asked medics to administer lifesaving antibiotics in the vital first hour of his treatment. But antibiotics were not given until 1.25am due to amisunderstanding between a doctor and nurses, the inquest at Bow coroner’s court heard. There was also a delay of about 90 minutes in transferring Hewes from the resuscitation area of A&E to the intensive care unit amid a disagreement between medics about escalating his care.The hospital admitted these mistakes were “suboptimal”. Hassell said Hewes was not treated “with the urgency he should have been” but added: “It is unclear whether, if he had been administered all appropriate treatment promptly, his life would have been saved.”She said: “I am not convinced, even on the balance of probabilities, that the state of medical knowledge is such that we know the answer to the question of whether William would have survived had he received earlier treatment. My conclusion is that I simply do not know whether earlier treatment would have saved William.”She said she would issue a prevention of future deaths report to Homerton hospital on the basis that the work it had done since Hewes’s death should be shared nationally.Hassell was also the coroner at the inquest into thedeath of Martha, who died of sepsis after delays at a different London hospital. Martha’s mother, Merope Mills, an editor at the Guardian, said doctors ignored her and her husband’s requests to escalate their daughter’s care. Her death led to the adoption in some hospitals, including Homerton, of Martha’s rule, which gives patients and their families the right to request an urgent review of hospital treatment.At the end of the inquest Hassell highlighted the similarities of the cases, including the fact that “a great deal of the investigation has been driven by the family”.The inquests into both deaths heard how parents’ concerns were ignored. There were also communication problems between doctors in intensive care and elsewhere in both hospitals that led to delays in the escalation of treatment.Hassell concluded in March 2022 that delays in Martha’s treatment contributed to her death.Burns said: “On the night I took William to hospital I knew he needed antibiotics as soon as possible but I witnessed a delay. In all, I raised the alarm eight times. They were then given, but late, and outside the time recommended by the hospital’s and the national guideline.”Burns, who was represented by Fieldfisher, said Homerton hospital closed the investigation into her son’s death without telling her, and when she found out she began investigating herself. She said: “This analysis was the most distressing thing I have ever had to do. It uncovered more causes for concern about his care.“My pursuit of the truth is not about blame. It has always been driven by concerns about the standard of care I witnessed in my own emergency department. I cannot believe that my hospital, which I know is proud of its standard of care, has not seen me as a resource to help improve its service.”Homerton Healthcare NHS trust said: “We will take onboard what the coroner has said in relation to the actions we have taken and will be sharing these nationally with our NHS colleagues.“We know that the impact of William’s death on his mother was compounded by it happening in the hospital where she works. Deborah has told us that our policies and processes for this situation are inadequate and detached and we are determined to learn from her experience. This work will ensure a more personal response for staff members or members of their family who are patients here.“Our thoughts remain with Deborah and her family during this incredibly difficult time.”Explore more on these topicsNHSSepsisHospitalsLondonEnglandHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Well, now there’s a word for it: gigil.Gigil (pronounced ghee-gill) is one of the new words that have made it into the Oxford English Dictionary (OED).Gigil, extracted from the Philippines’ Tagalog language, refers to what psychologists describe as cute aggression: “[a] feeling so intense that it gives us the irresistible urge to tightly clench our hands, grit our teeth, and pinch or squeeze whomever or whatever it is we find so adorable”.It can be deployed as a noun denoting the feeling or as an adjective for experiencing the feeling, such as: “That puppy is making me gigil.”With 600,000 words, the OED is one of the most comprehensive dictionaries in the English-speaking world.Its editors consider thousands of suggestions for new words every year that come from far and wide and from a variety of sources, including the OED’s own research and crowdsourcing appeals.Alamak, a colloquial cry used to express surprise or outrage in Singapore and Malaysia, also made the list.In its latest update, the OED said: “Wouldn’t it be useful for English speakers to have a specific word for sunlight dappling through leaves … Or a word for the action of sitting outside enjoying a beer?” The Norwegians have a word,utepils, for having a beer (pils) outside (ute). And the Japanese word “komorebi” (木漏れ日) describes sunlight dappling through leaves.People who speak English alongside other languages fill lexical gaps by “borrowing the untranslatable word from another language”. When they do this often enough, the borrowed word “becomes part of their vocabulary”, OED said.Most of the words added to the OED from Singapore and Malaysia are names of dishes, including kaya toast – jam made from coconut milk, eggs, sugar and pandan leaves spread on toasted bread; fish head curry – a Chinese and South Indian dish; and steamboat – a thinly sliced meat and vegetable broth.“All this talk of food might inspire one to get a takeaway, or to tapau,” OED said. Tapau is another new word originating from Chinese languages, meaning “to package, or wrap up, food to take away”.Other newly added Philippine words include videoke, the nation’s version of karaoke, which includes scoring, and salakot, a farmer’s hat.Words and phrases from South Africa and Ireland were also part of the update.Explore more on these topicsReference and languages booksSocial trendsLanguagenewsShareReuse this content"

I hope they come up with a just decision,” the former UBS and Citigroup trader said.Hayes, 45, served five-and-a-half years in prison for rigging Libor, a benchmark interest rate once used in the financial markets to underpin more than $350tn of loans and securities. The scandal led to fines of almost $10bn for a dozen banks and brokerages.The court of appeal last year upheld the guilty verdict, saying there was“indisputable documentary evidence”that he had sought to move Libor and that he had made “frank admissions of dishonesty” – arguments repeated by the Serious Fraud Office during the latest hearing.However, Hayes’s counsel, Adrian Darbishire KC, said there had been a “core error” underpinning the case that marked a “failure to respect the limits of the role of the judge in a jury trial”.The judge’s original directions had “entered territory that has to be left to the jury”, Darbishire told a panel of five senior judges in London. “What happened in the Hayes case was not consistent with well-established principles of English law.”The jury was wrongly instructed by the trial judge that the rules for the rates setting process prohibited considering the bank’s commercial interest before making their submissions, Hayes’s lawyers said.The trader has also said he was prevented from submitting evidence of his daily profit and loss accounts in his original trial, which he says would have undermined the prosecution’s case that he profited personally.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Temperatures on the moon can fall as low as -173C, there is low gravity and the pressure is so low that the moon can be considered as being under vacuum conditions.Inventors on hunt for way to make clean water on moonRead moreNow a small Gloucestershire-based companycalled Naicker Scientifichas come up with a solution that has won the UK arm of the challenge.Lolan Naicker, the technical director of the company, said the victory was a surprise. “We were up against professors, larger teams, teams with access to the full might of UK university resources.”Two runners up will also receive prizes: thefather and sons team RedSpace Ltd will receive £100,000 for their Filtered Regolith Aqua Neutralisation Kit (Frank) while a team from Queen Mary University of London will receive £50,000 for AquaLunarPure – an approach based on the production of supercritical water.Inventors on hunt for way to make clean water on moonRead moreNaicker said he and his colleague, Dr Ciarán Callaghan, shunned the brief of starting with contaminated ice and instead worked on the basis that this would first have to be extracted from the lunar regolith.The result, called the SonoChem system, is a multi-step contraption worthy of Wallace and Gromit. Icy soil is fed into a hopper-like container from which it is continuously moved, by means of an auger, into a quartz tube that passes through the middle of a microwave oven that has been turned on its side. There it is heated, causing the water and various contaminants to vaporise, leaving the soil behind.“After the microwave process these gases sublimate – they can’t liquefy because the pressure on the moon is so low,” said Naiker.The gases are then frozen, before being liquified under pressure and subjected to ultrasound which creates millions of micro-bubbles in the contaminated water.“When bubbles pop, there is actually a mini explosion that’s taking place,” he said, adding the localised high temperatures and pressures created cause contaminants in the water to either evaporate, or be broken down into other substances that subsequently evaporate, leaving behind clean water.Naicker said that, in the absence of icy soil from the moon, the team tested the setup using homemade regolith based on building sand – although he has not tasted the water produced by the process.Naiker said he has also been working on how to use the water to produce propellant for rocket engines. He hopes to use the prize money to grow his three-year-old business and is advertising for two graduates to help commercialise the technologies the team has developed.“I’ve managed to enter into collaborations with two companies who are interested in a derivative of the lunar technology: in one case, a small, compact, portable water device, and in another case, an effluent treatment device,” he said, adding the team found ultrasound can be used to remove a host of contaminants from water including pharmaceutical products and pesticides.Explore more on these topicsThe moonSpacenewsShareReuse this content"

A two-thirds empty bottle of spirits was later found in Woods’s car.A fireball engulfed the Glasgow-bound Toyota with four of the five occupants pronounced dead at the scene. They were Jaroslaw Rossa, 42; his children Filip, 15, and Dominic, seven; and his partner, Jade McEnroe, 33. McEnroe’s son Arran, seven, survived despite serious injuries.At the inquest into Woods’s death in Cockermouth, the coroner Margaret Taylor recorded a conclusion of suicide and described the incident on the afternoon of 15 October as a “catastrophe”.“The only thing I can do at this stage is to express my condolences to the family for the tragedy that has ensued, but also to remember those who were involved as collateral to this tragic event,” she said.The court heard Woods had a distinguished 14-year career as an RAF jet pilot. He toured Afghanistan twice and completed three tours of Iraq – receiving a commendation for one – before leaving the RAF in 2019. He then worked for BAE Systems, based at RAF Marham in Norfolk, as a lead contractor instructor pilot.The inquest heard he had a history of anxiety and detrimental alcohol use, for which he received professional help.Woods was at a flight safety conference near Preston, Lancashire, on the day of the crash but could be heard snoring during morning sessions.In the afternoon he drove north, with witnesses telling police that his car was drifting erratically and dangerously between lanes.The inquest heard that Woods then went on to the hard shoulder and made a U-turn, driving the wrong way for more than a mile in the third lane of the M6.After a near-miss with one vehicle, Woods’s car collided head-on with the Toyota. The Skoda’s speedometer was frozen on 65mph, and could have been travelling at 70 or more at the point of impact, police found.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mark Lowen was inTurkeyto report on the recent protests. He has been told he was deported for ‘being a threat to public order’.”More than 1,850 people have been detained,including 11 Turkish journalists, in the recent protests, which have taken place across the country.Clashes between protesters and security forces escalated on Sunday night, with police using teargas and rubber bullets against some demonstrators. They had previously used pepper spray and water cannon on Thursday.İmamoğlu, seen as Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s main rival for the presidency, is being held on corruption charges, which he denies. His supporters say his arrest is politically motivated. He was nominated as the presidential candidate for Turkey’s main opposition party shortly after he was detained.Lowen said in a statement: “To be detained and deported from the country where I previously lived for five years and for which I have such affection has been extremely distressing.Press freedomand impartial reporting are fundamental to any democracy.”The chief executive ofBBCNews, Deborah Turness, said Lowen’s deportation was “an extremely troubling incident and we will be making representations to the Turkish authorities”.“Mark is a very experienced correspondent with a deep knowledge of Turkey and no journalist should face this kind of treatment simply for doing their job. We will continue to report impartially and fairly on events in Turkey,” she said.Lowen had been reporting directly from the protests and speaking to some of those in the crowds. He said the protests were “galvanising the side of Turkey that feels stifled by President Erdoğan’s authoritarian rule”. When asked what the protesters wanted, one told him they wanted “pure democracy”.“That’s what everyone wants. Nothing more, nothing else,” they said.All forms of media are under scrutiny in Turkey, and popular apps such as Instagram, WhatsApp and YouTube have faced restrictions in recent weeks. Some prominent accounts on X have also been restricted. The Turkish government retains significant power over social media content under laws passed in 2022.On Thursday the broadcasting watchdog, RTÜK, said it was imposing a 10-day broadcast ban on the opposition TV channel Sözcü, after claims of incitement regarding its coverage of the protests.Erdoğan has described the protests as a “movement of violence”, but while there have been some clashes, they have been largely peaceful.Turkey is ranked 158th of 180 countries and territories in an index of world press freedom that Reporters Without Borders (RSF) compiled last year. The lowly ranking was the result of its imprisonment of journalists, online censorship and the government’s control of the judiciary.RSF’s representative in Turkey, Erol Önderoğlu, condemned Lowen’s 17-hour detention. “This professional journalist and specialist on Turkey, where he lived for five years, was accused of being a ‘threat to public order’ for covering the protests in Istanbul,” he said.“RSF calls on the Turkish authorities to stop using the legal system to criminalise journalists and to lift the arbitrary bans on Mark Lowen and other foreign journalists’ entry into Turkish territory.”Agence France-Presse said on Thursday that its photographer Yasin Akgul, who was among those arrested this week while covering the unrest, had been freed. The charges against him, however, have not been dropped. He was detained on Monday on charges of “taking part in illegal rallies and marches”.Akgul was one of the 11 Turkish journalists detained at the start of the week. Seven were later charged and remanded in custody. He was the last to be released. The UN has raised concerns about the arrests, which RSF described as part of a “dramatic escalation in the repression of press freedom”.Explore more on these topicsTurkeyBBCJournalist safetyPress freedomProtestEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In November, a dive boat capsized off the coast of Marsa Alam, south of Hurghada, leaving four dead and seven missing. In June 2024, two dozen French tourists were safely evacuated before their boat sank in a similar incident. In 2023, three British tourists died after a fire broke out on their yacht, engulfing it in flames.Map that shows the location of the resort along Egypt’s Red Sea coastThe submarine was carrying 45 tourists and five Egyptian crew members when it sank, the Red Sea governor, Maj Gen Amr Hanafi, said in a statement, adding that rescue teams were quickly sent.Hanafi said all six dead were Russians, and 29 of the 39 tourists rescued were injured and taken to hospital. No people remained missing from the vessel, he said, suggesting the crew had also been rescued.Russia’s Tass news agency earlier said the Russian dead included at least two children, citing the country’s consul in Hurghada. The consulate had said all 45 tourists on board were Russian, but the Egyptian governor said they also included Indian, Norwegian and Swedish citizens.The consulate said the submarine was on an underwater excursion to observe coral reefs when it “crashed 1km from the shore” at about 10am local time. “According to initial data, most of those onboard were rescued and taken to their hotels and hospitals in Hurghada,” the consulate said, adding that diplomats had been sent to the pier.Tourism is a key source of income for Egypt, in which Russian tourists play an increasing part. A United Nations report ranked Egypt first in Africa for tourism revenues in 2024 at $14.1bn (£11bn), more than twice what it earns in Suez Canal revenues.Many tourist companies have stopped or limited travelling on the Red Sea owing to the dangers from conflicts in the region over the past decade. A number of airlines suspended package flights to Egypt after thebombing of an aircraft operated by Metrojetin 2015.The Sindbad website says it offers short tourist trips in two submarines usually lasting about three hours and which operate to a maximum depth of 25 metres (80ft).According to the website its submarines allow tourists to “experience the beauty of the Red Sea’s underwater world without getting wet”.Hurghada, a resort about 280 miles (460km) south-east of Cairo, is a major destination for foreign visitors, with its airport receiving more than 9 million passengers last year, according to state media.Thursday’s forecast in the city was clear, with above-average winds reported but optimum visibility underwater.Dozens of tourist boats sail through the coastal area daily for snorkelling and diving activities, but Sindbad Submarines says it deploys the region’s “only real” recreational submarine. The vessel has been operating in the area for many years, a source familiar with the company told Agence France-Presse.Explore more on these topicsEgyptAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaWater transportRussiaTravel & leisurenewsShareReuse this content"

He has denied any wrongdoing, telling the court: “I deny all of it.”The state prosecutor delivered his closing speech on Thursday, the trial’s final day, calling for a guilty verdict and denouncing Depardieu’s “total denial and failure to question himself”.The panel of three judges will give their verdict on May 13. If they convict Depardieu, they will decide a sentence.He could still face up to five years in prison – the maximum sentence applicable for the charge – and a fine of €75,000 (£63,000).The state prosecutor said the actor must be judged “like any other citizen in the eyes of the law”, regardless of his celebrity status. He told the court Depardieu had targeted women “in an inferior position” who were economically dependent on the film set because it was their workplace.In her testimony, Amélie, the set decorator, said Depardieu had trapped her between his thighs and grabbed her body on set. The state prosecutor said this was “indisputably” a sexual assault to which there had been three witnesses.The assistant director, now 34, who has not been named in the media, said Depardieu touched her buttocks and breasts on two occasions. The state prosecutor said this constituted sexual assault and that other crew members had been made aware at the time.Depardieu – the biggest French cinema star to face trial for sexual assault since the#MeToo movement– was described by the women’s lawyers as a “sexual predator” and “misogynist”.Amélie’s lawyer, Carine Durrieu Diebolt, said the actor had committed misconduct for decades towards “little people” in the cinema world.She told the court: “Maybe you think he’s a great actor and you love his films. Depardieu is also a sexual predator.”She said many in the cinema world had kept quiet about his alleged sexual assaults of junior crew and staff. His status as an actor had made him both an artistic and an economic power in the film industry, in contrast with the plaintiffs who risked being blacklisted if they spoke out, Durrieu Diebolt told the court. She denounced what she called a “system of impunity”.She said: “Mr Depardieu, when he’s touching women’s bodies, is exercising his power over them.” She said the actor would make crude sexual comments all day on the film set, creating an atmosphere of “ambient misogyny”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Thursday, a French foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters: “We deplore the sentencing of our fellow citizen Boualem Sansal to prison”.The president of the Federation of European Publishers, Sonia Draga, said she was “appalled” by the sentence: “Boualem should be a free man; his only offence is to have spoken and written freely over all these years.

Hegseth appears to have also had the tattoo in another Instagramphoto postedin July 2024.Some people on social media criticized Hegseth for getting a tattoo that could be considered offensive to Muslims, especially as the US military seeks to represent a diverse pool of faiths. It is estimated that upwards of5,000 to 6,000US military members practice Islam.“This isn’t just a personal choice; it’s a clear symbol of Islamophobia from the man overseeing U.S. wars,”postedNerdeen Kiswani, a pro-Palestinian activist inNew York.She added: “‘Kafir’ has been weaponized by far-right Islamophobes to mock and vilify Muslims. It’s not about his personal beliefs. It’s about how these beliefs translate into policy – how they shape military decisions, surveillance programs, and foreign interventions targeting Muslim countries.”A former leader of the far-right Proud Boys, Joe Biggs, alsohas a similar tattoo.Pete Hegseth: five things to know about the new US secretary of defenseRead more“Tattooing the Arabic wordkafir– which refers to someone who knowingly denies or conceals fundamental divine truths – on his body is a display of both anti-Muslim hostility and personal insecurity,” Nihad Awad, the national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair),told Newsweek.This is not the first time Hegseth has been involved in a tattoo-related controversy. The defense secretary has previously shown off tattoos that indicate a fascination with “crusader aesthetics”, an increasing trend among the far right.His prior contentious tattoo is located on his right biceps – right next to the new one. It reads “Deus Vult”, which translates to “God Wills It” in Latin, believed to be a Crusader battle cry. Hegseth also has a tattoo on his chest of the Jerusalem cross, also known as the Crusader’s cross due to being popularized during the Christian Crusades.The criticism of the tattoo comes at a time of increased scrutiny for the defense secretary. Members of Congress in the US are calling for an investigation into Hegseth and the other officials involved in theSignal leakthat inadvertently exposed operational details of US plans to bomb Yemen.

That combination of the fantastically sci-fi and the mundanely everyday is Zajko’s hallmark. The young London-based artist has spent the past few years showing ceramic and concrete sculptures filled with flights of cybernetic romanticism and nods to vaping, baking and pickling.In The Spin Off, as this show at Focal Point Gallery in Southend is called, he has gone on a deep dive into a vast mess of ideas about longevity and rebirth. The centre of the space is dominated by an ovoid floor sculpture that gets moved and reshaped throughout the week. Laid across its surface, ceramic tiles are assembled to look like a map of planetary systems or control panels for alien spaceships, covered in incomprehensible knobs, buttons and displays. Circular sections of it can be lifted out and replaced with items from the cabinets on the wall: little concrete eggs, ceramic kaiser rolls, jars of pickles.It's as if Zajko is asking what the point of living forever is – if you’re going to be watched the whole timeEggs are everywhere. They’re in vitrines cut into benches around the space. They’re formed into huge uncomfortable stools in the middle of the gallery (a nod to designer Philippe Starck’s iconic but useless lemon squeezer). They’re nestled in reliefs on the wall that look like maps of future cities. They’re symbols of rebirth, of perseverance and survival.View image in fullscreen‘Eggs are everywhere’ … installation view of The Spin Off.Photograph: Corey Bartle-SandersonIn the other main gallery space, a huge red eye in a vast plastic bubble blinks at you and flashes lasers as it burps out an endless cloud of vape smoke, a polluted miasma of surveillance state aesthetics, as if Zajko is asking what the point of living forever is if you’re going to be watched the whole time.Lining the walls between the galleries, Zajko has painted frescoes of eggs and those Philippe Starck juicers, surrounding a huge relief of grey humanoid bodies studded with pink chewing gum. Vitrines are filled with architectural sculptures made of upcycled church candles.The whole thing is caked in references to pop culture (each work is named after a film that’s had at least one remake, A Star is Born, Funny Games, Cruel Intentions), art and design history, Polish mythology, and on and on. It feels overthought and under-edited. It’s so excited by its own endless references that the story of the work gets a little lost in the process.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Zajko is unique: it’s like a pastel-coloured Alien; a gentle, cotton candy take on sci-fi horror; a 1990s McDonald’s designed by a xenomorph; a Mattel Metropolis. It’s attractive, alluring, you want to touch all of it, get lost in it.The main thrust of the show, the primary idea, is brilliant. It’s so full of the fear of death and anxiety about the future: this is the art of a mind buzzing with apprehension about what’s next and trying desperately to hold on to some sense of self. Yet this esoteric sci-fi and heavy theorising is rooted in the everyday – thanks to those bread rolls and pickles. It gives everything a sense of joy and humour, a link to the past, to reality. Living forever, seeing what the future holds, may be terrifying, but at least there’ll be pickles.Explore more on these topicsArt and designArtSouthend-on-SeaEssexPolandreviewsShareReuse this content"

His wife, Jess, would pretend to be a “pompous chef”, his son, Axel, would play the “downtrodden waiter”, while Please himself would act the part of a demanding customer.“The dynamic of these three characters was so rich, the setting so loaded with potential, and the opportunity to showcase my long-practised and long-underappreciated art of rearranging food to look funny, made the story impossible to resist”, said Please.Please is a writer, animator and illustrator whose works include the 2011 stop motion animated film The Eagleman Stag, which won a Bafta for best short animation.

The existential terror of a man under attack by unknown forces begins when New York ad-man Roger Thornhill stands up to make a phone call in a hotel lobby and is mistaken for George Kaplan, a nonexistent spy created as a decoy by the US’s cold war-era security services. From thereon in he is pursued by enemies of the state. If everyone insists Roger is George, where does that leave his sense of self?Emma Rice’s adaptation is not concerned with the crisis around identity but with sending up the espionage genre through an archly played collection of spies and villains.It is delightfully playful, although there is not quite enough charge underneath. The drama’s themes of global crisis, security and the toxic legacies of war are raised rather too late, like an afterthought. There is little Hitchcockian brooding or darkness either, nor the jeopardy of the film.But the theatrical fun, games and entertainment are plentiful, along with witty subversions. Much of the film’s screenplay is preserved, some of its dated jokes delivered thick with irony, but the adaptation adds narration, wry commentary and fourth-wall puncturing moments which contain genuinely funny audience participation.Women play men, men play women, and characters break out into slinky dances or lip-sync to period jazz numbers (compositions by Simon Baker, combined with classics by Peggy Lee, Ella Fitzgerald, Cole Porter and more).Ewan Wardrop captures Cary Grant’s droll distemper from the film and appears like a comical Hitchcockian 007 with his dry martinis and smoothness. His romance with Eva Kendall (Patrycja Kujawska), clad in femme fatale red dress, is played tongue-in-cheek.View image in fullscreenMiniaturised invention … Katy Owen and Ewan Wardrop.Photograph: Steve TannerSpies in long coats and shades swirl around them; characters are vaguely reminiscent of the satirised British intelligence men from the musicalOperation Mincemeat(that second world war incident was one of the influences for the film).The six-strong cast, including Rice’s company stalwarts, do a remarkable job of conjuring the sense of a far bigger ensemble on stage. They excel at physical comedy, often set to jazz shuffles and shucks, with humorous choreography by Etta Murfitt. The professor-narrator is a highlight, played by Katy Owen (who was luminous inRice’s Wuthering Heights, too).It is a feat too to transpose the film’s action-led set-pieces featuring trains, planes and car chases on hairpin bends. Rice manages this with typically intelligent humour and imagination: the UN headquarters in which a murder takes place is gracefully conjured with a formation of telephone operators speaking a babel of languages while the iconic crop-dusting plane attack on Thornhill is full of miniaturised invention.Malcolm Rippeth’s witty lighting works well with Rob Howell’s elegant set design, a series of revolving doors and liqueur bottles. The effect is glorious and grand, filling the stage and gesturing towards the ever-changing disguises that the cast assume.It is a production that feels emphatically light and the final Mount Rushmore scene does not carry the precipitous danger of the film (how could it?). But this is an espionage crowd-pleaser for the summer – fun, intelligent and powered by Rice’s joyful whimsy.AtYork Theatre Royaluntil 5 April.

Another story revisits the Bombay neighbourhood of Rushdie’s 1981 novel Midnight’s Children, where a magical musician is unhappily married to a billionaire. A third story, set in an English college, sees an undead academic unable to rest until he gets revenge against his former tormentor.“I’m happy that the stories, very different from one another in setting, story and technique, nevertheless manage to be in conversation with one another, and with the two stories that serve as prologue and epilogue to this threesome,” Rushdie added. “I have come to think of the quintet as a single work, and I hope readers may see and enjoy it in the same way.”The book “moves between the places [Rushdie] has grown up in, inhabited, explored, and left”, according to Rushdie’s publisher Vintage, a division of Penguin Random House. “In doing so, he asks fundamental questions we all one day face. How does one deal with, accommodate, or rail against entering the 11th hour, the final stage of your life? How can you bid farewell to the places you have made home?”Rushdie announcedthat he was working on the forthcoming book last October to an audience at Lviv BookForum. All the novellas “in some way consider the idea of an ending”, he said at the time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Drops happen, but a good-quality case with proper impact protection can prevent them from becoming an expensive mistake. Most manufacturers make cases for their phones, but beefier cases are available from companies such asOtterBox,SpigenandSpeck. More sustainably minded options include biodegradable cases, including those made byWave CaseandPela. Also, consider fitting a goodstrengthened-glass screen protector, which will stop your screen from getting scratched and help prevent cracks.Defender phone caseFrom £12.99 at OtterBoxScreen protectorsFrom £4.97 at Carphone WarehouseFrom £19.99 at BelkinGet a grip (or a strap)View image in fullscreenA phone grip can help you keep hold of even the largest of devices. There are many options, including the ever-popularPopsockets, which are essentially pop-out knobs you stick to the back of a phone with magnets or adhesive. Alternatives includephone ringsandloops and hooks, though you could also consider gettinga case with a lanyardto put over your wrist or around your neck or a cross-body phone strap.Cross-body phone strapFrom £33 at CasetifyFrom £33 at AmazonPopGripsFrom £2.99 at EtsyFrom £10.99 at PopsocketsKeep it updatedView image in fullscreenIt makes sense for your phone’s longevity to upgrade it to the latest operating system, such as Apple’s iOS 18 (pictured).New versions of your phone’s operating system bring two things: added functionality and crucial security updates. Given that most whiz-bang features on new models are now software-based, you can often get them for your existing phone simply by updating to the latest Android or iOS and keeping your apps up to date. More importantly, these updates will keep your phone protected against security threats to help prevent criminals from stealing your data. When your phone stops getting security updates, you should stop using it.Clear out your storageView image in fullscreenRegularly delete older content from your phone, including WhatsApp group chats, ‘as every image, gif or video sent quickly adds up’.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAMost phones come with a decent amount of storage, but they can fill up over the years with photos, videos, music, apps and the general detritus of modern life. Make sure you have at least 2GB to 5GB of free storage at all times to help keep your phone running quickly.Regularly clear out blurry or duplicate photos and unneeded screenshots. Store your photos and videos in the cloud: there are plenty of providers to choose from, such asApple’s iCloud,Google Photos,Amazon PhotosandMicrosoft’s OneDrive. Delete unused apps and games. Remove old music, films and TV shows that have been downloaded for offline playback. Empty your downloads folder and clear out your messaging storage, particularly if you’re part of WhatsApp group chats, as every image, gif or video sent quickly adds up.Protect the battery and plan for a replacementView image in fullscreenMost modern smartphone batteries last up to 1,000 full charge cycles.Photograph: Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto/REX/ShutterstockBatteries are consumables that wear down every time you charge them until they need replacing, so it’s important to plan for a battery replacement after a few years of use. Most modern smartphone batteries last about 500 to 1,000 full charge cycles. Each charge cycle is cumulative, so if you use 60% of the battery one day, recharge it and then use 40% the following day before recharging it, that is one full charge cycle.There are things you can do to help extend the life of the battery. Avoid exposing it to extreme temperatures, which accelerate ageing. Using your phone less means fewer recharges, so frequent use of the battery-saver mode, setting a short screen timeout and other power-saving settings can help.Changing the way you charge it can make a big difference, too. Batteries have to work harder in the first and last 20% of capacity, causing more degradation of their internal components than the middle bit. Keeping a battery mostly between 20% and 80% of its maximum charge will significantly reduce its wear over time.Both Android and iOS devices have long been able to learn from your charging habits and charge the battery to 100% only just before you need it, such as an hour before you wake up. But you can also now limit the maximum charge to 80% on many devices.ForiPhone 15and later, look in Battery Charge settings. ForAndroid devices, including Samsung, Pixel and OnePlus, look in settings under battery protection, charging optimisation or battery health, depending on the manufacturer.Keep it cleanView image in fullscreenA clean screen will keep your phone fresh and improve visibility.Photograph: Adrian Crook/Getty ImagesCleaning your phone screen withantibacterial sprayfrom time to time is a good idea, but don’t forget to also clear out the various holes in the sides of your phone. Keep the charging port clear of pocket fluff to stop it from becoming blocked, and watch out for the buildup of detritus in the speaker and mic holes. If you don’t routinely play music out loud, it’s worth cranking the phone’s volume up to maximum with a loud and aggressive track every so often to eject built-up dust, particularly from the earpiece speaker.Antibacterial phone sprayFrom £1 at Muc-OffAntiviral phone wipes£1.25 at Wilko£1.25 at The RangeSamuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editorExplore more on these topicsSmartphonesThe FilterMobile phonesGadgetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While other retailers including Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury’s, Argos and John Lewis also stock cheap cast-iron, Aldi’s, at £19.99, is by far the cheapest. It’s also only available “while stocks last”.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Any cookbook worth its salt will, at some point, tell you to simmer/boil/fry/saute something in a “heavy-bottomed” pot or saucepan. Contrary to lightweight postwar aluminium fare, a pot with a decent weight to it retains and distributes heat more evenly, ensuring food cooks better (and slower). The ultimate in all-round heavy pots – and kitchen status symbols –come from Le Creuset. Founded by two Belgians in the tiny northern French town of Fresnoy-le-Grand, this foundry produced its first bright orange (a colour known as Flame in Le Creuset parlance) cocottes in 1925. Such was the international engouement they provoked early on, that the company still makes exactly the same products, in the same way.The coloured enamel exteriors have been central to their appeal from the outset: that original volcanic orange was inspired by the colour of molten metal. Marilyn Monroe had a whole collection in Elysee Yellow thatsold at a New York auction in 1999 for $25,300and cookbook authorElizabeth David, a lifelong fan, inspired a range in Gauloise blue. The latest iterations come in all sorts of colours with names like Berry and Bamboo. Each costs a small fortune.The last time the French brand held a warehouse sale – in Andover, Hampshire, in November 2024 – the police were called because hard-nosed hopefulswere lining the London Road and the A3093 for miles. One couple, who queued for four hours,TikTokked a massive haul of about 50 itemson which, they said, they’d saved £1,614.50 (paying £1,127 instead of £2,741.50 at full price). This included a classic round casserole dish that would have cost them £369 full price, but for which they only paid £159.The best Le Creuset alternatives, from cast-iron casserole dishes to skilletsRead moreIt makes perfect sense, then, that supermarkets should be clambering to produce imitation Le Creusets, but finding one of theAldicast-iron casseroles is a tricky business. I trekked to the brand’s superstore in Leyton, east London, the day after they were released and unearthed the last two, hidden mid-aisle in the jumbled product bins. They come in one size only – 22cm in diameter, with a volume of four litres – and two colours: Pepto-Bismol pink or night-sky blue.An Aldi shop assistant told me he’d bought a large blue frying pan in the same range, now completely sold out, a couple of weeks earlier. He was delighted with the purchase and, at that price (a cool £12.99), you would be too. The Le Creuset casserole closest in size (a 24cm / 4.2 litre model) to the Aldi one costs £305. For that amount, you could buy 14 Aldi pots (with change). Or one Aldi pot, and have enough money left over to buy yourself a cheap hob and oven. The question then is: are they any good?The kitchen testView image in fullscreenDale Berning Sawa places chopped onions in a Le Creuset casserole dish.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI have a small Le Creuset cocotte which I use to make things likeMarcella Hazan’s slow-simmer tomato sauceor Japanese pork curry. I use it for cooking Japanese rice, too; and as a Dutch oven for baking. I try cooking all of these things in both a pink Aldi number, and a greyM&S medium casserole dish(21.2 cm / 2.8 litre, £35), as a comparison.I find the Aldi lid doesn’t fit quite as snugly as the Le Creuset’s and the M&S’s – all the steam rushes out of the pot and my rice comes out harder than it should. Other than that, cooking with both pots is comparable to the Le Creuset.I’ve always associated enamelled cast-iron with gas or fire cooking but these pots work just as well on any other hob, including induction. Leiths cookery school graduate and foodie content creator Tyler Butt has garnered millions of followerson TiktokandInstagramwith homely dishes like shepherd’s pie, made in exactly this kind of casserole dish on – and in – an Aga.Honey and Co’s Sarit Packer, meanwhile, has a 20-year collection of cast-iron pots and pans at home that she uses on an electric hob. “We love the heat distribution and that they fit in the oven to cook through or just keep warm,” she says. Her absolute best use of the pans, she adds, is to braise a whole chicken with vegetables “and maybe a splash of wine and some spices, simply in a medium hot oven for two hours without paying any attention to it as it cooks. You get a great no-stress dinner for four.”I don’t roast three whole chickens, but to test the pots in the oven, I do bake a batch of cinnamon rolls in each. Here too, the bakes come out great – no discernible differences.The mistreatment testView image in fullscreenPut through its paces … the burned remains of a curry on the bottom of an Aldi casserole dish.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThe rules for using a cast-iron pot are simple: don’t heat it up too quickly (a danger particularly on induction hobs), or heat it up dry, without oil or liquid. Don’t use it over a too high heat. Don’t put a hot pan under cold water. Don’t use metal utensils or abrasive cleaners; don’t scrub with metal wool. I’ve definitely, foolishly, ruined a Le Creuset cast-iron milk pan before by not following this guidance. So, that’s precisely what I try to do now, with both the Aldi and the M&S.I purposely burn the curry and the rice. I scald milk. I melt sugar until it’s black and smoking. I put hot pans under a cold tap, scrape them with knives and metal spoons, and scour them inside and out with metal wool.The most damage I manage to inflict is a few grey lines on the otherwise beautifully smooth enamel: both still look new. Of course, I didn’t ruin my Le Creuset milk pan in one go, and my extant Le Creuset cocotte I’ve had for over a decade. All of which suggests that the real test will be how these cheapos fare in time.Neil Currie, the co-founder ofShropshire’s Netherton Foundry, started designing cookware and appliances straight out of art school in 1981. He worked for both Lidl and Aldi and says they would remove all and any unnecessary components, stripping the product down to the bare minimum – which sometimes actually resulted in a better product.When it comes to cast-iron cookware, however, there’s nothing extraneous to strip out. Production is as basic as it gets: molten metal is poured into a sand mould, cooled, cleaned and enamelled. To Currie’s mind, a £20 cast-iron pot sounds “too good to be true”.View image in fullscreenThe writer’s finished, go-to tomato sauce in a Le Creuset pot.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianHe cautions that provenance and process are of key importance. French brands such as Le Creuset and Staub, he says, are so expensive because of labour costs. They still hand-produce their cast-iron pots on site, meaning the purity and relative food safety of the raw materials they use are guaranteed. A Le Creuset casserole is sand-cast with a mix of iron and recycled steel andinspected, by hand, by 40 people. It comes with a lifetime guarantee, covering “faulty workmanship and/or materials when the product is used in normal, domestic conditions and in accordance with the care and use instructions provided”.Both M&S and Aldi, by contrast, simply specify that their cast-iron pots are “made in China” – which is a bit nebulous when you consider that some estimates put the number of Chinese sand-casting foundries across the country at over 20,000.Similarly, just what the metal is coated with is important. “Iron is cheaper than aluminium, weight for weight,” Currie says, “but it always takes much, much more finishing. Putting that finish on the top is often as expensive as making the pan itself.” Cast-iron casseroles are typically coated in vitreous enamel: a layer of coloured glass powder fused to the metal by firing at temperatures upwards of 800C (1,472F). The colours (Le Creuset’s rainbow of shades, Aldi’s pink, that M&S grey) are achieved by adding in different metals, which, because it’s cookware, need to be food-grade. Currie says this is why not many people do enamel work in the UK these days: “You have to ensure you’ve got the right metals and they’re not leaching out. It is hard and very difficult to control.” Longstanding French foundries such as Le Creuset, meanwhile, have perfected their enamelling craft for over a hundred years, and they still do it all in-house.If the enamel chips, the metal is exposed. Iron, of course, will rust. If it’s on the outside, you can oil it to prevent rusting, which the Le Creuset website says is safe. If the enamel is chipped on the inside of a pot, the company’s website says “we recommend submitting a warranty claim so the piece can be evaluated”. By contrast, the Aldi casserole dish simply specifies “3 layers of enamel coating” and a promise to replace or refund if the customer is not entirely satisfied with the product. The M&S version cautions users to handle with care to avoid chipping the enamel coating. In other words, these cheap pots come with much less information, and no guarantees.View image in fullscreenThe Le Creuset comes out on top … but only just.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThe verdictOn balance, then, as metallurgists and traditionalists will tell you, French does seem to be best in terms of artisanal heft and quality control. Clearly, no one really needs over a grand’s worth of Le Creuset wares, but if you can afford to invest in even just one, it makes sense to do so.Second-hand is a great option. As bakerDavid Lebovitzhas put it: “I actually love seeing the well-used pieces at the flea markets in France, because many people have kept their Le Creuset pots and pans in their families, handing them down from generation to generation. Some I put back because they’re too far gone, others I haggle for – or just pay up because it’s too good to leave behind – and a few I regret not acting faster on, seeing them snapped up by others.”At the same time, though, these cheaper versions are certainly much sturdier, and therefore less wasteful, than cheap nonstick pans, which cookware experts will tell you typically last only between one and five years. So, as long as, over time, you do not treat them as I did, the cast-iron equivalents have the potential to last a lot longer. That has to count for something.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleShoppingHomesAldiSupermarketsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

According todata publishedby the digital store Steam, almost 19,000 titles were released in 2024 – and that’s just on one platform. Hundreds more arrived on consoles and smartphones. In some ways this is the positive sign of a vibrant industry, but how on earth does a new project get noticed? When Triple A titles with multimillion dollar marketing budgets are finding it hard to gain attention (disappointing sales have been reported for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the Final Fantasy VII remakes and EA Sports FC), what chance is there for a small team to break out?And yet it does happen. Last year’s surprise hit Balatro has shifted more than 5m copies. Complex medieval strategy title Manor Lords sold 1m copies during its launch weekend. But what awaits a small developer after they achieve success? And what does success even mean in a continuously evolving industry?James Carbutt and Will Todd of Coal Supper are still trying to make sense of it. Their acerbic satireThank Goodness You’re Here!, in which players slap their way through bizarre quotidian scenarios in the fictional humble northern town of Barnsworth, is now an award-winning game. “It’s just not registered as a success in my head at all,” says Carbutt. “The numbers are going up on screen, and there have been YouTube playthroughs and some erotic fan art. Beyond that, it won’t register.”I can’t imagine making any more games. I don’t know where I would go from hereAfter spending three years working on the project, the pair now find themselves in the confusing glare of the spotlight, fielding questions about what’s next. “It’s horrible,” Carbutt jokes. “But I don’t think we feel any sort of second-album syndrome. The space it gives you to be a bit introspective about what you want to do next is the interesting quirk of a successful indie game.”Veteran indie developer Gabe Cuzzillo (Ape Out,Baby Steps) offered them sage wisdom. “He spoke about how you should focus not just on making something good – because how do you quantify that, it’s amorphous?” says Todd. “Instead we should look at what it is we want to explore and judge success intrinsically, based on whether we explored that thing. The pressure of speed to market doesn’t apply to us, because it’s never going to be possible to crank something out in six months to chase success anyway. It’s more like, in the wake of this being received well, what’s the next thing we want to explore? That’s something we’re interrogating at the moment.”Australian developer Grace Bruxner has also redefined success after leaving behind a trilogy of Frog Detective games: bite-size adventures co-developed with Thomas Bowker that quickly became cult indie hits.View image in fullscreen‘Has it impacted people’s lives in a positive way?’ … Frog Detective.Photograph: Wormclub“Success in games has always been a bit of a lie, a bit of an illusion,” she says, pointing to typical markers such as cultural impact, player numbers and financial gain. “My measure of success is: did I make something I’m proud of, and has it impacted my life and other people’s lives in a positive way? And yes, it did, so thumbs up.”Bruxner began working on the series during her final year at university as an experiment, to see whether she could produce a commercial game. After a relatively breezy first outing, the second Frog Detective game demanded that Bruxner and Bowker lock in, and spend most of their time on the project. By the third instalment, the hard work had paid off, though the pressure had begun to take its toll. Throw in the pandemic, as well as mental and physical health issues, and Bruxner was ready to take a break. “I wasn’t grinding super hard, but I also wasn’t having a great time,” she says. “It just was really nice to make that choice to stop.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unless you love making games. I’m not sure I love making games. I was quite young when we released the first Frog Detective, so it was like, ‘This is my entire identity for life. I don’t know how to be a separate person from that.”Three years after the series’ swan song, she is on indefinite hiatus, exploring alternative creative paths – such as pottery. “I can’t imagine making games, because of the expectations on me as a creator,” she explains. “I don’t even know where I would go from here.”Bruxner has been surprised by her ability to sustain herself on the modest amount of money provided by Frog Detective. “If your game continues to have a tail, and you can budget properly and live within your means, it is possible to have a passive income that isn’t tied to being a horrible landlord,” she explains. Even so, she knows how taboo it can be to talk plainly about money, especially in creative circles like the indie game scene. “I have the free time to chill and decide what I want to do, but I assume at some point I’ll probably need to have a career again. My biggest question is will this money last forever? Probably not, and then what happens when it runs out? I don’t know.”View image in fullscreen‘Opportunities are limited’ … Consume Me.Photograph: HexecutableIt may seem as though more indies than ever have broken into the spotlight in recent years. But enduring games industry turbulence has made finding financial support for follow-ups and debuts more complicated. “The elephant in the room is everything that’s happened over the past couple of years, with mass layoffs, studio closures and evaporating funding opportunities,” explains AP Thomson, a developer of the forthcoming indie Consume Me with fellow NYU Game Center graduate Jenny Jiao Hsia. “Before that, there was a pretty major change around the mid-2010s when indie publishers and funders started rising in prominence. Everything we’ve heard suggests that the same opportunities no longer exist or are incredibly limited.”Consume Me, the duo’s coming-of-age scheduling RPG doesn’t have a release date but has already been nominated for five gongs at the IndependentGamesFestival awards. As such, Jiao Hsia and Thomson are already under pressure to decide their next endeavour. “Multiple people have told us we should be moving forward once it launches,” says Thomson.Even with growing expectations, the pair aren’t keen to get ahead of themselves. “Everything we’ve heard suggests that now is really not a great time to be pitching, so we’re going to focus our energy on the launch and then read the temperature of the room after that,” Thomson adds.“I’m looking forward to finding enjoyment in making art again, instead of feeling like I have to show up to a job I never applied to,” explains Jiao Hsia. “The idea of making art for fun, without worrying about making money off it, is something I can’t wait to do.”Explore more on these topicsIndie gamesGamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Look around and you could be back in 1987 ...Morwenna FerrierThu 27 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTShareThe first time I heard the phrase “boom boom” was at a fashion show in January: Prada in Milan. While I sat waiting for something incredibly tasteful to appear on the catwalk, out marched a bare-chested model with a pashmina-sized fur draped over his shoulders. Then came another, and another, and then one more in a huge fur hood. The fur was shearling – skin from a recently shorn sheep or lamb; usually, as in Prada’s case, a byproduct of the meat industry, so marginally less problematic – but still. You see some strange things on catwalks these days, but “fur” isn’t usually one of them.Except it didn’t stop there. Later, there was “fur” at Emporio Armani and yeti coats at Dolce & Gabbana. By the time the womenswear shows had finished in March, “fur” (mostly fake, occasionally real) had appeared in about 70% of the shows. Along with that were exaggerated shoulders at Saint Laurent, Pretty Woman thigh-high boots at Stella McCartney and pointy bras at Miu Miu. These shows seemed to be saying that fashion wants us to look rich, gauche and glamorous. Or, to use a phrase coined by the trend forecasterSean Monahan, who gave the world normcore (2014) and vibe shift (2022), fashion wants us to look boom boom.View image in fullscreenGauche and glamorous … Prada’s autumn/winter 2025 collection proudly features shearling.Photograph: Alessandro Garofalo/ReutersIf you are new to the phrase, don’t panic. As a forecaster whose job involves mapping cultural moments on to prevailing trends, Monahan says “the curse with doing predictions is that sometimes you go too early”. It may take some time for most of us to start wearing fur coats and miniskirts. “But it is happening in the wild,” he says.Monahan has described boom boom as “a pure expression of excess”, a world in which “male-coded values … have come roaring back”. “I’m always looking at what people wear around me, the one thing that sticks out,” he says now. With the vibe shift, it was trucker hats (a favourite of the Strokes). With boom boom, it is men who don’t work in offices wearing suits and loafers, alongside women dressed up in “expressive big silhouettes and fur”. Until recently, he says, “no one was wearing a suit unless they worked in finance. Five years ago, people would have screamed at you for wearing even leather.”View image in fullscreenTrickling into culture … Patrick Schwarzenegger as Saxon in The White Lotus.Photograph: HBOBoom boom is glamour and greed, epitomised by a style and mindset reminiscent of the sleazy, money-saturated world of late 80s New York. There is an end-of-empire, end-of-history nihilism to it, a sense of raising another bottle of Moët into the air while the world burns around you. But it’s also about aspiration, panic and the jarring disconnection between the economic climate we want and the one that exists – an experience shared by most. As McCartney said backstage after her “laptop to lapdance” collection earlier this month: “Instead of going: I’m anxious [about the world] and I’m scared of all the feelings which we’re attached to, I’m like: fuck fear. I’m flipping it.” Easy for her to say, you may think.Already there are signs of boom boom trickling into culture. Take Patrick Schwarzenegger’s Saxon inseason three of The White Lotus, all golden tan and button-down shirts, and Mikey Madison’s titular,Oscar-winning role in Anora, complete with a Hervé Léger bandage dress and a six-figure sable coat. It’s Mark Zuckerberg sporting a $300,000 Rolex to a UFC fight. It’s caviar being sold on Deliveroo and eaten on chicken nuggets by Rihanna. It’s Kim Kardashianposing next to a Tesla roboton the cover of Perfect magazine.In fashion, it has been there for a while: red-carpet stylists peddling Old Hollywood glamour at the Oscars (takeDemi Moore’s crystal-embellished Armani Privé dress); a naked Bianca Censoridropping her fur coat at the Grammys. It’s secondhand Chanel handbags at John Lewis, party-girl polka dots at M&S and the growing popularity of weight-loss drugs in the fashion world, the body positivity movement seemingly forgotten. It’s this summer’s mootedreturn of Fyre festival, which summed up all the absurdity and injustice of late capitalism when itfailed so spectacularlythe first time around. It’s doing shots.View image in fullscreenIn vogue … Anna Wintour in 1989.Photograph: Ron Galella Collection/Getty ImagesRecently, Monahan has landed on 1987 as a reference point. This was the year the US Vogue editor Anna Wintour arrived in New York and Donald Trump published The Art of the Deal. Tina Brown, the patron saint of celebrity culture, with her “black tie, red nails, whole big swirl” glamour (as recounted in an interview for her memoir The Vanity Fair Diaries), was the queen of New York. (When approached for this article, Brown said she had not heard of the term boom boom, but that she would “study up on it”.)Then, as now, the rich were getting richer and the poor were getting poorer. On either side of the Atlantic, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were well into their neoliberal revolutions, crushing the welfare state as they enriched the 1%.Conspicuous consumerism had evolved into vice-signalling – 1987 was the year Bill Cosby was on the cover of Time magazine, alongside the headline: “Funny, famous, fifty and filthy rich!” The film Wall Street and Bret Easton Ellis’s novel American Psycho, which turns glamour and frivolity into emptiness and greed (“There is no real me,” claims its protagonist, Patrick Bateman), were also set in that year. The film’s Armani coats, real furs and Cerruti power suits are not faithful to the book (Calvin Klein and Comme des Garçons refused to lend their clothes), but speak to Bateman’s empty yuppie aesthetic and are not far off what popped up on Milan’s catwalks (or whatA$AP Rocky– and Rihanna – recently wore to court). Then there wasBlack Monday, when the stock market fell to its lowest point since the Wall Street crash of 1929.View image in fullscreenThe return of conspicuous consumerism … Donald Trump in 1987.Photograph: Joe McNally/Getty ImagesWith Trump’s re-election, technological and financial instability and the crucial addition of climate catastrophe (which in 1987 was a shadow in the background rather than a constantly exploding bomb), the time for a revival of boom boom mentality is ripe.Between the cost of living crisis, stagnant wage growth and a competitive job market, it’s no secret that many young people are struggling. A study last year by Yorkshire Building Society and the consultancy Public First showed that more than half of gen Z workers – those aged between 16 and 27 –have not saved any of their incomein the past two years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s not just a cultural shift towards the past; it’s another lurch to the right. It’s the much-discussed post‑pandemic“revenge dressing”we were promised.Monahan insists the trend is not political, but admits it does dovetail with global events: “Let’s not forget it’syoung people that swung the vote[for Trump].” Still, he thinks boom boom is as much a reaction against how we have been dressing lately as it is a political statement. The post-pandemic mass casualisation – into which normcore fed – reached its apotheosis when the working-from-home look became the “de facto adult dress code”, he says. “It’s the classic pendulum swing: young people rejecting what grownups are doing, while working out what it means to dress like an adult, all inching its way into fashion.”It’s also a reaction against “woke culture”. Over email, one fashion PR in her mid-20s who owns a vintage fur coat (and therefore wishes to remain anonymous) said she found the catwalk shows this season comically ironic. “None of us can afford this stuff, but that’s part of it. We can’t afford anything we’re ‘supposed’ to wear,” she says. “Most of the people who’ve heard of boom boom weren’t even born then, so it’s basically cosplaying your parents – if your parents were wealthy.” She sends me a link to Victoria Beckham’s sardonic“My dad had a Rolls-Royce” T-shirt.View image in fullscreenMonastic blandness … the Duchess of Sussex and Mindy Kaling in With Love, Meghan.Photograph: APIt’s no coincidence that the loadsamoney revivalism has landed on our laps in the week that the Duchess of Sussex released a £10,000shoppable wardrobebased on the clothes she wears in her new TV show. With her cream jeans and striped shirts, it’s giving“quiet luxury”, the 2022 high-fashion trend that centred on clothing of monastic blandness, frightening prices and subtle signifiers of wealth.Neither look is particularly winning. The difference is that boom boom isn’t trying to be. “The American elite is in flux,” says Monahan. “For a long time, it was about people not wanting to flaunt wealth. There is still an audience for stealth wealth, but it’s older and small-C conservative. Now, it’s unclear where people are in the status hierarchy.” Quiet luxury and normcore, he says, are “avoidant”: “They are attempts not to make a statement.” Boom boom is the opposite.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The English distinction – not tied to a cathedral, a certain form of local government, nor population size – is whimsical, even if signed off by royalty. This selection of destinations is not about alpha cities. The smallest is ancient; the other two newly minted. None merit bypassing.CarlisleI arrived in Carlisle by way of theCumbrian coast lineand would later ride onward on the fabled railway to Settle. Arriving in this ancient city in a midway kind of mood is all too common. If Carlisle wasn’t between so many beauty spots – Lakes and Dales, Scotland and Northumbria, Hadrian’s Wall and North Pennines – it would be a tourism hotspot.Its origins lie in the Roman settlement of Luguvalium, a key military base by the third century and the administrative centre for keeping down the indigenousCarvetii. A castle first appeared in 1093; itssuccessorgreets you outside the station. A priory and city were founded and a bishopric decreed in the 12th century. Walls were speedily built; the western ramparts remain. Anglo-Norman historian Jordan Fantosme (died circa 1185) describes the “fair and well-defended city of Carlisle … resplendent in its beauty as the sun lights up its walls and turrets”. Myth swirled around them. French Arthurian poet Chrétien de Troyes identified Arthur’s court with Carlisle.From the 13th century, the gaze shifted to Scotland, with Carlisle as a base for invasion. Between-ness became bloodyWool was woven and dyed; leather was tanned. Both commodities were exported to Ireland. From the 13th century, the gaze shifted to Scotland, with Carlisle as a base for invasion. Between-ness became bloody. The so-calledDebatable Lands, formerly too poor to matter, became a seedbed of anarchy.Border reiversfrom both nations raided farms and settlements. This was the last part of Great Britain to be brought under the control of a state, beginning in 1530.Subsequently, Carlisle was a major trading post, for corn, cattle, horses, with three fairs and eight thriving guilds (merchants, tanners, skinners and glovers, butchers, smiths, weavers, tailors, and shoemakers). TheGuildhallis a Grade I-listed, timber-framed beauty. However, commercial activity waned. Daniel Defoe, visiting in 1724, reported that “the city is strong, but small, the buildings old, but the streets fair … There is not a great deal of trade here either by land or sea, it being a mere frontier”.Industry rebooted it all over again, through canal, roads and, especially, the railways. It became a substantial north-west city. Dickens and Wilkie Collins stayed at theCounty Hotelon their tours. The latter used his northern experiences while writing The Woman in White. I imagine him sipping a brew and scribbling at the VictorianJohn Watt & Son tearoomsin his final year.Things to see and do:Lanercost Priory(bus AD122 and 685), Hadrian’s Wall (Birdoswald) at Brampton;Carlisle CathedralDoncasterView image in fullscreenA remarkable contemporary building … the Danum Gallery, Library and Museum.Photograph: Dave Porter/AlamyOne definition of the north is “point of no return”. In 1603, Sir Robert Carey, deciding to deliver the news that Queen Elizabeth I had died to James VI at Holyrood, travelled by horse from London to Doncaster in a single day. Henry Bolingbroke was proclaimed Henry IV at Doncaster. Northern powers met their foes to negotiate near Doncaster during thePilgrimage of Grace, a revolt against Henry VIII and Thomas Cromwell.England’s envoys were following their Roman forebears. Doncaster was a natural forward base for summits and skirmishes. The Great North Road provides both entry point and focus for a day trip to Donny. The starting gate is the racecourse, here since 1776, also the first year of the St Leger.Doncaster gathers pace as you walk. Soon the old main drag bristles with pubs and barsThe Great North Road (A638) is an elegant boulevard. On South Parade are smart early 19th-century terraces. Extensive parks spread out on either side of the road. At Regent Square, leafiness comes into town. In the area areThe Earl, a 1930s hotel with its art deco shimmeringly restored;The Point, a thriving gallery, cafe and cultural space; andThe Salutation, a lovely boozer that has kept its arch for horse-drawn coaches.Doncaster gathers pace as you walk. Soon the old main drag bristles with pubs and bars. Hall Gate becomes High Street. On the pavement are two undulating timelines – one for Doncaster (Romans invade 55BC, founding of Danecastre 1152, floods 1750); the other for world events (braille 1837, cubism 1907, etc). Rising above it is theMansion House, one of two Grade I-listed buildings in the town centre, and the official base of the civic mayor. Free tours of the opulent staircase, meeting rooms and grand ballroom are offered monthly.The Roman name, Danum, is everywhere: Danum hotel; Danum plumbing and heating; Danum coffee. TheDanum Gallery, Library and Museumis a remarkable contemporary building, housing part of the old Doncaster high school for girls building. It has a superb railway memorabilia collection, with the Green Arrow and Atlantic locos built at Doncaster Plant Works as magnificent centrepieces. Above these are beautiful library areas for adults and children, a smart cafe, and an art gallery that juxtaposes old master-ish oils of race meetings and wigged grandees with contemporary work reflecting the mostforward-looking attitudes to mental health.St George’s churchis the other Grade I-listed building. Known as the minster, it is prominent, dark and godly, and visible from afar. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner deemed it the “proudest and most cathedral-like of … parish churches”. I walked beneath it, over the North Bridge, past the Danum retail park to the Sun inn, there to discover the Roman Ridge – a branch of the old Roman road called Ermine Street, green and filled with birdsong. At a bench I ate a ham pie from the revered local bakeryToppings. The Romans are said to have introduced the idea of topping pies, and I was having a Toppings pie on the road by which their legionnaires, and their recipes, arrived.

Wales’s isn’t in doubt – but that doesn’t deter putdowns. In a parody of Dylan Thomas’s oft-quoted “ugly, lovely town”, the corrupt cop Terry Walsh (played by Dougray Scott) in the 1997 filmTwin Town describesSwanseaas a “pretty shitty city”.I disagree: terrace houses ranged on steep-sided hills and sweeping Swansea Bay offer solace to the searching eye. If all of Swansea isn’t pretty, blame the blitz, which obliterated buildings, lives, livelihoods, part of the past. The name of the city has nothing to do with swans or the sea. It was once calledSweins egoreyc, Swein’s island. In Welsh, it’s Abertawe, meaning mouth of the Tawe river. Swein may have been a Norseman who built a fort on the island around AD1000 as a base for raiding the Welsh coast.Dylan Thomas is too famous, his ownership of Swansea (and Laugharne) too established to need revisiting. Other artists are worthy guidesThe town was founded in the early 12th century during the Norman conquest of Wales. A wooden castle was constructed on the site of Worcester Place, rebuilt in stone in the early 13th century – still standing at the southern end of High Street, somewhat hemmed in by modern buildings. A town, with a market and garrison, sprang up. Much later, Swansea grew around coal mining and iron ore extraction, shipbuilding and shipping, and in the late 18th century saw booms in copper, lead and pottery. In 1801 the population was around 6,800; by the end of the century, it had passed 100,000. During the last three decades, the docks have been redeveloped – and rebranded as the Maritime Quarter (or Marina).Dylan Thomas is too famous, his ownership of Swansea (andLaugharne) too established to need revisiting. Other artists are worthy guides. Vernon Watkins’s Ode to Swansea opens with precise images of its particular luminance: “Bright town, tossed by waves of time to a hill.” Alfred Janes’s paintingCastle Street, Swansea 1941-41captures the blitzed, violated urban heart. Daniel Jones’sFifth Symphonymay evoke the drama of the wild surrounding landscapes, inner turmoil, the sea, wartime memories, or none of those. It confirmed him “without serious rival as the principality’s leading symphonist”.These three, with other pals, and Thomas, were known collectively as the Kardomah Gang. TheKardomahcafe on Portland Street is not the original (that was on Castle Street) but is a lovely combination of 50s-style greasy spoon and 21st -century retro chic. The city is packed with sites iconic to locals and literary pilgrims alike: theNo Sign Bar(the city’s oldest wine bar); theTower of the Eclipticastronomical observatory; the graciousMorgan’s Hotel; the magnificently (mis)named Salubrious Passage off Wind Street; the old Carlton Cinema (now abookshop).Trainspotters and history buffs get misty eyed about the Swansea and Mumbles Railway, opened on 25 March 1807, to carry the first paying passengers in the world; a replica of the first horse-drawn carriage is on display in theTramshedin the Marina. I follow its trail to Mumbles and the Gower – which rises towards the sunset.Things to see and do:Swansea Jack memorial;5 Cwmdonkin Drive(Dylan Thomas’s house) and Cwmdonkin Park,Dylan Thomas Centre,National Waterfront Museum.Chris Moss’s visits were assisted byVisit England,Visit Walesand Doncaster CouncilExplore more on these topicsUnited Kingdom holidaysWhere tourists seldom treadWales holidaysEngland holidaysDay tripsCultural tripsShort breaksCity breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But which do you prefer? We asked the great and good on the UK conservation scene to name their favourite invertebrate:Steve Reed, UK environment secretaryRed admirals are such a beautiful sight on a sunny day in the garden. Sadly we are seeing far fewer butterflies and insects, which is why this government is committed to banning bee-killing pesticides.Caroline Lucas, former Green leader and MPMy vote goes to the common green grasshopper, because I like the vividness of its green body but mostly because the familiar “churring” sound they make as they rub their legs against their wings is a sure sign that summer is on its way. The word “stridulation” is a cool one, too – the name of the grasshopper’s song.Nadia Shaikh, co-director of the Right to Roam campaignI nominate the green tiger beetle,Cicindelacampestris. First, they are so strikingly beautiful: the body of the beetle is iridescent forest green with cream smudges. They also have long shiny legs, which are a sort of aubergine bronze colour. What is perhaps even more worthy of nomination is how they hunt: you’ll find green tiger beetles on bare sandy soil looking for other insects, which they will catch in their very large jaws. It’s spectacular to watch them running at great speeds along the ground after they’ve spotted something to eat. They are relatively easy to spot and endlessly exciting to watch dart around on their long legs.Sadiq Khan, mayor of LondonThe relationship between Londoners and oysters goes beyond the card for catching the tube. Oysters once kept the working class of London fed, with Victorians eating hundreds of millions a year. They also have an inspiring future, as I saw when I visited New York and the Billion Oyster Project, which is using their natural filter feeding to clean the harbour – an idea with exciting potential for London’s waterways.Craig Bennett,chief executive of theWildlifeTrustsThe humble bumblebee wins out for me for several reasons, not least because they are beautiful and fluffy insects whose appearance effortlessly symbolises the hope of spring and vibrancy of summer.But they’re not just here to look nice. They play a vital role as ambassadors for the important ecosystem services that nature provides and humanity replies upon – in this case, pollination.View image in fullscreen‘They symbolise the huge threats to nature we’re facing.’Photograph: FLPA/Rex ShutterstockFor many children, especially in urban areas, bumblebees are one of the first connections they make to nature and the beginnings of an awareness of the importance of nature for our survival. And I love that everyone can experience them, whether in towns, cities, the coast or the countryside.Whenever I see one, to me they also symbolise the huge threats to nature we’re facing. The loss of habitat and overuse of pesticides continues to be incredibly damaging to bees. Now that the government has promised to ban one group of these toxic pesticides – neonicotinoids – I’m looking forward to seeing bumblebees this year as a symbol of a hope after a hard-fought and recently won campaign, but also a reminder of how much more we have to do.Mary Creagh, UK environment ministerThe ladybird is a the best sort of superbug – chomping through the aphids on my fruit trees and inspiring generations of children through poetry. My only grumble is that they love having their babies in my bathroom, which can lead to some close encounters in spring!Tony Juniper, chair of Natural EnglandThe small tortoiseshell. Their orange, black and white wings, fringed with blue dots, bring a bright splash of exotic colour to spring and summer. They are sadly no longer common, with numbers now at an all-time low.Guy Shrubsole, author and nature campaignerI think I’d have to go with the blue ground beetle, an icon of Britain’s temperate rainforests and devourer of slugs. I’ve only seen this species once, on a moonless night around midnight, in a damp and dripping Atlantic oakwood on the banks of the River Dart. They’re surprisingly large, iridescent indigo-blue and scuttle up and down tree trunks in search of their prey.Beccy Speight,chief executive of the RSPBIn the cloud forests of Saint Helena, a UK Overseas Territory in the middle of the South Atlantic, the spiky yellow woodlouse has a party trick: when the UV lights show, they literally glow, the only woodlouse of record to have this reaction. But they’re not the only incredible creature on Saint Helena: the island is also home to 250 other unusual species which live nowhere else on Earth. The RSPB has been involved in conservation on this magical island since 2018, working with the island community and partners on a plan to save and restore the vital cloud forest.Prof Dave Goulson, expert in invertebratesI have to go for the hairy-footed flower bee,Anthophora plumipes. Seeing these lovely fluffy bees zipping about the garden is one of the highlights of springtime. The jet-black females are most interested in drinking nectar from lungwort and grape hyacinth, while the rusty-brown males have eyes only for the girls, chasing off rival males and defending patches of flowers that females might visit. Courtship involves the male grabbing clumsily at the female either mid-air or while she feeds on a flower. He then tries to make up for his gauche behaviour by gently brushing her face seductively with his hairy feet. These are solitary bees, only on the wing for a few weeks in April and May.Between 24 March and 2 April, we will be profiling a shortlist of 10 of the invertebrates chosen by readers and selected by our wildlife writers from more than 2,500 nominations. The voting for our 2025 invertebrate of the year will run from midday on Wednesday 2 April until midday on Friday 4 April, with the winner to be announced on Monday 7.

No amnesty!” one elated lefty roared from his balcony into the sunny autumn afternoon.Across the bay in the city of Niterói, the composer Edu Krieger was so delighted by the prospect of Bolsonaro serving time he wrotea song– a parody of a Tom Jobim bossa nova classic called Waters of March – celebrating the downfall of the “coup-mongering fascist”.“It was a feeling of relief,” Krieger, one of many progressive Brazilians who abhor the far-right populist for his attacks on culture and human rights, said ofthe court’s decision.View image in fullscreenEdu Krieger, pictured in 2019.Photograph: Felipe Fittipaldi/The GuardianThousands of miles north, deep in the Amazon, the Yanomami leader Júnior Hekurari also voiced satisfaction. “Never before were we so abandoned by the Brazilian state [than during Bolsonaro’s 2019-23 administration] … His words encouraged thousands of illegal miners to infiltrate our forests, bringing mercury, violence and environmental destruction,” Hekurari recalled.Bolsonaro’s critics have said they hope this week’s ruling will end his divisive andhate-filled 36-year career, in which the paratrooper turned politician underwent an astonishing transformation from eccentric​ backbencher​ to the country’s most powerful man.“He turned his back on us – and now the world can see the consequences of his acts,” said Hekurari, condemning Bolsonaro’s “negligence and omission” for plunging his Yanomami people into a deadly crisis of hunger and pain.View image in fullscreenJúnior Hekurari speaking to Yanomami villagers about the future of their territory in January.Photograph: João Laet/The GuardianBolsonaro’s future looks bleak after the unanimous ruling. When he goes on trial, possibly later this year, few believe the politician will escape punishment for allegedly leading a murderous conspiracy to stop his left-wing successor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, taking power after his 2022 election win. Those crimes could earn the 72-year-old a sentence of more than 40 years.As she voted for Bolsonaro to be put in the dock, the supreme court justice Cármen Lúcia Antunes Rocha launched a searing​ attack on the kind of authoritarian takeover the far-right politician is accused of plotting. “Dictatorship kills. Dictatorship lives off death – not just the death of society and of democracy, but of human beings made of flesh and bone​ who are tortured, mutilated and murdered,” she said.Bolsonaro tried to strike a defiant tone during a rambling, peevish 45-minute pronouncement to reporters, insisting he was innocent of “unfounded” accusations. “I’m not obsessed with power, I have a passion for Brazil,” he shouted, before a prankster trumpet player gatecrashed the press conference witha sarcastic rendition of Chopin’s Funeral March.Maria Cristina Fernandes, a columnist from the Valor Econômico newspaper, said she believed Bolsonaro cut a diminished figure. “It was the speech of someone who is bewildered, who doesn’t have a strategy … I saw a Bolsonaro who was lost and I think [in his position] anyone would be,” she said.Fernandes said she thought Bolsonaro – who she expected to be convicted – would try to grab two lifelines as he fought for political survival.The first involved securing a presidential pardon by helping to elect a right-wing president in next year’s election, in which he is banned from running. Bolsonaro had hoped his congressman son, Eduardo, might stand in his place. But Fernandes said she believed the court’s verdict meant he would instead be compelled to support São Paulo’s less radical right-wing governor, Tarcísio de Freitas, who stood a better chance of winning.Second, Fernandes said, Bolsonaro would fight to ensure a large number of right-wing senators were elected, wagering they would help impeach the supreme court judge Alexandre de Moraes – the man Bolsonaristas suspect would spearhead efforts to strike down any such pardon. “This is Bolsonaro’s absolute top priority,” she said.It is far from certain Bolsonaro will achieve those goals. When the ex-president summoned supporters to rally on Rio’s Copacabana beach this month, allies anticipated a million-strong crowd. About 18,000 people turned up, according to an estimate by one of Brazil’s top universities.View image in fullscreenSupporters throng Copacabana Beach, Rio de Janeiro, for the 16 March rally.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“For me, the protest in Copacabana was a sign that people want to turn the page,” Fernandes said. “I really think Bolsonaro is running the risk of becoming yesterday’s news.“I’m not saying Brazil’s right and extreme right are doomed,” she added, but Bolsonaro looked a spent force and the populist’s hopes of staging a Donald Trump-style comeback were not good. “Voters want to look to the future.”Not everyone is so sure. Bernardo Mello Franco, a political columnist for the newspaper O Globo, said he also expected Bolsonaro to be found guilty and jailed – if he did not flee abroad or hide in a foreign embassy first.Mello Franco said he believed the ex-president was hoping the “global extreme-right alliance” – spearheaded by Trump and Elon Musk – might somehow rescue him, even if the US president appeared to have more urgent priorities than a septuagenarian South American politician who no longer held power.But was Bolsonaro truly finished?“In Brazil, we can never say someone’s politically dead and buried,” Mello Franco replied. “Just look at the case of President Lula,” whose career looked over when he was jailed in 2018 but who reclaimed the presidency four years later. “Sometimes people seem to be out of the game and then suddenly there’s a twist.”View image in fullscreenFans greet Jair Bolsonaro at a rally in São Paulo in February last year.Photograph: Miguel Schincariol/AFP/Getty ImagesKrieger, the musician, voiced similar fears.“When it comes to politics, everything is so unpredictable,” Krieger said, pointing to the emergence of a new generation of social media savvy far-right figures. “While it might be the end of the road for a specific person, it isn’t, unfortunately, the end of the road for conspiratorial, coup-mongering, fascist ways of thinking.” .He added: “This seed wasn’t planted in Brazil by Bolsonaro – it was planted more than 500 years ago when Brazil was invaded by the Europeans, and native people began to be exterminated and slavery [took root] … These far-right ideas are still very much alive.”Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilThe far rightAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But these wines won’t be arriving stateside anytime soon.After the Trump administration threatened on 13 March to impose200% tariffson alcoholic products from Europe, many US importers like Bush have halted all outgoing shipments from Europe.The 1,100 cases of his wine, from family-owned producers in his company’s modest European portfolio, have already been paid for. But due to the tariff threat, they will remain stranded at their respective domaines at least until 2 April when the Trump administration is expected to reveal a “reciprocal tariff number” for each of its global trading partners.The newfound uncertainty around tariffs has many restaurant owners, beverage directors, liquor distributors and wine importers on edge in recent weeks. The only certainty among the trade professionals interviewed is that a 200% tariff would be catastrophic for the wine and spirits industry globally. And while most believe the actual number will end up much lower, everyone agrees that even modest tariffs would send shock waves throughout the entire food and beverage ecosystem, weakening distribution channels and further driving up already astronomical prices.Rising fears of Trump tariffs pummel US consumer confidence to four-year lowRead more“What scares me is how these hypothetical tariffs would affect [the many] European-themed restaurants like French bistros, Italian trattorias and German beer halls,” said Richard Hanauer, wine director and partner with Lettuce Entertain You. The Chicago-based group owns, manages and licenses more than 130 restaurants and 60 brands in a dozen different states and Washington DC. Hanauer predicts that concept-driven eateries that rely on European products would have to source wine and spirits from other regions because “the consumer is not going to accept the markup”.Even though Trump has been known to walk backdubious claims about tariffsbefore, the wine and spirits industry is taking this recent threat very seriously. Most American importers, such as Loci’s Bush, are adhering to the US Wine Trade Alliance’s (USWTA)guidance issued in mid-Marchwarning its members to cease wine shipments from Europe. Without guarantees that any potential tariffs would come with a notice period or exemptions for wines shipped prior to their announcement, the organization had no choice but to advise its constituents to halt all EU wine shipments.“Once the wine is on the water, we have no power,” said Bush. “We’re billed by our shippers as soon as the wine arrives.”Tariffs are import taxes incurred by the importer and paid as a percentage of the value of the freight at the point of entry upon delivery. Since shipments from Europe can often take up to six to eight weeks to arrive, firms like Loci face the predicament of not knowing how much they will owe to take delivery of their products when they reach US ports.“We’ve had many US importers tell us that even a 50% unplanned tariff could bankrupt their businesses, so we felt we had no choice,” said Benjamin Aneff, president of the USWTA, of the organization’s injunction. “It’s a sad situation. These are mostly small, family-owned businesses.”Europe’s wineries can also ill afford to be dragged into a trade war with the United States. According to the International Trade Center, the US comprises almost20% of the EU’s total wine exports, accounting for a total of $14.1bn (€13.1bn) of exported beverage, spirit and vinegar products from the EU in 2024.Many independent importers still recall Trump levying$7.5bn of tariffs on exportsfrom the EU during his first presidency, which included 25% duties on Scotch whiskey, Italian cheeses, certain French wines and other goods. These retaliatory measures, which took effect in October 2019, resulted from a years-long trade dispute between the US and the EU over airline subsidies.“We were hit with duties in late 2019. But we negotiated with a lot of our suppliers, so we were able to stave off any significant price increases,” said André Tamers, the founder of De Maison Selections, a fine-wine importer with a large portfolio of French and Spanish wines and spirits. But because the Covid-19 pandemic hit shortly thereafter, Tamers admitted, it was difficult to gauge the impact of the first round of Trump tariffs. The Biden administration eventuallyrescinded the measuresin June 2021.To pre-empt any potentially disastrous news on the tariff front, many restaurants and bars are ramping up inventory purchases to the extent that their budgets allow. “We made some large commitments for rosé season,” said Grant Reynolds, co-founder of Parcelle, which has an online wine shop as well as two bars and a bricks-and-mortar retail outlet in Manhattan. “To whatever we can reasonably afford, we’ve decided to secure those commitments sooner than later so that we can better weather the storm.”The same is true for many cocktail-focused bars around the country, which are looking to shore up supplies of popular spirits that could end up a victim of tariffs, including allocated scotches and rare cognacs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since it opened in 2023, Post Hasteeschews imported spirits of any kind; the bar is stocked exclusively with US products from east of the Mississippi River. “We always thought it would be advantageous to have our producers close to us for environmental reasons and to support the local economy,” said Beebe, “but we didn’t necessarily think that it would also benefit from fluctuations in distribution or global economic policy.”Donald Trump announces new 25% tariffs on cars from overseasRead moreInstead of serving popular European liquor brands such as Grey Goose vodka or Hendrick’s gin, the bar highlights local craft distillers such as Maggie’s Farm in Pittsburgh, which produces a domestic rum made from Louisiana sugar cane. After the recent tariff threats, Beebe says, the decision to rely on local products has turned out to be fortuitous. “I feel really bad for anyone who is running an agave-based program, a tequila or mezcal bar,” said Beebe. “They must be worried constantly about whether the price of all of their products are going to go up by 25% to 50%.”On the importing side, there is agreement that this is an inopportune moment for the wine industry to face new headwinds. Wine consumption has steadily declined in the United States in recent years as gen Z and millennial consumers are turning to cannabis, hard seltzers and spirits such as tequila, or simply embracing sobriety in greater numbers.“Unfortunately, the reality is that wine consumption was already down before this compared to what it was five years ago,” said Reynolds. “This obviously doesn’t help that. So, with more tariffs, you would start to see a greater shift of behaviors away from drinking wine.”But despite slumping sales and the impending tariff threats, niche importers like Tamers say they have little choice but to stay the course. “You leave yourself vulnerable, but if you don’t buy wine, then you don’t have any wine to sell. So, it’s a double-edged sword,” he said. “Our customers are still asking for these products, so there’s not much else we can do.”Aneff hopes that commonsense negotiations will lead to both parties divorcing alcohol tariffs from other trade disputes over aluminum, steel and digital services.“I do have some hope for a potential sectoral agreement on wine, and perhaps spirits, which would benefit domestic producers and huge numbers of small businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,” he said. “I can’t think of anything that would bring more joy to people’s glasses than ensuring free trade on wine.”Explore more on these topicsWineOur unequal earthTrump tariffsTrump administrationFoodUS politicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Between them, a two-tonne replica of a pilot whale gently rocks in the swell.On the sand, another group pours buckets of water over a replica dolphin, while some dig away the sand from beneath its fins. Occasionally, a trainer reminds students to stand back from the tail – if this were a real animal the tail could deliver an unexpected blow.The animals are so life-like beachgoers run to check on them, prompting assurances from trainers they are just models to teach people how to respond if a whale or dolphin strands.New Zealand is aglobal hotspot for whale strandings, with hundreds beaching along the country’s extensive coastline each year. In most countries, strandings are primarily managed by government agencies but in New Zealand, a unique cultural phenomenon plays out – a vast nationwide network of trained volunteers leaps into action to assist in the rescue of stranded whales.View image in fullscreenIn 2022, about 500 pilot whales died in mass stranding on New Zealand’s remote Chatham Islands.Photograph: Tamzin Henderson/Courtesy of Tamzin Henderson/AFP/Getty ImagesThe volunteers put their lives on hold and work with officials who lead the whale rescues, which can require hundreds of hands on deck.Once named world’s ugliest animal, blobfish wins New Zealand’s fish of the yearRead moreMark Rounce, a wastewater engineer from nearby Nelson, is one of New Zealand’s most dedicated rescue volunteers.His journey as a helper began one summer evening a decade ago, when 200 pilot whales stranded at New Zealand’s notorious “whale trap” – a long narrow spit at the top of the South Island, where mass strandings are frequent.Over the next few days, more than 500 people – families, tourists and marine specialists – gathered and attempted to re-float the ink-black animals dotting the shallows like polished obsidian.Rounce and his daughterwere among them, despite never having attended a stranding before. They tended to a whale for hours – cooling it with water and making it comfortable. When it came time to re-float the animal, they did not have the appropriate gear and as such, were ordered off the beach before the rescue was finished.“For days afterwards I was quite shaken up – did my whale survive?” he recalls. The experience prompted Rounce and his daughter to sign up for a one-day course that would equip them with the knowledge to see a whale rescue through.View image in fullscreenMark Rounce at Project Jonah’s whale rescue workshop in Scorching Bay, Wellington in March 2025.Photograph: Mark Coote/Photo © Mark CooteSince then, Rounce has attended nine strandings and volunteers his time to help Project Jonah – a charity that trains marine mammal medics and advocates for the marine environment. It works closely alongside the Department of Conservation to respond to strandings. More than 5,000 New Zealanders have taken Project Jonah’s one-day course so they can assist in strandings.“You get all walks of life turning up,” Rounce says. “No one asks what your political views are, or what your religion is, everyone just wants to pitch in and help.“If the world could live like we do when we’re involved in a stranding, we would have no problems.”New Zealand was one of the first countries to pioneer rescue and response programmes for strandings, says Louisa Hawkes, a biologist and one of two full-time staff running Project Jonah. This legacy, alongside the unique volunteer-based model, makes New Zealand’s stranding response internationally renowned, she says.“I don’t know of many courses where you can go from not knowing the head or tail of a whale, to being able to help look after a whale and empower people to do the same in a day,” she says.Overseas, a stranding is deemed large if its 10-30 animals, Hawkes says. “For us its over a hundred.” Responding to such events would be impossible without the hundreds of volunteers, she says.“We are still grass roots – we couldn’t do this without people who are willing to put their life on pause and help.”View image in fullscreenProject Jonah whale rescuers pick up skills at the workshop at Scorching Bay.Photograph: Mark Coote/Photo © Mark CooteIn some cases, scientists are able to determine why a whale has stranded, be it illness or injury. But in many events it is unclear and pinpointing the reasons why is an ongoing field of research, says Karen Stockin, marine ecology professor at Massey University.In New Zealand, the long coastline, a large diversity of whale and dolphin species and long-sloping coastal geography can contribute. Social and behavioural factors can also play a role – if a head of a pod becomes disoriented, others may follow.Stockin says researchers also regularly look to whether human activity is a factor, be it from underwater disturbances by ships, or nutritional distress that may be linked to over-fishing or climate change.New Zealand has “a gumboots-and-all response to whale strandings,” Stockin says. She puts this down to the population’s close proximity to the ocean and desire to spend time at the beach over summer, which also coincides with the peak stranding season.“It is a cultural thing, there is no doubt about that.”View image in fullscreenA Project Jonah whale rescue workshop under way at Scorching Bay, Wellington.Photograph: Mark CooteBack on the beach of Scorching Bay, university student Maia Horn tells the Guardian that as a marine biology major she has longed to complete Project Jonah’s training. But her reasons are also personal.Whales are considered a “taonga” species for Māori, meaning they are a sacred treasure of cultural significance. Horn’s family is from the small, predominately Māori, North Island community Whāngārā, where The Whale Rider – Witi Ihimaera’s novel and its film adaptation - is set.“Whales have a special significance for me … subconsciously along the way, I think that [Whāngārā] connection was motivating me.”New volunteer Pablo Wolinski wanted to become a medic so he could give something back to the ocean.“Here, we rely on others,” he says. “Everyone steps up to help … including for other creatures.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandSeascape: the state of our oceansWhalesOceansMarine lifeCetaceansAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Part of the Tuareg population had taken up arms alongside groups linked to al-Qaidato fight for an independent statein northern Mali, as several jihadist groups spread throughout Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, pitting different communities against each other.“When we arrived in Bamako, we met people who had not met people like us – the Tuareg from the north – before,” said Mitta. “That was more than 10 years ago.

But Mitta and his band dare not leave Bamako. “If the jihadists ever occupy the city again, artists will be among the first victims,” he said.In the past four years, three military regimes have come to power in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso through coups born out of frustration with the failure of the French-led military campaign, Operation Barkhane, to contain the spread of jihadist groups in the Sahel. TheFrench withdrew their forces in 2022after nine years of fighting the Islamists.When the Economic Community of West and CentralAfrica(Ecowas) imposed economic and monetary sanctions, and threatened to intervene militarily in Niger to force the juntas to hold elections and restore civilian rule, the three countries came together to form their own bloc: the Alliance of Sahel States (AES).In January, theAES states withdrew from Ecowas, aiming for greater military, economic and cultural sovereignty.View image in fullscreenAn army band playing at the opening of the new Kôrè Museum, which drew ministers from the AES states of Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali.Photograph: Mohamed Aguissa HamaThe political backdrop added weight to the theme of this year’s festival of “cultural diversity, peace and unity”.The military regimes of the AES states sent a senior delegation of ministers and envoys to the festival, where Col Maj Ismaël Wagué, one of the Malian junta members, told the crowd: “From Mauritania to Chad, our shared culture and diversity can be a binding force if we choose to embrace it.”Mali’s foreign minister, Abdoulaye Diop, told visitors at the opening of the new Kôrè museum in Ségou: “Just as the European Union works toward a common identity to prevent disintegration, we too see the importance of this for the alliance of our countries.”View image in fullscreenPerformers at Segou’Art, which brought together artists and musicians from across the disparate region.Photograph: Aboubacar Traore/ReutersAfter the ministers left, visitors crowded round Abdoulaye Konaté, an artist whose internationally acclaimed canvases are on display at the museum. “For me, this festival is like a library, a place and yearly event where we can share knowledge and dialogue about what matters to us.

He whirled around in circles, hollering something unintelligible. In a familiar scene – I have small children of my own – his mother tried to impose order, but yielded to the greater force of a kid on sugar kept indoors by a cold snap.Elias, his five-year-old sister Taline and nine-year-old brother Khaled were in the US because Elias and Taline needed urgent medical care. They had sustained staggering injuries when an Israeli pilot or drone operator shot a missile at the house they were taking refuge in. The explosion cleaved Elias’s right leg off below the knee. Taline’s injuries were also severe; she arrived in the US with external fixators – pins and steel in her legs – as she battled infection. A program organized and managed byHeal Palestine, a non-profit that helps evacuate wounded children from Gaza, arranged the children’s travel with their mother, Amna.When we met, Taline shied away from me, withdrawing into a large sofa. She peeked out from behind copious bangs while I talked with a volunteer from the organization, which had secured housing for the family for the duration of their stay in the US. Once the children’s treatment is completed, perhaps by the summer, their mother said, the family will have to leave the US for Egypt, a stipulation of the state department.Their father, Amna’s husband, was still trapped in Gaza – he hoped to join the family in Egypt whenever the Rafah border reopens, now a distant possibility with Israel resuming its assault. In Egypt, their rights and access to education will be limited. The Egyptian government has indicated that Palestinians who have taken refuge in the country will have to return to Gaza, an uncertain prospect even beforeDonald Trumppronounced his intention to cleanse the territory of Palestinians. The question of what the children’s futures would be like – what kind of future was possible – cast a long shadow over our time together.Taline was unable to walk well – her doctors in the US had tried to repair her legs hoping to avoid amputation, which remains a possibility. Elias had been fitted with a prosthesis, enabling him to move around the home. He was boisterous, and when I played back a recording of my conversation with his mother, Amna, his voice – his shouts and laughter – acted as counterpoint to the horrors Amna was describing.Khaled, the nine-year-old, was different. He had been trapped with his father in Gaza’s al-Shifa hospital for three days during Israel’s second siege of the facility in March 2024; Taline and Elias had already been evacuated south to Rafah with Amna by that time. Khaled watched as Israeli troops killed people at the hospital. He watched, too, when his father was beaten, stripped and dragged off to the beach, where he was interrogated for two days. Israeli troops bulldozed the nearby cemetery, and when Khaled was compelled to leave on the third day of the siege, he picked his way, with all the other surviving women and children, through a field of corpses.He was, his mother told me, suffering from emotional issues.View image in fullscreenElias and Taline, who both sustained injuries in a missile strike in Gaza.Photograph: Hannah Yoon/The GuardianI had sought the family out – and others like them – to begin to piece together what had happened to the children of Gaza. Before October 2023, kids accounted for roughly half of the 2 million Palestinians there. Official figures put the death toll in Gaza at more than 50,000 people,a number that continues to climb as Israel renews its attacks. But a study in the Lancet estimates that Israeli troops killed more than64,000people in just the first nine months of their rampage, the time for which the study’s authors had data. In other words, the official count is probably dramatically understated.Meanwhile, the UN reports that at least14,500 childrenhave been killed – also probably a dramatic undercount. The real mortality figure is probably unknowable, not least because somany familieshave been killed at once, leaving no one to account for some babies or toddlers ever having existed.Beyond the mass death, international agencies suggest that at least110,000 people in Gazahave been injured, including at least25,000 children. And Unicefestimatesthat between 3,000 and 4,000 children in Gaza have had one or more limbs amputated. That small tract of earth is now home to more child amputees per inhabitant than anywhere else in the world.Much of what these kids are experiencing is hidden from the world – journalists still cannot enter Gaza, and many of those who called the place homehave been killed. Yet, a handful of children have made it out for treatment, in the US and elsewhere.In the United States a life-changing injury doesn’t mean the end of a life worth living. Laws are in place to ensure people with disabilities enjoy equal rights and opportunities. For those with insurance, there is advanced medical infrastructure with follow-up care.But what does an amputation mean in a place with no sidewalks, no streets or wheelchair ramps or prosthetists? What promise can the future hold for children who have sustained brain injuries, or burns that destroy their ability to maneuver or function? What kinds of outcomes will exist for children who have no access to psychologists, physical therapists, legal rights – or homes?The many thousands of injured children are important. Yet together, their bodies tell a story, one that has been embossed for all time on the terrain of the 21st century. They act as the prism through which questions of international law and the protection of the vulnerable will be mediated. But if the loss these children have endured is a judgment, it is also prologue. Because their needs, their capacities and limitations, will define the contours of Palestinian society and memory forever.Amna seemed wary of me initially. But as she spoke the words came more freely.She had survived multiple Israeli wars on Gaza, and had lived through an 18-year siege. Then came the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, and Israel’s devastating response.Before then, Amna recalled, life was hard, but home “was my heaven, too”. She was pregnant when the assault on Gaza began, and she delivered Faris by cesarean section on 11 December 2023.Ten days later, an Israeli pilot fired a missile at her apartment building. In past wars, her neighborhood in Jabalia had been spared. “The area where we were was supposed to be safe,” Amna told me.Amna, Khaled and Taline sustained deep cuts in that first assault, and required stitches – in Taline’s case, to close lacerations on her arm and head. A neighbor provided the address of a nurse who lived nearby. The family fled the rubble and made their way to her home.“We got to the house. It was overflowing with displaced people. I can’t tell you how many. There were so many people,” Amna said.The nurse stitched the open wounds on Taline’s arm and head. She explained that the laceration in Taline’s arm was deep and would require internal stitches, something she was unable to do. She also told Amna that the little girl’s arm was broken.The entire time, the bombing continued. Soon after the nurse finished treating Taline, a second explosive struck, killing 11 people at the nurse’s home.“The walls disappeared. You can’t see anything. You swallow the dust. You can’t hear anything,” Amna recalled.“My first shock came when I saw [Faris]. He was in my arms. He was choking. I thought he was dead. But he hadn’t died. Someone took him from me and shook him and he began to scream. My baby who died. He was alive then.”Skin is the body’s largest organ, made of fat and protein. The top layer, the epidermis, is where melanin is formed and where new skin cells are made. Humans wear new skin – the whole is renewed – every month. But not in the case of injury, particularly one caused by fire.View image in fullscreenTaline may have another surgery scheduled in the spring, an attempt to save her leg.Photograph: Hannah Yoon/The GuardianThe Cleveland Clinic offers aguideto burn injuries. First-degree burns are what we experience after touching a hot kettle. The damage caused by the heat is superficial, and the skin recovers quickly. Second-degree burns mean the “top and middle” layers of the skin are damaged. The next degree of severity – third-degree burns – touches the third layer of skin and thin layer of fat just beneath it.A fourth-degree burn goes into the muscle and gristle, the nerves. Muscle is roasted by the fifth degree. Sixth-degree burns scorch bone.In Gaza, the extraordinary incidence of amputations is explained not only by the traumatic force injuries caused by relentless Israeli bombardment, but burns and resulting infections as well. Many amputations should not have been necessary.Dr Feroze Sidhwa, speaking from Gaza, said that he saw many children lose limbs that could have been saved under other circumstances. He cited the destructiveness of the weapons, the high rates of infection given the sanitary conditions at hospitals, the scarcity of necessary medical equipment, and malnutrition as leading contributors to amputation.“It’s very difficult to heal a wound when you have no protein intake for a week, let alone for 15 months,” he saidDr Thaer Ahmad, another doctor who operated in Gaza, explained that treating burns requires a lot of resources that were often unavailable. In ordinary circumstances, he said, a physician may be willing to tolerate an infection that results from a burn, since infections can typically be treated.“But given the pressure that’s being put on the health system and practitioners in Gaza, an amputation is a relatively quick treatment than can be done,” he said.We may never learn how many children had treatable wounds that, in different circumstances, may have resulted in their keeping a limb.Baylasan was 11 when her house was bombed in Khan Younis. We met in a suburb of Washington DC in December 2024, near where she was receiving treatment.“I’m afraid of loud noises,” she said.She told me about the first nights of the war in Gaza, in October 2023. A missile exploded nearby one evening: “I woke up and started screaming. My mother came to comfort me. I was afraid; I was shaking.”The night of her injury, in November of 2023, her mother had made her a cheese sandwich before bed.“At nine or 10 I went to sleep – I didn’t feel anything until 2am. I heard Mama screaming under the rubble. I didn’t know I was under the rubble.”She lost consciousness and awoke four days later in the hospital, unaware that her leg had been amputated.“Every time someone would sit by my leg I would scream thinking they would injure it.”View image in fullscreenBaylasan lost her leg when her house in Khan Younis was bombed.Photograph: HandoutBaylasan – vivacious, funny and sarcastic – stood out when we spoke. She was the only child I met who wasn’t accompanied by a guardian. She was alone in Virginia, staying with a Palestinian-American family who volunteered through Heal Palestine to host her. She’d made friends at school, and was learning English. When I asked about her favorite music she lit up. She loved Al Shami, a pop singer from Syria.Baylasan’s mother survived that bombing, and after being evacuated for treatment in Turkey with Baylasan, had traveled to Belgium. Baylasan’s brother had been studying there when the assault on Gaza began. He had succeeded in obtaining a visa for their mother, who traveled there after Baylasan departed for the US. The family hopes to receive asylum in Belgium, a process that could take18 months.When we met, Baylasan was completing intensive physical therapy at the Prosthetic Care Facility of Virginia. Her father remained in Gaza, where an amputation virtually guarantees a life of social isolation, no access to support services, and limited opportunity for emotional recovery.When I asked Baylasan whether her father had the means to join the family in Belgium, she gave me an exasperated look; it was a stupid question.“Raho al masary. Inharago.”The money’s gone. It burned.Gaza was a difficult place before October of 2023. My ownmemoriesof life there – I was born in Rafah – are imbued with a feeling of closeness, of being hemmed in. For many people, education was the only path to a better life, which perhaps helps explain why literacy rates in Gaza exceeded 97.8% for adults. The degree of educational attainment was also reflected in therelatively well-developedmedical infrastructure in the territory.Doctors Without Bordersreports that before the Israeli assault, there were 36 hospitals serving 2.3 million residents in Gaza – one for every 60,500 people. People in the US havemore access– one hospital for every 23,500 people – but the development of the healthcare sector surpassed what could be reasonably expected in light of Israel’s longstanding siege on the impoverished territory.Today, most of that infrastructure no longer exists. Gaza’sreconstructionwill require more than $50bn over 10 years, according to a UN, EU and World Bank assessment. That’s saying nothing about the lost human capital, the doctors and nurses and the people who educate and train them. The Guardianreportsthat more than 1,000 healthcare professionals were killed by the Israeli military. Of Gaza’s 36 hospitals, only 16 are partially functioning today, according to aUN report. If critically injured, disabled people in Gaza could lead dignified, productive lives before 2023, that no longer seems possible.Organizations like Heal Palestine and thePalestine Children’s Relief Fundhave worked assiduously, against long odds in challenging conditions, to meet some of the need. Steve Sosebee, who leads Heal Palestine, described the organization’s work as comprehensive. Its staff operate a field hospital in Gaza. They also manage a mental health program and food kitchens there. The organization has also facilitated the evacuation of and care for 37 severely injured children. It continues to provide mental healthcare even after their physical wounds have healed.“We get them the medical care that they need but otherwise don’t have access to,” Sosebee explained. “We’re also providing a holistic approach to their healing which is mental health therapy, education and community support.”View image in fullscreenTaline and Elias play together in their room at their current residence in Philadelphia.Photograph: Hannah Yoon/The GuardianMany of those who escaped Gaza for medical treatment – including the 11 children I met with in the US and Egypt – did so before Israeli troops overran the Rafah border with Egypt in May of last year. Their petitions for medical evacuation involved a long chain of coordination through the health ministry in Gaza, the Egyptian government, the World Health Organization and the Israeli army. Typically they traveled to the Rafah border with Egypt and from there were loaded into ambulances which then undertook the six-hour drive from the border to Cairo.I met Marah and her mother, Amal, in Long Island. They were staying at a Ronald McDonald House, a facility that houses families with children who require long-term care, near the hospital where Marah was being treated.Marah, who is one of seven children, was 16 when an Israeli bomb struck her aunt’s house in Al-Shaboura, in Rafah, where she was sheltering. Both of her legs had been amputated above the knee, near her pelvis.In New York, Marah had numerous surgeries to prepare her for prosthesis. When we met, she was learning to walk – a process which is markedly more difficult for those with amputations above the knee. Her days are filled with physical therapy and more physical therapy, as she put it to me.The family’s nightmare began early, and like virtually everyone else I spoke with, continued until they left Gaza.In October 2023, an Israeli airstrike destroyed the family home in Al Zeitoun in northern Gaza, sending them to seek shelter in Marah’s aunt’s home. Eight days later, another bomb killed her brother, her sister, her brother-in-law; and one of her sister’s young daughters.Marah lost both legs after an Israeli bomb struck her aunt’s house in Rafah.Photograph: HandoutAnother niece, a 15-month-old child named Mona, survived the bombing with serious injuries. The family took Mona with them and fled south to the home of another one of Marah’s aunts in Rafah. At 3am, two months after arriving, the bombers struck again. A missile exploded in the room where Marah was sleeping with Mona.The toddler was killed in that bombing, joining her mother, father and baby sister in death.“I remember waking up briefly in the rubble and calling for my father. I thought he hadn’t heard me and I said theshehada[an Islamic prayer] three times and after that I don’t have any memory of the next two or three weeks,” Marah told me.Marah’s legs were badly lacerated and mangled; she had multiple fractures and a head injury. She was taken to a hospital which, lacking resources, directed her rescuers to another hospital.Overwhelmed staff at the second hospital believed she was dead and moved her to the morgue.“My [surviving] brother – he’s three years older than I am. He came close to say goodbye to me and came close to my face and saw that I was breathing. He told the doctor: ‘She’s breathing.’”Marah was in a coma for eight days, during which her doctors amputated her legs.Marah’s mother, Amal, was also severely wounded in the strike that injured her daughter. She made a point of serving me coffee despite her difficulty walking.“I had 22 operations,” Amal told me. “The fleshhad meltedoff my legs.”Amal spent eight months at theEmiratihospital – a field hospital in Rafah, which was operating through the efforts of the UAE. She decided to leave, despite needing additional care, when she learned that Marah would be able to travel to New York for treatment through Heal Palestine. After extensive back and forth with Israeli and international officials, Marah succeeded in obtaining permission to leave. Heal Palestine coordinated her travel and care by enlisting the services of various hospitals and charities, and raising funds for travel. Marah’s father and brother remained in Gaza.View image in fullscreenTaline and Elias’s wheelchairs.Photograph: Hannah Yoon/The GuardianMarah and Amal will eventually have to travel to Egypt from New York, where they will await their return to Gaza.I asked Amal about her hopes for her daughter’s future.“There is no future in Gaza for someone like Marah,” she told me, gesturing to her daughter in her wheelchair. “I want her to complete her education.”I traveled to Cairo to meet children who had been injured and were receiving care there. I wanted to see too, what life could be like for Marah, Elias, Khaled and Taline, all of whom are meant to go to Egypt after completing treatment in the US.I met Malik, a little eight-year-old boy who had suffered a severe head injury when his home in Gaza was bombed, in a suburb of Cairo. He had been evacuated to the US where doctors had performed a cranioplasty – a titanium plate covered most of the back of his head. After three months of treatment in Florida, he and his mother returned to Egypt in August of last year. Malik slurred his speech but had learned to walk again by the time we met – he accompanied me to the store to buy chocolate for him and his sisters.Ibtisam, Malik’s mother, described pulling him from the rubble from an airstrike on their home in Nuseirat on 8 January 2024.“I called for my girls; they were screaming and crying. It was dark – you couldn’t see anything. I called for Malik but he didn’t respond,” she said.“I started feeling around in the dark … I found a pile of hot rubble and glass. I started to uncover him there. I pulled him out and was cut by glass. I held him. He was awake but he wasn’t responding to me. I cradled his head with my hand and my hand went inside – into his head.”Malik, left, suffered a severe head injury when his house in Gaza was bombed.Photograph: HandoutProspects for a life in Egypt are better for those with life-altering injuries than they are in Gaza, but public infrastructure there cannot truly support the needs of disabled people.I spoke with a developmental neuroscientist who leads a lab at a large research university in Philadelphia. He requested anonymity because of his lab’sreliance on fundingprovided by the National Institutes of Health, which is at risk under the Trump administration.“[Brain development] is a process of refining cellular connections postnatally,” he explained.“Kids’ brains are remarkably resilient and can recover from things that adult brains never could … but there is a limit to the ability to repair and rewire around injuries.”Brain-injured patients need years of support from “trained physical therapists and occupational therapists and physicians to really maximize the amount of recovery [they] can get”, he said. That’s in addition to the child psychologists who are tasked with addressing the post-traumatic stress disorders that attend trauma.Dr Hazem Madi, a Palestinian doctor from Gaza who managed to escape to Cairo in February 2024, explained that while private hospitals in the Egyptian capital can meet a high standard of care, many public hospitals cannot. Access to occupational therapists and child psychologists is limited as well.An Amnesty International reportelaborates: “Egypt’s public healthcare system has been struggling with a shortage of public hospital beds, offering only 1.4 beds per 1,000 people, which is significantly below the global average of 2.9 beds per 1,000 people.” In that regard, Malik is more fortunate than others. Heal Palestine has facilitated his ongoing mental and physical therapy in Cairo.Beyond medical care, Egyptian authorities do not permit Palestinian refugees from Gaza –roughly 100,000people – to register their children in public school. Malik and his sisters were attending school remotely – teachers in Gaza had succeeded in organizing virtual learning, albeit haphazardly and unevenly.Nor can the challenge of earning a living be overstated. Malik’s family rely on Heal Palestine for housing – the organization rents an apartment for them in 6 October City near Cairo. But the aid won’t last forever, and Palestinians in Egypt lack residency permits andcannot work. Their status is, like so much about their lives, precarious.Amna, the young mother I met in Philadelphia, searched frantically for her husband and children after the strike at the nurse’s home.“When I saw them I was shocked. Elias’s leg was gone. Taline looked … Her legs were mangled. Shredded. They were going to die. I collapsed. Khaled carried his brother out and he returned and carried his sister out. Can you imagine a nine-year-old in that situation?”Her husband sustained a leg injury too. The family spent a night in the stairwell. The ambulance never came – no one would risk the drive to Jabalia. Tourniquets kept the children alive through the night.View image in fullscreenElias in his room in Philadelphia.Photograph: Hannah Yoon/The Guardian“All night – I want you to imagine – all night. My kids are saying I need water. Please give me water. All night. The bombing was going all night. It wouldn’t stop.”The area was bombed again in the morning. Someone suggested they try to evacuate to a nearby school.“Everyone said we have to go. Everyone was fleeing from death. My husband couldn’t stand. How was I going to move my children? I said I’m not going anywhere. I can’t leave Elias and Taline.”A stranger came along and offered to carry Elias and Taline. He helped make crutches from discarded wood for Amna’s husband and encouraged him to try to walk. The school was no more than 200 meters away.Amna started to walk, which was difficult since she had given birth by C-section 10 days earlier.“There were people in front of me,” she said. “They had their kids. They were shelled. Limbs. Things that I still can’t comprehend. Those people wanted to enter the school and they were killed … The soldiers shelled them.”Amna fled into a nearby house and was separated from her husband, who was with Taline and Elias. She remained with Khaled and her infant, Faris. “I didn’t know if Elias and Taline were alive or dead. If my husband was dead.”Elias and Taline found refuge with their father at al-Shifa hospital. They received basic care, keeping them alive.Amna spent two days in hiding until the Israeli troops withdrew. Finally, she left with her baby and son Khaled, who carried a makeshift white flag. They emerged into a new landscape.“We were barefoot. Everything was destroyed. No school. No hospital. The landmarks – it wasn’tJabaliaany more.”Eventually, she made her way to al-Shifa, the last operating hospital in the area. There, she found her husband with Elias and Taline.“They were on the ground. The crowd was unbelievable. People stepping on one another. My children were on the ground.“I gave the doctor my infant. He said to me: ‘Your son needs oxygen’ – there was none. ‘Try to nurse him – hold him.’“I understood. My son was going to die. Hours or a day or two – he was going to die. Six hours later he died. Faris died. He was 12 days old.”Amna buried Faris in the Shifa cemetery, the one Khaled would walk through after it had been bulldozed by Israeli forces.Soon after Faris died, an ambulance drove Amna, Taline and Elias south to another hospital in Rafah. Weeks later, she secured permission to leave Gaza with Elias. An Egyptian border guard was moved by Taline’s condition and said he would let her out too. Soon after that, Khaled was allowed to travel south in an ambulance with a cousin who had been injured. Eventually, he was permitted to join his mother in Cairo.The children’s father stayed behind in Jabalia, which was bombed again this month.I met Baylasan in December of 2024. In March, I learned that she had been reunited with her mother and brother in Belgium, where Heal Palestine is providing them with housing. For now, Baylasan is completing her physical therapy treatment virtually. When it’s time she will travel back to Virginia for a new prosthesis. Baylasan’s father remains in Gaza.Marah and her mother were supposed to leave for Egypt in March, but the severity of Marah’s injuries led her doctors to conclude that she needed at least another nine months of therapy and treatment in the US. She’s now studying for a high school equivalency exam.View image in fullscreenKhaled, left, Taline, and Elias. The three siblings are enrolled in school in Philadelphia.Photograph: Hannah Yoon/The GuardianElias, Taline and Khaled are enrolled in school in Philadelphia. Taline may have another surgery scheduled in the spring, an attempt to save her leg.In November of 2024 – the same month I first visited Marah – hundreds of Israelis traveled to Amsterdam to watch a football match. They received a lot of attention when they attacked, and were attacked by, locals there. Yet in all the reporting, one provocation stood out to me: the Israeli visitorssang: “Why is school out in Gaza”?And they answered: “There are no children left.”Almost all of the small children I met in the course of writing this story carried haunted looks. I asked them things like “What are your hobbies?” and “What’s your favorite show on television?” and I was met, mostly, by blankness. Beyond their physical injuries, they have experienced unspeakable loss. Their schools, their neighborhoods are gone. Many of their loved ones, siblings and friends are now dead.If childhood is a time of innocence, small hurts and joys, playground anxieties and high drama, then, the Israeli fans, for all their venom, were right. There is no childhood in Gaza."

Photograph: Marie Hald/The GuardianThe Black Swan follows a repentant master criminal as she sets up corrupt clients in front of hidden cameras. But is she really reformed–and is the director up to his own tricks?BySamanth SubramanianThu 27 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 27 Mar 2025 06.07 EDTShareThe trap was laid in a rented office: two rooms in downtown Copenhagen, furnished without a whisper of Scandi style. If it wasn’t for a Frida Kahlo print on one wall, the premises might have felt as impersonal and stark as a confessional. That, in any event, was what it became. For six months, beginning in mid-2022, a parade of people – members of motorcycle gangs, entrepreneurs, lawyers, real-estate barons, politicians – trooped through to recount their sins to Amira Smajic. They didn’t come for expiation. They knew Smajic to be one of them – an outlaw, and in her particular case, a business lawyer so skilled at laundering money that she’d enabled a couple of billion kroner in financial crime over the previous decade. They called her the Ice Queen, because she showed not a flicker of regret for what she did.In her office, Smajic’s visitors bragged about dodging tax, bribing officials or exploiting the bankruptcy code. She offered them coffee and coaxed forth their confidences. Six cameras and three microphones, secreted in power sockets, captured it all – footage that was turned into a documentary called The Black Swan. In its surreptitious method and breathtaking drama, The Black Swan bore all the fingerprints of its director, Mads Brügger, a provocateur who has spent his career searching for bombshells to drop but who had never quite managed it as well as he did here. Denmark’s national bird is theCygnus olor, a swan as white as virtue. The Black Swan, in showing such easy, unbridled formulations of crime, blew up Denmark’s idea of itself.Since airing last May as a five-part series on TV2, Denmark’s biggest television network, The Black Swan has sent the country into convulsions. One out of every two Danes has seen the documentary. After its release, a biker-gang member and his accountant were charged with financial crimes and taken into custody; others, including a municipal official, are under investigation. The Danish Bar and Law Society formally apologised to the minister of justice for the conduct of two lawyers caught on camera; they have been either fired or disbarred. A new money-laundering law was introduced to give banks more oversight over “client accounts” – the kind of accounts in which lawyers pool the funds of several clients and transact on their behalf, and that featured in many of the machinations in Smajic’s office. In her New Year’s speech, Denmark’s prime minister suggested biker-gang criminals ought to be stripped of their pension rights – a detail so specific it was surely inspired by The Black Swan.Other Scandinavian nations also reeled upon watching The Black Swan. After the series premiered in Sweden, a criminologist at Lund University warned: “There’s a lot of evidence that it’s probably even worse here.” Norwegian civil servants invited Brügger to Oslo in January to talk to them about money-laundering. All of Scandinavia, he believes, has persuaded itself that crime exists only in violent, poor abscesses on the edges of their societies. “The Danes totally subscribe to this idea that Denmark has no corruption, and to the idea of Denmark as the end of the road,” Brügger said, referring to the political scientist Francis Fukuyama’s notion that “getting to Denmark” is the goal of every modern democracy. “The Black Swan punctured that hallucination,” Brügger said. “It was Denmark’s red-pill moment.”Sitting in the Copenhagen offices of Frihedsbrevet, or Freedom Letter, an investigative journalism site Brügger co-founded in 2021, I asked him what ordinarily passes for corruption in Denmark. He thought about it for a comically long time. During his boyhood, he recalled, one major scandal involved a small-town mayor being bribed with a bathroom renovation for his home. In 2011, Danish newspapers carried as front-page news the revelation that the prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, was leasing her car from Germany, saving €20 a month and depriving the exchequer of €70 a month in tax. Brügger had told a Greek friend about this brouhaha; the friend stared at him and said: “Back home, we’re talking about a politician who was given an entire island as a bribe.” Brügger also related a Frihedsbrevet scoop: Copenhagen’s leading newspaper editors had been attending a Proust book club run by a government official, a degree of socialising that Brügger characterised as unhealthy. This was, he was suggesting, the scale of grift Danes were used to – chump-change tax avoidance and highbrow hobnobbing – until The Black Swan came along.But he was embroidering for effect. There have been graver controversies: a stock price manipulation scheme in 2008; a money-laundering caseinvolving Danske Bank; a $1bn tax fraud case that ended in a 12-year prison sentence for its mastermind last December. Michael Bang Petersen, a political scientist at Aarhus University who studies trust in Danish society, told me that citizens’ trust in politicians has fallen by 20 percentage points since 2007. But their trust in fellow citizens has stayed stable. When asked if they can trust most people, an astonishing 80% of Danes reply in the affirmative. Lawyers, roasted as rogues practically everywhere, enjoy a glowing reputation in Denmark, and the welfare state is revered, as inviolable as a cathedral.“We’re taught from a young age that cheating the system is not something you do, because you end up pissing on everybody,” Ane Cortzen, a television presenter and Brügger’s sister, told me. “Cheating on taxes is one of the most serious crimes you can commit.” Kalle Johannes Rose, an associate professor at Copenhagen Business School, observed: “Most Danish scandals have to do with the state – public healthcare, public banks, public something or the other. People want to know their high taxes are being spent correctly. If they don’t trust the system, they don’t pay their taxes, and then the house of cards falls down.” The Black Swan thus invited viewers to dwell on their worst nightmare: a shattering of the trust that underpins not just the smooth functioning of their beloved welfare state but the essence of what makes Danes proud to be Danes.Amira Smajic wears her dark hair pulled back so tightly that her skin tightens around her high cheekbones. It lends her the severe, credible look of a schoolteacher, doubtless an asset during her years of crime. In her first job after university, at an accounting firm, Smajic quickly sensed they were skating close to the edge of the law. Her employer was subsequentlyconvictedof fraud and forgery – but by then, Smajic had struck out on her own, working with Denmark’s biker gangs, which are notorious for criminality and violence. “I specialised in making accounts look as needed – getting white money to turn black and vice versa,” she says in the film. For these services, she earned several hundred thousand kroner a month. “I shopped in Louis Vuitton every week. I bought shoes like other people buy milk.”View image in fullscreenAmira Smajic in a still from The Black Swan.Photograph: Wingman Media/TV2 DenmarkIn 2020, wearying of the paranoia and guilt of this delinquent life, Smajic thought of going public – through a book, perhaps, or a film. Having met several publishers and journalists, she eventually found her way to Brügger, and she commanded every shred of his attention. Over sushi, she told him so much about her connections with the criminal underworld that “she was clearly the real deal”, Brügger told me. He was instantly smitten, in that half-ardent, half-extractive way that journalists are with their subjects.Brügger and TV2 first considered investigating the old contracts, emails and texts in Smajic’s files. But Michael Nørgaard, TV2’s editor-in-chief, said he was aware that Smajic had spent years engaging in fraud and forgery. “Could we believe that the materials she came to us with were intact – that she didn’t take out documents to put her in a better light?” he wondered. The idea to open a new office and clandestinely film its operations, Brügger and Nørgaard told me, came from Smajic. In a 2021 email, which Brügger showed me, Smajic excitedly laid out five pages of plans to monetise her past: articles, newsletters, podcasts, an eight-part true-crime show, the documentary, four books, the full panoply of a repentance empire. The arc, Smajic wrote, referring to herself in the third person, would be of “her social and moral redress”.Brügger says he believed her. Smajic had come to Denmark as a child refugee from Bosnia, along with her family, and on one occasion she told Brügger that her father, who’d died of cancer, would have been disappointed that she’d turned to crime after Denmark had taken her in. “I will never get out of this life if I do nothing,” Smajic says in the first episode, with the air of a woman plotting to burn a bridge even as she flees over it. Before filming began, a security expert talked Smajic through the consequences of making the documentary, Brügger told me. “He didn’t spare her. He said she may have to relocate to another country, change her name, or not see her friends any more. She was crying, and I thought: ‘OK, that’s it. She’s out.’ But she insisted on continuing.”Brügger and Nørgaard knew one more thing about Smajic. She was at the time, and had been for years, a police informant. On her request, they withheld that from the documentary – but they also didn’t let the police know in advance about the trap they were setting. In a brief contract, drafted at the outset of production and barely two pages long, Brügger’s producer, Peter Engel, stipulated that Smajic would be paid 30,000 kroner (roughly £3,350) a month. Engel said she also agreed to refrain from any actual criminal activity during production. In the opening minutes of The Black Swan, sitting across a desk from Smajic in a room resembling an interrogation chamber, Brügger asks her what the worst outcome of her undertaking could be. She replies: “That someone finds out and I will be liquidated before any of this is shown.”The suspense of whether Smajic will be unmasked keeps The Black Swan as taut as a bowstring. The documentary’s more immediate shocks come from watching people methodically plan to break the law. The crimes range from the paltry to the serious. A man named Wassem, to whom Smajic introduces herself in the first episode, runs a shawarma shop and wants to skip out on tax. Fasar Abrar Raja, a grey-bearded member of a motorcycle gang called Bandidos, helps demolition crews dispose of asbestos and other toxic material without the costly safety measures the law requires. For a fee, he will bribe environmental analysts and local officials to look the other way while he dumps the material in the Danish countryside. Fasar also brings along Martin Malm, a smooth-faced businessman who launders millions of kroner a month through his “invoice factories”: companies that issue fake invoices for services never rendered. (Malm might invoice a nightclub owner for providing bouncers, say; the owner would pay Malm, who’d keep a fee and return the rest to the owner in cash or some other fashion, allowing him to avoid paying tax on it. The bouncers, needless to say, don’t exist.)One of the film’s revelations, Brügger says in a voiceover, is the connection “between the nice-looking, everyday citizens and the underworld”. In Smajic’s presence, a lawyer named Lise Roulund delivers to Fasar a USB drive full of confidential documents she has obtained from the police – an illegal act in itself. On suspicions of money-laundering, Fasar’s bank account has been frozen, so Roulund helps him enact his tax dodges by transferring money in and out of an account she controls. Without lawyers willing to look the other way, criminal activity would seize up, Roulund says. “We’re the ones who make it go around.”Another lawyer, named Nicolai Dyhr,a partner at one of Denmark’s most prestigious law firms, is a fount of suggestions on how to exploit the bankruptcy code. He lays out how Wassem could shutter his shawarma business, declare bankruptcy and avoid a tax debt of 2.4m kroner; he even details how Wassem could squeeze additional money out of a government fund that guarantees worker salaries while companies are going through bankruptcy. Malm, the businessman with the invoice factories, also files for bankruptcy, and Dyhr advises him to hide evidence of fraud and deliberately undervalue his businesses. (Later, Dyhr claimed he was “eel-trapping” – leading Malm on to secure him as a client, but with no plans to commit crimes. Dyhr sued TV2, demanding that all covert footage of him be edited out of the film, butlosthis case. Fasar denied committing the crimes discussed on camera; Malm told TV2 it “didn’t have the whole picture”; Roulund has refused to comment.)By themselves, the sums of laundered money bandied about run only to a few million pounds, small enough in scale that one expert described it to me ashyggekrim– crime so domestic it’s practically cosy. But all these cons purport to show how simple it is to exploit the Danish state. It was one of the earliest lessons of Smajic’s career, she says: “The state always pays.”Some episodes of The Black Swan prickle with violence. On a trip to his native Pakistan, Fasar discusses killing a patient in a hospital – a potential witness in a trial against him. (Nørgaard told me TV2 tipped off the Danish police about Fasar’s plans.) After returning to Copenhagen, Fasar storms into Smajic’s office, threatening to “crush you with my bare hands” because she has failed to secure a Danish passport for his daughter. Without breaking character, Smajic mollifies him. By the end of the meeting, they’re reminiscing about how a mental illness diagnosis concocted years ago has kept Fasar out of prison for drug and arms trafficking offences, and he’s laughing along. It’s an astonishing performance from Smajic – like watching someone act out Hamlet while walking a high wire.Then, in the final episode, we learn Smajic is an even more nerveless and consummate actor than we thought – that she has double-crossed Brügger himself.From one of Smajic’s sound recorders, the producers recover a file she has deleted, and discover that she knows Wassem far better than she lets on. His name is not even Wassem, and from their conversation on the file, about transporting cash, she seems to be engaged in an entirely different caper with him, one that Brügger and TV2 know nothing about. Upon investigation, they find she has secretly been running a second office, where they suspect she has been laundering hundreds of thousands of kroner via invoice factories for other clients. (Smajic has said she never facilitated any crimes during this period.) Inone case, TV2 claims to have found undiluted fraud: Smajic embezzling 65,000 kroner from a client by forwarding him emails that she’d fabricated, and that appeared to be from the tax authority. Smajic isn’t a crook on the mend at all, the film concludes; she’s a crook in the thick of committing an assortment of crimes. When she finds out that Brügger and his colleagues know about her side hustles, she demands the documentary be shelved.All documentaries are artificial: their footage has been carefully threshed and sieved with an eye to telling a story or pushing an argument. The Black Swan, though, relies on the unblinking, real-time gaze of hidden CCTV cameras, so we lull ourselves into thinking that we’re seeing the full picture, the full truth. No such thing. Instead, we get evasion upon evasion: Smajic’s charade for her clients, Malm cheating the taxman, TV2 withholding their work from the police, Brügger keeping details from his audience. Smajic’s final bluff merely confirms what Brügger seems to have believed throughout his career: everywhere, there are conspiracies and lies that he must expose, even if he has to participate in the dissembling himself.Brügger, who turns 53 in June, is a very tall, very bald man with a very red beard. He never seems to run out of conversational energy; whatever time of day it is, he’s likely to be ready to talk for hours, looking at you unblinkingly through his chunky spectacles as he tells you how bizarre or absurd the world really is. When I first met him, at the Frihedsbrevet offices in January, we loitered in the building’s courtyard, our pates goose-pimpling over in the Danish winter, so he could finish his cigarette. He warmed us up with fresh gossip. We had originally planned to attend, that evening, a public lecture by three TV2 journalists about The Black Swan. But Smajic had emailed the journalists a few days earlier, promising to show up and ask a few questions of her own, such as: “How does it feel to take credit for a program I pay for with my life (even though I’m still breathing, yes)?” or “How many people have you thrown under the bus against your better judgment to make your story work?”After the documentary’s release, fearing for her safety and that of her young son, Smajic had gone into hiding, so her cameo at the lecture would have been sensational. She would bring “a bunch of friends”, she warned – and then, in a second email, added: “Have you thought about and arranged security for that night … The assessment is that my participation that evening increases the risk for both me, you and the audience.”Citing caution, TV2 cancelled the event. I couldn’t tell if Brügger felt disappointed or vindicated – the first at the dashed prospect of seeing Smajic rising in the audience and setting it abuzz, the second at how Smajic’s emails appeared laced with an articulate derangement. “She’s an expert in creating conflict and manipulating people,” he told me. “If you plant her inside a biker gang, she could tear it apart within two weeks.”View image in fullscreenSmajic and Fasar Abrar Raja in a still from The Black Swan.Photograph: Wingman MediaBrügger was raised in the belief that conflict makes for great copy. His parents were journalists, and at the dinner table, his sister, Ane Cortzen, said: “We’d talk about society and politics, and you couldn’t just sit and listen. You had to have an opinion.” Cortzen remembers Brügger as an inventive child obsessed with comic books, to the point that he developed a “very black-and-white view of the world, in which some people are good and some are evil”. (On the middle finger of his right hand, Brügger wears a skull ring as homage to The Phantom, a comic-book crimefighter who wears a skintight purple suit and lives in a cave resembling a human cranium.) At university, Brügger studied film-making, and then worked at the state broadcaster, where he met his longtime producer, Peter Engel. “The best thing, I discovered, is to let him do his own stuff,” Engel said. “If you hear there’s a black market for diplomatic credentials, an ordinary journalist will say: ‘I’ll interview the broker and write a piece.’ Mads would say: ‘Let me become a fake diplomat.’ He always wants to step into his own universe.”As a documentarian, Brügger likes to make things happen. Not for him the Attenboroughian serenity of waiting for a lion to grow hungry and then track down its antelope; he’d rather starve the lion, hobble the antelope, and then introduce both beasts into a cage to film the carnage. In all his projects, Brügger has mounted elaborate, artificial setups just like Smajic’s office, and lured people into self-indictment, folly or sudden disclosures. Most of his films pivot on Brügger pretending to be someone he isn’t. In The Red Chapel, which won a Sundance award in 2010, he plays the manager of a pair of comedians touring North Korea. In The Ambassador, he impersonates a Liberian diplomat in Central African Republic. His cameras are, if not hidden, claiming to be present for benign purposes. In Pyongyang with his comedians, Brügger’s tapes were screened every night by a government agency; the film’s splenetic views of North Korea – “a sanctuary for crazy people” – emerge in the edits and in Brügger’s voiceovers. As in The Black Swan, the most burning question in these films is always: will someone tear the facade away and expose Brügger?Even in Cold Case Hammarskjöld, in which Brügger tamely appears as himself – a film-maker smelling conspiracy behind the death of Dag Hammarskjöld, the UN secretary general, in a 1961 plane crash – he cannot resist a splash of play-acting. He wears an all-white outfit, down to his sneakers, because, as he says in his narration: “I know for a fact that the villain of this story, he wore only white.” Brügger fails to prove that this villain – a long-dead South African mercenary – actually brought down Hammarskjöld’s plane, but that kind of factfinding is, in any case, never the priority of his films. “Hammarskjöld was a ticket to all the things I really enjoy: tracking down mercenaries, telling tales of evil men who dress in white, [and] rumours about secret African societies,” Brügger says in one voiceover. He’s always out for spectacle, shock and a wild ride. “If Hunter S Thompson had gone into film and ditched all the drugs,” a Norwegian columnist wrote of Cold Case Hammarskjöld, “maybe this is what he could have ended up with.”Brügger’s approach can leave his collaborators uneasy. When I spoke to one of the comedians in The Red Chapel, he euphemistically called Brügger’s journalism “uncompromising,” adding: “Mads is often portrayed as either a villain or a genius – and maybe he’s both.” An early collaborator described Brügger to me as ruthlessly ambitious – someone who wouldn’t hesitate to pilfer an idea or sell out a friend to make good TV. But he admits Brügger can be charming and persuasive, and I know what he means. When Brügger outlines his outre philosophies of journalism – of orchestrating scenarios and entering them – you feel like a mug for having arranged an interview in a cafe.It’s often unclear what Brügger is setting out to discover, what facts he’s seeking to establish. In The Red Chapel, even as his comedians rehearse on a riverbank, Brügger declares he wants to “expose the very core of the evil in North Korea” – an aim as grand and adolescent as it is vague. (As it happens, he never even makes it out of his minders’ line of sight.) As a Liberian diplomat in The Ambassador, Brügger tries to buy blood diamonds, pretends he wants to start a match factory in Central African Republic (CAR), and arranges to tour a “Pygmy village”. The CAR is a place with no moral boundaries, he tells us, and so it “offers itself as a sort of Jurassic Park for people longing for the Africa of the 1970s”. He circles some sort of exposé – evidence of how illicitly obtained diplomatic papers can be used to smuggle diamonds and commit other crimes – but never quite pins it to the mat. By the end of Cold Case Hammarskjöld, similarly, Brügger has proven no conspiracy. The ride has been weird, but the case remains cold.View image in fullscreenMads Brügger.Photograph: Marie Hald/The GuardianOnly in The Mole, a story of such reckless and dogged infiltration that it might have been hatched by an intelligence agency, does Brügger obtain more orthodox journalistic results. Ulrich Larsen, a retired chef who had watched The Red Chapel, tracked Brügger down in 2010 and volunteered as a spy within the Copenhagen chapter of the Korean Friendship Association. Brügger gave him cameras and instructed him to film everything. “I thought I’d just be showing these Danish guys as Monty Python weirdos doing silly walks,” Larsen told me. Instead, under Brügger’s supervision, Larsen posed so effectively as a sympathiser that he wound up penetrating the heart of North Korea’s influence network better than any full-time spy – and filmed himself doing it, to boot. With an accomplice, he duped North Korean officials into thinking he was setting up a drug and arms factory in Uganda – part of a plan to make enough money to buy North Korea weapons despite prevailing sanctions. The con ran a full decade – so long that Brügger sometimes clean forgot about it for months on end.Brügger wouldn’t necessarily quibble with these characterisations of his movies. “I’m a film-maker who craves sensation,” he says in The Mole, and that he does provide. His tone is caustic, his characters are colourful, and his plot twists are what Lotte Folke Kaarsholm, the opinion editor at the Danish daily Politiken, wryly calls “maximalist”. During one of our conversations, Brügger quoted Jørgen Leth, the doyen of Danish documentarians, to describe their line of work as “laying a trap in the forest and then waiting behind a tree to see who falls in”. Later, I looked up the quote and found that Leth had talked about setting a trap for reality, to capture the most authentic version of the world. “We are relaxed, attentive and noncommittal,” he said in a 2000 interview. “Things happen when they happen.” Leth was advocating patience and preparation; Brügger was thinking of a literal trap to tempt someone into making a mistake.One morning in Copenhagen, I visited Smajic’s lawyer, who led me into a conference room, laid his mobile on the table, and dialled her on speakerphone. The previous day, she’d been convicted in a different case of a million-kroner fraud; the following week, she would be sentenced to 18 months in prison. When we spoke, she was still in hiding, but there wasn’t a trace of anxiety in her voice. She complimented me on pronouncing her name correctly, and said she’d spoken to no other journalist since the documentary’s release. Midway through our conversation, while mentioning the episode during which Fasar threatened her, I told her I was appalled that journalists had put her in that position. I did mean it, but it’s also the sort of thing a journalist says, with exaggerated concern, to gain someone’s confidence. “That’s the first time someone has been sympathetic and said that,” she told me – something I knew to be false, because I’d read Danish columnists expressing the same views. Later, I learned that Iwas also notthe first journalist to interview her about the film.Smajic believes she’s a victim of journalistic deceit. The Black Swan was meant to be about her life, she said, with the hidden camera footage being used only sparingly to corroborate her stories. She’d been offered no security during the filming, she said. When TV2 screened the first three episodes for her approval, they were really just raw, unedited clips, she maintained, and in any case, she’d been strongly medicated after a surgery and couldn’t assess them with a clear mind. (“Amira watched the edited episodes, they just needed finalising,” TV2’s Nørgaard told me. “During the four hours she spent with the editorial team that day, she appeared unaffected and seemed coherent, as we also documented in the series.”) Smajic hadn’t been running any other office at the time, she said to me, and in any case, “they hadn’t bought the rights to every single moment in my life”.Smajic felt betrayed. “For two years, these people were telling me to go through with it, saying: ‘This is going to be the biggest thing. You’re going to be a star.’” When she began worrying that the documentary would place her in danger, she asked for it to be suspended. “They figured that if they made me out to be a criminal, I wouldn’t have a say,” she told me. Early in 2024, months before The Black Swan was due to be broadcast, Smajic sued for an injunction against the film. A court denied her plea on grounds of public interest. In its verdict, it decided Smajic was fully aware of the project’s risks, the protection that TV2 arranged for her, and the ambit of the documentary.Among those who think Smajic was treated poorly is Jacob Mollerup, a veteran of the Danish media and a co-founder of Foreningen for Undersøgende Journalistik (FUJ), an association of investigative journalists. Mollerup described The Black Swan as “an exceptional production”, but argued Brügger had prized his dramatisation too much, abandoning fairness and balance in the bargain. “Normally, you protect your sources, but here they say: ‘Now she’s just a criminal, she broke our contract, so we can set aside her wishes about the production,” Mollerup told me. Hiding Smajic’s ongoing work as a police informant from The Black Swan’s viewers was dishonest, he said. If she was telling her handlers everything about the sting as it happened, that made it an operation implicitly sanctioned by the police – and plunged it into all sorts of ethical murk. Was Smajic inviting into her lair suspects whom the police wanted to nab? Which of the crimes being planned on camera were actually carried out, and how? Mollerup believes journalists must be transparent about their methods and precise in documenting misdeeds. When The Black Swan won an FUJ prize, he gave up his membership. “I told them: ‘This is not what I worked for.’”Brügger briskly rejected all of Smajic’s statements. She’d often claimed to be on medication before, he said, including once when she was pleading loss of memory while testifying in another criminal trial. She was merely recycling this excuse to explain to me why she hadn’t objected to the advance cuts of the first three episodes, Brügger told me. On his laptop, he found a photo of a production team’s stakeout that had been in place throughout the sting, in an office near Smajic’s. The team constantly watched the feed from the hidden cameras, ready to summon security if things went south – a setup she knew about, he said. When I wondered if the police had known of Smajic’s parallel adventures in money-laundering, or perhaps even endorsed them for their own purposes, Brügger said: “I find it highly unlikely, but it’s a possibility. The police wouldn’t confirm or deny this anyway.”Nothing I learned from Smajic solved the central mystery of The Black Swan: why did she choose to capsize her life by participating at all? Janet Malcolm, the deft vivisectionist of the psyche in journalism, would argue that such masochistic tendencies can be found in anyone who volunteers to talk to the press. But Smajic wasn’t just anyone: she was a habitual lawbreaker, so for her to let a television crew into the darkest corners of her life felt positively self-destructive. Perhaps she did think of exposure as disinfectant, a step towards a cure. Perhaps she believed she could bear any waves of bad press, or even surf them towards fame and freedom. “The thing is,” Brügger said, “with Amira, you can just never be sure of anything.”View image in fullscreenFrida Kahlo, The Two Fridas (1939).Photograph: Archivart/AlamyHe said this with the kind of awe that one veteran trickster reserves for another. Despite the lies and lawsuits, Brügger remains magnetised by Smajic. In one conversation, he’d mentioned his sole contribution to the decor of Smajic’s office: a print of The Two Fridas, in which Frida Kahlo painted herself twice, once with a gaping hole in her chest cavity, and again with a healthy heart and a small picture in her hand. “I’d hoped someone would come in and ask about it, but I didn’t prepare Amira for that,” Brügger said. This trap-within-a-trap is sprung in the fourth episode by a motorcycle thug’s curiosity, but Smajic improvises like a maestro. “It’s only when you cut out the heart that you can think coldly and rationally,” she explains. The picture the second Kahlo holds is of her child, Smajic ad-libs: “You can’t be cold if you have a family … That was me then, and this is me now.”Brügger was delighted. “It was brilliant. I became so happy and excited when I saw that. It’s my favourite scene.” The journalist may often be cast as the seducer, coaxing information out of people, but he’s just as liable to be seduced – by the mirage of the perfect story, as clean and vivid as a comic book. For Brügger, Smajic had initially promised to provide just that. When she turned out to be staging a perilous deception, throwing his production into chaos, he only grew further enthralled – perhaps because he recognised in Smajic an even more skilled version of himself.It’s difficult to feel sorry for Smajic, or for anyone in The Black Swan. The most moving passages in Brügger’s films always involve peripheral players in the great jape: the Ugandan villagers who are told they will be relocated so that an arms factory can be built on their land; or the North Korean interpreter who weeps at the memorial to Kim Il-Sung, claiming she’s mourning him but possibly grieving for some other reason; or the Central African Republicans who take lessons in how to make matches in a factory that Brügger will never build. To his credit, Brügger acknowledges the odd pang of guilt in his voiceovers – but only in passing.For The Ambassador, Brügger flew an Indian match-exporter named Sumeet Mehta to the CAR for a few days, ostensibly to train his employees. The Ambassador came out in 2011, but until I called him recently, Mehta didn’t know he’d featured in a documentary – or, indeed, that Brügger was a film-maker and not a diplomat. “I was kind of afraid to go, but I went anyway,” Mehta said, sounding baffled. “I sensed this factory was some kind of gimmick, but I didn’t know the reason behind it.” Ulrich Larsen told me that he wonders about the repercussions that the North Koreans unwittingly cast in The Mole might have suffered. “The rough answer is: I’m not responsible for what the regime does,” Larsen said. He hoped that “Mr Kang”, his translator in Pyongyang, was all right, “but of course, nobody knows. I did what I could. I brought his daughter a Lego.” Like Brügger, Larsen seemed to write it off as the cost of making an engrossing film. As Brügger says in The Red Chapel: “For your sake and mine, I have to lie.”Who killed the prime minister? The unsolved murder that still haunts SwedenRead moreThe Black Swan is such a careful, hermetically sealed production that it yields no such collateral damage, and I wondered if it was because Brügger was less cavalier in his own country, with his compatriots. Most journalists begin their careers at home before venturing farther afield. Brügger’s has run in reverse – in part, I think, because he, too, had once bought into the image of Denmark as a safe, dull place where nothing ever happens. “I’ve come to Africa becauseEuropehas become old and tired,” he says in The Ambassador – a sentence that could have been uttered by a European man in any of the last half-dozen centuries. It was a backhanded jibe: a suggestion that Europe was no longer troubled by the anarchic social disorder that he desires in his films. The Black Swan showed Brügger can find all that he craves at home: conspiracy, corruption, shape-shifters, sensation, stories that evaporate like dry ice or swallow you like quicksand. The world is full of lies, not least the ones we tell ourselves.Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readDenmarkEuropeTelevisionOrganised crimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

In November, a dive boat capsized off the coast of Marsa Alam, south of Hurghada, leaving four dead and seven missing. In June 2024, two dozen French tourists were safely evacuated before their boat sank in a similar incident. In 2023, three British tourists died after a fire broke out on their yacht, engulfing it in flames.Map that shows the location of the resort along Egypt’s Red Sea coastThe submarine was carrying 45 tourists and five Egyptian crew members when it sank, the Red Sea governor, Maj Gen Amr Hanafi, said in a statement, adding that rescue teams were quickly sent.Hanafi said all six dead were Russians, and 29 of the 39 tourists rescued were injured and taken to hospital. No people remained missing from the vessel, he said, suggesting the crew had also been rescued.Russia’s Tass news agency earlier said the Russian dead included at least two children, citing the country’s consul in Hurghada. The consulate had said all 45 tourists on board were Russian, but the Egyptian governor said they also included Indian, Norwegian and Swedish citizens.The consulate said the submarine was on an underwater excursion to observe coral reefs when it “crashed 1km from the shore” at about 10am local time. “According to initial data, most of those onboard were rescued and taken to their hotels and hospitals in Hurghada,” the consulate said, adding that diplomats had been sent to the pier.Tourism is a key source of income for Egypt, in which Russian tourists play an increasing part. A United Nations report ranked Egypt first in Africa for tourism revenues in 2024 at $14.1bn (£11bn), more than twice what it earns in Suez Canal revenues.Many tourist companies have stopped or limited travelling on the Red Sea owing to the dangers from conflicts in the region over the past decade. A number of airlines suspended package flights to Egypt after thebombing of an aircraft operated by Metrojetin 2015.The Sindbad website says it offers short tourist trips in two submarines usually lasting about three hours and which operate to a maximum depth of 25 metres (80ft).According to the website its submarines allow tourists to “experience the beauty of the Red Sea’s underwater world without getting wet”.Hurghada, a resort about 280 miles (460km) south-east of Cairo, is a major destination for foreign visitors, with its airport receiving more than 9 million passengers last year, according to state media.Thursday’s forecast in the city was clear, with above-average winds reported but optimum visibility underwater.Dozens of tourist boats sail through the coastal area daily for snorkelling and diving activities, but Sindbad Submarines says it deploys the region’s “only real” recreational submarine. The vessel has been operating in the area for many years, a source familiar with the company told Agence France-Presse.Explore more on these topicsEgyptAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaWater transportRussiaTravel & leisurenewsShareReuse this content"

There his bodyguards were disarmed and an arrest warrant issued “under unclear charges”, he said.The UN human rights commission in South Sudan said in a statement that the arrest, alongside escalating armed clashes and reported attacks on civilians, “signals a severe unravelling of the peace process – and a direct threat to millions of lives.“Failure to uphold the protections enshrined in the peace agreement – including freedom of movement, political participation and the cessation of hostilities – will lead to a catastrophic return to war,” it added.Adhering to the agreement and protecting civilians was “critical to preventing all-out war”, the commission said.Tang said Machar was being held with his wife, Angelina Teny, who is the country’s interior minister, at their home. Machar has been accused of supporting the White Army militia, which clashed with the military recently. His party denies current links with the White Army, which it fought alongside during the war.In a video address, the SPLM-IO spokesperson Pal Mai Deng said Machar was “in confinement by the government” and that his life was at risk.Machar’s arrest poses a grave threat to the power-sharing agreement between him and the country’s president, Salva Kiir, his longtime rival. The agreement was part of a 2018 peace deal to end the civil war, in which 400,000 people were killed.Tensions have been rising in recent months. The White Army, a community militia loyal to Machar, launched attacks against the country’s military, the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces (SSPDF), in Nasir county earlier this month and overran an army base. The militia, which protects the Nuer community, said it had acted in self-defence.The government responded by bombarding areas where the group is based and arresting opposition figures.An SSPDF commander and a UN crew member were among at least 27 soldierskilled in gunfireas a UN helicopter was trying to evacuate troops from Nasir county on 7 March.The deputy chair of SPLM-IO, Oyet Nathaniel Pierino, said Machar’s detention meant the power-sharing agreement was at an end.It “effectively brings the agreement to a collapse, thus the prospect for peace and stability in South Sudan has now been put into serious jeopardy”, he said.South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011. A civil war between government and opposition forces swiftly followed, fought largely along ethnic lines.International bodies called for restraint after Machar’s arrest. The Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), an eastern African trade bloc,saidhis detention seriously undermined the peace agreement and risked “plunging the country back into violent conflict”.The head of the UN peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, Nicholas Haysom,saidthe country stood on the brink of relapsing into widespread conflict that “will not only devastate South Sudan but also affect the entire region”.He called for the parties involved to immediately cease hostilities and engage in constructive talks.The US Bureau of African Affairsurged Kiirto release Machar and called on South Sudan’s leaders to “demonstrate sincerity of stated commitments to peace”.Explore more on these topicsSouth SudanAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The prison, built in 2022 during a brutal government crackdown on organized crime, is where nearly 300 migrants, previously in US custody, were recently expelled and are currently detained.They have been accused of being violent gang members, despitefamily membersof several of the menassertingthat they are not.‘Deported because of his tattoos’: has the US targeted Venezuelans for their body art?Read more“The Department of Homeland Security secretary’s visit is an example of the fear that Trump’s government wants to instill in immigrants,” attorney Ivania Cruz said on Thursday. Cruz works with the Committee to Defend Human and Community Rights (Unidehc), a human rights organization inEl Salvador. “This is precisely what Noem has done — use the Cecot as a cinematographic space,” she added.Noem’s visit to the prison “was a typical gross and cruel display of political theater that we have come to expect from theTrump administration,” Vicki Gass said. Gass is the executive director of the Latin America Working Group (LAWG), a human rights organization based in Washington DC. “That the Trump administration is flouting judicial orders and denying due process to people within the US borders is outrageous and frightening.”Earlier this month,Donald Trumpinvoked theAlien Enemies Act, a wartime provision that allows the executive to detain and deport people coming from an “enemy” nation. Despite a federal judgeblockingthe invocation of the act, shortly after, planes from the US landed in El Salvador, filled with men and women in immigration custody.More than 250 men, mostly from Venezuela, were quickly and forcibly shuffled into the Cecot, where officials shaved their heads and placed them in cells.Trump and his administration have repeatedly claimed that the men were members of transnational gangs. When invoking the Alien Enemies Act, Trump – without proof – accused the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua of having “infiltrated” the US at the behest of the Venezuelan government. US intelligence agencies contradict Trump’s claims about ties between the gang and the Venezuelan government, the New York Times has reported, and the Venezuelan government has also denied it is connected.News reports across various publications have emerged revealing the identity of the Venezuelan men expelled to El Salvador, with family members saying some of the men are innocent. When pressed, the DHS has not provided proof of those men’s purported ties to the gang and they were flown out of the US without a hearing, raising questions about violations of constitutional due process rights.Thefederal judgein Washington who blocked the invocation of the Alien Enemies Act has repeatedly pressed the Trump administration to provide information about their process to conduct the operation, also ordering “individualized hearings” for people Trump wants to expel under the act. In response, the Trump administration invoked“state secrets”privilege, to avoid disclosing any information about the operation.The Salvadorian prison that Noem visited was constructed in 2022, during El Salvador’s “state of exception”, a move by the president, Nayib Bukele, that rounded up thousands of people in an attempt to crack down on criminal gangs. According to Cruz, the human rights attorney, and other organizations, the state of exception violated due process rights, with thousands being caught up in arrests and detention without proof of gang membership.Trump administration claims details of mass deportations are state secretsRead moreCruz has been targeted for her work denouncing conditions in the Salvadorian prisons. During the state of exception, her brother was arrested and imprisoned by the Bukele government. Cruz fought for his release and since then, she has taken on a role as a key spokesperson for people who have been wrongfully detained in the prisons.“It is not by chance that the expelled immigrants are from Venezuela, when we know there is a political conflict between the two countries,” Cruz said. “Today it is Venezuelans – tomorrow may be Chileans, then Colombians. It’s an international problem that is provoking conflict.”Noem’s visit came one day before a protest organized by a Salvadorian rights organization, opposing the Central American government’s “arbitrary detentions”.“I also want everybody to know, if you come to our country illegally, this is one of the consequences you can face,” Noem said in avideoposted on X from the Cecot prison. “Know that this facility is one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people.”The use of another country’s vast, maximum-security prison to detain immigrants from a third country is unprecedented, especially considering the grave allegations of abuses at this and other Salvadorian prisons.“Amnesty International has extensively documented the inhumane conditions within detentions centers in El Salvador, including the Cecot, where those removed are now being held,” the organization said in astatementon Wednesday. “Reports indicate extreme overcrowding, lack of access to adequate medical care, and widespread ill-treatment amounting to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.”According to Ana María Méndez Dardón, the Central America director for the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights non-profit in DC, there are two or three huge prisons in El Salvador where the mass incarceration of people has been concentrated. The detention centers in the country have faced extreme allegations of human rights abuses.US deportees face brutal conditions in El Salvador mega-prison: ‘Severe overcrowding, inadequate food’Read more“The Cecot has a capacity for 40,000 people, that is to say only 30% of the current prison population, the rest of the population is located in other centers, such as the one in Mariona, where torture and other human rights violations have been documented,” Méndez Dardón said.She added: “Unlike the videos edited and produced about Cecot, President Bukele is not showing the world the true reality within the other detention centers, where the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has stated that they have committed torture and other cruel and inhuman treatment.”Reports have described bare metal bunks stacked high like shelving and with no bedding whatsoever.The Trump administration’s practice of denying due process and defying judicial orders “is outrageous and frightening”, Gass, from LAWG, added. “So is forcibly disappearing them to Cecot where prisoners are not allowed to meet with lawyers or their family members, are jammed into overcrowded cells, and never see the light of day.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationKristi NoemEl SalvadorUS politicsVenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Passenger bookings on Canada to US routes are currently down by over 70% compared to the same period last year.Comparing the available bookings from March 2024 to March 2025, OAG looked at how many people have booked trans-border flights in the six-month period between April through September. It found that the number of tickets booked was down anywhere from 71% to 76%.Donald Trump announces new 25% tariffs on cars from overseasRead moreTotal capacity available for passengers on flights between the two countries has also seen a reduction, likely a response to decreasing demands. The data shows that more than 320,000 seats have been removed by airlines operating between the two countries through to the end of October, with the highest cuts, 3.5%, also occurring during the peak summer months.But the steep decline suggests that the current capacity cuts do not even begin to cover the current disinterest in traveling to the US.The dramatic drop in bookings suggests that Canadian travelers are holding off on making reservations, probably due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding the tariff war. Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, called thelatest roundof Trump’s tariffs a “direct attack” on Canadian workers.Though a decline in travel betweenCanadaand the US was expected, the substantial 70% drop in bookings could require drastic changes for airlines, such as Air Canada, which is the airline that has the largest network of border crossings between the neighboring countries.Beyond the trade dispute, some Canadians say they feel increasingly uneasy crossing into the US following several high-profile incidents of foreign visitors beingdetained by Ice.Explore more on these topicsAir transportCanadaTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS foreign policyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In January, Lunaintroduced a bill to add Trump’s face to the side of Mount Rushmore, the mountainside memorial to the nation’s greatest presidents.View image in fullscreenNayib Bukele and the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, at his residence in El Salvador, on 3 Feburary 2025.Photograph: Mark Schiefelbein/APThe caucus publicizes its activities via an account on Musk’s social media platform, X. In many posts and reposts, that account has appeared to endorse unconstitutional and anti-democratic proposals from Bukele, Musk and other far-right actors.One of the account’s reposts is of a post from Bukele that embeds a 26 February complaint from Musk saying: “The only way to restore rule of the people in America is to impeach judges. No one is above the law, including judges. That is what it took to fix El Salvador. Same applies to America.”The day before, a federal judge blocked Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) from accessing the personal details of millions of Americans via data from the Department of Education and the Office of Personnel Management.Bukele shared Musk’s post with the remark: “If you don’t impeach the corrupt judges, you CANNOT fix the country.”He added: “They will form a cartel (a judicial dictatorship) and block all reforms, protecting the systemic corruption that put them in their seats.”In May 2021, Bukeleremovedthe country’s attorney general and five supreme court judges. Later that year, theBiden state department put Bukele’shand-picked replacement judges on a list of “undemocratic and corrupt actors”, with the US chargé d’affaires in El Salvador at that time warning of a “decline in democracy” in the country.In a 26 February post reposted by the El Salvador caucus account, Matt Gaetz amplified yet another of Bukele post from 2021. Bukele had posted pictures apparently showing a rally of the leftwing Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) party; that party initially formed as an armed insurgent group, but has participated in national elections since 1994 after the insurgency ended in peace accords in 1992.Bukele himself served as mayor of Nuevo Cuscatlán and San Salvador, before he was ousted from the party in 2017. He hasconsistently attackedthe party in power, including by refusing to commemorate the peace accords that brought peace to El Salvador after years of brutal civil war.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Monday, the appeals court judge Patricia Millett averred that “Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act” during the second world war.The relatives of some people sent to El Salvador as gang members have said that they are innocent. While immigration officials selected deportees on the basis of alleged gang tattoos, family members say the tattoos were ofreligious imagery and football club logos.Bukele haslong been in favor on the US far right, who admire his authoritarian approach to law and order, his strongman constitutional brinkmanship, and his embrace of cryptocurrencies.Wolf said: “Having been elected president twice, the second time by violating the constitution, [Bukele] has established an opaque and corrupt regime that pursues personal enrichment… the president has also eroded institutional checks and balances, stifled press freedom, and pushed for gentrification and megaprojects that undermine people’s livelihoods and displace communities.”Gonzalez has a history of striking conservative positions both in Congress and on the campaign trail. In January,he was one of two Democratswho voted to support a Trump-backed act that would withhold federal funding from schools that allow transgender athletes to compete alongside girls.

No amnesty!” one elated lefty roared from his balcony into the sunny autumn afternoon.Across the bay in the city of Niterói, the composer Edu Krieger was so delighted by the prospect of Bolsonaro serving time he wrotea song– a parody of a Tom Jobim bossa nova classic called Waters of March – celebrating the downfall of the “coup-mongering fascist”.“It was a feeling of relief,” Krieger, one of many progressive Brazilians who abhor the far-right populist for his attacks on culture and human rights, said ofthe court’s decision.View image in fullscreenEdu Krieger, pictured in 2019.Photograph: Felipe Fittipaldi/The GuardianThousands of miles north, deep in the Amazon, the Yanomami leader Júnior Hekurari also voiced satisfaction. “Never before were we so abandoned by the Brazilian state [than during Bolsonaro’s 2019-23 administration] … His words encouraged thousands of illegal miners to infiltrate our forests, bringing mercury, violence and environmental destruction,” Hekurari recalled.Bolsonaro’s critics have said they hope this week’s ruling will end his divisive andhate-filled 36-year career, in which the paratrooper turned politician underwent an astonishing transformation from eccentric​ backbencher​ to the country’s most powerful man.“He turned his back on us – and now the world can see the consequences of his acts,” said Hekurari, condemning Bolsonaro’s “negligence and omission” for plunging his Yanomami people into a deadly crisis of hunger and pain.View image in fullscreenJúnior Hekurari speaking to Yanomami villagers about the future of their territory in January.Photograph: João Laet/The GuardianBolsonaro’s future looks bleak after the unanimous ruling. When he goes on trial, possibly later this year, few believe the politician will escape punishment for allegedly leading a murderous conspiracy to stop his left-wing successor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, taking power after his 2022 election win. Those crimes could earn the 72-year-old a sentence of more than 40 years.As she voted for Bolsonaro to be put in the dock, the supreme court justice Cármen Lúcia Antunes Rocha launched a searing​ attack on the kind of authoritarian takeover the far-right politician is accused of plotting. “Dictatorship kills. Dictatorship lives off death – not just the death of society and of democracy, but of human beings made of flesh and bone​ who are tortured, mutilated and murdered,” she said.Bolsonaro tried to strike a defiant tone during a rambling, peevish 45-minute pronouncement to reporters, insisting he was innocent of “unfounded” accusations. “I’m not obsessed with power, I have a passion for Brazil,” he shouted, before a prankster trumpet player gatecrashed the press conference witha sarcastic rendition of Chopin’s Funeral March.Maria Cristina Fernandes, a columnist from the Valor Econômico newspaper, said she believed Bolsonaro cut a diminished figure. “It was the speech of someone who is bewildered, who doesn’t have a strategy … I saw a Bolsonaro who was lost and I think [in his position] anyone would be,” she said.Fernandes said she thought Bolsonaro – who she expected to be convicted – would try to grab two lifelines as he fought for political survival.The first involved securing a presidential pardon by helping to elect a right-wing president in next year’s election, in which he is banned from running. Bolsonaro had hoped his congressman son, Eduardo, might stand in his place. But Fernandes said she believed the court’s verdict meant he would instead be compelled to support São Paulo’s less radical right-wing governor, Tarcísio de Freitas, who stood a better chance of winning.Second, Fernandes said, Bolsonaro would fight to ensure a large number of right-wing senators were elected, wagering they would help impeach the supreme court judge Alexandre de Moraes – the man Bolsonaristas suspect would spearhead efforts to strike down any such pardon. “This is Bolsonaro’s absolute top priority,” she said.It is far from certain Bolsonaro will achieve those goals. When the ex-president summoned supporters to rally on Rio’s Copacabana beach this month, allies anticipated a million-strong crowd. About 18,000 people turned up, according to an estimate by one of Brazil’s top universities.View image in fullscreenSupporters throng Copacabana Beach, Rio de Janeiro, for the 16 March rally.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“For me, the protest in Copacabana was a sign that people want to turn the page,” Fernandes said. “I really think Bolsonaro is running the risk of becoming yesterday’s news.“I’m not saying Brazil’s right and extreme right are doomed,” she added, but Bolsonaro looked a spent force and the populist’s hopes of staging a Donald Trump-style comeback were not good. “Voters want to look to the future.”Not everyone is so sure. Bernardo Mello Franco, a political columnist for the newspaper O Globo, said he also expected Bolsonaro to be found guilty and jailed – if he did not flee abroad or hide in a foreign embassy first.Mello Franco said he believed the ex-president was hoping the “global extreme-right alliance” – spearheaded by Trump and Elon Musk – might somehow rescue him, even if the US president appeared to have more urgent priorities than a septuagenarian South American politician who no longer held power.But was Bolsonaro truly finished?“In Brazil, we can never say someone’s politically dead and buried,” Mello Franco replied. “Just look at the case of President Lula,” whose career looked over when he was jailed in 2018 but who reclaimed the presidency four years later. “Sometimes people seem to be out of the game and then suddenly there’s a twist.”View image in fullscreenFans greet Jair Bolsonaro at a rally in São Paulo in February last year.Photograph: Miguel Schincariol/AFP/Getty ImagesKrieger, the musician, voiced similar fears.“When it comes to politics, everything is so unpredictable,” Krieger said, pointing to the emergence of a new generation of social media savvy far-right figures. “While it might be the end of the road for a specific person, it isn’t, unfortunately, the end of the road for conspiratorial, coup-mongering, fascist ways of thinking.” .He added: “This seed wasn’t planted in Brazil by Bolsonaro – it was planted more than 500 years ago when Brazil was invaded by the Europeans, and native people began to be exterminated and slavery [took root] … These far-right ideas are still very much alive.”Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilThe far rightAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Monday, the president hinted that the auto industry levies could come in “the very near future”.On 2 April – a day Trump has dubbed “liberation day” – the president is expected to unveil a wide range of so-called reciprocal tariffs: levies on imported goods that the Trump administration argues are unfairly taxed by the US’s trading partners.Trump has long argued that the US is being cheated by its trading partners and that tariffs are the best remedy. However, he has delayed or watered down his tariff plans on several occasions. His stance has worried investors, leading to sharp sell-offs in US stock markets, and has proved unpopular with both the corporate US and consumers.Many economists have expressed alarm, too, warning that the president’s tariff plan would risk increasing prices across the US. A study by Anderson Economic Group, an automotive consultant,for example, found that blanket tariffs on Canada and Mexico risks increasing US car prices by as much as $12,000.Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Canada and Germany are among the top car exporters to the US. Will Scharf, a White House official, claimed the new car tariffs would result in more than $100bn in annual revenue to the US.Shares of automakers fell in after-hours trading and US equity index futures slid, indicating stocks were headed for a lower open on Thursday.India’s Tata Motors, meanwhile, slid 5% and Tesla’s biggest Indian supplier, Sona Comstar, dropped over 4%, leading to a 1.2% drop in the auto sector in the world’s third-largest auto market.Shares in South Korea’s Hyundai Motor shed more than 4% and sister automaker Kia Corp fell more than 3% after Trump’s announcement. Hyundai Motor shares are set to post their biggest daily drop since late October last year. Hyundai, together with affiliate Kia, is the world’s third-largest automaker by sales.Shares in Toyota, the world’s top-selling automaker, dropped 3.7% in early trading in Tokyo, while Nissan lost 3.2% and Honda 3.1%. In South Korea, Hyundai shares fell 3.4%.The tariffs will rattle Japan’s auto industry, a key component of the world’s fourth-largest economy. The sector accounts for about a tenth of Japan’s workforce, while vehicles made up about a third of its ¥21.3tn ($142bn) in exports to the US last year.Speaking before Trump’s announcement, Masanori Katayama, chair of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, said a 25% tariff on cars from overseas “would have a negative impact overall on the economies of the United States and Japan”.Despite hopes that Japan would not be targeted, ministers in Tokyo have so far been unsuccessful in persuading their US counterparts to grant exemptions on exports such as steel and vehicles.Trump on Wednesday said the tariffs could be net neutral for Tesla, the electric vehicle company that is led by Elon Musk. Musk later posted on X that Tesla would not be unscathed. “The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,” he wrote.Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier this month: “Have no fear, we will WIN everything!!!”, claiming that tariffs were already “pouring money” into the country.But aHarris pollconducted for the Guardian found that the majority of Americans were already worried about the impact tariffs would have on their finances. Ninety per cent of Democrats, 69% of independents and 57% of Republicans reported they were concerned about tariffs.Industry groups sounded the alarm on Wednesday. “Throwing away tens of thousands of jobs on both sides of the border will mean giving up North America’s auto leadership role, instead encouraging companies to build and hire anywhere else but here,” said Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. “This tax hike puts plants and workers at risk for generations, if not forever.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsAutomotive industryDonald TrumpCanadaMexicoAmericasMark CarneynewsShareReuse this content"

About 37,000 people have been displaced, the Yonhap news agency said.“We are nationally in a critical situation with numerous casualties because of the unprecedented rapid spread of forest fires,” the acting president, Han Duck-soo, told a government response meeting, adding that the high number of older victims, including those in nursing hospitals, was a particular concern.The military has released stocks of aviation fuel to help keep firefighting helicopters flying to douse flames across mountainous regions in the province, where fires have been burning now for nearly a week. More than 300 structures had been destroyed, officials said.As of Thursday morning, authorities were mobilising more than 9,000 people and about 120 helicopters to battle the fires, the government’s disaster response centre said.The country’s disaster chief said the wildfires were now “the largest on record”, having burned more forest than any previous blazes. The last major wildfire, in April 2020, scorched 23,913 hectares across the east coast.“The wildfire is spreading rapidly,” Lee said. “The forest damage has reached 35,810 hectares, already exceeding the area affected by the 2000 east coast wildfire, previously the largest on record, by more than 10,000 hectares.”The fatalities include a pilot whose helicopter crashed during efforts to contain a fire and four firefighters and other workers who died after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds.View image in fullscreenA satellite image showing smoke from fires burning in South Korea’s Uiseong county.Photograph: Nasa Worldview/ReutersAuthorities have not disclosed details of the civilian dead, except that they are mainly in their 60s and 70s. They suspect human error caused several of the wildfires that began last Friday, including cases where people started fires while clearing overgrown grass from family tombs or with sparks during welding work.Last year was South Korea’s hottest year on record, with the Korea Meteorological Administration saying that the average annual temperature was 14.5C – two degrees higher than the preceding 30-year average of 12.5C.Yeh Sang-Wook, professor of climatology at Hanyang University in Seoul, said the lack of rainfall had dried out the land “creating favourable conditions for wildfires”.“This can be seen as one of the fundamental causes,” he said. “We can’t say that it’s only due to climate change, but climate change is directly [and] indirectly affecting the changes we are experiencing now. This is a simple fact.”The blazes were threatening two Unesco world heritage sites – Hahoe Village and the Byeongsan Confucian academy – in Andong city on Wednesday, a city official said, as authorities sprayed fire retardants to try to protect them.Andong and the neighbouring counties of Uiseong and Sancheong, as well as the city of Ulsan, have been hardest hit. On Wednesday night, strong winds and smoke-filled skies forced authorities in Andong, in the south-east, to order evacuations in two villages, including Puncheon, home to the Hahoe folk village, founded around the 14th-15th century. Hikers were advised to leave the scenic Jiri mountain as another fire spread closer.locator mapThe wildfires originated in Uiseong and have been moving rapidly eastward, spreading almost to the coast, carried by gusty winds and with dry conditions aggravating the situation.The meteorological agency has forecast some rain for the south-west but precipitation is expected to be under 5mm for most of the affected areas.“The amount of rain is going to be small so it doesn’t look like it’ll be big help in trying to extinguish the fire,” said the Korea Forest Service minister, Lim Sang-seop.Officials said earlier this week that firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in key areas, but wind and dry conditions allowed them to spread again.Houses, factories, vehicles and some historic structures have been destroyed in the fires. In Uiseong, about 20 of the 30 structures at the Gounsa temple complex – which was said to be originally built in the 7th century – have been burned. Among them were two state-designated “treasures” – a pavilion-shaped building erected overlooking a stream in 1668, and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king.View image in fullscreenA monk looks at a cracked temple bell remaining after a wildfire destroyed most of the buildings at the Gounsa temple in Uiseong, South Korea.Photograph: Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty ImagesExperts have said the Uiseong fire showed extremely unusual spread in terms of its scale and speed, and that climate change was expected to make wildfires more frequent and deadly globally.Higher temperatures amplified by human-caused climate change contributed to the existing seasonally dry conditions, “turning dry landscapes into dangerous fire fuel” in the region, said the Climate Central group, an independent body made up of scientists and researchers.With Reuters, Associated Press and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsSouth KoreaAsia PacificWildfiresnewsShareReuse this content"

Three of the soldiers were discharged from the military before an investigation was launched in August last year after a tip-off to the defence ministry, and the fourth was suspended.China has debuted its new landing barges – what does this mean for Taiwan?Read moreAccording to the court, the four received payments from around NT$260,000 to NT$660,000 ($7,850-$20,000) in return for taking photographs of information with their mobile phones.The defendants had worked for “extremely sensitive and important units but violated their duties to accept bribes, and stole secrets by photographing”, the court said in a statement.“Their acts betrayed the country and endangered national security.”The four received jail terms ranging from five years and 10 months to seven years.The number of people prosecuted in Taiwan forallegedly spying for Chinahas risen sharply in recent years as the military and civilian investigative bodies crack down on infiltration and espionage. Many of those prosecuted have been current or retired members of Taiwan’s military, recruited by Beijing or its agents in Taiwan.Beijing has vowed to annex Taiwan, which it claims is Chinese territory. It has not ruled out using force to do so, but in the meantime runs multifaceted pressure campaigns including greyzone acts of military intimidation, cyberwarfare, disinformation and espionage.Earlier this month Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, designatedChinaas a “foreign hostile power” and announced a swathe of new measures to counter its efforts. The measures include plans to reinstate military courts to hear cases of espionage and other offences involving military personnel.Last week Taiwan’s government also announced increases to the base pay rates of Taiwan military personnel.The relatively small payments disclosed in some cases had drawn attention to the conditions and benefits offered to Taiwan’s serving military. Last year Dr Shen Ming-Shih, a research fellow at the Taiwan government-linked thinktank the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, saidsome recruited spies were luredby financial and sexual incentives, while others were driven by bitterness over their treatment or lack of advancement during their career.Both sides of the Taiwan Strait have been spying on each other for decades. But analysts have warned that espionage is a bigger problem for Taiwan, which faces the existential threat of a Chinese invasion.Taiwan’s intelligence agency previously reported that 64 people were prosecuted for Chinese espionage in 2024, compared with 48 in 2023 and 10 in 2022. In 2017 Taiwan’s government estimated there were more than 5,000 spies working for China in Taiwan.Cases have included soldiers filming themselves declaring they will surrender as soon as China’s military invades, or making written pledges of loyalty to the Chinese Communist party. Some retired officers have allegedly been paid to recruit active soldiers.Explore more on these topicsTaiwanChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Just one resulted in an enforceable action.In 2022 Sandilands apologised for “using filthy language and some derogatory archaic terms” but added: “I’m never going to change. I’m still not changing [for] the woke world.”An ARN spokesperson said the show’s loyal audience have an “awareness and expectation of the content” they will hear.“We understand that the Kyle and Jackie O show is not for everyone. But ultimately, it is their candid and light-hearted style that has proved popular for decades,” they said in a statement.The spokesperson said the company “respects” the role of Acma and it would continue to engage with the watchdog on the process, “including any enforceable undertakings that follow its findings”.Explore more on these topicsAustralian mediaRadionewsShareReuse this content"

He denied the spyware wasused to target Francesco Cancellato, the editor-in-chief of the Italian news outlet Fanpage.Mantovano’s assertions, which were first reported byLa Repubblica, have so far not been denied by the government.Paragonsuspended its relationshipwith Italy when the breaches emerged, a person familiar with the matter told the Guardian.

Along with the 27 confirmed dead, four people are still missing. Two survived.At least 130 more migrants have lost their lives in the Channel since the November 2021 incident, according to the UN’sInternational Organization for Migration, but incident Charlie remains the largest single loss of life since small boat crossings of the Channel began in 2018.The inquiry has heard a litany of failings, including poor communication and understaffing at the Dover coastguard on the night, and a failure of Home Office intelligence sharing.Charlie was confused by authorities with another dinghy named “incident Lima”, from which 35 people were successfully rescued, meaning that efforts to continue searching for Charlie passengers were halted. The incident was mistakenly marked as “resolved” and nobody came to their rescue.On Wednesday and Thursday the inquiry heard impact statements from bereaved relatives who spoke about their grief and sense of deep loss, compounded by uncertainty in the early days about whether or not their relatives had survived.Some said they wished they had died at the same time as their loved ones instead of living in pain, and many said they were struggling to keep going without the people they had lost. Relatives of those still missing they described the pain of not being able to have closure.Issa Mohamed Omar from Somalia, one of the two survivors, described the scene when the dinghy capsized at about 1.13am.“It was very cold, people were screaming, there was darkness all around,” he said. “We all thought we were dying. If rescue had come quickly, I believe half of these people would still be alive today. We have been seen as refugees. That’s the reason I believe the rescue did not come. We feel we are treated like animals.”Ali Areef, the cousin of Halima Mohammed Shikh, 33, a mother of three, had spoken to Omar from his hospital bed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is estimated that the passengers went into the water at 3.12am or 3.13am.In concluding remarks on Thursday, Sonali Naik KC, representing bereaved families and one of the survivors, said: “The tragedy of 24 November was preventable and it should never have happened. The victims’ identities as migrants and as foreigners shaped the search and rescue response.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumMigrationRaceFranceRefugeesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Long gone is the tetchiness on display in London in the aftermath of the Ukrainian leader’scatastrophic trip to the White House. In its place was a degree of optimism so high that it could only be interpreted as political positioning.Though he complained about comments made by Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump’s special envoy, that four Ukrainian regions wholly or partly occupied by Russia consisted of people who wanted Moscow’s rule in an “overwhelming majority” – these were “in line with the messages of the Kremlin”, Zelenskyy said – he insisted that had advantages too.Over time, Zelenskyy reasoned, the White House team would appreciate the Kremlin was not acting in good faith. It would become clear that “the Russians don’t want” an unconditional ceasefire as they threw up more and more objections as the peace talks developed. “People,” he said, meaning Trump’s top team “will not believe the Russians more and more with every day”.Though Zelenskyy signed up Ukraine to theenergy and maritime ceasefire proposed by the US, he knew there were Russian qualifications. Within hours, the Kremlin said its participation in a maritime ceasefire was conditional on agricultural sanctions relief, while reports on Thursday of a power outage in Kherson after Russian shelling suggest the energy ceasefire is not entirely being honoured either.2:50'Volodymyr, you have our support': Starmer details key outcomes of Ukraine summit – videoUnequally applied ceasefires may not obviously be to Ukraine’s advantage, but Zelenskyy acknowledged many details were left vague in the two statements put out by the US (one negotiated withUkraine, one with Russia) because the Trump White House was in a rush to get some sort of deal.“It does not say what happens if somebody violates the ceasefire; the US did not want it to break down,” the president said, suggesting during his briefing “don’t delve too deeply”. For its part Ukraine would document any Russian violations and share them with the US and the world, though the impact on Kremlin behaviour may be limited.Keir Giles, a Russia expert at the Chatham House thinktank, said: “Zelenskyy has assessed that it is better to go along with what is being cooked, rather than to attempt to inject reality into the process, because he has seen what happens if he does the latter.”European leaders agree now ‘not the time’ to lift sanctions against RussiaRead moreWhen, at the beginning of the month, a tired Zelenskyy, still reeling from the Oval Office ambush, said at some point during an hour-plus press briefing in London, that a deal to end the war “is still very, very far away” it was used as justification by the White House to halt military aid and intelligence sharing.That was only restarted when Ukraine committed to a full ceasefire in Saudi Arabia a week or so later, a commitment that Russia has yet to match, arguing, in the words ofVladimir Putin, that any ceasefire should lead to “the elimination of the root causes of the conflict” and therefore more negotiation while the land and air war continues.The problem for Zelenskyy’s strategy is that if there are significant Russian attacks against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, or some other inequality emerges in the Black Sea, it is unsure how long Kyiv will be able to turn the other cheek. On the day of the ceasefire announcement, it was notable that Ukraine’s defence minister immediately warned Russia not to use the ceasefire as a cover for manoeuvring its navy out of the eastern Black Sea, where it has been penned in.Nor is it obvious that the White House would be willing to ramp up the pressure on the Kremlin if the peace talks show only negligible progress. That would represent a sharp change of White House strategy. So far, the US has offered concessions to Moscow, such as ruling out Ukraine’s Nato membership, while Trump appears far more comfortable talking to Putin than Zelenskyy.Putin and his Russian colleagues, said Giles, “will be calculating just how far they can go and how much they can extract from the Americans, before it becomes so embarrassing that even Trump, with no sense of shame or humiliation, says enough is enough”. On Monday in Saudi Arabia, the US and Russia talked about Ukrainian territory, though nothing concrete emerged. Zelenskyy did not make much of that on Tuesday – saying simply that he was “worried” – but in the coming weeks, the president’s newfound patience is likely to be tested again.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeDonald TrumpVladimir PutinanalysisShareReuse this content"

Mark Lowen was inTurkeyto report on the recent protests. He has been told he was deported for ‘being a threat to public order’.”More than 1,850 people have been detained,including 11 Turkish journalists, in the recent protests, which have taken place across the country.Clashes between protesters and security forces escalated on Sunday night, with police using teargas and rubber bullets against some demonstrators. They had previously used pepper spray and water cannon on Thursday.İmamoğlu, seen as Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s main rival for the presidency, is being held on corruption charges, which he denies. His supporters say his arrest is politically motivated. He was nominated as the presidential candidate for Turkey’s main opposition party shortly after he was detained.Lowen said in a statement: “To be detained and deported from the country where I previously lived for five years and for which I have such affection has been extremely distressing.Press freedomand impartial reporting are fundamental to any democracy.”The chief executive ofBBCNews, Deborah Turness, said Lowen’s deportation was “an extremely troubling incident and we will be making representations to the Turkish authorities”.“Mark is a very experienced correspondent with a deep knowledge of Turkey and no journalist should face this kind of treatment simply for doing their job. We will continue to report impartially and fairly on events in Turkey,” she said.Lowen had been reporting directly from the protests and speaking to some of those in the crowds. He said the protests were “galvanising the side of Turkey that feels stifled by President Erdoğan’s authoritarian rule”. When asked what the protesters wanted, one told him they wanted “pure democracy”.“That’s what everyone wants. Nothing more, nothing else,” they said.All forms of media are under scrutiny in Turkey, and popular apps such as Instagram, WhatsApp and YouTube have faced restrictions in recent weeks. Some prominent accounts on X have also been restricted. The Turkish government retains significant power over social media content under laws passed in 2022.On Thursday the broadcasting watchdog, RTÜK, said it was imposing a 10-day broadcast ban on the opposition TV channel Sözcü, after claims of incitement regarding its coverage of the protests.Erdoğan has described the protests as a “movement of violence”, but while there have been some clashes, they have been largely peaceful.Turkey is ranked 158th of 180 countries and territories in an index of world press freedom that Reporters Without Borders (RSF) compiled last year. The lowly ranking was the result of its imprisonment of journalists, online censorship and the government’s control of the judiciary.RSF’s representative in Turkey, Erol Önderoğlu, condemned Lowen’s 17-hour detention. “This professional journalist and specialist on Turkey, where he lived for five years, was accused of being a ‘threat to public order’ for covering the protests in Istanbul,” he said.“RSF calls on the Turkish authorities to stop using the legal system to criminalise journalists and to lift the arbitrary bans on Mark Lowen and other foreign journalists’ entry into Turkish territory.”Agence France-Presse said on Thursday that its photographer Yasin Akgul, who was among those arrested this week while covering the unrest, had been freed. The charges against him, however, have not been dropped. He was detained on Monday on charges of “taking part in illegal rallies and marches”.Akgul was one of the 11 Turkish journalists detained at the start of the week. Seven were later charged and remanded in custody. He was the last to be released. The UN has raised concerns about the arrests, which RSF described as part of a “dramatic escalation in the repression of press freedom”.Explore more on these topicsTurkeyBBCJournalist safetyPress freedomProtestEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The committee would still have nine members: three supreme court judges, the justice minister and another minister, one coalition lawmaker, one opposition lawmaker, and two public representatives – one appointed by the majority and the other by the opposition.In his closing remarks before the vote, Levin criticised the supreme court, saying it had “effectively nullified the Knesset. “It has taken for itself the authority to cancel laws and even basic laws. This is something unheard of in any democracy in the world,” he said.In 2023, changes to the judiciary prompted one of the largest protest movements in Israel’s history. With the announcement of the new bill, rallies were once again held in main cities. On Wednesday, thousands of people protested against the bill before it was approved in parliament.The row came as European far-right leaders flew to Jerusalem for a conference organised by the Israeli government aimed at “combating antisemitism”. The event, which was shunned by mainstream Jewish leaders because of the divisive guest list, illustrated a growing alliance between Israel and the European far right.The supreme court has so far blocked Netanyahu’s attempt to fire Bar. The Shin Bet intelligence chief has been investigating the prime minister’s close aides for alleged breaches of national security, including leaking classified documents to foreign media and allegedly taking money from Qatar, which is known to have given significant financial aid to Hamas.Netanyahu is also attempting to fire the attorney general after Baharav-Miara told him he could not fire Bar until her office had reviewed his motives for doing so.In an unprecedented step on Sunday, Netanyahu’s cabinet approved a no confidence motion against Baharav-Miara, its latest move against officials deemed hostile to the government.Claude Klein, a public law expert at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University, said enactment of the law would be catastrophic. “They want to take real power. Netanyahu thinks that the supreme court is keeping him from running the country his way,” he told Agence-France Presse.Last weekIsraelresumed its military operation in Gaza, shattering the calm of the ceasefire with Hamas. According to the Palestinian health ministry, 855 people have been killed in the renewed assault.On Thursday Hamas said an Israeli strike hit the tent in the Jabaliya area, where its spokesperson Abdel-Latif al-Qanoua was living, killing him. Another strike near Gaza City killed four children and their parents, according to the emergency service of the region’s health ministry.Security sources told Reuters that Egypt, one of the mediators in the Gaza ceasefire negotiations, had received positive indications from Israel over a new ceasefire proposal that would include a transitional phase. The proposal suggests Hamas release five Israeli hostages each week, sources said.Explosions were heard in Jerusalem as Israel said it had intercepted two missiles launched from Yemen. The long-range missiles were fired by the Houthi rebels and were intercepted before crossing into Israeli territory, according to the military.Agence France-Presseand Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite potential violations of classification protocols, federal record-keeping laws and promises of operational security, the leaders look to face no meaningful legal consequences.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, and the defense secretary,Pete Hegseth, have doubled down on the administration’s position that none of the messages in the Signal chat were classified, claiming they amounted to a “team update” that did not name intelligence-collection sources or methods.But Brian Finucane, a former state department attorney with extensive experience in counter-terrorism and military operations, including deliberating and advising on pastUS militarystrikes against the Houthis in Yemen, said the specificity of the information about the aircraft types suggests it was classified.“If I had seen that sort of information beforehand, that was shared with the special operation, in my experience, it would have been classified,” Finucane said. “I can’t guarantee what the state of the information was that Hegseth shared, but in my experience, this kind of pre-operational detail would have been classified.”The US Department of Defense’s own classification guidelines suggest the kind of detailed military plans in the Signal chat would typically be classified at least at the “secret” level, while some of the real-time updates could have risen to a higher level of classification.The information shared by Hegseth included a summary of operational details about the operation to strike Houthi rebel targets inYemen, such as the launch times of F-18 fighter jets, the time that the first bombs were expected to drop, and the time that naval Tomahawk missiles would be launched. Hegseth’s update was sent before the operation had been carried out, and his reference to “clean on OPSEC” – operational security – indicated he recognized the sensitivity.According to the classification guide, information about the “date and time mission/operation begins”, “time lines/schedules” and “concept of operations including order of battle, execution circumstances, operating locations, resources required, tactical maneuvers, deployments” would all usually be classified.The chat also included a message from Mike Waltz, the national security adviser, who shared a real-time update (“first target – their top missile guy – we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend’s building and it’s now collapsed”), which had the potential to reveal the capabilities and assets the US had in the region.The detail of targeting an individual at his girlfriend’s building exposes another legal problem: a military strike that blurs the lines between legitimate warfare and extrajudicial targeting, potentially violating both the War Powers Act’s strategic intent and international humanitarian law’s core principle of distinguishing combatants from civilians.AnAssociated Press reviewfrom Thursday found that there had also been a shift in US airstrikes in Yemen, operating on a widening scope of striking Houthi leadership and urban areas that are still continuing.The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project documented 56 distinct strike events in Yemen between 15 March and 21 March, while the UK-based monitoring group Airwars suggests that at least five US strikes may have resulted in civilian casualties, based on video evidence, Houthi statements, and other documented details. There have been 57 killed in Yemen so far, according to Houthi figures.Finucane explained that the primary areas of legal concern would be the Espionage Act, typically used to target whistleblowers; the Federal Records Act, for federal agencies to preserve documentation; and the Presidential Records Act, which requires the president to save all their records to be transferred to the National Archives post-term.“The bigger-picture question is, who actually authorized what in respect to Yemen?” Finucane said. “It’s not clear what decision Trump actually made. We don’t know what Trump authorized.”A former White House official said that while many in the government use Signal for convenience, this incident can only be summed up as “complete amateur hour”, and that Hegseth’s oversharing would have resulted in immediate security-clearance revocation in previous administrations.“I would have lost my clearance,” the official said. “I mean, these guys won’t lose their clearances, because no one fucking cares about anything any more, but if I would have done this, I would have been investigated, and I would have lost my clearance.”The web of potential misrepresentations extends beyond the White House’s official denial of the chat containing any classified information. Waltz, who according to the screenshots created and invited members into the group, attempted to distance himself from the incident, claiming he had “never met, don’t know, never communicated with” Jeffrey Goldberg, the Atlantic editor-in-chief – a statement complicated by the Atlantic’s reporting suggesting prior communication between the two.White House inadvertently texted top-secret Yemen war plans to journalistRead moreMore than a dozen top-level Trump administration leaders use a Signal group chat, rather than secure government communication channels that they are all well aware of, which raises additional questions about information handling.The officials face a potential Department of Defense inspector general investigation that could become embarrassing for the Trump administration, after the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate armed services committee asked for a review in a rare bipartisan letter on Wednesday.But the officials appear to face no criminal exposure under the Espionage Act, which makes it a crime to improperly disclose “national defense information” regardless of its classification, in part because the Trump justice department is unlikely to prosecute its own cabinet officials.Trump said at an event with his nominees for US ambassadorships at the White House on Tuesday that it was “not really” a matter for the FBI to investigate. Former FBI agents suggested that could be true since it did not involve an act of espionage for a foreign adversary.The immediate legal consequence is likely to come in a lawsuit filed on Tuesday that accuses Hegseth; the CIA director, John Ratcliffe; the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and others of flouting federal records retention laws.In the 18-page suit, the watchdog group American Oversight asks a federal judge to compel the Trump administration to preserve the messages in the Signal chat, arguing that the use of a function that automatically deleted the messages after a certain time was unlawful.The suit was assigned on Wednesday to James Boasberg, the chief US district judge in Washington DC, who is also presiding in the other major national security case involving the administration, over the deportations of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act.At issue for the administration in that case is that it flouted Boasberg’s verbal order to turn back flights that had already departed, and then stonewalled his inquiry into the possible violation of the order by invoking national security protections.The aggressive approach that the administration took in the deportations case could become awkward in the new lawsuit over the Signal chat, with Boasberg likely to be skeptical from the outset of officials’ shifting interpretations of which materials are classified.What that would mean in practical terms remains unclear. The Atlantic magazine releasing the full Signal text chain renders some of the suit redundant, since the messages are now in the public domain. But Boasberg could, for instance, order some fact-finding into the matter.Explore more on these topicsSignal group chat leakTrump administrationPete HegsethRepublicansUS militaryUS politicsYemenanalysisShareReuse this content"

It is understood that this visit, where the king plans to become the first British sovereign to address both houses of the Italian parliament, is expected to go ahead as planned.The king had been due to meet ambassadors in audiences at Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon and to travel to Birmingham on Friday, but these were postponed.The king visited the London Clinic, the same hospital where he was treated for an enlarged prostate in January 2024, on Thursday morning.It is understood the side-effects, the specifics of which have not been disclosed, were temporary and not uncommon with many medical treatments.He was not joined by the queen during his brief stay, and travelled to and from the hospital by car.After he returned home to Clarence House, the king was said to be on good form, and was reported to be working on state papers and making calls from his study.A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: “His majesty was due to receive credentials from the ambassadors of three different nations this afternoon.“Tomorrow he was due to undertake four public engagements in Birmingham, and is greatly disappointed to be missing them on this occasion.“He very much hopes that they can [be] rescheduled in due course and offers his deepest apologies to all those who had worked so hard to make the planned visit possible.”The announcement from the palace was made late on Thursday evening because the king needed time to consult his staff and medical team after he returned to Clarence House.Since his diagnosis last year, the king’s diary of engagements is understood to have been developed in full consultation with his medical team at all stages to protect his recovery.It was decided on balance that it was wiser to cancel the visit to Birmingham, which involved four back-to-back engagements, as a precautionary measure.Sources told PA Media the hospital visit was not a major development and no further updates were expected on the king’s health, with any minor alterations to his diary that may be required next week being announced in due course.Charles became king on 8 September 2022after the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II.When announcing his cancer diagnosis last February, the palace asked for privacy and only confirmed it was a “form of cancer”.The king was diagnosed after a “separate issue of concern was noted” and investigated while he was being treated for a benign prostate condition.In December 2024,the palace said the king’s “treatment has been moving in a positive directionand as a managed condition the treatment cycle will continue into next year”.When asked how he was that month during a visit with the queen to Walthamstow in north-east London, the king smiled as he replied: “I’m still alive.”Explore more on these topicsKing Charles IIIMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

It comes after a three-and-a-half-year investigation into theresignation of Prof Kathleen Stock, who was the target of protests at Sussex over her views on gender identification and transgender rights.The university intends to challenge the size of the fine – 15 times larger than any previous penalty levied by the OfS – through tribunal, and also seek a judicial review of the judgment.Sasha Roseneil, who joined as vice-chancellor a year after the investigation began, said she was initially shocked by the OfS’s judgment but was confident the courts would find in the university’s favour.“I think our position is extremely strong, and I think they will lose a judicial review. But I’m not surprised that they’ve dug in, because [the OfS] has been so determined to pursue this, and so unwilling to engage,” Roseneil said in an interview with the Guardian.University of Sussex fined £585,000 for failing to uphold freedom of speechRead moreRoseneil said Sussex had substantially overturned sections of the OfS’s interim judgment, delivered last year, which would have fined the university £1m for a string of additional allegations.She said: “The provisional decision was much, much worse, and we rebutted it at length. We sent back a 2,000-page response, and they have reduced the fine from the provisional decision – a million-pound fine – to £585,000 and they’ve dropped quite a lot of what they were alleging against us.“They haven’t explained why they’ve dropped any of it but one has to imagine they realised that they weren’t on strong legal grounds, and we produced a lot of evidence against what they were saying, including evidence against what they’re still saying.”An OfS spokesperson said: “We are confident in the decisions made in this case and will vigorously defend any legal action.”Roseneil said the OfS refused to meet the leadership team at Sussex or interview those involved, with the exception of Stock, and instead relied on thousands of pages it requested from the university. She said that when she arrived at Sussex in 2022 she sought a meeting with OfS executives to discuss the investigation but was turned down.Arif Ahmed, the OfS’s director for freedom of speech and academic freedom, defended the regulator’s methods. He said: “There may have been occasions where [Sussex] wanted to see somebody, and in fact that was done in writing instead, I’m quite sure that could well have happened. But the engagement would nevertheless have happened in the sense that we communicated with them and they communicated with us.”But Roseneil said the OfS had refused to tell Sussex if its amended policies had met its conditions. She said: “We have been up for working with the OfS on these difficult issues but they have just wanted to prosecute us, even persecute us, on this. It’s a very sorry state for a regulator to be doing this rather than actually trying to help the sector work better.”The OfS’s final ruling focuses on a trans and non-binary equality policy statement passed in 2018, which the regulator argued had “a chilling effect” that could result in self-censorship by staff and students.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said she “tried to raise the matter with superiors but to no avail”, and added: “Over time, my teaching about sex and gender in feminist philosophy grew increasingly cautious, and most of my criticism of the sudden sanctification of gender identity took place elsewhere.”Roseneil said: “Obviously she left long before I arrived but it is deeply regrettable that Kathleen [Stock] wasn’t supported to the extent that she felt able to stay working at Sussex. I regret that.”Ministers to revise university freedom of speech legislationRead moreBut she said the OfS had erred by inflating the statement into a “governing document” of the university. “The whole case rests on it being a governing document. This is a really small statement, of which we have many dozens, if not hundreds, of similar policies and statements. Whereas the governing documents of the university are its charter and statutes and regulations. So that’s the core of the problem.”Roseneil said the OfS policy was a “sort of libertarian, free speech absolutism” that meant universities were unable to apply rules for anything other than unlawful behaviour or speech.“We can’t now say that we will remove or take down antisemitic or anti-Muslim propaganda because not all such propaganda is illegal,” she said.Explore more on these topicsUniversity of SussexHigher educationFreedom of speechOffice for StudentsStudentsUniversitiesEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Musk also downplayed the number of government employees his initiative has targeted in cuts, saying it was a small percentage of the overall government workforce and others left voluntarily.“Basically almost no one has gotten fired,” Musk claimed. His initiative has planned to layoff or offer buyouts to100,000 federal employees, although courts have orderedthousands of workers to be reinstatedafter finding they were illegally fired.Doge shutters federal workplace mediator agency after Trump orderRead moreMusk and his team at Doge have rapidly accumulated power across federal agencies since inauguration day. They have led the dismantling of USAID, the world’s largest single source of humanitarian aid, as well as fired thousands of government workers. Doge staffers and Musk allies have also gainedaccess to sensitive government data, as well as been placed in key positions at major government agencies.Doge staffers took turns during the interview framing their efforts as vital to the survival of the government and claiming their overhaul would help Americans. Asked abouta Washington Post reportthat cuts at the Social Security Administration caused the agency’s website to repeatedly crash and resulted in long waits, Musk claimed that he would keep the website online and increase benefits.“Legitimate recipients of social security will receive more money not less money,” Musk said. “Let the record show that I said this.”Other members of Doge touted their previous experience working as tech executives, claiming that they could import ideas from Silicon Valley and private enterprises into government.“We really believe that the government can have an Apple Store-like experience,” said Joe Gebbia, a Doge team member who co-founded Airbnb.The Fox News interview on Thursday took place as nationwide protests are planned against Musk at Tesla showrooms this coming weekend. Doge is also facing nearly two dozen lawsuits that allege Musk and his team acted without legal authority while violating privacy and transparency laws. He has reacted to the legal pushback and judges’ rulings against the Trump administration bycalling on Congress to impeach justicesand radically overhaul the judicial system.Many Doge members have also come under individual public and media scrutiny for their youth andlack of experiencein government. Their behavior at agencies has drawn additional criticism from federal employees, who have reported that Doge staffers have siloed themselves off from other workers, hidden their names on video calls andset up Ikea bedsto sleep inside federal buildings.Several Doge workers have already become involved in scandals surrounding their suitability to work with sensitive government systems that affect millions of people. Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old listed as a “senior adviser” at the state department, previouslyprovided tech support to a cybercrime gang, according to a Reuters investigation.Another Doge staffer who was given access to treasury department systems, 25-year-old Marko Elez, resigned followinga Wall Street Journal reportthat found he was linked to a social media account that made numerous posts that advocated for racism and eugenics. Musk held a poll on X asking if Elez should return, however, and he wasreinstated later that monthat the Social Security Administration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Steve Davis, who helped facilitate Musk’s mass layoffs at X and became president of his Boring Company in 2018, isreportedly runningDoge’s daily operations. Davis sat beside Musk during the interview on Thursday.Polling shows thatthe majority of American voters disapproveof Musk’s initiative, with attitudes to Doge largely divided along partisan lines. Musk’s own favorability among Americans is similar,according to a Pew Research Centersurvey taken in late January which found Americans overall hold a more negative view of the Tesla CEO.Musk previouslyappeared on Fox Businessearlier this month to tout Doge’s achievements, as well as claim that he was planning on doubling the team’s staff. He has also been extremely active boasting about Doge’s cost-cutting efforts on X, the social media platform that he owns, although there has been very little public transparency into how the initiative is operating and what savings it is actually making. Analyses of Doge’s public “wall of receipts” website havefound it full of errorsand the site hasdeleted billions in claimed savingsfrom its ledger without explanation.In the same interview, Musk said he was running his slew of businesses, which include X, SpaceX and Tesla, “with great difficulty” because of his work with theTrump administration. Musk has lost some $100bn from his personal fortune due to a slump in Tesla’s stock this year.Toward the end of the segment, Baier showed part of an additional one-on-one interview with Musk in which he was asked about calling the Arizona Senator Mark Kelly a “traitor” for visiting Ukraine. Musk appeared to double down on his attack, saying that Kelly’s credentials as navy combat veteran and former astronaut didn’t matter if he “put the interests of another country above America”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationElon MuskFox NewsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Prosecutors declined to bring criminal charges against the deputy who used a Taser on Burch and wrestled with him in a Huerfano county jail cell. In making the decision, district attorney Henry Solano cited self-defense laws.An autopsy found six of Burch’s right-side ribs had been broken and his right lung had collapsed. He wasn’t taken to a hospital but instead was transferred to another cell where he was found dead seven days later.“The simple act of breathing became so painful as Mr Burch’s shattered ribs continued to pierce and tear through his organs that his body stopped using his right lung, which shrank to half the normal size,” lawyers for Burch’s estate said in the federal lawsuit.Defendants in the case include the Huerfano county commissioners, sheriff’s office, individual sheriff’s officials, paramedics and the hospital they worked for, as well as nurses and the non-profit company contracted to provide healthcare to prisoners.The lawsuit accuses them of causing Burch’s fatal injuries and not doing anything to treat them, violating his constitutional rights.A lawyer representing the county and sheriff’s office, Eric Ziporin, declined to comment. Representatives of the hospital and the healthcare company declined comment.One of the family’s lawyers, Qusair Mohamedbhai, said Burch’s relationship with his children had been strained by his mental health problems, but they had hoped he would have a relationship with his grandchildren. Now they have nightmares about how painful their father’s final days must have been.“This is gulag-type behavior that simply should not exist anywhere,” he said.Burch was tackled after he refused to drop a pencil he had been given. A deputy warned him “drop it or we’ll drop you”, according to body camera footage. Once the Taser was used, Burch rushed toward the deputy and the video, which becomes obscured, shows him going to the ground near a steel bench with his arms held by the deputy. The lawsuit says Burch was tackled into the bench, which broke his ribs.Burch, a former California prison guard, was arrested on 25 March 2023, after a series of erratic acts, including driving to the home of two strangers and swinging a rubber mallet.According to the lawsuit, his mental health was not evaluated when he arrived at the jail, although video shows sheriff’s official signaling he was mentally unstable by stirring her finger next to her head after he was hit with the Taser and tackled on 28 March 2023.Burch screamed and moaned as the deputy used a knee to keep him on the ground when he was accused of resisting. Later he appeared calmer as paramedics evaluated him. He said his ribs had been crushed and he wanted to go to the hospital, but family members allege in their lawsuit that the paramedics did not evaluate his chest.Body camera footage shows one paramedic briefly lifting up Burch’s shirt, but the lawsuit said no one listened to his lungs with a stethoscope or took vital signs.After Burch told a sheriff’s captain that he barely survived the night on 1 April 2023, he was seen over video by a contracted nurse in Mississippi, who did not ask to see his chest, the lawsuit said. Instead, it described the interaction as focused on Burch’s mental health.Three days later, he was found dead on the concrete floor of his cell.Explore more on these topicsColoradoUS policingUS prisonsUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Passenger bookings on Canada to US routes are currently down by over 70% compared to the same period last year.Comparing the available bookings from March 2024 to March 2025, OAG looked at how many people have booked trans-border flights in the six-month period between April through September. It found that the number of tickets booked was down anywhere from 71% to 76%.Donald Trump announces new 25% tariffs on cars from overseasRead moreTotal capacity available for passengers on flights between the two countries has also seen a reduction, likely a response to decreasing demands. The data shows that more than 320,000 seats have been removed by airlines operating between the two countries through to the end of October, with the highest cuts, 3.5%, also occurring during the peak summer months.But the steep decline suggests that the current capacity cuts do not even begin to cover the current disinterest in traveling to the US.The dramatic drop in bookings suggests that Canadian travelers are holding off on making reservations, probably due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding the tariff war. Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, called thelatest roundof Trump’s tariffs a “direct attack” on Canadian workers.Though a decline in travel betweenCanadaand the US was expected, the substantial 70% drop in bookings could require drastic changes for airlines, such as Air Canada, which is the airline that has the largest network of border crossings between the neighboring countries.Beyond the trade dispute, some Canadians say they feel increasingly uneasy crossing into the US following several high-profile incidents of foreign visitors beingdetained by Ice.Explore more on these topicsAir transportCanadaTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS foreign policyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The firings should be legally declared “unlawful and ineffective”, it argues, adding that the court should formally instruct the FTC’s leadership to allow Slaughter and Bedoya to serve out the remainder of their terms.Fired FTC commissioner raises concern over Trump ties to tech billionairesRead moreUnder the FTC Act, a commissioner can only be removed by the president for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. The act also says that no more than three of the FTC’s five commissioners can be of the same political party. After the terminations, the FTC currently holds a 3–0 Republican majority.“The president’s attempt to terminate commissioners Bedoya and Slaughter is contrary to federal law and nearly a century of supreme court precedent,” said Amit Agarwal, special counsel for Protect Democracy, which is representing Slaughter and Bedoya in the lawsuit. “This isn’t aboutDemocratsversus Republicans or liberals versus conservatives – it’s about an economy governed by laws rather than political whims.”Slaughter and Bedoya wereinformed of their terminationson 18 March in an email message from Trent Morse, deputy director of presidential personnel, according to the complaint. It included a message from the president: “I am writing to inform you that you have been removed from the Federal Trade Commission, effective immediately.”The lawsuit alleges that the message from Trump failed to identify any “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office” to support the firings, as the FTC Act would require.Trump fires FTC’s only two Democrats: ‘The President just illegally fired me’Read moreInstead, the message stated that the commissioners’ “continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my administration’s priorities. Accordingly, I am removing you from office pursuant to my authority under Article II of the constitution.”Additionally, the lawsuit accuses Trump of violating the first amendment of the US constitution. “By purporting to remove Plaintiffs from their positions without cause … President Trump deprived plaintiffs of their property interests without affording them due process of law, thereby violating the fifth amendment,” it states.Both commissioners have been vocally critical of Trump’s decision to fire them, with many legal experts agreeing with the illegality of the move. Bedoya has called it an “interesting coincidence” that he was dismissed afterpublicly criticizingJeff Bezos, the billionaire Amazon founder, citing the cases he has brought forward against the e-commerce giant, and his concern about the growing influence of billionaires in government.Slaughter was nominated to be commissioner in 2018 during Trump’s first presidency. She was renominated and confirmed again in 2024, under then president Joe Biden.

But these wines won’t be arriving stateside anytime soon.After the Trump administration threatened on 13 March to impose200% tariffson alcoholic products from Europe, many US importers like Bush have halted all outgoing shipments from Europe.The 1,100 cases of his wine, from family-owned producers in his company’s modest European portfolio, have already been paid for. But due to the tariff threat, they will remain stranded at their respective domaines at least until 2 April when the Trump administration is expected to reveal a “reciprocal tariff number” for each of its global trading partners.The newfound uncertainty around tariffs has many restaurant owners, beverage directors, liquor distributors and wine importers on edge in recent weeks. The only certainty among the trade professionals interviewed is that a 200% tariff would be catastrophic for the wine and spirits industry globally. And while most believe the actual number will end up much lower, everyone agrees that even modest tariffs would send shock waves throughout the entire food and beverage ecosystem, weakening distribution channels and further driving up already astronomical prices.Rising fears of Trump tariffs pummel US consumer confidence to four-year lowRead more“What scares me is how these hypothetical tariffs would affect [the many] European-themed restaurants like French bistros, Italian trattorias and German beer halls,” said Richard Hanauer, wine director and partner with Lettuce Entertain You. The Chicago-based group owns, manages and licenses more than 130 restaurants and 60 brands in a dozen different states and Washington DC. Hanauer predicts that concept-driven eateries that rely on European products would have to source wine and spirits from other regions because “the consumer is not going to accept the markup”.Even though Trump has been known to walk backdubious claims about tariffsbefore, the wine and spirits industry is taking this recent threat very seriously. Most American importers, such as Loci’s Bush, are adhering to the US Wine Trade Alliance’s (USWTA)guidance issued in mid-Marchwarning its members to cease wine shipments from Europe. Without guarantees that any potential tariffs would come with a notice period or exemptions for wines shipped prior to their announcement, the organization had no choice but to advise its constituents to halt all EU wine shipments.“Once the wine is on the water, we have no power,” said Bush. “We’re billed by our shippers as soon as the wine arrives.”Tariffs are import taxes incurred by the importer and paid as a percentage of the value of the freight at the point of entry upon delivery. Since shipments from Europe can often take up to six to eight weeks to arrive, firms like Loci face the predicament of not knowing how much they will owe to take delivery of their products when they reach US ports.“We’ve had many US importers tell us that even a 50% unplanned tariff could bankrupt their businesses, so we felt we had no choice,” said Benjamin Aneff, president of the USWTA, of the organization’s injunction. “It’s a sad situation. These are mostly small, family-owned businesses.”Europe’s wineries can also ill afford to be dragged into a trade war with the United States. According to the International Trade Center, the US comprises almost20% of the EU’s total wine exports, accounting for a total of $14.1bn (€13.1bn) of exported beverage, spirit and vinegar products from the EU in 2024.Many independent importers still recall Trump levying$7.5bn of tariffs on exportsfrom the EU during his first presidency, which included 25% duties on Scotch whiskey, Italian cheeses, certain French wines and other goods. These retaliatory measures, which took effect in October 2019, resulted from a years-long trade dispute between the US and the EU over airline subsidies.“We were hit with duties in late 2019. But we negotiated with a lot of our suppliers, so we were able to stave off any significant price increases,” said André Tamers, the founder of De Maison Selections, a fine-wine importer with a large portfolio of French and Spanish wines and spirits. But because the Covid-19 pandemic hit shortly thereafter, Tamers admitted, it was difficult to gauge the impact of the first round of Trump tariffs. The Biden administration eventuallyrescinded the measuresin June 2021.To pre-empt any potentially disastrous news on the tariff front, many restaurants and bars are ramping up inventory purchases to the extent that their budgets allow. “We made some large commitments for rosé season,” said Grant Reynolds, co-founder of Parcelle, which has an online wine shop as well as two bars and a bricks-and-mortar retail outlet in Manhattan. “To whatever we can reasonably afford, we’ve decided to secure those commitments sooner than later so that we can better weather the storm.”The same is true for many cocktail-focused bars around the country, which are looking to shore up supplies of popular spirits that could end up a victim of tariffs, including allocated scotches and rare cognacs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotion“If it becomes very apparent that these tariffs are going to go live, we could be looking at dropping close to $100,000 on inventory just to insulate ourselves because it will save us so much money over the next six months,” said Deke Dunne, beverage director of Washington DC’s award-winning cocktail bar Allegory. “It will have to be a game-time decision, though, because the last thing I want to do is to buy up a lot of inventory I don’t need.” Hanauer said that he’s seen some vendors offering wine buyers heavy discounts and incentives to stockpile cases of European products to prepare for the possibility of onerous tariffs.One bar owner feeling a little less panic compared with his industry counterparts is Fred Beebe, co-owner of Post Haste, a sustainability-minded cocktail bar in Philadelphia. Since it opened in 2023, Post Hasteeschews imported spirits of any kind; the bar is stocked exclusively with US products from east of the Mississippi River. “We always thought it would be advantageous to have our producers close to us for environmental reasons and to support the local economy,” said Beebe, “but we didn’t necessarily think that it would also benefit from fluctuations in distribution or global economic policy.”Donald Trump announces new 25% tariffs on cars from overseasRead moreInstead of serving popular European liquor brands such as Grey Goose vodka or Hendrick’s gin, the bar highlights local craft distillers such as Maggie’s Farm in Pittsburgh, which produces a domestic rum made from Louisiana sugar cane. After the recent tariff threats, Beebe says, the decision to rely on local products has turned out to be fortuitous. “I feel really bad for anyone who is running an agave-based program, a tequila or mezcal bar,” said Beebe. “They must be worried constantly about whether the price of all of their products are going to go up by 25% to 50%.”On the importing side, there is agreement that this is an inopportune moment for the wine industry to face new headwinds. Wine consumption has steadily declined in the United States in recent years as gen Z and millennial consumers are turning to cannabis, hard seltzers and spirits such as tequila, or simply embracing sobriety in greater numbers.“Unfortunately, the reality is that wine consumption was already down before this compared to what it was five years ago,” said Reynolds. “This obviously doesn’t help that. So, with more tariffs, you would start to see a greater shift of behaviors away from drinking wine.”But despite slumping sales and the impending tariff threats, niche importers like Tamers say they have little choice but to stay the course. “You leave yourself vulnerable, but if you don’t buy wine, then you don’t have any wine to sell. So, it’s a double-edged sword,” he said. “Our customers are still asking for these products, so there’s not much else we can do.”Aneff hopes that commonsense negotiations will lead to both parties divorcing alcohol tariffs from other trade disputes over aluminum, steel and digital services.“I do have some hope for a potential sectoral agreement on wine, and perhaps spirits, which would benefit domestic producers and huge numbers of small businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,” he said. “I can’t think of anything that would bring more joy to people’s glasses than ensuring free trade on wine.”Explore more on these topicsWineOur unequal earthTrump tariffsTrump administrationFoodUS politicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I hope they come up with a just decision,” the former UBS and Citigroup trader said.Hayes, 45, served five-and-a-half years in prison for rigging Libor, a benchmark interest rate once used in the financial markets to underpin more than $350tn of loans and securities. The scandal led to fines of almost $10bn for a dozen banks and brokerages.The court of appeal last year upheld the guilty verdict, saying there was“indisputable documentary evidence”that he had sought to move Libor and that he had made “frank admissions of dishonesty” – arguments repeated by the Serious Fraud Office during the latest hearing.However, Hayes’s counsel, Adrian Darbishire KC, said there had been a “core error” underpinning the case that marked a “failure to respect the limits of the role of the judge in a jury trial”.The judge’s original directions had “entered territory that has to be left to the jury”, Darbishire told a panel of five senior judges in London. “What happened in the Hayes case was not consistent with well-established principles of English law.”The jury was wrongly instructed by the trial judge that the rules for the rates setting process prohibited considering the bank’s commercial interest before making their submissions, Hayes’s lawyers said.The trader has also said he was prevented from submitting evidence of his daily profit and loss accounts in his original trial, which he says would have undermined the prosecution’s case that he profited personally.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kazakhstan’s Mikhail Shaidorov (94.77), this year’s Four Continents winner, sits in third but more than 15 points adrift of Malinin’s mark.Amber Glenn, the skater redefining what power looks like on the iceRead more“I can’t describe how I feel right now,” Malinin said. “All I remember is getting on that ice. I felt really nervous, more than usual, and I didn’t know what was going to happen. But once the music came on, I just got into a flow state and it really just went from there.”Malinin’s performance, set to Running by the American rapper NF, included a clean quadruple flip, a triple Axel and a quad Lutz–triple toe loop combination. He typically saves his signature quad Axel – the four-and-a-half-revolution jump that had never been landed in competition until Malininpulled it off at the 2022 US Classic– for the free skate. He hasn’t lost since 2023 and is riding a win streak of eight straight events.By the time he completed his final step sequence with about a half-minute to go, the entire building was on its feet and aroar. “I heard the cheering but I didn’t take enough time to see how people were reacting to me,” Malinin said. “I was so excited. I didn’t even finish skating yet and they were already standing and cheering me so loud.”His main rival, Kagiyama, was elegant and precise in his own right through his exquisite routine to Montenegrin guitarist Miloš Karadaglic’s cover of The Sound of Silence, continuing a return to form after an injury-hit season. The 2022 Olympic and three-time world silver medalist had offered an extraordinary confession seated beside Malinin at last year’s worlds after coming in second – “If we both perform at 100% of our ability, I don’t think that I will be able to win,” he said – but has spent the year recommitting himself to closing the gap.Yet in Thursday’s aftermath, a familiar resignation crept into the frame. “He does all those difficult jumps, and he makes them look effortless,” the 21-year-old from Nagoya said through a translator. “Maybe he is putting [out] effort, but to us, it looks effortless and really easy. And it’s not just his jumps. I feel like his skating and his artistry, his expression is getting better year by year, so I’m starting to think he’s invincible.”View image in fullscreenJapan’s Yuma Kagiyama sits in second place after Thursday’s short program at the world figure skating championships in Boston.Photograph: Joosep Martinson/International Skating Union/Getty ImagesBehind them, France’s Adam Siao Him Fa – bronze medallist at last year’s worlds and the reigning European champion – has work to do after falling on the back half of his opening quad Lutz-triple toe combination and placing ninth (87.22). The 23-year-old was the last skater to beat Malinin internationally, back at the 2023 Grand Prix de France, and has rebounded well from injury earlier this season. And it warrants mention the Nice-based Siao Him Fa has scratched back on this stage before, reaching the podium last year after placing 19th in the short.The men’s free skate on Saturday will bring more than medals into play. Malinin is expected to attempt a full seven-quad layout, including the quad Axel, and he’ll likely feature his signature backflip – a legal addition to his program for the first time at worlds.The move hasn’t been landedlegallyat a world championships in nearly 50 years. The last to do it was American Terry Kubicka in 1976, after which the International Skating Union banned the element for being too dangerous. It returned last June, with the ISU stating: “Somersault-type jumps are very spectacular and nowadays it is not logical anymore to include them as illegal movements.”Famously, France’s Surya Bonaly defied the ban at the 1998 Nagano Olympics, landing a one-footed backflip in protest. Though penalized, the move became a symbol of resistance and individuality in the sport.Malinin first debuted the backflip in competitionat the Lombardia Trophyin September and has used it as a crowd-pleasing punctuation ever since. “It fits the music really well,” he’s said. “It gets that audience applause, feels really suspenseful, and I really just like doing it.”While it doesn’t earn points, the flip enhances his performance scores and speaks to his creative flair – something few others in the field can match.It’s that combination – technical innovation, competitive nerve and choreographic audacity – that’s made Malinin a star. And the crowd seems to be catching on. The lower bowl and much of the upper deck of the 17,850-seat TD Garden were filled for Friday afternoon’s session – an unusually robust crowd for a Thursday afternoon in a sport where weekday sessions often play to half-full arenas. It was a signal that Malinin’s profile is growing, both within the sport and beyond.Fellow Americans Andrew Torgashev and Jason Brown also delivered solid performances, with Torgashev finishing eighth (87.27) and Brown 12th (84.72) after each posted their highest international scores of the season. But Friday belonged to Malinin. He skated clean, he skated fearless, and on a stage primed for something bigger, he delivered his best.The first medals of this year’s worlds will be doled out later Thursday with the pairs’ free skate, with Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara of Japan leading Italy’s Sara Conti and Niccolo Macii after Wednesday’s short program.Explore more on these topicsFigure skatingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

But the announcement made on Thursday by NBA commissioner Adam Silver and Fiba secretary general Andreas Zagklis is a major step forward after a long process.The league would probably use Fiba rules, such as a 40-minute game instead of the NBA’s 48-minute model, Silver said. But much of the other details – such as the teams and where they would play – will be determined in the months ahead.‘A free ticket to travel’: the Americans forging basketball careers in EuropeRead more“We feel now is the time to move to that next stage,” Silver said, noting that NBA owners offered “enthusiastic support” for such a move.The NBA and Fiba, the sport’s global governing body, were in discussions for some time about adding either an annual competition in Europe or having an NBA-operated league there. It was a topic at a Board of Governors meeting this past September, one where Zagklis took part.“Coming out of the most successful World Cup and Olympics ever, we also believe it is the right time to take the next step for club basketball,” Zagklis said.In January, when the league took advantage of the trip to France to meet with European stakeholders, Silver said he believes the NBA remains “on track” in the process of expanding its footprint in Europe. That was also when he said the league’s governors would be briefed further at the March meeting.“The response we’ve gotten from the marketplace is very positive,” Silver said.Zagklis said Fiba’s leadership also unanimously agrees that it’s the right time to partner with the NBA on a new league.“Our role as a federation is to unite the basketball ecosystem,” Zagklis said.It is unclear how the new competition would fit into the existing structure of European basketball, which has a number of thriving and well-supported leagues across the continent.Explore more on these topicsNBABasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Yet while it was neither unexpected nor particularly surprising, there is more to it than simple dissatisfaction with an underperforming driver. Replacing him with Yuki Tsunoda was a U-turn that indicates fundamental problems the team are facing, ones to which they are unlikely to find a quick fix, and that Max Verstappen is unhappy at their performance and indeed their prospects for the new season.Lawson, who had already looked shell-shocked by the close of the second race in China last weekend, was left entreating the team to give him just a little more time.Red Bullwere not forthcoming. On Thursday morning they announced he would be replaced by Tsunoda from their sister team, RB, the Japanese driver having originally been passed over for the seat in Lawson’s favour at the end of last season.Verstappen makes feelings known after Red Bull drop Lawson for TsunodaRead moreThe New Zealander was less experienced but expected to be better able to come up to speed and to come closer to matching Verstappen, the defending world champion, but it really did not go to plan. He endured the worst sequence of qualifying in the team’s history, 18th in Australia, 19th for the sprint in China and 20th for the GP. He crashed out in the Melbourne race and went pointless in both races at Shanghai.Far from being close to Verstappen he was not even that close to the midfield, flailing with a car he could barely manage and with no obvious indication that he was going to come to terms with it, although two races is a very short time for anyone with only 11 grands prix under his belt to have a handle on a brand new ride.So Red Bull pulled the trigger. Yet it is impossible not to surmise there was more to it than Lawson not being up to scratch. The team are simply not where they expected to be at the start of this season. Having endured the second half of last year with a car that was unstable and sorely lacking in balance – which Verstappen nonetheless still managed to drag to the title – the target had been to address the issues over the winter and come back with a solid drive for the Dutchman’s defence and to vie for the constructors’ championship.In the statement announcing the switch,Christian Hornerconceded as much. “We acknowledge there is a lot of work to be done with the RB21,” the team principal said. Which in F1 terms is a seismic admission from a man in his position. The expected development of the car has not been achieved and even in Verstappen’s hands it is at best still well behind the McLaren and perhaps struggling to match the Mercedes.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen is unhappy with Red Bull’s performance and their prospects for the new season.Photograph: ShutterstockWhen they took Lawson on, this was not expected to be the case but given it is then Tsunoda, with 89 grands prix under his belt, suddenly looks the better option to help work through the problems, as Horner acknowledged. “Yuki’s experience will prove highly beneficial in helping to develop the current car,” he said.Red Bull enjoyed a hugely dominant car in 2022 and 2023, especially, but the direction it has gone in since has not proved beneficial, while the opposition has caught up and in McLaren’s case leapt ahead. Verstappen has been making this point for no short time now and doubtless is not satisfied that the shortcomings remain. That he is less than impressed with the team’s handling of the situation might be gauged by the fact that he liked a post on Instagram by the former F1 driver Giedo van der Garde, who described Red Bull’s treatment of Lawson as “closer to bullying or a panic move”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tsunoda must be seen as part of the process of addressing this, and Lawson almost as collateral damage. Yet in mitigation for the New Zealander, there is another fundamental hurdle for any number-two driver at Red Bull and that is that the car has long been designed to suit the strengths of their world champion.Verstappen enjoys a very pointy front to the car, with oversteer, to enjoy a sharp turn-in to the corner, ramped up as far as possible. “That’s where [he] excels,” said Horner in China. “That’s where he’s able to live on a knife’s edge of adhesion and he’s just constantly asking for more and more front out of the car.”The side effect of this, as Horner noted, is that it makes the rear of the car unsettled, loose on corner entry, which can be enormously hard to control and adapt to, especially if you are new to it. Which, in turn, can grind away at the confidence, leaving drivers bereft and questioning their own abilities. Sergio Pérez was nowhere near as woeful a driver as his performances for the last two years at Red Bull suggested but he simply could not handle the car. Lawson replaced him only to find himself in similar deep water and now Tsunoda has a shot at this poisoned chalice.He will face a similarly tough challenge, a huge test of his skill and his mettle, but for Red Bull his appointment is part of a far bigger picture. They need to adapt, to develop and to do it fast, and it is Tsunoda’s potential ability to cope with the fundamental frailties of the car and deliver feedback on how to fix it that has put him in the hot seat. If he too is found wanting, Red Bull have very few options left.Explore more on these topicsRed BullMax VerstappenChristian HornerFormula OneMotor sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

I expressed that I wanted to quit athletics.”A few days later Ingrid, who is now 18, said she had broken down in tears in front of producers of the fly-on-the-wall series.“They asked me a normal question, about the future of my career,” she added. “Then I saw no future. Then I broke down brutally. I couldn’t control it. They looked at me with their backs turned and were horrified. The interview ended.”The documentary series is the most successful show in Norwegian TV history, but Ingrid told the court that it didn’t always reflect the reality of family life.“I was five years old when the recording began,” she said. “This is something I grew up with and lived with, without having had a real choice myself. You could easily notice that something changed when a camera came along. I think they probably got a lot that wasn’t included.“The entire series is not rigged, but certain situations and conversations could have been rigged,” she added. “We were placed in the kitchen and ‘now we’re going to talk about this’. But the conversations we had were real.”According to the indictment, Gjert is alleged to have used threats, coercion and violence against his daughter, as well as restricted her freedom of movement.Gjert, who is facing six years in jail for abusive behaviour towards Jakob and Ingrid, denies all allegations of violence.On her second day of her evidence, Ingrid also told the court that her father had put his finger in her face and whipped her with a wet towel when she asked to go out with friends.She said that the relationship with her father had broken down after she had decided to stop running the previous autumn, and that she had been forced to stay at home during her free time against her will.“He could ignore me completely,” she said. “I felt like he was mad at me. And one day he said that he didn’t see me as his daughter any more.”Asked about the incident in January 2022, Ingrid said she had pushed back when he refused to let her hang out with friends between 5pm and 6pm, only for him to put his finger in her face.“I had felt trapped in my own home for so long,” she said. “I was pretty determined that today I would make it happen. I didn’t accept the ‘no’ I got from him.“I had been so depressed and ignored for several months, I simply felt bullied. I pushed his finger away. To this day I don’t understand how I dared to do it, but I was probably pretty upset and angry.“He had a small towel that he had been sweating in, so it was wet. He whipped it at my face. First once without hitting. Then he did it once more, and then he hit me on the cheek.”Ingrid told the court that she then ran to the wife of her brother Henrik, who lived two doors away. Afterwards she said her father called her “many times and said that if I didn’t come, he would kind of come and get me”.Under cross-examination, Ingrid was shown a series of text messages between her and her father in 2021, which she agreed showed that she had never asked for a day off from training before she quit running.The court was also shown a text message from Gjert on 6 January 2022, after he was alleged to have hit her with the towel. “I apologise with all my heart,” it read. “I promise that I will never raise my voice against you again in my entire life.”On Monday the court was shown a photograph of the mark on Ingrid’s face.The incident led to Jakob and his two brothers ending their training relationship with Gjert and going public with their allegations. The trial, which is due to last until 16 May, continues.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Guardian has seen footage of the 78-year-old’s remarks about Tuchel, which came when he was asked whetherEnglandwere right to appoint the German.“I don’t know,” Redknapp said before making comments designed to amuse his audience. “I’ll be honest with you, I think he’s a German spy. I’m telling you. Seriously, he’s been sent over to fuck us up. He has.

He finished by revealing that he had not received payment for his appearance.The remarks were made before Tuchel’s first two games in charge of England, a2-0 win over Albanialast Friday and a3-0 victory against Latviaon Monday.Tuchel is the first German and, after Sven-Göran Eriksson and Fabio Capello, the third foreigner to manage the England men’s team. His appointment in October 2024 received a mixed response, with the Daily Mail’s back page declaring it was “A dark day for England [as] Three Lions gamble on a German.”The German ambassador to the UK, Miguel Berger, said at the time: “I think it’s a small minority that thinks that and I found it a bit outdated. The side has had foreign coaches before, so to have a foreigner is nothing new. It’s a brave decision, but it’s a very clear and a very clever one.”The Guardian has attempted to contact Redknapp for a response.Explore more on these topicsHarry RedknappThomas TuchelEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Her margin of victory – 1.13sec over Germany’s Lena Dürr – was her largest in a slalom this season. Slovenia’s Andreja Slokar rounded out the podium in third.Amber Glenn, the skater redefining what power looks like on the iceRead moreShiffrin, who began the season by winning the first two slalom races, missed four of the 10 events in the discipline due to injuries sustainedin a frightening giant slalom crashin Killington, Vermont, on 30 November. That fall left her with torn oblique muscles and a deep puncture wound that narrowly missed her internal organs. The physical trauma sidelined her for two months. The emotional toll lingered even longer.She was later diagnosed with PTSD in February, just days beforewinning her 100th career racein Sestriere, Italy – a milestone that served as a testament to her perseverance. Thursday’s win, however, may have felt even more meaningful. This was her final race of the season, and only her sixth slalom start. She’s won four of those, reaffirming her status as the best technical skier in the world.Shiffrin’s win wasn’t enough to reclaim the slalom season title, which she has won a record eight times. That honor went to 21-year-old Zrinka Ljutić of Croatia, who finished 10th on Thursday but secured her first crystal globe with a 32-point lead over Austria’s Katharina Liensberger.“I sort of knew I would win it,” Ljutić said. “I just didn’t know how – and that made me nervous.”Shiffrin ended up fourth in the slalom standings, an impressive feat given how much of the season she missed. In total, she’s now stood on a World Cup podium 156 times – more than any skier in history – and has finished in the top three in an astonishing 89 of her 118 career slalom starts, a podium rate of over 75%.Her comeback this season wasn’t without further setbacks. She placed 10th in her first race back on 30 January and suffered additional crashes during training ahead of February’s world championships, including one that required her to clear concussion protocol. She still managed to win team combined gold in those worlds with US teammate Breezy Johnson and placed fifth in the slalom.Explore more on these topicsMikaela ShiffrinSkiingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Undefeated this season, she was seen as the one to beat. TheGrand Prix final Champion,two-time US champion, the only woman to regularly land a triple Axel in competition (on which she suffered an uncharacteristic fall, landing her ninth place in the short on Wednesday afternoon), she had been tipped to become the first US woman to win the world title in nearly 20 years. But with less than seven points between her and first place, nothing is impossible. And while much of the tenacity that could still bring her victory this week lies in her raw athleticism, Glenn has something in her arsenal more tenuous, and more volatile: She’s an artist.At first glance, Glenn doesn’t appear so different to the all-American skating stars of past decades. Slender, with blonde curled hair framing her perfectly made up face, she doesn’t overtly break the mold. But when the music starts, something else takes over. She’s explosive; her movements deliberate, and there’s a weight to her actions that not only enables her to drive across the ice like a hockey player, but to display exquisite musicality, showcasing a sensitivity and showmanship that has gained her a devoted fanbase (and1.5m TikTok followers).Quick GuideWorld Figure Skating Championships 2025ShowScheduleAll times EST.Wed 26 Mar• Women's Short, 12.05pm (Peacock)• Women's Short, 3pm (USA Network)• Remembrance Ceremony, 6.15pm (Peacock)• Pairs' Short, 6.45pm (Peacock)Thu 27 Mar• Men's Short, 11.05am (Peacock)• Men's Short, 3pm (USA Network)• Pairs' Free, 6.15pm (Peacock)• Pairs' Free, 8pm (USA Network)Fri 28 Mar• Rhythm Dance, 11.15am (Peacock)• Rhythm Dance, 3pm (USA Network)• Women's Free, 6pm (Peacock)• Women's Free, 8pm (NBC/Peacock)Sat 29 Mar• Free Dance, 1.30pm (Peacock)• Free Dance, 3pm (USA Network)• Men's Free, 6pm (Peacock)• Men's Free, 8pm (NBC/Peacock)Sun 30 Mar• Exhibition Gala, 2pm (Peacock)How to watch outside the USUnited KingdomAs of last year, Premier Sports holds the broadcasting rights for the World Figure Skating Championships in the UK, with coverage extending until 2028.

What about that?’ And of course, the answer is always, ‘yes.’”For much of the history of the sport, women figure skaters have been praised for their elegance, creating clean lines from fingertips to toes while typically performing to classical or romantic music, Weaver says. And generally, female skaters will choose one of two roles to portray: seductress or princess-like ingenue. Of course, there have been exceptions to this, but Glenn’s natural muscular skill, offset by an ability to execute balletic elegance offers a new approach, averting claims she looks too rough, or “masculine” – critiques often levied at women who focus solely on athletic skill. (Tonya Harding is one notable example.)“When I think about creating [routines] for male or female athletes, there are intrinsic differences in what they will want their performance to look like, what their body is capable of, and what they will be judged on,” Hill says. “With Amber, some of those differences feel like they don’t exist.”View image in fullscreenAmber Glenn of the United States performs her routine during an official practice ahead of the world championships on Tuesday in Boston.Photograph: Tim Clayton/Corbis/Getty ImagesHill joined Glenn’s team three years ago, and says that as a choreographer, she often asks skaters if they see themselves as athletes or artists. Most will think briefly before choosing “athlete,” but with Glenn, the answer is clearly the latter. Hill believes that along with innate ability, lessons learned from cultivating a large social media following have also made an impact on Glenn’s creativity. She understands the importance of timing – matching an exciting or beautiful move with a musical crescendo, grabbing attention and drawing the audience in. She also understands that figure skating is a judged sport, and just like her followers, judges want to be entertained.Watch her skate, and you’ll see one-handed cartwheels, massive “butterfly” leaps in which she launches herself horizontally into the air, and physics-defying cantilevers – a move that has her gliding on her blades down the ice like she’s taking part in the most extreme limbo contest possible, hair brushing back on the ice. She’s itching to include a backflip. And of course there’s the triple Axel. She isn’t the first to perform any of these moves, but she’s the first to package them together – and to pull them off in competition. All this sounds extremely athletic – and it is – but the overall impression is more of a contemporary dancer than a champion figure skater.‘Frozen in time’: figure skating world unites in grief and tribute at Boston world championshipsRead moreFor many fans, the allure of figure skating is its proximity to the arts; but for over300 years, it’s been a competed sport, and as a sport, there are restrictions and requirements that level what athletes must perform. In the men’s and women’s disciplines, jumps – skaters leaping high into the air and rotating as many as four times before landing on a single blade – have become integral to the sport. Glenn understands the need for recognizable, judgable elements, but she believes the sport could benefit from loosening its obsession with jumps.“I have so many things that are in my arsenal that I would love to perform in competition. But some of the more interesting and creative moves just aren’t worth the risk,” Glenn says. Sometimes she’s had to take out some of the more experimental actions Hill and Weaver have created for her because she needs more time to set up a jump, and she believes fans want more.“Whenever I post online, it’s very rare that a jump [gets more engagement] than a fast spin or a cantilever, or split leap,” Glenn says. “Most people don’t see the difference between a triple flip and triple lutz. The only reason why they know that a quad is hard is because they’re told it is.” There’s a chance she may get her wish. Last season the International Skating Union put forward a proposal to reduce the number of required jumps from seven to six, although this was not ultimately passed for the current Olympic cycle.Even so, Hill says each choreographic body movement – from every arm motion, to every turn of her head – is highly trained. Together, they talk about what Glenn should be feeling and thinking in each moment, what the music is expressing and how she can respond to it. In other words, she’s training like a dancer. And while Glenn says she has loved choreographing and creating routines to music since she was a child, some aspects of this approach remain out of her comfort zone.“Growing up, I always skated to more intense music,” Glenn says. “I would make things so big, and I’d go so fast. But over time, I’ve learned faster isn’t always better. I was like, go, go, go! Because if I ever took a moment to do something, I felt like, Oh, my God, I’m being still. I can’t be still. And that’s something even now I struggle with.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But some of the more interesting and creative moves just aren’t worth the risk.’Photograph: Jurij Kodrun/International Skating Union/Getty ImagesHer coach, Damon Allen, says that getting her to slow down is often a huge part of his role. They started using an app that tracks her heart rate, and he now uses real-time metrics to remind her to regain a sense of calm.“She’s a perfectionist, and so, if she has an issue with an element, she wants to do it 15 times until she feels it’s right,” Allen says. “I’ll have to say, ‘All right, we don’t need to do 15. Let’s move on to something else.’”It’s clearly working. After several starts and stops in her career due to injury and mental health concerns, in just two seasons Glenn has soared to the top of the sport.Glenn’s coaching team all say her popularity with fans and her huge social media following is in no small part because both off and on the ice, her personality shines through. She takes the time to check in with young skaters around her, asking them how they’re doing, and remembering to follow up. Glenn is also the first woman skater at her levelto come out as queerwhile still competing, and she’s an active champion for LGBTQ+ rights.“She’s the real deal,” Allen says. She’s not afraid to tell you about her problems, her anxiety, her ADHD. She is a great advocate for mental health, and I think a lot of people gravitate to that.”Regardless of the final results at the World Championships on Friday, Glenn has cemented herself as a game changer. And while at 25, she’s older than many of her competitors, she’s making no sign of slowing down. Allen says the feedback he receives from judges and officials is simply to “Keep Amber, Amber,” and to keep pushing forward.“When I think of skaters that are going to be remembered, it’s people that change the game,” says Weaver. “With Amber’s highlights, her jumps, her ability to tell a story, her ability to entertain a crowd, all of those things put together make her the first of her kind.”Explore more on these topicsFigure skatingUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But that doesn’t mean retaining the title is a givenGabriel Baumgaertner,Melissa Jacobs,Hannah KeyserandDavid LengelThu 27 Mar 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 27 Mar 2025 06.09 EDTShareAre the days of small markets teams winning the World Series over?No, because winning the World Seriesonly requires 11 postseason wins, providing you avoid the wildcard. The best thing that any team can do to win the World Series is to get into the playoffs. Getting into the playoffs usually requires that teams spend money to employ the best players, but last year was the first time since 2018 that the team with the best regular-season record won the World Series.GBDefinitely not. There areyoung studs scattered in some of the smallest markets. Pair a couple of trusty veterans with Bobby Witt Jr (Royals), Elly de La Cruz (Reds), or Paul Skenes (Pirates) and crazy things like winning a World Series can happen. See the Nats in 2019.MJSmall market teams will continue to have a shot for as long as there are more postseason spots than there are $300m-plus payrolls.October baseball is a unique, mercurial beastthat can be bested by a healthy team getting hot at the right moment. In baseball, financials may buy you consistent contention – the Dodgers may not miss the playoffs for at least another decade. But each October is still a crapshoot, money just ensures you get to gamble every year.HKSmall market teams? How about teams like the Giants and everyone else outside the top 10 payrolls? Those guys are also up a creek. That said, I do still thinkthere are some slim opportunitiesfor a fantastically designed minor league system to produce unicorns and beat the big boys. It’ll take a perfect game from the front office to get even close and then the window will be smaller than Eddie Gaedel’s strike zone.DLWhat I’m most looking forward to this season …Baseball is teeming with young stars: Skenes electrified baseball upon his arrival last year and is a top contender to win the NL Cy Young; the Diamondbacks’ Corbin Carroll is a budding superstar with power, speed and a hard-charging style; with his size, power and plate discipline, Nationals outfielder James Wood resembles a young Aaron Judge. And those are just a few across the league.GBFerocious, calm and deadly: why the Mets agreed to pay Juan Soto $765mRead moreWhile attention will be on the big market powerhouses, theAL Centralis packed with talented young teams. The Royals, Tigers and Guardians are poised for postseason berths once again but will entertain us as they duke it out for the division title first.MJThe two differentreceptions awaiting Juan Soto this seasonwill take place fewer than 10 miles apart: when he plays for his new team in Queens and when he visits his most recent team in the Bronx. It’s not just the Soto of it all, the Mets and Yankees are both formidable, flawed, and have reason to believe they’re the premier New York team. The crosstown rivalry should be especially pointed and important this season.HKWill Soto sink or swim in Flushing?What does $765m, divided into 15 tidy parcels, actually yield? We’ve seen players come to Queens and crumble under the expectations. Yes, I know that Soto has been great almost everywhere he’s been, including the Bronx. Still, nothing on the 7 line is ever guaranteed and I get the feeling that the baseball world wouldn’t mind a Soto shit show to begin the season. Such a slow start could snowball pretty quickly, but the good news is, however he performs, it’s guaranteed to be entertaining.DLView image in fullscreenJames Wood: 6ft 7in worth of talent coming to a ballpark near you soon.Photograph: Mitchell Layton/Getty ImagesYoung player to watchThe Dodgers’ Japanese hurler Roki Sasaki will transfix any viewer with his roaring fastball and disappearing splitter, so I’ll take a moment to focus on my favorite young bat:Athletics outfielder Lawrence Butler, who possesses a thrilling combination of power and speed that led to 25 home runs and 18 stolen bases in his rookie campaign. A 30 homer-30 stolen base campaign is not out of the question.GBWood. There’s only one reason to watch the Nats this year, and that’s to see how Wood will jumpstart the rebuild. At 6ft 7in and 235lbs, the 22-year-old has crazy speed and the potential to become one of the great hitters in baseball.MJIt’s tough to make trading away Soto look good but the haul that the Nationals got in return is starting to pan out – headlined by the Nats’Wood, who pairs the kind of power you would expect out of that physique with the sort of smooth athleticism that you wouldn’t. I’m hardly going out on a limb after he was 20% better than league average in a partial season last year. But if you’re not watching the Nats, you might have missed the debut of the soon-to-be star.HKWe all want to know whenSkeneswill undergo his seemingly inevitable Tommy John surgery. This year? Next year? Is that a cynical take? Oh yeah it is, and though I do kid, every bad joke has a kernel of truth in it. Skenes has elite secondary stuff and he isn’t quite max effort on every single fastball. But even still, half of his fastballs are over 100 mph and his sinker settles at about 95. So, you know, I worry. A prayer to the baseball gods: Please let Skenes become a sturdy, dominant workhorse who hurls deep into games – the sport needs it desperately. Can I get an amen?DLMVP winnersNL: Shohei Ohtani, Dodgers. I am aching to pick Carroll, whom I believe will hit between 25 and 30 home runs and steal over 50 bases in 2025, but Ohtani is the default answer once he resumes pitching.AL: Gunnar Henderson, Orioles.I like the young shortstop, who finished fourth in last year’s voting after a phenomenal age-24 season, to edge out another star young infielder, the Royals’ Witt.GBAL: Witt. The do-it-all stud is a great defender with lightning speed and huge power. Witt could be the next 40-40 man.NL: Ohtani.Speaking of 40-40 seasons, Ohtani is coming off his first. He’s the best player in baseball, and there is no credible counterpoint.MJNL: Ohtani.He has won MVP in 50% of the full seasons he’s played inMLB. He’s won with the Angels in the American League and with the Dodgers in the National League. He’s won as the only two-way player this century and he’s won as the first-ever strictly DH to take home the honors. He’s winning it again this year for the NL. Since that’s so chalk, I have a slightly more interestingAL pick: Wyatt Langford, the Texas Rangersoutfielder, who debuted last season less than a year after getting drafted. He struggled for most of the season before getting red-hot in September. But even while struggling he was fast, patient, and sprayed the ball all over the field. Now he just needs to add back the power he had in college and the minors.HKWell there’sOhtaniin the NLat the juicy price of 5-4 and then there’s the field. If the slugger turns starter around the All-Star break, well, you know the deal. Baseball is generally unpredictable, but with Ohtani, it’s just about whether he will stay healthy. His only competition is in the other league and that’s Judge, who was actually better overall than Ohtani last season, if only because he plays the field. One problem for No 99: nobody will pitch to him now that Soto is gone, and that meansWitt gets the trophy in the AL.DLAL East winnersEven after losing Soto to the Mets and ace Gerrit Cole to an elbow injury (he’ll miss the entire 2025 season),the Yankeesshould excel after savvy offseason additions like outfielder Cody Bellinger, starting pitcher Max Fried and closer Devin Williams. This will be an extremely competitive division and all five teams may finish with records over .500.GBWhile the Yankees did sign Fried, Bellinger and Williams, they lost Soto and Nestor Cortes, and Cole is done for the season. That leaves aRed Soxteam that had a fruitful offseason acquiring Garrett Crochet and Alex Bregman with a viable path to AL East glory.MJYes, the Yankees are reigning pennant winners and pivoted admirably from losing Soto. And yes, the Red Sox missed the postseason entirely the past three years. But I believe in the pitching moves Boston made this winter and the influx of talent in the form of a trio of top prospects ready to contribute at some point this summer. It’s a shame Netflix isn’t following them around this season, becausethe Red Soxare going to be the team to beat.HKI know who it won’t be: the Yankees. No Cole, no Soto, no Giancarlo Stanton and Luis Gil, at least for now. They still have three MVP’s on the roster, which is nothing to sneeze at, but that’s a lot of losses. It opens the door tothe Orioles, who shamefully failed to adequately invest in their rotation after the loss of ace Corbin Burnes to free agency. They’re still more than capable, with an enormous amount of talent on the roster. They should hold off the improved Red Sox for the crown.DLAL Central winnersThe Twinssuffered an ugly collapse, going 8-18 in the final month of the 2024 regular season en route to a fourth-place finish in a clustered AL Central. Here’s a bet that their starting pitching depth and versatile lineup – with major contributions from slugger Matt Wallner and former top pick Royce Lewis – put them back in the playoffs in 2025.GBThis will be the most competitive division in baseball and any of three teams could take it. But people are sleeping onthe Royals, not believing they can improve on their 30-win jump a season ago. The front of their lineup should be bolstered by new leadoff hitter Jonathan India. Most of Kansas City’s useful rotation stayed intact, and they fortified the bullpen in the offseason.MJI would love to see what the Twins could do with full and fully healthy seasons from Byron Buxton and Carlos Correa, but I don’t think we’re ever going to get that.The Royalswent from 100 losses to playing in the postseason in the span of a single season. I like their spunkiness – and the fact that Witt projects to be the fourth-best position player, behind only marquee names like Judge, Soto, and Ohtani.HKRemember when everyone handed the Twins the AL Central last season and ignored the Guardians? Well that was embarrassing. What now? Well, really, I have no idea. We have four middling teams, none of whom light up the room and any of them are capable of winning the Central. That said, KC’s rotation is bright, especially if Seth Lugo can be the ace he broke out to be last season. Plus they have the soon-to-be MVP in Witt, so,the Royalsare worth a whirl.DLView image in fullscreenIf Jacob deGrom can stay healthy, the Rangers are a real threat.Photograph: Jeffrey McWhorter/APAL West winnersThe Astros look a bit less fearsome without franchise cornerstones Bregman and Kyle Tucker, so the 2023 World Series championRangerswill sneak past them and the punchless Mariners. A veteran core should propel this sturdy squad to 92 wins, which will probably be enough to win the division.GBWelcome back, Jacob deGrom! He’s not the only key player back: with the return of Evan Carter and Josh Jung, as well as adding more pop in the lineup via free agency, theseRangersshould hit a lot of homers on the road to the division title.MJThe Astros have won the West seven out of the last eight years. But their core is aging or getting shipped out whilethe Rangershave Langford, Carter, and Jung to supplement their 30-something stalwarts (also Corey Seager is somehow only just now going into his age-31 season?). Plus, theymaygetmostof a season out of deGrom for the first time since he signed with Texas ahead of 2023 – and he’s the best pitcher in the sport whenever he’s on the mound.HKMLB players are giving their new robot umpire overlords a cautious welcomeRead moreOh, the AL West: the AFC South of MLB, or at least it was last season. It was not so interesting to watch the Rangers sink and the Mariners slide, with many thanks to Julio Rodriguez’s mystifying decline. The Astros won, again. Yawn. The good news? That may finally be over.The Rangershave the boys to bounce back into the post season, especially if deGrom can stitch together 20 or so starts: wouldn’t that be something? Their infield is stacked, the rotation may be serviceable and there’s no real closer. Warts and all, it looks like Texas, mostly thanks to the decline in Houston, a cheap, lazy Mariners front office and a flimsy back end of the division.DLNL East winnersThe Mets had the splashiest offseason by adding Soto, butthe Philliesstill have the league’s deepest starting lineup after the Dodgers and a reliable pitching staff. Zack Wheeler should be the frontrunner for the NL Cy Young award after finishing second last year and he could be challenged by teammate Christopher Sánchez.GBUnlike other teams that overhauled their rosters in the offseason, Atlanta just needed their stars to return to health. Getting Ronald Acuňa Jr back will be huge. Same with Spencer Strider. If Marcell Ozuna sits somewhere near 40 homers once again, and the rest of the lineup steps it up, this offense will easily leadthe Bravesto more than 100 wins.MJYou could justifiably put the Braves, Phillies, and Mets in virtually any order. Which is why I’m going with the boring pick ofthe Braves. And actually, the projection systems don’t seem to think it’s as close as I do. The Braves finished second in the East last year after losing two of the most impactful players in the sport to early-season injuries. Getting Strider and Acuña back puts them back on top.HKLoaded, that’s the NL East. The Phillies have a tremendous core, but in a game increasingly defined by young, raw talent, there’s always a chance that their aging roster breaks down. And while that decline could happen sooner than later, it won’t be in 2025:the Phillieswill win a tight race with the Braves and Mets. That’ll be thanks to a deep starting rotation led by Wheeler and the usual suspects on offense, Bryce Harper and Co, featuring a Trea Turner who bounces back to his old self.DLNL Central winnersThe Brewershave lost franchise shortstop Willy Adames, who signed a seven-year contract with the Giants, but feature one of the game’s brightest young stars in outfielder Jackson Chourio and arguably the game’s best offensive catcher in William Contreras.GBThe Reds and Cubs could certainly make a push, but Milwaukee’s stacked bullpen will be key in keepingthe Brewersas division leaders. Can we stop calling them overachievers?MJSpeaking of projections, the computers have a hard time separating the NL Central teams right now. I’m going withthe Brewersjust on gut feeling. Their offseason was a net negative, but somehow they always manage to overcome their financial austerity. And not always just by the skin of their teeth! Last year they scored the sixth-most runs in baseball and they’ll bring back offensive contributors like Chourio, Contreras, and a healthy Yelich, who looked hot in spring.HKIf the Cardinals don’t make the playoffs, it will be their longest streak of postseason less seasons since 1995. And they’re not going to make it, so will we finally hear consistent booing from their wholesome fans who love their team SO MUCH? Who will be more miserable? St Louis or Milwaukee, who traded off Williams and lost Adames to free agency? The door is open forthe Cubs, a flawed but capable club led by their freshest face, Kyle Tucker.DLView image in fullscreenThe Dodgers’ Japanese stars should help them ease to another division title.Photograph: Gene Wang/Getty ImagesNL West winnersThis won’t be a cakewalk. The Padres were one win away from ending the Dodgers’ season in 2024 and the Diamondbacks made two marquee offseason additions – starting pitcher Burnes and first baseman Josh Naylor – to fortify an exciting young core. Even so,the Dodgersare simply too powerful: Adding Blake Snell and Sasaki gives them the best pitching staff in baseball and their offense is the envy of any executive and fan. They may not win the World Series, but they’ll probably win 100 games.GBThe most loaded hitting and pitching staffs in baseball. Most of the who’s who in MLB are on this roster.The Dodgersfeel like a bully at this point, which makes them extra fun to hate.MJThis winter, the World Series champions – and winners of the most games not just last year but the pastdecade– added a two-time Cy Young Award winner and the most coveted starting pitcher on the market, and those were not the same person. Plus, their lineup is studded not just with All-Stars or potential MVPs, but likely future Hall of Famers. It adds up to a pretty dominantDodgersteam.HKIt’s all about the Rockies, who seem poised to break out and win the NL West for the first time in when, (checks baseball-reference), ever? Yes, ever! Wow! Spectacular third baseman Ryan McMahon and dynamic Ezequiel Tovar will lead this spicy Colorado bunch along with a revitalized Kris Bryant (remember him?) and veteran hurler German Marquez. How long can I keep this farce up? I’d say up until right about now when I sawthe Dodgers.DLAL wildcardsOrioles, Rays, Guardians.GBYankees, Orioles, and Tigers.MJAstros, Yankees, Orioles.HKRed Sox, Yankees, Blue Jays – that means four AL East teams in the playoffs!DLNL wildcardsDiamondbacks, Braves, Mets.GBMets, Phillies, Reds.MJDiamondbacks, Mets, Phillies.HKMets, Braves, Padres.DLALCSRangers over Orioles.GBRed Sox over Yankees.MJRed Sox over Royals.HKOrioles over Rangers.DLNLCSPhillies over Dodgers.GBBraves over Dodgers.MJPhillies over Dodgers.HKDodgers over Phillies.DLView image in fullscreenThe Phillies and Braves are both title contenders.Photograph: Scott Cunningham/UPI/ShutterstockWorld SeriesPhillies over Orioles. After their surprise run to the 2022 World Series, the Phillies have struggled with the weight of expectations over the last two Octobers. I like them to finally overcome those recent ghosts to outlast a weaker, but mentally tough opponent in the Rangers thanks to brilliant postseasons from Bryce Harper and Wheeler. An underrated contributor this season will be infielder Bryson Stott, who should flush a disappointing 2024 with a breakout offensive season thanks to improved plate discipline.GBBraves over Red Sox.The Braves win the World Series over the Red Sox thanks to a deep roster that can swing the bat up and down the order. Crochet, a huge add for Boston, will eke out a win. But Atlanta’s starting rotation is too loaded, with reigning NL Cy Young winner Chris Sale and a bunch of contenders.MJRed Sox over Phillies.Let’s get this out of the way: the Phillies are not the best team in the NL. But, they have an incredible – and incredibly durable – top of the rotation, which has an outsized impact in October. They’ll ultimately fall, however, to a Red Sox team who pair a gaggle of high-ceiling young players with the veteran presence – and perspective from having played nearly 100 playoff games – of Bregman. To a starting rotation that had the third-lowest park-adjusted ERA last year they added the best pitcher on the trade block in Crochet and a fiery competitor with interesting upside in Walker Buehler. He was on the mound for the end of the 2024 World Series and I’m predicting that he’ll be somewhere in the vicinity again when the 2025 championship is decided.HKDodgers over Orioles.It’s1966 all over again, except this time, Baltimore lose to LA in five games. The Dodgers’ second consecutive title leads us neatly into 2026, which will be dominated by the unavoidable labor issues which are coming at the sport like a speeding locomotive. LA’s grip means split ownership groups taking sides and clarion calls for a salary cap. The Dodgers just have too much talent, for way too much money. Is their roster fair? Does it spoil MLB? Well, as they say, don’t hate the player, hate the game. And that’s why all hell is coming to the game, sooner rather than later.DLExplore more on these topicsMLBBaseballUS sportsLos Angeles DodgersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Goals from Sandy Baltimore, Nathalie Björn and Mayra Ramírez saw off City in style to set up a mouthwatering semi-final against the Champions League holders, Barcelona, who earlierdispatched Wolfsburg 10-2 on aggregate.Sonia Bompastor marvels at Chelsea’s mental strength on ‘perfect night’Read moreThe Chelsea manager made five changes to the team that scored astoppage-time winnerat the Etihad Stadium on Sunday and it was this ability to freshen up her team that many predicted would make the difference. Sure enough the Blues were able to maintain an intensity that a depleted and limited City squad could not match.Much has been made of City’s injury crisis, with Khadija Shaw, Aoba Fujino, Rebecca Knaak, Lauren Hemp, Alex Greenwood, Laura Blindkilde Brown and Ayaka Yamashita all out and only five players named on the bench for the trip to Stamford Bridge.However, the home team also had absentees; Naomi Girma, Sam Kerr, Guro Reiten, Maelys Mpomé, Kadeisha Buchanan and Sophie Ingle all injured and Zecira Musovic pregnant.Such is the quality and number of players available to Chelsea it is easy to forget who is not there and overlook the work done to ensure they remain competitive. City’s injuries are a valid excuse for failure on the pitch but they are not an excuse for a club that should be investing more in its playing group.View image in fullscreenNathalie Björn rises highest to head Chelsea level in the tie from a corner.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAThere was a frenetic energy to Chelsea from the off as a result of the fresh legs, a fire in the bellies and belief emanating from the players. Bompastor stood in a power stance in her technical area, living every pass and every run, one step away from racing on to the pitch to do the job herself.Their pressure was relentless and although the crowd was half the size of that which graced theEmirates Stadium a night earlier, the 10,769 fans absorbed the fight of the players in blue and fed back with the same intensity. Goals were coming and they were only going one way, the contrast between the game in London and the phenomenal and battling City performanceeight days priorwas stark. It took 14 minutes for Chelsea to capitalise on their dominance, a relentless Lucy Bronze driving into the box from the right and launching a shot off the post that Baltimore was there to follow up on, blasting into the corner from the left.City regrouped, somewhat, in the immediate aftermath of the goal, Mary Fowler and Kerolin forcing straightforward saves from Hannah Hampton, and then the Chelsea show resumed. They were level on 37 minutes and ahead just before the break for the first time in the tie.First, Baltimore’s corner was met by Björn, who sent a looping header past Khiara Keating, the Chelsea duo returned to the starting XI for this fixture, then Lauren James escaped on the right before pulling the ball back for Ramírez to turn in. The visiting team looked shell-shocked, unable to cope with or adapt to the terrier-like pressure of their opponents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The formal public consultation for its project is over and a decision on its applications to Hammersmith and Fulham council and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council is expected this year.Sources have warned it would become more challenging for Chelsea to move to Earl’s Court if the ECDC’s application succeeds and the club were then to make an offer. Although a deal would be possible sources have cautioned that the price of land conservatively estimated to be worth at least £500m would rise, and there are suggestions Chelsea would find it harder to garner the necessary political support. It is believed local politicians would be highly reluctant to back a football stadium over the ECDC’s promise of new homes.Chelsea need to navigate the political scene in London. One element in their favour is that figures in planning in the capital believe the ECDC’s plans could be too expensive. Sources have indicated Chelsea enjoy private political goodwill over Earl’s Court. It is felt that a multi-use football stadium would benefit the local economy and there would still be the potential to build affordable housing on the site.Chelsea have drawn up plans and ­identified the Lillie Bridge depot as the area on which to build a stadium. TheGuardian reported last yearthat Jason Gannon, the club’s chief executive, had held talks with Transport for London, one of the partners that looks after the Earl’s Court site, and the real estate developer Delancey.View image in fullscreenTodd Boehly has said that any division over the stadium project would probably lead to the end of his partnership with Clearlake.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesHowever, it is impossible for there to be any serious engagement with political figures who could influence the outcome until Chelsea make a formal and public declaration of their interest by submitting a bid.The lack of movement has caused frustration among some individuals who want Chelsea to move to Earl’s Court and is understood to be partly related to tensions within the club’s ownership. Boehly and Clearlake, the majority shareholders, have an uneasy relationship and explored buying each other out last year. It is unclear when the board last held a meeting over stadium plans.Boehly does not have the power to force the project through and suggested this week that any division over stadium redevelopment wouldprobably lead to the end of his partnershipwith Clearlake, which has no intention of selling its stake. Clearlake is not opposed to Earl’s Court but wants to be sure a deal makes financial and logistical sense and will stand the test of time. Boehly has hinted at a multi-use stadium capable of generating income for the club by hosting other sports and concerts.A source suggested that plan could meet with opposition from local residents. Clearlake shares the view that any stadium must be capable of hosting international football tournaments, other sports and non-sporting events. A key consideration for Chelsea is ensuring they are not pushed into bidding for land by parties keen to make a sale. Key figures within the club are determined to act prudently and assess every option properly to find the best long-term plan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has been stressed that it would not be difficult for them to find a partner keen to build on a piece of prime real estate in west London.Figures familiar with the issue believe Chelsea moving to Earl’s Court is the most realistic solution for the club. There is no other site available in west London and redeveloping Stamford Bridge is feasible but challenging, not least because the ground is next to a railway line. A stand-by-stand rebuild is unattractive and a complete demolition would come with the drawback of Chelsea having to play at a temporary home, most likely Wembley, for up to seven years. But Chelsea have not ruled out redeveloping Stamford Bridge and made space for such a project after purchasing a 1.2-acre site next to Stamford Bridge from Stoll, a housing charity for veterans.Moving home for good would require Chelsea to strike an agreement with Chelsea Pitch Owners, which holds the freehold of Stamford Bridge stadium. The club will seek the approval of the CPO before bidding for land elsewhere.Moving to Earl’s Court would enable Chelsea to remain at Stamford Bridge while the stadium is being built. The risk of doing nothing is that Chelsea fall behind their rivals. Arsenal, Tottenham and West Ham have moved into bigger stadiums in London, Liverpool have expanded Anfield, Everton are leaving Goodison Park at the end of the season and Manchester United have announced plans to build a 100,000-seat stadium.Chelsea declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

The buying group is understood to be led by the TV executive David Gandler, who has handled the negotiations with Orient’s owner, Nigel Travis. The tech and sports entrepreneur Kit Hawkins and Neil Leibman, an executive at the Texas Rangers Major League Baseball franchise, have had talks about joining the consortium.Gandler is fronting the bid having sold his 17% stake in Paris FC last October as part of a takeover of the Ligue 2 club by the billionaire Bernard Arnault, France’s richest person. The American is a former Warner Bros executive and the founder and chief executive of fuboTV, a streaming platform that broadcasts European football in the US, Canada and Spain.The England-born Hawkins is based in Los Angeles. His investments include a stake in the TMRW Golf League co-founded by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy and a music management company.Leibman has been a member of the Texas Rangers’ ownership group since 2010. He remains on the board and chairs the media company that distributes Rangers games and other content.A source with knowledge of the buyers’ plans told the Guardian they would ultimately like to attach an American football franchise to ­Orient that would play in the European League of Football. The 16-team competition will begin its fifth season in May and would welcome the addition of the first British franchise, although it is unclear how far advanced the consortium’s ­multisport plans are.A new stadium and training ground for Orient are on the agenda, with the potential new owners viewing Brentford’s achievements in building a new ground and establishing themselves in the Premier League as an ideal template.Orient do not own their ground or training ground, leasing Brisbane Road from the former owners Matchroom and Barry Hearn and training at the private Chigwell school. The prospective buyers want to build a multisport venue in east London that could also be used by the local community.As part of the proposed deal Travis would retain a significant stake and stay as chair, at least in the short term. Orient have been transformed under the American’s ownership since he bought them eight years ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sign up now!John BrewinThu 27 Mar 2025 13.07 EDTLast modified on Thu 27 Mar 2025 13.48 EDTShareWHO SANCHIONED THIS?Something that goes viral now and again is the particulars of the house sale of someone rich, famous and very possibly lacking in taste. Sure, that saloon bar created in the style of the East End pub off Goodnight Sweetheart felt like a good idea at the time, as did that mirrored master bedroom ceiling adorned in the style of Jeff Koons’ Cicciolina period. How will it sell on the open market? Quartz and pine are very much out, and as for that kitchen island … how much are they going to have to lower the price to get shot? It’s a doer-upper, surely.Trends move on, and so, at great pace, does the football transfer market. One minute, a player’s a hot prospect, and almost the next the dumper is beckoning. And as transfer fees climb ever upwards – £60m only buys you a “maybe” these days – and wages multiply, there’s an increased chance of expensive, unwanted duds.Jadon Sancho didn’t ask for Manchester Unitedto pay £73m for him in 2021, though he probably benefited financially. That it didn’t go well at United is now accepted, though failure can have as many fathers as success. He’s hardly the only player to have been chewed up and spat out by the United bone machine. Morgan Schneiderlin, Memphis Depay, Alexis Sánchez, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Antony … the list of the lost is almost endless. Sancho was seen back then as English football’s brightest talent, top of the class at the elite Borussia Dortmund kindergarten, even allowing for Erling Haaland banging them in. In fact, wasn’t itbecauseof Sancho that Haaland looked so bloody good?Transfers, and the giddy expectation they allow, that mind’s-eye fantasy of what a player will be like before the thudding reality of him actually playing, have made fools of just about every manager and sporting director in the game. In 2009, Real Madrid bought Cristiano Ronaldo, Xabi Alonso and Kaka, a full-on Oxford-Cambridge-Hull/Cleese-Milligan-Sessions trio. It’s the thudding reality part that Sancho has struggled with, his contribution to United negligible, his loan return to Dortmund better but not as good as previously, and nowChelsea, where his impact has slowed to nothing-burger status.Playing the margins of last summer’s transfer market, Chelsea set up a loan deal leading to a permanent £20m-25m deal, handily paying only half-wages, but such is Sancho’s lack of use they are reported to want to kibosh any deal. Problem being, United get £5m back as a penalty fee. Paying up to not play a player breaks fresh territory in transfer market silliness, even for Chelsea. As despite Sir Big Jim getting a bonus £5m into dwindling coffers,Manchester Unitedstill needs a buyer, preferably someone who fancies renovating a player still aged just 25. As for Sancho, he’s reported to hope Dortmund’s ever welcoming bosom stops him becoming yesterday’s man.QUOTE OF THE DAY“[The fourth official] said I was aggressive – people who know me, I’ve got a Scottish accent. It comes across very aggressive, but I didn’t swear, I didn’t run, in my opinion I wasn’t aggressive. My accent and my Scottishness is aggressive, but yeah, I got sent off for that” – the Exeter City manager, Gary Caldwell,reckons his Caledonian broguewas the reason he was sent from the dugout in Saturday’s draw at Lincoln, earning his second red card this year.View image in fullscreenOh, Gary!Photograph: Chris Vaughan/Getty ImagesFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS“Brazil in 1982 definitely did have Zico, Falcao, and Socrates [Wednesday’s Football Daily], but that team had the worst goalkeeper in the tournament in Waldir Peres, and the worst center forward in Serginho.

It reminds of the time me and an ex girlfriend walked into my local. She knew nothing about football but was endearingly enthusiastic about it, so as I was waiting to get served she excitedly proclaimed that Real Madrid v Parma was being shown on the TV.

In a statement the Premier League said: “The window will open early, between Sunday 1 June and Tuesday 10 June, due to an exceptional registration period relating to the Fifa Club World Cup.

So, having belief and mental strength going into the game was important,” said Bompastor.Nick Cushing said he was “disappointed we didn’t progress but immensely proud of the group”, after City battled to come back into the tie. “It’s been hugely positive in terms of the desire and commitment of a team that has had a lot of stress and strain over the last two weeks,” the Manchester City interim head coach said. “To still be in it and be pushing at the end shows me a lot. We’ve shown our togetherness, fight and spirit is there.”Cushing conceded that “depth is definitely the difference between the two teams at the moment, based on numbers” and said City were in “a period where fortune hasn’t favoured us in terms of injuries to key players”.City may be missing a host of key players, but Chelsea are too and a deep squad is critical, said Bompastor. “It’s really important, the league is really competitive and if you don’t have depth in your squad it’s impossible to achieve your goals,” said the Chelsea manager. “The intensity at this level is really high.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A second motion brought by the RFU, proposing greater devolution of powers to the regions to address local issues, was passed with an 80% majority.Richard Wigglesworth: ‘I’ll be honest … and think of nothing but the Lions’Read moreThe RFU interim chair, Bill Beaumont, called for unity after the vote and described the outcome as “emphatic” in his closing address, but the wounds of this long-running dispute will take some time to heal. The trigger for this revolt led by the Whole Game Union, an alliance of Championship, grassroots clubs and refereeing bodies, was the revelation in November that Sweeney received a £358,000 bonus last year, taking his overall remuneration to £1.1m, despite the RFU reporting losses of £37.9m.“This is not a time to argue, but to pull together,” Beaumont said. “The time for division is past. Now is the time to unite behind an opportunity to renew English rugby.“Let us put behind this period of in-fighting and modernise the union. Let’s get back to focusing on the many positives in our game. Every single player who puts that white shirt on started off in community rugby – every single one of them.”The final decision on Sweeney’s future lies with the RFU board, but it has backed him throughout and after he received almost 66% of the vote, the RFU views the result as an endorsement of his position.Sweeney did not speak during or after the meeting, but received the strong backing of the former international referee and RFU board member Wayne Barnes.“One thing that rugby has always told me is that if there are two sides to an argument, when the referee makes a decision, you move on,” Barnes said. “What we’ve seen tonight is a decision being made by the members. And quite a strong decision, 66% of the vote saying that Bill Sweeney should remain.“We’ve had a clear instruction to move on with what we’ve learnt over the last few months. Sir Bill Beaumont has been around the clubs, listening, understanding what the concerns of the game are. We want to action them. We will challenge our executive team to do exactly what they have been tasked to do.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Nottingham chair, Alistair Bow, welcomed the devolution of power and said the clubs would continue to hold the RFU to account, with 11 proposals for further governance changes to be presented at their AGM in June.“I think the result was not as important as what comes next,” Bow said. “What I think we have seen is a very strong support for change. When you look at the numbers [in support of Sweeney] I think that clearly shows you that there’s a big problem in the game.“If it was in the corporate world, as a CEO you would be in a spot of bother, you wouldn’t be surviving. What has been said tonight is that clubs want change and they are expecting to see change.“I think the strong message from speaking to Bill Sweeney and Bill Beaumont afterwards is that we’re going to see change. I think they know that the world has been looking at us tonight and the rugby public are expecting to see change. We’re going to see how that plays out. Hopefully we can work together.

His unhappiness with how the season has progressed thus far and approval of the use of the word “panic” may cause interested parties to once more sense a potential opening with the Dutchman.The decision to remove the 23-year-old Lawson, not the first time Red Bull have acted with such emphatic purpose towards an underperforming driver, was nonetheless blunt even by the team’s previous standards and an indication that competing for theFormula Oneconstructors’ championship is a priority. Lawson will revert to driving for Racing Bulls for the rest of the season.Lawson had been promotedat the end of 2024 to replace Sergio Pérez, who repeatedly underperformed for Red Bull. The team finished third behind McLaren and Ferrari last season, despiteVerstappen winning the drivers’ title.Red Bull had been optimistic Lawson would offer greater support to Verstappen but in the first two races of the season he endured a woeful return, failing to score points in Australia and China.Immediately after the race in Shanghai, his future was thrown into doubt and on Thursday morning Red Bull replaced him with Tsunoda, the Japanese driver who has been with Red Bull’s sister team since 2021.“It has been difficult to see Liam struggle with the RB21 at the first two races and as a result we have collectively taken the decision to make an early switch,” the Red Bull team principal,Christian Horner, said. “We came into the 2025 season with two ambitions, to retain the world drivers’ championship and to reclaim the world constructors’ title and this is a purely sporting decision. We acknowledge there is a lot of work to be done with the RB21 and Yuki’s experience will prove highly beneficial in helping to develop the current car.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tsunoda will be the sixth teammate Verstappen has had in 10 seasons at Red Bull and a further indication that their car has been optimised for the Dutchman and proves a handful for other drivers.Lawson said in Shanghai he was struggling with the car and that he required more time but Red Bull instead opted to give the more experienced Tsunoda the chance to step up.The 24-year-old Japanese driver will make his debut with Red Bull at his home grand prix at Suzuka next week. He was frustrated not to be moved up to the senior team after last season given he had far more experience than Lawson, with 89 races now under his belt. However, Red Bull now believe his ability to help develop this year’s car could be invaluable, with the team having major steps to make to bring it up to pace to match McLaren, who lead the field this season.Explore more on these topicsRed BullChristian HornerFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Their names remain shorthand for excellence infigure skating– especially in the UK, where the sport has long since faded from the spotlight.This week inBoston, however, another British ice dance duo are quietly building on a legacy of their own. When Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson take the TD Garden ice for the rhythm dance on Friday afternoon, they will do so as genuine medal contenders. After finishing fourth at the last two world championships, the pair arrive inMassachusettsin form: winners of both their Grand Prix assignments, bronze medallists at the Grand Prix final, and holders of seven national titles – the same number Torvill and Dean hauled in during their glittering career.‘Frozen in time’: figure skating world unites in grief and tribute at Boston world championshipsRead moreFear and Gibson are the highest-profile British ice dancers in a generation and, while the comparisons with their predecessors are inevitable, they have long since carved out a style and trajectory that is unmistakably their own.“It’s a huge honour, I think, to be even in that sentence,” Fear told Sky Sports last month. “It’s crazy for us – especially given Lewis’s start to the sport was watching Torvill and Dean on Dancing on Ice. Just the legacy they’ve had in Great Britain and in ice dance, it’s lasting to this day. It’s extremely kind to be in that sentence and it’s something that we don’t take lightly.”The comparison is not lost on Gibson either. “The impact that they had on the sport and in British history, just getting people engaged with figure skating and ice skating back then – we really want that for the UK again,” he said. “And if we can make that happen, that is a success in itself.”That connection could grow stronger if they reach the podium inBoston– something no British team has done at a world championships or an Olympics since Torvill and Dean returned to win bronze at the 1994 Lillehammer Games. For Fear and Gibson, who train at the Ice Academy of Montreal alongside many of their top rivals, the final step is consistency. Their bronze medal at January’s European championships marked their third straight podium finish at the event – but also came with a tinge of disappointment. They now expect, and demand, more.Quick GuideWorld Figure Skating Championships 2025ShowScheduleAll times EST.Wed 26 Mar• Women's Short, 12.05pm (Peacock)• Women's Short, 3pm (USA Network)• Remembrance Ceremony, 6.15pm (Peacock)• Pairs' Short, 6.45pm (Peacock)Thu 27 Mar• Men's Short, 11.05am (Peacock)• Men's Short, 3pm (USA Network)• Pairs' Free, 6.15pm (Peacock)• Pairs' Free, 8pm (USA Network)Fri 28 Mar• Rhythm Dance, 11.15am (Peacock)• Rhythm Dance, 3pm (USA Network)• Women's Free, 6pm (Peacock)• Women's Free, 8pm (NBC/Peacock)Sat 29 Mar• Free Dance, 1.30pm (Peacock)• Free Dance, 3pm (USA Network)• Men's Free, 6pm (Peacock)• Men's Free, 8pm (NBC/Peacock)Sun 30 Mar• Exhibition Gala, 2pm (Peacock)How to watch outside the USUnited KingdomAs of last year, Premier Sports holds the broadcasting rights for the World Figure Skating Championships in the UK, with coverage extending until 2028.

The Canadians won the free dance at last year’s worlds and edged out Chock and Bates at Four Continents in February by just half a point. A mistake in the Grand Prix final cost them a higher placement, but their momentum appears to be returning at just the right time.Italy’s Charlène Guignard and Marco Fabbri, meanwhile, are the most experienced pair in the 36-team field, making their 13th world championship appearance. The reigning European champions and Grand Prix final runners-up are seeking their third straight world medal as they build toward a home Olympics in Milan in 11 months.‘If there was no one on Earth, I would still skate’: Alysa Liu on her remarkable figure skating comebackRead moreAll three teams – Chock and Bates, Gilles and Poirier, and Guignard and Fabbri – also competed at the 2016 worlds in Boston, when Chock and Bates won bronze. Now, they return as the clear frontrunners but, in a discipline known for infinitesimal margins, the door remains open.Behind them, a new generation is pressing upward. Canada’s Marjorie Lajoie and Zachary Lagha finished just outside the medals at the Grand Prix final and Four Continents. From the US, Christina Carreira and Anthony Ponomarenko are hoping to make an impact on home ice. France’s Evgeniia Lopareva and Geoffrey Brissaud, Finland’s Juulia Turkkila and Matthias Versluis, and Spain’s Olivia Smart and Tim Dieck all arrive in strong form after the European season.For now, though, all eyes will be on the battle at the top. And on whether Fear and Gibson can finally deliver the result that has been just out of reach. “It’s exciting, and it’s pressure,” Fear said. “But this is what we’ve worked for.”Explore more on these topicsFigure skatingUS sportsBostonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My fellow Canadians are furiousThu 27 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTShareIremain immensely proud to have lived in Edmonton during the Oilers’ glory years, when Wayne Gretzky was not merely that city’s darling, but also a fresh-faced, flag-waving ambassador for all ofCanada.On ice, he dazzled with his scoring prowess and consistency; off ice, he charmed with his various charitable deeds and aw-shucks humility.Few could doubt his love for – and mentorship of – the late Joey Moss, the legendary locker-room attendant who was born with Down’s syndrome.So when it was suggested that the superstar centre and newly minted bridegroom had cried crocodile tears over being traded from Canada’s Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988, I didn’t hesitate to give him the benefit of the doubt.Et tu, Wayne: Gretzky’s legacy in Canada takes hit over 4 Nations snubRead moreBut when No 99 himself began starring in TV commercials endorsing online sports gambling, I started to squirm, if not cringe.When it became apparent that Gretzky, a dual citizen, was on the same page politically asDonald Trump, even being photographed with a Maga hat, my discomfort rose. Still, I reasoned that in a democracy, everyone has the right to decide where they throw their support.A month before Trump’s second inauguration – which the Gretzkys would go on to attend – the Orange One declared that his pal the Great One was so popular in Canada that he could handily run for political office here. It’s distinctly possible I swore under my breath before chalking it up to Trump’s usual mouthing-off.By the time the so-called leader of the free world began calling Canada “the 51st state” and dismissing our then prime minister as “Governor Trudeau”, my patience had worn thinner than onion skin.And it only got worse.As if he didn’t have enough to concern himself with on the home front, soon Trump was musing about Manifest Destiny 2.0, with an eye toreclaiming the Panama canal,buying Greenlandfrom Denmark,clearing Gazato build luxury resorts and … the eventual annexation of Canada, after first battering its citizens with crippling tariffs.Then came last month’s4 Nations Face-Off hockey finalin Boston, with the head-scratching choice of a rather bored-looking and awkward Gretzky as honorary captain for Team Canada.In Canada, I saw how Trump is ripping North America apart – and how hard its bond will be to repair | Andy BeckettRead moreDuring pre-game ceremonies, Gretzky – wearing not a Canadian jersey, but a navy suit with nary a trace of red and white; not so much as a Maple Leaf lapel pin – entered the ice from the US bench, not the Canadian one. He also gave the thumbs-up to US players while appearing not to acknowledge our side. Then to cap it off – so to speak – he went on to give the victorious Canadian players red hats bearing the words “Be Great”.That was the final straw for me, and apparently for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of other Canadians.Here is a man who could have used his “soft” power to educate Trump on the inviolability of this country’s sovereignty. Instead, he revealed his true colours (yes, with a “u”) are red, white and blue.Gretzky was widely booed in pubs that night, slammed as a traitor and a sellout. In the flap that ensued, there were calls to remove his statue from outside Rogers Place in Edmonton. A few days ago, the statue wassmeared with feces. An online petition demanding that the city of Edmonton rename Wayne Gretzky Drive hadgarnered more than 13,000 signaturesas of Wednesday.Others have expressed outrage that in 2009, when Gretzky was awarded this country’s highest civilian honour, Companion of the Order of Canada, he didn’t bother to come home to collect it. He still hasn’t.Over these past few weeks and after Trump’s inflammatory pronouncements, has Gretzky made any effort to explain or clarify himself or his beliefs, or defend his homeland? No, instead he has a) let his buddy Trump, on his social media website Truth Social, offer a tepid defence of Gretzky’s “low-key” support of Canada remaining a separate nation, while b) hiding behind wife Janet’s skirts.“I have never met anyone who is more proud to be a Canadian, and it has broken his heart to read and see the mean comments,” she said in an Instagram post that has since been deleted.As Trump menaces us in Canada, we have a question for Britain: when will you stand up to him? | Jennifer WelshRead moreNor did it help Gretzky’s cause that among those rushing to his defence was the Canadian-born former NHL-er and fellow Trump disciple Bobby Orr.“How fickle can people be, when someone who has given so much time and effort to Canadian hockey is treated in such a way?”Orr wrote in an op-edfor the Toronto Sun. “Listen, we all have our personal beliefs when it comes to things like religion and politics. Wayne respects your right to your beliefs – why can’t you respect his?”As the Globe and Mail sports columnist Cathal Kellywrites of Gretzky: “He’s a 64-year-old man of the world of now, creased by experience and not much the better for it. He’s an other-direction carpet bagger, a golf world hanger-on and a Mar-a-Lago regular. When you see Mr Gretzky up close now, the first word that leaps to mind is ‘louche’.“As of about a month ago, he is the polar opposite of what Canada wants in a representative.”Gretzky is hardly a naif, having stick-handled his way through countless interviews over the past more than 45 years. Widely credited for his vision, his ability to “skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been”, Gretzky had to have anticipated how this would play out with the folks back home.His silence makes clear to Canadians, if not the entire world, he no longer gives a puck.Karen Booth is a retired journalist and former resident of Edmonton whose loyalties will always lie with the Edmonton OilersExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionHockeyNHLDonald TrumpJustin TrudeauUS sportsAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

On Wednesday night at TD Garden, the world figure skating championships paused between events for something far more profound than medals or scores: a solemn tribute to the 28 members of the skating community who died in January when American Eagle flight 5342crashed into the Potomac River.Held after the women’s short program and before the start of the pairs’ short program, the ceremony honored the skaters, coaches and parents who were returning from a development camp held in conjunction with the US figure skating championships in Wichita, Kansas.Flight 5342 had lifted off from a wintry runway in southeast Kansas, carrying dozens of young skaters, their coaches and parents who had just attended a US Figure Skating development camp following nationals. Many had posted about what they’d learned – new jumps, spins, friendships. They never got the chance to bring that energy home. On final approach to Washington DC, the regional jet collided with a military helicopter, killing all 67 people aboard.Quick GuideWorld Figure Skating Championships 2025ShowScheduleAll times EST.Wed 26 Mar• Women's Short, 12.05pm (Peacock)• Women's Short, 3pm (USA Network)• Remembrance Ceremony, 6.15pm (Peacock)• Pairs' Short, 6.45pm (Peacock)Thu 27 Mar• Men's Short, 11.05am (Peacock)• Men's Short, 3pm (USA Network)• Pairs' Free, 6.15pm (Peacock)• Pairs' Free, 8pm (USA Network)Fri 28 Mar• Rhythm Dance, 11.15am (Peacock)• Rhythm Dance, 3pm (USA Network)• Women's Free, 6pm (Peacock)• Women's Free, 8pm (NBC/Peacock)Sat 29 Mar• Free Dance, 1.30pm (Peacock)• Free Dance, 3pm (USA Network)• Men's Free, 6pm (Peacock)• Men's Free, 8pm (NBC/Peacock)Sun 30 Mar• Exhibition Gala, 2pm (Peacock)How to watch outside the USUnited KingdomAs of last year, Premier Sports holds the broadcasting rights for the World Figure Skating Championships in the UK, with coverage extending until 2028.

The tragedy cut across generations and geographies: 11 of the dead were skaters between the ages of 11 and 16. The city of Boston, long a historic hub for American skating, became its emotional epicenter.‘Our youngest and brightest’: grief of DC plane crash rocks figure skating communityRead more“Someone once told me time is a great healer,” said International Skating Union president Jae Youl Kim during the memorial. “But for those who have experienced deep loss, we know that time does not simply erase pain. For many of us, it feels like we are frozen in time.”Doug Lane, whose son Spencer and wife Christine were among those killed, stood before a hushed crowd of thousands at TD Garden and offered a message that blended grief with resolve.“They haven’t really invented the vocabulary to talk about the grief that we’re all feeling,” Lane said. “So what I thought I would do with my time today is share a few thoughts of hope.”He called on the audience to support the young skaters who are still here – those who are grieving and still lacing up their skates each day. “They’re hurting,” he said. “I hope we can support them in their skating journeys, but I also hope we can help them find paths of happiness and impact off the ice as well.”Lane also addressed the systemic failures that may have led to the crash. “Even a layperson like me can easily identify the breakdowns that allowed this to happen,” he said. “But rather than look for blame, I hope we can work with our elected officials to make air travel safer for everyone.”The 20-minute tribute included a video montage of the victims, poetry read by US Figure Skating’s interim CEO Sam Auxier, before concluding with live performance from Boston’s Coro Allegro Choir. Massachusetts governor Maura Healey and Boston mayor Michelle Wu both addressed the gathering. The audience, including many moved to tears, rose for a standing ovation when it finished.View image in fullscreenNames of the victims of the 29 January plane crash in Washington DC are displayed during Wednesday’s remembrance ceremony at the world figure skating championships in Boston.Photograph: Maddie Meyer/Getty ImagesAt the renowned Skating Club of Boston, which produced such champions as Dick Button, Tenley Albright and Nancy Kerrigan and where the six local victims trained and taught, an impromptu memorial remains: two folding chairs that once belonged to Jinna Han and Spencer Lane are now covered in cards, flowers, photos, and stuffed animals. The space is roped off – not by the club, but by the skaters themselves.“The kids insisted,” said Doug Zeghibe, the club’s chief executive. “It’s their way of keeping Spencer and Jinna close.”Earlier this month, a gala tribute in Washington DC brought generations of figure skating stars together. Legacy on Ice featured performances by Kristi Yamaguchi, Scott Hamilton, Brian Boitano, Amber Glenn and reigning world champion Ilia Malinin. Thirteen-year-old Isabella Aparicio skated in honor of her father and brother, Franco and Luciano, who were killed. Max Naumov – whose parents, Shishkova and Naumov, died in the crash – performed in their memory.Alysa Liu vaults to shock lead at figure skating worlds with statement programRead more“They’re not here right now, but they’ll always be here,” Naumovtold NBC Sports. “It’s not just me anymore. It’s our family. I have the strength of two other people with me forever.”The Washington gala raised more than $1.2m for victims’ families and first responders. Malinin, too, has spoken openly about how the crash affected him. Several of the young skaters killed trained at the same rink as the 20-year-old US champion.“Now I’ll always have them in my head and in my heart,” Malinin said. “This worlds, I really want to dedicate to everyone on that flight. I want to give my all in that performance and really make it special for them.”Though grief was front and center on Wednesday night, the world championships now turn toward the ice. The event also serves as a critical qualifying step toward the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano Cortina, with national quotas on the line and international rivalries heating up – even as one of skating’s most dominant nations remains sidelined. Russian skaters are still barred from international competition due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, now in its third year.Malinin enters as the overwhelming favorite in the men’s event. Known asthe Quad Godfor his boundary-pushing jumps, he’s looking to defend his world title on home ice. His challengers include France’s Adam Siao Him Fa and Japan’s Yuma Kagiyama.View image in fullscreenA spectator fights back tears during Wednesday’s remembrance ceremony for members of the figure skating community who were killed in the 29 January plane crash in Washington DC.Photograph: Cj Gunther/EPAIn the women’s event, the Japanese star Kaori Sakamoto’s bid for a fourth straight world title hit a snag earlier Wednesday when she finished the short program in fifth placebehind surprise leader Alysa Liu, back on the world championships stagefollowing a two-year retirement. American Amber Glenn, who entered Boston undefeated this season, was ninth after falling on her opening triple Axel, but honored the crash victims by holding up a T-shirt emblazoned with their names during her post-skate interview.The pairs field remains wide open, and in ice dance, Americans Madison Chock and Evan Bates are seeking a third consecutive world title. That would mark the first three-peat at worlds in the discipline in 28 years.Still, for many, these world championships will never be just about competition.“The kids are back on the ice,” Zeghibe said. “But they’re skating with a deeper purpose.”The lights came up harshly after the tribute. The music swelled and the competition resumed. But for those who lost friends, coaches and teammates this winter, the ice will never quite feel the same.“February was hard,” as Zeghibe put it. “March has been a little better. And it’s all our hope that April will be better still.”Explore more on these topicsFigure skatingWashington DC plane crashBostonUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Trump has used tariffs as a bargaining chip in the TikTok negotiations in the past.On 20 January, his first day in office, he warned that he could impose tariffs on China if Beijing failed to approve a US deal with TikTok.Vice-president JD Vance has said he expects the general terms of an agreement that resolves the ownership of the social media platform to be reached by 5 April.Reuters reported last week that White House-led talks among investors are coalescing around a plan for the biggest non-Chinese backers of ByteDance to increase their stakes and acquire the video app’s US operations, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.The future of the app used by nearly half of all Americans has been up in the air since a law – passed with overwhelming bipartisan support – required ByteDance to divest TikTok by 19 January.The app briefly went dark in January after the US supreme court upheld the ban, but flickered back to life days later once Trump took office. Trump quickly issued anexecutive order postponing enforcementof the law to 5 April and said last month that he could further extend that deadline to give himself time to shepherd a deal.The White House has been involved to an unprecedented level in the closely watched deal talks, in effect playing the role of investment bank.Free speech advocates have argued that the ban unlawfully threatens to restrict Americans from accessing foreign media in violation of the first amendment of the US constitution.Explore more on these topicsTikTokTrump administrationChinaTrump tariffsSocial mediaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He denied the spyware wasused to target Francesco Cancellato, the editor-in-chief of the Italian news outlet Fanpage.Mantovano’s assertions, which were first reported byLa Repubblica, have so far not been denied by the government.Paragonsuspended its relationshipwith Italy when the breaches emerged, a person familiar with the matter told the Guardian.

At least in return they found out more about their earwaxThu 27 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 27 Mar 2025 09.56 EDTShareInformation is the most valuable resource on Earth. We shed data from everything that we do, and megalithic corporations hoover it up. With that, they know us better than we know ourselves, and the information we readily give up is used to upsell to us, and manipulate our political and personal views. We are users of social media, but in reality we are the product. Google’s mission was never simply to provide a search engine; it was to curate the world’s information. Perhaps it is no coincidence that the commercial genetic testing company 23andMe was cofounded by Anne Wojcicki, once the wife of one of the Google creators; 23andMe’s mission was to curate the single richest dataset in the known universe, the one you carry around in your cells: your genome.23andMe provided information purporting to be about your personal health and ancestry. All you had to do was spit in a tube and give them some money, and in return you’d get a very glossy map of your genetic genealogy, and some info on the probability that you like the taste of coriander, or your skin flushes when you’re drunk, or whether you have sticky or wet earwax, or your eye colour – things you might have already known, if you have ever looked in a mirror, or stuck your finger in your ear. If you look carefully, they did give solid info on the science underlying the results, but who reads the small print?Your DNA is your most private data. The billions of letters of genetic code in your cells are unique to you, and always will be, in the whole history and future of humankind, even if you are an identical twin. It contains the history of your family, of our species, and of life on Earth. It harbours the most personal conceivable information about your family, your life and health. And that is what 23andMe wanted.The companyhas just filed for bankruptcy, and this does not sadden me. It didn’t invent direct-to-consumer genomics, but it made big data big business. The genius of its business model was not simply to get you to volunteer this personal data to a private company, but to persuade you to actually pay to give it to them. It then commercialised your DNA byselling it on to pharmaceutical companies, which would use it to develop drugs, ultimately for profit. It was the type of racket that a mob boss might look on and say: “And this is legal?” There was always an opportunity to opt out, but most people did not, because who reads the small print? And what did you get in exchange? A scientific trinket.There were good news stories too – tales of lost relatives being found, or previously unknown parents being identified. I discovered an unknown branch of Jewish ancestry, which petered out six generations ago. The scientists at 23andMe published some studies that used customers’ data to uncoverlost information on transatlantic slavery, and this was only possible because they were sitting on one of the largest collections of human genomes in existence.But the main interest came from people who thought they were paying to answer the nebulous question of where they came from. The trouble is: it’s an empty promise. There is no method for identifying the geographical origin of your ancestors using genetics. Your ancestors about 50 generations back arefrom all over the world, and besides, biology does not bestow membership to a tribe or clan or people or country. What 23andMe was actually doing was comparing your DNA to that of other paying customers, and matching up where they live today, and inferring that you have ancestors in that location. It kind of works, but is mostly meaningless. When the data lets you believe that you are 37% German, or 18% Spanish, or whatever, it might feel fun, but of course there is no way of being 37% German. White supremacists loved this type of service too because – locked into their scientifically ignorant ideology – they believed it would reveal some sort of racial purity. Even when testing uncovered previously unknown ancestry from people they deem inferior, they would often attribute the results to aJewish conspiracy.As for the health information it provided, the results are also of profoundly limited use, because the tests are not designed todiagnose medical conditions, and the genetic variants anaylsed as part of the service are derived from population-levelstatistics, which are not particularly informative to individuals. I discovered that I have a genetic variant that at a population level is associated with a slightly higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Knowing this neither bothers me nor has prompted a change in my behaviour. It does not mean that I will get Alzheimer’s, and if you don’t have that same variant it doesn’t mean you won’t.DNA is not fate. 23andMe was trading on ignorance of how the genome actually works, and perpetuating a deterministic view of genetics that is outmoded and wrong.Opt out: what to do with your 23andMe account after company filed bankruptcyRead moreMaybe people fell out of love with this fad because what are you meant to do with the reports anyway? Sure, some people did find out new things about their family ties. But most of the millions of paying customers discovered nothing of note. Maybe punters got wise to the weakness of the claims the glossy marketing made, such as “root for your roots” – a laughable attempt to sell testing kits to football fans during the 2018 World Cup.And then there was thedata breach. In 2023, 23andMe was hacked – 7 million customers’ most private data was leaked, and Ashkenazi Jewish customers’data was put on saleon the dark web. You paid a company to store your data, and it failed.So, for all the punters who were seduced by the promise of some vaguely sciencey storytelling, you might want tolook at deleting your datawhile 23andMe is in financial turmoil. The lessons are clear: understand the science and check the small print. You were never customers; you were always the product.Dr Adam Rutherford is a lecturer in genetics at UCL and the author of How to Argue With a RacistExplore more on these topicsGeneticsOpinionGenealogyPrivacyBiotechnology industryBiologyFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Given that most whiz-bang features on new models are now software-based, you can often get them for your existing phone simply by updating to the latest Android or iOS and keeping your apps up to date. More importantly, these updates will keep your phone protected against security threats to help prevent criminals from stealing your data. When your phone stops getting security updates, you should stop using it.Clear out your storageView image in fullscreenRegularly delete older content from your phone, including WhatsApp group chats, ‘as every image, gif or video sent quickly adds up’.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAMost phones come with a decent amount of storage, but they can fill up over the years with photos, videos, music, apps and the general detritus of modern life. Make sure you have at least 2GB to 5GB of free storage at all times to help keep your phone running quickly.Regularly clear out blurry or duplicate photos and unneeded screenshots. Store your photos and videos in the cloud: there are plenty of providers to choose from, such asApple’s iCloud,Google Photos,Amazon PhotosandMicrosoft’s OneDrive. Delete unused apps and games. Remove old music, films and TV shows that have been downloaded for offline playback. Empty your downloads folder and clear out your messaging storage, particularly if you’re part of WhatsApp group chats, as every image, gif or video sent quickly adds up.Protect the battery and plan for a replacementView image in fullscreenMost modern smartphone batteries last up to 1,000 full charge cycles.Photograph: Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto/REX/ShutterstockBatteries are consumables that wear down every time you charge them until they need replacing, so it’s important to plan for a battery replacement after a few years of use. Most modern smartphone batteries last about 500 to 1,000 full charge cycles. Each charge cycle is cumulative, so if you use 60% of the battery one day, recharge it and then use 40% the following day before recharging it, that is one full charge cycle.There are things you can do to help extend the life of the battery. Avoid exposing it to extreme temperatures, which accelerate ageing. Using your phone less means fewer recharges, so frequent use of the battery-saver mode, setting a short screen timeout and other power-saving settings can help.Changing the way you charge it can make a big difference, too. Batteries have to work harder in the first and last 20% of capacity, causing more degradation of their internal components than the middle bit. Keeping a battery mostly between 20% and 80% of its maximum charge will significantly reduce its wear over time.Both Android and iOS devices have long been able to learn from your charging habits and charge the battery to 100% only just before you need it, such as an hour before you wake up. But you can also now limit the maximum charge to 80% on many devices.ForiPhone 15and later, look in Battery Charge settings. ForAndroid devices, including Samsung, Pixel and OnePlus, look in settings under battery protection, charging optimisation or battery health, depending on the manufacturer.Keep it cleanView image in fullscreenA clean screen will keep your phone fresh and improve visibility.Photograph: Adrian Crook/Getty ImagesCleaning your phone screen withantibacterial sprayfrom time to time is a good idea, but don’t forget to also clear out the various holes in the sides of your phone. Keep the charging port clear of pocket fluff to stop it from becoming blocked, and watch out for the buildup of detritus in the speaker and mic holes. If you don’t routinely play music out loud, it’s worth cranking the phone’s volume up to maximum with a loud and aggressive track every so often to eject built-up dust, particularly from the earpiece speaker.Antibacterial phone sprayFrom £1 at Muc-OffAntiviral phone wipes£1.25 at Wilko£1.25 at The RangeSamuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editorExplore more on these topicsSmartphonesThe FilterMobile phonesGadgetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

According todata publishedby the digital store Steam, almost 19,000 titles were released in 2024 – and that’s just on one platform. Hundreds more arrived on consoles and smartphones. In some ways this is the positive sign of a vibrant industry, but how on earth does a new project get noticed? When Triple A titles with multimillion dollar marketing budgets are finding it hard to gain attention (disappointing sales have been reported for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the Final Fantasy VII remakes and EA Sports FC), what chance is there for a small team to break out?And yet it does happen. Last year’s surprise hit Balatro has shifted more than 5m copies. Complex medieval strategy title Manor Lords sold 1m copies during its launch weekend. But what awaits a small developer after they achieve success? And what does success even mean in a continuously evolving industry?James Carbutt and Will Todd of Coal Supper are still trying to make sense of it. Their acerbic satireThank Goodness You’re Here!, in which players slap their way through bizarre quotidian scenarios in the fictional humble northern town of Barnsworth, is now an award-winning game. “It’s just not registered as a success in my head at all,” says Carbutt. “The numbers are going up on screen, and there have been YouTube playthroughs and some erotic fan art. Beyond that, it won’t register.”I can’t imagine making any more games. I don’t know where I would go from hereAfter spending three years working on the project, the pair now find themselves in the confusing glare of the spotlight, fielding questions about what’s next. “It’s horrible,” Carbutt jokes. “But I don’t think we feel any sort of second-album syndrome. The space it gives you to be a bit introspective about what you want to do next is the interesting quirk of a successful indie game.”Veteran indie developer Gabe Cuzzillo (Ape Out,Baby Steps) offered them sage wisdom. “He spoke about how you should focus not just on making something good – because how do you quantify that, it’s amorphous?” says Todd. “Instead we should look at what it is we want to explore and judge success intrinsically, based on whether we explored that thing. The pressure of speed to market doesn’t apply to us, because it’s never going to be possible to crank something out in six months to chase success anyway. It’s more like, in the wake of this being received well, what’s the next thing we want to explore? That’s something we’re interrogating at the moment.”Australian developer Grace Bruxner has also redefined success after leaving behind a trilogy of Frog Detective games: bite-size adventures co-developed with Thomas Bowker that quickly became cult indie hits.View image in fullscreen‘Has it impacted people’s lives in a positive way?’ … Frog Detective.Photograph: Wormclub“Success in games has always been a bit of a lie, a bit of an illusion,” she says, pointing to typical markers such as cultural impact, player numbers and financial gain. “My measure of success is: did I make something I’m proud of, and has it impacted my life and other people’s lives in a positive way? And yes, it did, so thumbs up.”Bruxner began working on the series during her final year at university as an experiment, to see whether she could produce a commercial game. After a relatively breezy first outing, the second Frog Detective game demanded that Bruxner and Bowker lock in, and spend most of their time on the project. By the third instalment, the hard work had paid off, though the pressure had begun to take its toll. Throw in the pandemic, as well as mental and physical health issues, and Bruxner was ready to take a break. “I wasn’t grinding super hard, but I also wasn’t having a great time,” she says. “It just was really nice to make that choice to stop.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unless you love making games. I’m not sure I love making games. I was quite young when we released the first Frog Detective, so it was like, ‘This is my entire identity for life. I don’t know how to be a separate person from that.”Three years after the series’ swan song, she is on indefinite hiatus, exploring alternative creative paths – such as pottery. “I can’t imagine making games, because of the expectations on me as a creator,” she explains. “I don’t even know where I would go from here.”Bruxner has been surprised by her ability to sustain herself on the modest amount of money provided by Frog Detective. “If your game continues to have a tail, and you can budget properly and live within your means, it is possible to have a passive income that isn’t tied to being a horrible landlord,” she explains. Even so, she knows how taboo it can be to talk plainly about money, especially in creative circles like the indie game scene. “I have the free time to chill and decide what I want to do, but I assume at some point I’ll probably need to have a career again. My biggest question is will this money last forever? Probably not, and then what happens when it runs out? I don’t know.”View image in fullscreen‘Opportunities are limited’ … Consume Me.Photograph: HexecutableIt may seem as though more indies than ever have broken into the spotlight in recent years. But enduring games industry turbulence has made finding financial support for follow-ups and debuts more complicated. “The elephant in the room is everything that’s happened over the past couple of years, with mass layoffs, studio closures and evaporating funding opportunities,” explains AP Thomson, a developer of the forthcoming indie Consume Me with fellow NYU Game Center graduate Jenny Jiao Hsia. “Before that, there was a pretty major change around the mid-2010s when indie publishers and funders started rising in prominence. Everything we’ve heard suggests that the same opportunities no longer exist or are incredibly limited.”Consume Me, the duo’s coming-of-age scheduling RPG doesn’t have a release date but has already been nominated for five gongs at the IndependentGamesFestival awards. As such, Jiao Hsia and Thomson are already under pressure to decide their next endeavour. “Multiple people have told us we should be moving forward once it launches,” says Thomson.Even with growing expectations, the pair aren’t keen to get ahead of themselves. “Everything we’ve heard suggests that now is really not a great time to be pitching, so we’re going to focus our energy on the launch and then read the temperature of the room after that,” Thomson adds.“I’m looking forward to finding enjoyment in making art again, instead of feeling like I have to show up to a job I never applied to,” explains Jiao Hsia. “The idea of making art for fun, without worrying about making money off it, is something I can’t wait to do.”Explore more on these topicsIndie gamesGamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s a very big deal, and while the president insists this hefty import tax on cars is going to be good for “anybody who has plants in the United States”, his move – like a car in desperate need of a tune-up – could easily backfire.Nearly half of the cars sold in the US are imported, and Trump’s 25% tariff will add at least $6,000 to the sticker price of the average car, industry experts say. Domestic auto producers will be able to jack up their sticker prices because the new tariffs will make US automakers face considerably less price competition from imported cars. This expected sticker shock could anger America’s inflation-weary consumers and voters, especially since candidate Trump had pledged to battle to bring down prices. These higher car prices could cause a quick drop in auto sales in the US, and that could translate into a downturn in auto production, too.Trump’s big hope, as well as the United Auto Workers’ big hope, is that the tariffs will encourage automakers – especially GM, Ford and Stellantis (the successor company to Chrysler) – to bring lots of their car production back into the US long term. Shawn Fain, the UAW’s president applauded Trump “for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working-class communities for decades”. Fain, an outspoken supporter of Kamala Harris, added: “Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today’s actions.”What the accidentally leaked war group chat reveals about the Trump administration | Moira DoneganRead moreThe UAW has been one of the leading critics of the three-decade-old North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). That union warned that the agreement would do grievous damage to US manufacturing by giving Mexico, a country with far lower wages, free access to the US market. The UAW cautioned that Nafta would be a boon for profit-hungry US corporations, but a bane for US factory workers. The UAW proved correct about that. The Economic Policy Institute, a progressive research group, estimates that the US lost 682,000 jobs because of Nafta. (Stellantis makes several models of its Ram pick-up truck in Mexico, while GM makes the electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox there.)In a statement released on Wednesday, Fain said: “With these tariffs, thousands of good-paying blue collar auto jobs could be brought back to working-class communities across the United States within a matter of months.” But many industry experts are dubious about that, in effect saying that the UAW should be careful what it wishes for. Trump’s aggressive trade war as well as his on-again, off-again deployment of tariffs has badly shaken consumer and corporate confidence, caused stock markets to tumble and made many economists warn that the strong economy Trump inherited from Biden could sink into recession.Slumping consumer confidence, together with soaring sticker prices, could take a serious bite out of US car sales and cause production to sink. In an unhappy forecast, Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, a market research firm, said that as a result of Trump’s auto tariffs, US plants would churn out 20,000 fewer cars per week, about a 30% drop compared with before Trump imposed the tariffs. “By mid-April we expect disruption to virtually all North American vehicle production,” Smoke said in a Wednesday conference call with clients and journalists. “Bottom line: lower production, tighter supply and higher prices are around the corner.”As for Trump’s dream that his tariffs will result in far more domestic auto production long term, that could prove elusive. During Trump’s two months back in office, he has disconcerted and discombobulated corporate executives by sowing uncertainty and instability – by his and Elon Musk’s tearing up of the federal government; by his repeatedly flouting federal law and the constitution; and by his imposing tariffs one day, then suspending them the next day, and then reimposing them a few days later. Moreover, Trump has executives fearing an economic downturn, with his commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, saying Trump’s policies are “worth it” even if they cause a recession.When CEOs are feeling so uncertain due to Trump’s volatility, capriciousness and antics – as well has him changing his mind every few days on trade policy – that Trump-induced sense of instability means auto executives are unlikely to do what Trump wants: to rush to invest a billion or two to build a new auto plant. If Trump and his team had gone about imposing tariffs with a far steadier hand and had made their case in a more thoughtful, non-Trumpian way, then many executives would be far more open to building auto plants and other plants in the US in response to tariffs.The Canadian Chamber of Commerce warned that Trump’s auto tariffs could backfire badly. In a statement, the chamber said: “Throwing away tens of thousands of jobs on both sides of the border will mean giving up North America’s auto leadership role, instead encouraging companies to build and hire anywhere else but here. This tax hike puts plants and workers at risk for generations, if not forever.”Trump’s sudden announcement on auto tariffs will certainly help him in one way – it made tariffs the nation’s lead news story and pushed to the side those hard-hitting stories about the Trump administration’s acutely embarrassing leak on bombing Yemen. On the other side of the ledger, the tariffs will hurt Trump and the US in a profound way. By imposing a 25% tariff on auto imports from Canada and Mexico, Trump, many trade experts say, is blatantly violating the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a free trade agreement that Trump signed in his first term. (Trump once called it the “best and most important trade deal ever made by the USA”.) Brad Setser, an expert on global trade at the Council of Foreign Relations, said this breach of the USMCA would hurt the US’s credibility and “may raise questions about the value of any future deals Trump signs”.For decades, the UAW has been right about the need for Washington to do more to prevent the loss of manufacturing jobs (and to help those workers who lost their factory jobs). But with Trump, the UAW seems to be betting on an unsteady, capricious – and anti-union – general to win a trade war, but as veteran racetrack bettors will tell you, unsteady horses rarely win the race.Steven Greenhouse is a labor reporter.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionDonald TrumpUS economycommentShareReuse this content"

The Trump White House boasts of being the most transparent administration in history – though commentatorshave suggestedthat the inadvertent leak of military plans to a journalist may have happened because senior figures were using messaging apps such as Signal to avoid oversight. Last week, itreleased thousands of pages of documentson John F Kennedy’s assassination. Donald Trump hasdeclaredthat Kennedy’s family and the American people “deserve transparency and truth”.Strikingly, this stated commitment to sharing information comes as his administration defunds data collection and erases existing troves of knowledge from government websites. The main drivers appear to be the desire to remove “woke” content andglobal heating data, and the slashing of federal spending. Information resources are both the target and collateral damage. Other political factors may be affecting federal records too. Last month, Mr Trumpsacked the head of the National Archiveswithout explanation, after grumbling about the body’s involvement in the justice department’s investigation into his handling of classified documents.The impact is already painfully evident.Cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationhave affected not only climate records but also anextreme weather risk tool. The purge’s results are absurd as well as damaging. A webpage on the Enola Gay, the aircraft that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, appears to have beenmarked for deletionbecause it was mistaken for a reference to LGBTQ+ issues.Yet the disparity between the data dump on the Kennedy assassination and the removal of other material is not a contradiction. It speaks volumes about the administration’s approach to truth and knowledge, which it regards as contingent and a matter of convenience. (Tellingly, it is alsoaxingthe body that provides most federal funding to libraries.)The 1963 presidential assassination is not only an event around which multiple theories circle but one that helped feed a broader culture of conspiracy theorising and distrust in authority. That has metastatised to the bizarre and extreme claims embraced and even promoted by Mr Trump or figures around him, includingbirtherism,PizzagateandQAnon. These increasingly fantastical narratives have had real-world consequences. Facts, science and rationality itself are under attack.In his first term, Mr Trump’s aides shamelesslypromoted “alternative facts”while decrying actual facts as “fake news”. The Washington Posttallied more than 30,000 false or misleading claimsover those four years. This time round, his administration is removing existing sources of information. Websites, datasets and other informationvanished from federal health websites– such as that for the Centers for Disease Control – last month, though some has since reappeared. One scientistcalledit “a digital book burning”. The Union of Concerned Scientistshas warnedthat “critically important science conducted at many US agencies, institutions, and universities [is] under increasing assault”.Ad hoc preservation of essential national information and records is usually the work of those faced with the destructive force offoreign invasions,jihadist insurgenciesor dictators. But as this bonfire blazes, a motley but committed array of individuals – “nerds who care”,in the words of one– are fighting back by preserving data before it is deleted. Their admirable effort to defend the truth deserves support.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

One can only imagine what other information has been as recklessly handledThu 27 Mar 2025 14.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 27 Mar 2025 14.39 EDTShareOver the past six months or so, the Atlantic has been assembling more and more reporting talent, including by poaching some of the biggest stars from the troubled Washington Post.One of the best intelligence reporters in the country is Shane Harris, who moved from the Post to the Atlantic last summer.Harris shared the byline this week on the Atlantic’s shocking scoop, in which top editor Jeffrey Goldberg inadvertently was given access to a group text where top US officials were planning a strike in Yemen.Before they published and at every step along the way, the Atlantic conferred with knowledgable lawyers about how to proceed. The journalists revealed what they had in stages, and carefully.The Atlantic thus was a model of caution and good judgment.“Jeff Goldberg and The Atlantic handled the whole thing perfectly,” Martin Baron, the renowned editor who led the Washington Post newsroom until 2021, told me in an email on Thursday.The journalists’ actions “could be a college journalism class in careful, ethical handling of sensitive information”, said David Boardman, dean of Temple University’s media school.The contrast was sharp between those well-considered measures and the dangerous negligence at the highest level of theTrump administration. One awful thing is that this incompetence is baked in; in a very real sense it is intentional. Just as “the cruelty is the point,” as writer Adam Serwer said years ago of Trump World, so is the bumbling.It’s an offshoot of the only thing that really matters to Trump: loyalty.“Carelessness – or any of the injurious attributes of clowns, idiots and buffoons – is something Trump can trust,” noted John Stoehr, who writes The Editorial Board, a politics newsletter. “When things go south, as they will, he can trust them to cling to him more tightly, as by then, he might be the only thing standing between them and a jail cell.”Here’s one telling detail. When Tim Miller on the Bulwark’s daily podcast asked Goldberg about the covert CIA operative who was named in the text thread, the Atlantic editor said he purposely withheld her name.“I didn’t put it in the story because she’s under cover. But, I mean, the CIA director put it in the chat.”Yet, inevitably, Trump loyalists responded by trashing Goldberg and the Atlantic. Always attack, as Trump learned decades ago at the knee of the disgraced lawyer Roy Cohn.Thus, Goldberg was described as sleazy, and the magazine itself as hyper-partisan and failing.The press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, called the story “another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin”.You would have to be plenty credulous or truth-averse to buy that, and much of Maga Nation is just that, including those who relied on Fox News – where, soon after the story broke, prime-time host Jesse Watters made himself part of the defense team: “Journalists like Goldberg will sometimes send out fake names with a contact with their cells to deceive politicians. … This wouldn’t surprise me if Goldberg sneaked his way in.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Margaret SullivanFree newsletterSign up to get email alerts every time Margaret Sullivan publishes a new column.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just so.Shining a bright spotlight on this mess was a public service. One can only imagine what other information has been as recklessly handled.Maybe this revelation will prevent future lapses, though with this crowd in charge I wouldn’t count on it. Instead, we’ll see punitive leak investigations and even more efforts to control information.Still, this chapter does show the value of conscientious journalism in an increasingly dangerous environment.There has been plenty of sleaziness on display in recent days – but it has nothing to do with the Atlantic’s exemplary reporting.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS politicsPete HegsethDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

It seemed the antithesis of management-school custom and practice. But it worked, to be imitated after a fashion by Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and other digital tycoons with similar success.Donald Trumpis now seeing if it works in government.The smart money in Washington was that after the fiasco of Trump’s first term, his second would see a more emollient president, one careful of his reputation. He would reach out, consult, become a peacemaker, in his desperation to become aNobel presidentlike Barack Obama.How wrong that has proved. Trump is doing what few leaders dare do. He is being a cultural revolutionary, a Mao Zedong, a grandiloquent system smasher. He wants to reorder Washington’s role in the US and the US’s role in the world. He knows that he may have just two years before “the system” – the electoral cycle, the judiciary and state governments – blocks his path. If he truly wants revolution he must break things, and fast.The historianArthur Schlesingersaid the US needed occasional shocks to wipe away the cobwebs, the bureaucracy and the dirt of an ever more cumbersome union. Should it get out of hand and disaster threaten, the constitution was designed to pull the country back from the brink. Thus it rid itself of Richard Nixon, but not before his radicalism towards China achieved the US’s exit from Vietnam. Might this apply to Trump?Already a dose of the so-called new realism has torn through Nato’s cobwebs. Trump simply does not regard Russia as a threat to the US and western Europe. It is merely obsessed, as it has been throughout history, with its frontier states, with the Baltics, Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia and the “stans”, nations that Trump has little interest in defending. Yet ever since the end of the cold war – and during most of it – Nato’s rationale has relied on a thesis, a conventional wisdom, that Russia is set on the conquest of western Europe. If Keir Starmer really thinks, as he appears to, that Russia’s assault on Ukraine threatens Britain, Trump’s message is that Britain should pare down its welfare state and rearm quickly. American taxpayers are not going to be taken for that ride.It was indeed a Republican, Dwight Eisenhower, who warned against exaggerating the Russian threat to sustain Nato, which was already the biggest and richest military establishment the world had ever seen. The defence lobby demanded deterrence to be infinite. Trump has called that bluff. To him the US’s defence is just that: to guard its own borders. So should be Europe’s. It is hardly an outrageous view. No one was screaming for war when Russia invaded Georgia or Ukraine in 2014. It is one thing to disagree with this argument, another to dismiss it as 1939-style appeasement, as western defence lobbyists have done.Meanwhile, on the subject of borders Trump is hardly out on a limb. The US gainsabout 150,000Mexican immigrants a year, to join the11 million already there. Mexico and Canada bombard the US with imports, as does China. To Trump, Americans should pay for their goods what it costs Americans to make them. If they want Chinese cars they candonate 25%of the price to the government as a tariff. As for fentanyl, the way to get countries such as China to stem the flow and the deaths that follow is againwith tariffs, massive tariffs. Sometimes in diplomacy only force talks – force backed up with uncertainty.Almost every president comes to Washington promising to cut the bureaucracy. Thus did Warren Harding, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George W Bush. The reality is that an activist president breeds bureaucrats. The power of the centre in a democracy attracts more power. Trump knows he has no time for a long fight. It is Musk and the chainsaw or it is nothing. Education is not a federal function but a job for the states. So shut theUS Department of Education. Ditto USAID. Also slash the state department. Raid the Treasury. Sure, things will get broken, but it is no worse than doing nothing. That is what cultural revolution means.Let’s put it in language the Signal leakers will understand: what a bunch of pathetic sleazebags | Emma BrockesRead moreTrump and his administration’s actions have been in many respects appalling. To renege on Joe Biden’s aid to Ukraine in mid-battle, to call Volodymyr Zelenskyy a dictator, to insult Canada, to threaten Greenland, to stop famine relief to Africa, to propose a Gaza beach resort, to bully lawyers, toleak security meetings, all beggar belief. Trump and his team are like playground thugs in their crudity and rudeness.But this is the sound of things breaking. It illustrates why Washington develops a defensive “swamp”, to guard against inexperienced presidents. As it is, the chance of Trump succeeding in his radicalism is small. You cannot stage much of a revolution in two years.There will be a counter-revolution. Greenland is unlikely to be an American Ukraine. Tariffs will come back down. The Democrats will recover their nerve. Many of Trump’s “broken things” will be patched together. But in among the chaos are challenges to convention that were overdue. Nato could become realistic. A forever war in Ukraine – or wider – could be avoided and Russia readmitted to the community of nations, as China was after Nixon.This is at least possible. More to the point, the US may review its role in the world, a role that has meant a quarter of a century of moral belligerence, with appalling cost and slaughter. It should revert to being what it is, another nation among nations. That may even be the result of someone moving fast and breaking things.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

Democrats are calling for a congressionalinvestigationand theresignationof some of the officials involved in the breach, including the defense secretary,Pete Hegseth, and the national security adviser, Mike Waltz.In anarticle published on Monday,the Atlanticmagazine’s editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, outlined how he was able to follow the conversation among members of Trump’s cabinet over two days leading up to a series of US airstrikes on 15 March. But in the widespread outrage over the sharing of military information on a Signal chat, one essential question is getting lost: why is Trump bombing Yemen in the first place? Five consecutive US presidents and administrations (George W Bush, Barack Obama, the first Trump administration, Joe Biden and the second Trump administration) have ordered military attacks on Yemen, which is the poorest country in the Middle East.What the accidentally leaked war group chat reveals about the Trump administration | Moira DoneganRead moreCollectively, these leaders have continued more than two decades of failed US policies toward Yemen, centered on repeated bombings, counter-terrorism operations and support for a dictator who ruled the country for decades. Trump, whoportrayed himselfthroughout the last presidential campaign as “the candidate of peace”, appears almost eager to repeat past US mistakes in Yemen. During Yemen’s long civil war, years of intense bombing by two US allies – Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – failed to dislodge the Houthis from power. By the end of 2021, the UN estimated thatthe Yemen conflicthad killed 377,000 people – nearly 60% of whom died not in fighting but from indirect causes, including famine, cholera outbreaks and destruction of the health system.And while Yemeni civilians suffered,the Houthis emerged stronger after each military confrontation.Why aren’t Democrats and other critics of the Trump administration asking this basic question: what have two decades of regular US attacks on Yemen achieved, beyond more death and misery in a country where Washington already helped instigate one of the world’sworst humanitarian disasters? Anyone interested in real accountability for US policymaking should see this as a far bigger scandal than the one currently unfolding in Washington over the leaked Signal chat.The Trump administration says the latest US strikes on Yemen areintended to pressurethe Houthi militia to stop attacks on international shipping lanes in the Red Sea. After the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, and Israel’s subsequent invasion of Gaza, the Houthis began firing missiles and drones at commercial vessels sailing around the Bab el-Mandeb strait, where the Red Sea comes closest to Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen. The Houthis said they were acting in support of besieged Palestinians and pledged to stop targeting shipping lanes once Israel ended its war on Gaza.Trump is now repeating the same failed approach to Yemen as Biden and previous US presidentsThe attacks disrupted global shipping, as companies reroutedhundreds of vessels around South Africa, which can add thousands of miles to a freighter’s journey between Asia and Europe. In January 2024, the Biden administration, along with Britain, launched missile strikes against dozens of targets in Yemen. But Houthi leaders did not back down, and they stepped up their attacks on shipping vessels and continued to fire drones and missiles at Israel, most of which were shot down before reaching Israeli territory. Starting in July 2024,Israel carried out four roundsof airstrikes against Yemen, including attacks on the international airport in Sana’a, power stations and several ports.For more than a year, Biden avoided the most clear-cut path to stopping the Red Sea attacks and US escalation against the Houthis: his administration failed to apply pressure on the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to end Israel’s assault on Gaza and accept a ceasefire with Hamas. Biden refused to withhold billions of dollars in US weapons or to stop providing political cover for Israel at the UN security council and other international bodies. Instead, theBiden administrationcontinued to insist that it could bring the Houthis to heel by force.The Guardian view on the Signal war plans leak: a US security breach speaks volumes | EditorialRead moreBiden’s strategy failed to secure international shipping in the Red Sea. And the Houthis, who were losing support inside Yemen before the Gaza war, turned US attacks into apublic relations bonanza. Houthi leaders portrayed themselves as one of the few movements in the Arab world willing to defend the Palestinian cause and fight Israel and its western allies – in contrast to Arab governments that stayed on the sidelines and occasionally issued statements condemning Israel’s war. The Houthis also used the Gaza conflict to elevate their profile within the so-called “axis of resistance”, a network of regional militias supported by Iran. Two of the main factions in this alliance, Hamas and the Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah, were decimated by the Israeli military over the past 18 months, providing a new opening for Houthi leaders to enhance their popularity throughout the Middle East.The Biden administration – along with Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Middle East envoy – finally persuaded Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire with Hamas, which took effect on 19 January, a day before Trump’s inauguration. After the truce in Gaza, the Houthisstopped their attacksagainst commercial shipping in the Red Sea, as they had promised for more than a year. But as the ceasefire’s first phase expired on 2 March, Netanyahu refused tostart the second phaseof negotiations, which required a complete Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza and talks over a permanent truce. Instead, with theTrump administration’s support, the Israeli government imposed anew siegeon Gaza,banningall food and other aid deliveries. Netanyahubacked out of the dealhe had initially agreed to, and tried to pressure Hamas into accepting a six-week extension of the ceasefire’s first phase.By 18 March, Israel resumed its brutal war on Gaza with airstrikes thatkilled more than 400 Palestiniansin a single day. In the days leading up to the ceasefire’s collapse, Houthi leaders warned that they would restart their attacks on shipping vessels if Israel resumed its war. And that’s when the Trump administration began threatening renewed US military strikes against Yemen.It’s war and peace with Donald and Pete – and the worst group chat the world has ever seen | Marina HydeRead moreTrump is now repeating the same failed approach to Yemen as Biden and previous US presidents. In the Signal group chat messages revealed this week by the Atlantic’s editor, Trump cabinet members – who included the vice-president, JD Vance; the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; and the CIA director, John Ratcliffe –expressed disdainfor European allies and debated the timing of US attacks on the Houthis. But none of these top officials raised the possibility that pushing for a renewed ceasefire in Gaza would remove the Houthis’s rationale for their aggression against commercial shipping in the Red Sea.The most senior officials on Trump’s national security team did not seem to consider the idea of taking the Houthi leaders at their word: that they would cease disrupting global trade onceIsraelstops bombing Gaza, as they had done in January. Instead, the US security establishment continues bombing Yemen as it has done for two decades – and somehow hoping for a different outcome this time.Mohamad Bazzi is the director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern studies and a journalism professor at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsSignal group chat leakOpinionTrump administrationYemenUS militaryMiddle East and north AfricaBiden administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

My fellow Canadians are furiousThu 27 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTShareIremain immensely proud to have lived in Edmonton during the Oilers’ glory years, when Wayne Gretzky was not merely that city’s darling, but also a fresh-faced, flag-waving ambassador for all ofCanada.On ice, he dazzled with his scoring prowess and consistency; off ice, he charmed with his various charitable deeds and aw-shucks humility.Few could doubt his love for – and mentorship of – the late Joey Moss, the legendary locker-room attendant who was born with Down’s syndrome.So when it was suggested that the superstar centre and newly minted bridegroom had cried crocodile tears over being traded from Canada’s Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988, I didn’t hesitate to give him the benefit of the doubt.Et tu, Wayne: Gretzky’s legacy in Canada takes hit over 4 Nations snubRead moreBut when No 99 himself began starring in TV commercials endorsing online sports gambling, I started to squirm, if not cringe.When it became apparent that Gretzky, a dual citizen, was on the same page politically asDonald Trump, even being photographed with a Maga hat, my discomfort rose. Still, I reasoned that in a democracy, everyone has the right to decide where they throw their support.A month before Trump’s second inauguration – which the Gretzkys would go on to attend – the Orange One declared that his pal the Great One was so popular in Canada that he could handily run for political office here. It’s distinctly possible I swore under my breath before chalking it up to Trump’s usual mouthing-off.By the time the so-called leader of the free world began calling Canada “the 51st state” and dismissing our then prime minister as “Governor Trudeau”, my patience had worn thinner than onion skin.And it only got worse.As if he didn’t have enough to concern himself with on the home front, soon Trump was musing about Manifest Destiny 2.0, with an eye toreclaiming the Panama canal,buying Greenlandfrom Denmark,clearing Gazato build luxury resorts and … the eventual annexation of Canada, after first battering its citizens with crippling tariffs.Then came last month’s4 Nations Face-Off hockey finalin Boston, with the head-scratching choice of a rather bored-looking and awkward Gretzky as honorary captain for Team Canada.In Canada, I saw how Trump is ripping North America apart – and how hard its bond will be to repair | Andy BeckettRead moreDuring pre-game ceremonies, Gretzky – wearing not a Canadian jersey, but a navy suit with nary a trace of red and white; not so much as a Maple Leaf lapel pin – entered the ice from the US bench, not the Canadian one. He also gave the thumbs-up to US players while appearing not to acknowledge our side. Then to cap it off – so to speak – he went on to give the victorious Canadian players red hats bearing the words “Be Great”.That was the final straw for me, and apparently for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of other Canadians.Here is a man who could have used his “soft” power to educate Trump on the inviolability of this country’s sovereignty. Instead, he revealed his true colours (yes, with a “u”) are red, white and blue.Gretzky was widely booed in pubs that night, slammed as a traitor and a sellout. In the flap that ensued, there were calls to remove his statue from outside Rogers Place in Edmonton. A few days ago, the statue wassmeared with feces. An online petition demanding that the city of Edmonton rename Wayne Gretzky Drive hadgarnered more than 13,000 signaturesas of Wednesday.Others have expressed outrage that in 2009, when Gretzky was awarded this country’s highest civilian honour, Companion of the Order of Canada, he didn’t bother to come home to collect it. He still hasn’t.Over these past few weeks and after Trump’s inflammatory pronouncements, has Gretzky made any effort to explain or clarify himself or his beliefs, or defend his homeland? No, instead he has a) let his buddy Trump, on his social media website Truth Social, offer a tepid defence of Gretzky’s “low-key” support of Canada remaining a separate nation, while b) hiding behind wife Janet’s skirts.“I have never met anyone who is more proud to be a Canadian, and it has broken his heart to read and see the mean comments,” she said in an Instagram post that has since been deleted.As Trump menaces us in Canada, we have a question for Britain: when will you stand up to him? | Jennifer WelshRead moreNor did it help Gretzky’s cause that among those rushing to his defence was the Canadian-born former NHL-er and fellow Trump disciple Bobby Orr.“How fickle can people be, when someone who has given so much time and effort to Canadian hockey is treated in such a way?”Orr wrote in an op-edfor the Toronto Sun. “Listen, we all have our personal beliefs when it comes to things like religion and politics. Wayne respects your right to your beliefs – why can’t you respect his?”As the Globe and Mail sports columnist Cathal Kellywrites of Gretzky: “He’s a 64-year-old man of the world of now, creased by experience and not much the better for it. He’s an other-direction carpet bagger, a golf world hanger-on and a Mar-a-Lago regular. When you see Mr Gretzky up close now, the first word that leaps to mind is ‘louche’.“As of about a month ago, he is the polar opposite of what Canada wants in a representative.”Gretzky is hardly a naif, having stick-handled his way through countless interviews over the past more than 45 years. Widely credited for his vision, his ability to “skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been”, Gretzky had to have anticipated how this would play out with the folks back home.His silence makes clear to Canadians, if not the entire world, he no longer gives a puck.Karen Booth is a retired journalist and former resident of Edmonton whose loyalties will always lie with the Edmonton OilersExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionHockeyNHLDonald TrumpJustin TrudeauUS sportsAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

Amemorandum dated 15 February 2025, issued by the General Services Administration, the procurement arm of the federal government, explicitly dropped those strictures.“Any open solicitations that contain any of the provisions or clauses listed above should be amended to remove the provisions and clauses,” the memo read. Forget about simply putting an end to race-based affirmative action and DEI. Team Trump appears determined to turn the clock back to the 1950s, if not earlier than that. The ghost of Jim Crow smiles.The Confederate flag stood as a constant presence in and around the US Capitol on January 6 alongside makeshift gallows forMike Penceand a sea of Trump flags. Since his 2016 campaign, Trump’s relationship with the Confederacy and white supremacy has been too close.During his first run, he only reluctantly distanced himself from the endorsement of David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan. After the infamous 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Trump defended the “very fine people” on both sides. He even heaped praise upon Lee, the leader of the losing army during the US civil war.Angered by the removal of a statue of Lee from the Virginia state capitol in 2021, Trump rushed to his posthumous defense. “Robert E Lee is considered by many Generals to be the greatest strategist of them all,”Trump announced. “Except for Gettysburg”, Lee would have won the war, according to the 45th and 47th president. For good measure, Trump also labeled Lee as a national unifier.Discomfort with civil rights laws has been stirring within the Republican party for more than a decade. In 2010, Rand Paul, then a Senate candidate, mused that it should have been legally permissible for a privately owned restaurant to deny service to a Black customer.“Do you think that a private business has the right to say we don’t serve Black people?”Rachel Maddow asked him. Paul answered “Yes,” decrying racism and discrimination in the next breath.But it didn’t end there. In 2013, Paullost the servicesof Jack Hunter, his media aide and co-author, after it became known that Hunter was the “Southern Avenger”, a radio talkshow host who wore a Confederate mask and wrote articles praising John Wilkes Booth, Lincoln’s assassin. For good measure, Hunter boasted that he had toasted Booth’s birthday.Paul could only say that Hunter was “unfairly treated by the media and he was put up as target practice for people to say he was a racist, and none of that’s true.” Old embers still glowed.Fast forward. In apost to a private Facebook groupin April 2020, as Covid-19 broke out, Brian Westrate, the then treasurer of the Wisconsin Republican party,implored anti-stay-at-home protestersnot to bring Confederate flags or semi-automatic weapons to a scheduled demonstration. He did not want to give the mainstream media “the opportunity to paint us as racists or extremists”.Tellingly, Westrate also sought to disassociate the Confederacy from slavery, adding in the post: “I well understand that the Confederacy was more about states’ rights than slavery.”With time, sympathy for yesteryear also gained traction among Republican elites.In Justice on Trial, their book published in 2019 about the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, Carrie Severino, a conservative judicial activist, and Mollie Hemingway, the editor-in-chief of the Federalist, appeared to rubbish the legal underpinnings of Brown v Board of Education, the 1954 supreme court ruling that made state-imposed school segregation unconstitutional.Such decisions, they wrote, “may have been correct in their result but were decided on the basis of sociological studies rather than legal principles”. Note their use of the word “may”.It was a unique take, albeit too odious and too wrong for any of Trump’s three supreme court picks to embrace.Amy Coney Barretthas called Brown a “super-precedent … unthinkable” to overrule. Brett Kavanaugh said the same. Neil Gorsuch concedes it was properly decided.Trump is unleashing sadism upon the world. But we cannot get overwhelmed | Judith ButlerRead moreUndeterred,in 2021Hemingway took aim at the 1964 Civil Rights Act in Rigged, her attack on the outcome of the election of 2020. On the page, she resurrects the contention of the late Barry Goldwater, the failed 1964 Republican presidential candidate, that the Civil Rights Act evinced “an unconstitutional usurpation of power by the federal government”.Hemingway also derided Lyndon Johnson’s support for civil rights as a blatant appeal to Black voters. Her memory is selective.During the debate over the Civil Rights Act, congressional Republicans gave LBJ the votes he needed to overcome Dixiecrat opposition. Representative William Moore McCulloch, a conservative Republican whose ancestors had opposed slavery, was instrumental in gaining the bill’s passage. Illinois Republican senator Everett McKinley Dirksen backed Johnson’s efforts in the Senate to break the southern-led filibuster.Goldwater lost to Johnson in a landslide months later. That was the last time a Democrat accomplished that feat – or won the “white vote”, for that matter.In 1973, the Nixon justice departmentsued Trump, his father and their companyfor illegal housing discrimination.

(This is not the first time he has referred to Musk this way. Right before the election last year,Walz told a crowd: “Look, Elon’s on that stage, jumping around, skipping like a dipshit.”)Parking for a moment the perfection of the phrase “skipping like a dipshit” to capture Musk’s very particular style of movement and speech, the range of what can and can’t be said in politics has clearly, radically changed. When you look back on the phrase that caused Hillary Clinton so much trouble in 2016 – “basket of deplorables” – it sounds like a quote from an 18th-century novel. “Take that, sir! You and your basket of deplorables!” Now we have Trump referring to Jeffrey Goldberg, the Atlantic editor mistakenly added to the Signal chat, as a “sleazebag”, and Hegseth, the US defense secretary, telling JD Vance that he fully shares the vice-president’s “loathing of European free-loading”. We are millimetres away from someone shouting “asshole” across the floor of the Senate.The Signal chat, obviously, wasn’t supposed to be public, and responding to the leak this week has put the White House in a delicious bind – or rather, a bind that we might have enjoyed as delicious had it not underscored just how petrifyingly stupid Trump’s team really is. On Wednesday, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, had simultaneously to dismiss further revelations from the Atlantic designed to expose the White House lie that none of the information discussed was classified, whileslamming the magazinefor leaking “sensitive information”. Well, Karoline, which is it?The new information shared by the Atlantic on Wednesday was, to use government-approved language, freaking MIND-BLOWING. Two hours before the Yemeni bombing raid, Hegseth, Vance and national security adviser Mike Waltz went intoextraordinary detailas to the exact timing, nature and target of the bombings. “1345: ‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME – also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s),” wrote Hegseth, followed by a stream of similar details. After the release of the information on Wednesday, retired military brass lined up in the US to tell cable news channels: “There is no question this is classified.”The Guardian view on the Signal war plans leak: a US security breach speaks volumes | EditorialRead moreAnd while it remained deeply unfortunate for theTrump administrationthat, of all the people they might have mistakenly cc-ed into the group, it happened to be a serious journalist like Jeffrey Goldberg, given the frat boy tenor of the exchange, it could also have been a lot worse. We should, surely, be grateful that Mike Waltz, the national security adviser who organised the group on Signal, didn’t do that thing – look, we’ve all done it – where you inadvertently send a bitchy message about someone to the person in question, or in this case a message outlining a plan to drop a bomb on their head to the Houthi rebel commander target. Or as Waltz described him, in the style of a man shooting the breeze at the water cooler, “their top missile guy”. One assumes the only reason that guy wasn’t in the chat, too, is that he hadn’t gotten around to signing up for Signal.It’s not the rudeness, of course, it’s the flippancy that terrifies. The tone of the messages flying between the most powerful people in the world via an unsecure messaging app and on subjects of vital national security was that of someone idly texting with one hand while throwing and catching a hacky sack in the other. At one point, per Wednesday’s new trove, Mike Waltz wrote “typing too fast” and it must have taken every shred of collective will power in the group for no one to reply, “Sausage fingers!”Waltz, by the way, is the figure who has come closest to saying sorry for the mess, remarking on Fox News on Tuesday that he took “full responsibility” for the error. But then he ruined the vanishingly rare moment of appearing to be the only adult in the room by referring to Goldberg – a hero without whom none of us would know any of this had happened – as “scum”. And, sadly, back we went to square one.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSignal group chat leakOpinionTrump administrationUS national securityPete HegsethUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

They assault you and your neighbours, throw stones at your house, beat you. If you try to defend yourself, or document the violence, they attack you. When the military arrive, they detain you. Some of themjoin inwith the violence. This harrowing scene is not a story from Tsarist Russia or Jim Crow America. Last Monday, this was exactly what occurred in the Palestinian village of Susya in the occupied West Bank.The attackers who arrived in Susya were neither Cossacks nor Klansmen but Jewish-Israeli settlers accompanied by soldiers. Indeed, when the attacks commenced, three Palestinians were seized by the Israeli military, detained, and then subjected to police interrogation. Such violent raids are far from unique inWest Bank, especially in the areas of South Hebron Hills, Masafer Yatta and the Jordan river valley. Since the start of this year, the Centre for Jewish Non Violence has documented more than 40 violent settler attacks in the village of Susya alone.Most go unnoticed by the rest of the world. But this time was different. One of the Palestinian victims was the award-winning director Hamdan Ballal, whose film,No Other Land,which covers the destruction of Palestinian communities in the occupied West Bank, won best documentary at the recent Academy Awards. For hours, the military didn’t officially disclose his whereabouts, and attempts to locate him failed. When the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) finally issued a statement, theyabsurdly labelledhim and his fellow villagers terrorists.This facade of justice, when law is nothing but an empty shell, is typical of how the Israeli occupation works. Under its veneer of legality, the most brutal savagery is legitimised and the role of criminal and victim inverted. In the past three years I have submitted numerous complaints to the Israeli Ministry of Defence and Israel’s attorney general about settler violence. Nothing has ever happened. My experience is only one of many that indicates how the Israeli legal system makes a farce of justice and allows settlers to terrorise Palestinian communities with impunity.After the attack on Gaza began in 2023, the reign of terror in the West Bank has only intensified. According toB’Tselem(the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories), settlers have forced at least 18 Palestinian communities – more than 1,000 people – to flee their homes since October 2023. The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has found that settler violence, intimidation and harassment havedisplaced at least 300 Palestinian households, including hundreds of children.Benjamin Netanyahu’s government hasn’t just stood by passively and allowed this to happen. It has actively allocated funding and weaponry to illegal settlers. Last June, the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data initiative (Acled) found that armed settlers, some of whom have formed their own quasi-military forces, had received a “considerable amount” of weapons and munitions, including thousands of pistols, M-16 semi-automatic rifles and machine guns from the Israeli military, while regional councils had coordinated with the IDF and the national security ministry to buy hundreds of additional rifles. As that report put it: “the lines between settlers and the military are increasingly blurring”, and “the difference between civilian aggressors and the Israeli state apparatus is fading even further”.While civilian security squads are supposed to act only in self-defence, the truth remains that Israel is unwilling to tackle those vicious gangs, and that senior government ministers advocate in their favour. Only last week, Israel’s security cabinet approved a plan to recognise 13 Jewish settlements in the West Bank as independent. “We continue to lead a revolution of normalisation and regulation in the settlements. Instead of hiding and apologising – we raise the flag, build and settle,” said theIsraeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich.The atrocity that happened in Susya is only one example of the countless injustices committed under this criminal occupation. It shouldn’t take an Oscar winner for international audiences to notice these acts of violence. The Palestinian people deserve safety and liberation from the occupation, and sovereignty and independence. The international community must play its part in pursuing this. In recent months,a numberof governmentshave issued sanctions against Israeli settlers. This is a good start, but these sanctions must be far stronger if they are to have an effect.The sanctions should include established illegal settler municipalities. Those imposed by the UK, for example, only targetthree illegal settler outposts and four organisationsthat have supported the settlers. The established municipalities, such as Shomron regional council, which oversees 35 settlements that are home to an estimated 47,200 people, are the driving force behind violent attempts to take control of more Palestinian territories. Personal sanctions against government ministers who block counter-terrorist measures against violent settler groups are also essential. The UK can play a leading role in coordinating this response, particularly given the moral depravity of Donald Trump’s administration. As Washington DC cancels sanctions against violent settlers, London could present the world with a different and more righteous path.When I arrived in Susya on Tuesday after the attack, I knew exactly what I wanted to tell its people. I said that we want to live together, Arabs and Jews, as brothers and sisters. That we are not the enemy of one another, as we struggle together for freedom. A mere day after a gang of criminal Israeli settlers terrorised this village, its villagers welcomed me,an Israeli member of the Knesset, and my message for peace. This proves that the real conflict is not between nations, but between those who seek justice and those who vow bloodshed. The government of Israel has chosen the path of bloodshed, ethnic cleansing and war. It is up to all of us – and to you – to choose a different path.Dr Ofer Cassif is a member of the Knesset, representing the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality (Hadash) since 2019Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Shyness was comparative, and, in my family of origin, there was always someone shyer than me.I didn’t notice my shyness until I split with my first long-term partner when I was 26. He’d been my boyfriend from the age of 14, so – by the time we parted – almost half my life. This first boyfriend was gregarious, always ready for a chat. He had a way of walking into a room and cracking a joke, so by the time I entered on his tailwind, everyone was already laughing. He’d warmed the room and I’d felt welcome. I’d never been an adult without him, so didn’t have any awareness of how he’d held me under his wing.In the aftermath of our split, I became conscious of how difficult I found certain aspects of socialising. Simple things like how to enter and exit a room. Beginnings and endings: how to start a chat and how to finish one. How to mingle in a crowd of people. Parties or gatherings of any sort suddenly became fraught.I’m scared of being the granny everyone avoids. How do I get over this? | Leading questionsRead moreI’d always assumed my ex-partner was simplyfriendlybut, in 2013, a decade after our split, I readSusan Cain’s, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talkingand realised he wasan extrovertand I wasan introvert. According to Cain, shyness and introversion often cross over but they aren’t the same thing.Extroversion and introversion exist along a spectrum but they are mostly viewed as traits we’re born with rather than develop. It seemed odd that I had to get to 36 to learn this about myself. My chattiness one-on-one had worked as a distraction. In fact, I found bigger groups overwhelming and needed lots of alone time to recharge. Like the shyness, my obvious introversion took some time to become obvious to me.My granddaughter came in to this world so vivacious that her extroversion was impossible to miss. Even from before she was mobile, she was throwing her arms up in welcome and squealing with delight at the sight of a visitor. Everything displayed, everything shared. She’s so friendly out in public that I often come up against my own shyness when I carry her around. When she started talking, she’d motion to someone in the queue ahead and say – “I shy” – but what she meant was,I would like to connect with that person and I’m not sure how.Striking up conversations with strangers is not my forte but she seemed to want my help. She was not yet two but she was already pushing me out of my comfort zone. One day, while I was wheeling her along the main street of my country town, an unknown woman called out, “Hey, party girl!” This was clearly not aimed at me and I had to laugh. My granddaughter’s social networks were already larger than mine and she was still in nappies.What is a shy person to do with such gregariousness?My eldest son, her father, had been the same. Throughout his life I’d watched him making enthusiastic small talk with strangers. As a teen he’d start up chats with elderly people at the checkout, spying dogfood in their trolleys and asking what type of dog they had. Often, they’d brace at first – the dissonance of this friendliness with his teenage attire – but a few minutes in and they’d be smiling. When he was young, before I’d read Cain’s book, I’d tried to force rest days on him to catch up from the kind of socialising that left me drained. He never seemed to need it but I did.On these home days all his games involved imaginary “parties”. I found his outgoingness baffling; he wondered why I was always so tired. When my second born came on the scene, dreamy and internal, he made perfect sense. He cried when I took him out in the world, all that overwhelming sound and colour. He nestled into me, staying close. As a toddler, his favourite game was snuggling on the couch. Our needs in perfect sync.In my family, introvert-extrovert pairings are common. Both my sons have paired up with their opposites. Now I understand the terminology, it all seems so clear! My introvert son’s partner once declared, “I hate having a shower, it’s so boring!” and I realised it was the only time she ever spent alone. I watch them all navigate their differing needs: the introverts enjoying recharging in quiet, the extroverts wanting chats in the shower.My granddaughter is now just past two but she can talk up a storm. I was out with her a few weeks back and we bumped into a friend I hadn’t seen for years. I was immediately awkward but my granddaughter came to my aid. “You have a blue dress!” she said to my friend, “and mine is pink!” The ice was broken. It was a beginning. I was holding my granddaughter on my hip but she had me under her wing.My younger son and his partner have a fifteen-week-old baby. A new granddaughter! Thus far, she’s expressive and smiley. My older son’s partner gave birth last week. A grandson! In this genetic lottery, I wonder what we’ll get. Introverts who’ll snuggle on the couch, or extroverts who’ll help us make new friends.

In 2014, the all-party parliamentary group on modern languages estimated thatthe UK’s untapped linguistic potentialwas worth£48bn. It’s £8bn more than Reevesadded to the tax billlast year, and if anything it has grown, since Brexit has re-oriented “global Britain” towards customers beyond Europe. Ask any native English speaker who trades internationally: if you’re buying, English will do, but if you’re selling, better to speak the client’s tongue.The UK’s language teaching has been in steady decline for 30 years, and a big cause is a lack of qualified language teachers. That’s one reality. Another is that, over the same period, the country has become more linguistically diverse. It has an expanding pool of fluent bilinguals, sometimes multilinguals, who are being ignored – their other languages in some cases stigmatised. Often, those languages are native to regions our post-Brexit businesses would dearly love to sell to.Not only is the government not tapping this pool of speakers, it’s pretending the pool doesn’t exist. In 2021, the census for England and Wales asked one question about language: “What is your main language?” (and for those who did not answer “English” to that question: “How well can you speak English?”). For a person who speaks more than one, theneuroscientist Thomas Bakof the University of Edinburgh told me, that’s like asking the parent of several children: “Which is your main child?” People were prevented from explaining that they spoke one language at home and another at work. (The question wasslightly different in Scotland, but barely more informative.)The census is conducted every 10 years, and Bak is one of a group of researchers who have beencampaigning to alter the questionin the next edition. They are asking for a tweak of a few letters, so that it reads: “What are your main languages?”, and for the response box to be enlarged. So far, even this modest request has been ignored. It’s a moot point as to whether the census willexist in 2031, so you could argue that the campaign is purely symbolic. For now, however, the census is the only way of gauging the nation’s linguistic capital, and it forms the basis for the government’s language policy for the next decade.How, then, do we know that Britain is becoming more multilingual? By extrapolating from a hotch-potch of academic studies, school surveys and the census itself. In England and Wales in 2021,more than 90different answers were given to the language question, which is probably a vast underestimate because of the way the question was asked. More than 300 languagesare spoken in London, while in England the proportion of schoolchildren whose first language is not English has been increasing year-on-year. It currently stands at aboutone in five. The US and many continental European countries are on a similar trajectory.It’s instructive to set this situation in its historical context. Monolingualism was an invention of the nation state, only a few centuries ago, but the word has always described an aspiration more than a reality, despite temporarily effective and often cruel attempts to suppress non-official languages and dialects. For tens or even hundreds of thousands of years before the modern period,Homo sapienswas multilingual, and much of the world remained so even after Europe and its former colonies insisted on a linguistic standard.Seen in that light, the present trend looks like a reversion to type. Immigration is part of the explanation: over the 400 years of the colonial period, the net flow of people was away from Europe; since the second world war, it has been towards Europe. But there are other forces at work. Though immigrants continue to bow to pressure to assimilate, the French linguist François Grosjean has found that they are holding on to their native languages for longer – over generations. Already in 1982, he couldmake the discombobulating claimthat “there is probably a larger proportion of bilinguals in monolingual nations than in bilingual and multilingual countries”.Still, many people in officially monolingual countries cling to the false notion that monolingualism is the natural state of humanity. It is particularly cherished by isolationist states, even though, absurdly enough, they probably need better indigenous language skills than networked ones. The new Trump administration hasdeclared English the official language of the US, while under the UK’s Turing scheme for student exchange, British students can go abroad but foreign students can’t return. Many academics consider Turinga poor relationof the EU’s Erasmus programme, which it replaced after Brexit.The potential benefits of multilingualism aren’t only economic. Many studies have shown that speaking more than one language protects against dementia, whichcost the UK £42bnin 2024. Imagine if we not only reduced that bill by teaching languages better, but covered it entirely with the income generated by bringing our native linguists into the workforce? Acquiring languages is good for mental health too, because it expands the pool of potential connections. There’s even evidence thatmultilinguals are more rationaland open-minded than monolinguals, and that they canaccess more memories.So here’s a checklist for the chancellor and her cabinet colleagues: make our languages visible; create incentives for multilinguals to become language teachers and translators; think about ways of assessing children’s language skills more flexibly than through GCSEs and the English baccalaureate, and not just in German and Spanish, but in Mandarin, Bengali and Swahili too. More generally, value linguistic diversity and forget “one nation, one language”. That dictum has had its day, and it was short.Laura Spinney is a science journalist and the author of Proto: How One AncientLanguagewent Global and Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How it Changed the WorldExplore more on these topicsLanguageOpinionLanguagesEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

We shed data from everything that we do, and megalithic corporations hoover it up. With that, they know us better than we know ourselves, and the information we readily give up is used to upsell to us, and manipulate our political and personal views. We are users of social media, but in reality we are the product. Google’s mission was never simply to provide a search engine; it was to curate the world’s information. Perhaps it is no coincidence that the commercial genetic testing company 23andMe was cofounded by Anne Wojcicki, once the wife of one of the Google creators; 23andMe’s mission was to curate the single richest dataset in the known universe, the one you carry around in your cells: your genome.23andMe provided information purporting to be about your personal health and ancestry. All you had to do was spit in a tube and give them some money, and in return you’d get a very glossy map of your genetic genealogy, and some info on the probability that you like the taste of coriander, or your skin flushes when you’re drunk, or whether you have sticky or wet earwax, or your eye colour – things you might have already known, if you have ever looked in a mirror, or stuck your finger in your ear. If you look carefully, they did give solid info on the science underlying the results, but who reads the small print?Your DNA is your most private data. The billions of letters of genetic code in your cells are unique to you, and always will be, in the whole history and future of humankind, even if you are an identical twin. It contains the history of your family, of our species, and of life on Earth. It harbours the most personal conceivable information about your family, your life and health. And that is what 23andMe wanted.The companyhas just filed for bankruptcy, and this does not sadden me. It didn’t invent direct-to-consumer genomics, but it made big data big business. The genius of its business model was not simply to get you to volunteer this personal data to a private company, but to persuade you to actually pay to give it to them. It then commercialised your DNA byselling it on to pharmaceutical companies, which would use it to develop drugs, ultimately for profit. It was the type of racket that a mob boss might look on and say: “And this is legal?” There was always an opportunity to opt out, but most people did not, because who reads the small print? And what did you get in exchange? A scientific trinket.There were good news stories too – tales of lost relatives being found, or previously unknown parents being identified. I discovered an unknown branch of Jewish ancestry, which petered out six generations ago. The scientists at 23andMe published some studies that used customers’ data to uncoverlost information on transatlantic slavery, and this was only possible because they were sitting on one of the largest collections of human genomes in existence.But the main interest came from people who thought they were paying to answer the nebulous question of where they came from. The trouble is: it’s an empty promise. There is no method for identifying the geographical origin of your ancestors using genetics. Your ancestors about 50 generations back arefrom all over the world, and besides, biology does not bestow membership to a tribe or clan or people or country. What 23andMe was actually doing was comparing your DNA to that of other paying customers, and matching up where they live today, and inferring that you have ancestors in that location. It kind of works, but is mostly meaningless. When the data lets you believe that you are 37% German, or 18% Spanish, or whatever, it might feel fun, but of course there is no way of being 37% German. White supremacists loved this type of service too because – locked into their scientifically ignorant ideology – they believed it would reveal some sort of racial purity. Even when testing uncovered previously unknown ancestry from people they deem inferior, they would often attribute the results to aJewish conspiracy.As for the health information it provided, the results are also of profoundly limited use, because the tests are not designed todiagnose medical conditions, and the genetic variants anaylsed as part of the service are derived from population-levelstatistics, which are not particularly informative to individuals. I discovered that I have a genetic variant that at a population level is associated with a slightly higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Knowing this neither bothers me nor has prompted a change in my behaviour. It does not mean that I will get Alzheimer’s, and if you don’t have that same variant it doesn’t mean you won’t.DNA is not fate. 23andMe was trading on ignorance of how the genome actually works, and perpetuating a deterministic view of genetics that is outmoded and wrong.Opt out: what to do with your 23andMe account after company filed bankruptcyRead moreMaybe people fell out of love with this fad because what are you meant to do with the reports anyway? Sure, some people did find out new things about their family ties. But most of the millions of paying customers discovered nothing of note. Maybe punters got wise to the weakness of the claims the glossy marketing made, such as “root for your roots” – a laughable attempt to sell testing kits to football fans during the 2018 World Cup.And then there was thedata breach. In 2023, 23andMe was hacked – 7 million customers’ most private data was leaked, and Ashkenazi Jewish customers’data was put on saleon the dark web. You paid a company to store your data, and it failed.So, for all the punters who were seduced by the promise of some vaguely sciencey storytelling, you might want tolook at deleting your datawhile 23andMe is in financial turmoil. The lessons are clear: understand the science and check the small print.

What matters is that it feels like oneGaby HinsliffThe ‘party of change’ says it’s bound by fiscal rules. What voters hear is that all governments are the same, and things will never get betterThu 27 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 27 Mar 2025 09.18 EDTShareIt was change that won it. That was the single word to which Labour eventually boiled down all its complex ambitions; the six-letter slogan plastered triumphantlyacross its manifesto, because by the summer of 2024 change was pretty much the only thing the people of an exhausted country could all agree on. What kind of change exactly had by that point almost ceased to matter. Anything but this, millions of us told ourselves, as we scattered our votes in all directions.It was clear even at the time that there were tensions between that urgent, almost reckless hunger for change and the naturally careful, cautious instincts of a steady-as-you-go incoming prime minister and chancellor. But Labour papered over them with the impenetrable mantra that, actually, if you think about it, “stabilityischange”. Well, actually, it isn’t. That line was never going to hold, and withWednesday’s spring statementit finally broke.AsRachel Reevesquite rightly pointed out when called on to explain how the relatively narrow room for manoeuvre she had left herself in last autumn’s budget had been wiped out by (among other things) the threat of war in Europe and associated economic turbulence, the world has changed. But the problem is that she doesn’t seem to have changed with it. Her fiscal rules on borrowing remain non-negotiable – in fairness the bond markets don’t leave her much choice there – and she won’t budge (so far) on taxes. Her only remaining idea for plugging the gap was therefore a continuation of the status quo offered by the previous government, which means a truly wretched round of spending cuts.There was never going to be a good way of saying that a Labour government is taking money away from people who can’t wash themselves below the waist without help, or go to the loo alone. But there’s one surefire way of making it sound even worse, and that’s announcing at the last minute that these cuts still weren’t deep enough to convince theOffice for Budget Responsibility, forcing you to slash millions more from the sickness benefits bill in a hurry.More than3 million UK familieswill now lose out from cuts, including to the health element of universal credit – paid to people with limited ability to work.Around 370,000 disabled peoplewill lose the personal independence payment (Pip) they currently rely on, made regardless of whether they’re working or not and designed to help with the everyday costs racked up when you can’t just easily hop on a bus or you need the heating on all day. About a quarter of million people risk being pushed into poverty by welfare cuts if they can’t find work.Will Rachel Reeves’s tough decisions pay off? Our panel on the spring statementRead moreHanging over all this is the grim understanding that the headroom Reeves has so painfully recreated by signing off on these cuts could yet vanish again overnight, if Donald Trump wakes up in the mood for a trade war. Rumours persist that his price for avoiding tariffs on the UK might be the scrapping of a digital tax currently levied on tech giants, a question Reeves carefully ducked when pressed on it. Few things would be harder forLabourbackbenchers to swallow than the prospect of slashing help for vulnerable people, while letting tech billionaires off the hook to appease the US president.Though technically none of this constitutes a return to austerity – Reeves will still be raising public spending in real terms overall, though by less than originally promised, and she is pinning her hopes on millions feeling the benefit of an imminent rise in the minimum wage – good luck explaining that to people who use the phrase more as shorthand for the sinking feeling that no matter what was promised, nobody is coming to the rescue.When more than half of Britons say the country’s either heading back into austerity or has never left it, according to a new report gloomily entitledDoom Loop Deepensfrom the More in Common thinktank, they’re not thinking of the dictionary definition. What they really mean is a sense that nothing changes, no matter who is in power, and maybe this is just how life is going to be now.Staggeringly, almost half say they can’t be sure the cost of living crisis willeverend, while seven in 10 think it’s unlikely this government will improve their lives. This depth of pessimism alone is enough to explain why Labour’s poll lead has collapsed, leaving them neck and neck with the still-hated Tories and a Reform party that barely even existed a year ago but that now has every expectation of cleaning up at the coming local elections.All Reeves’s talk of OBR constraints and fiscal rules, meanwhile, must make it sound to those on the sharp end of the cuts as if their lives are being sacrificed to appease arbitrary gods, none of whom are answerable to the people getting hurt. Though she is right that it’s ordinary people who suffer when chancellors throw caution to the wind – as Liz Truss helpfully demonstrated not so very long ago – and that Britain would be punished for borrowing more, what people increasingly hear is “computer says no”. A chancellor who once made a virtue of being strong and steady sounds increasingly tangled up in her own spreadsheets, unable to break free.Thankfully, this isn’t Reeves’s last word on the subject. The really big decisions about how Britain funds its security in a dangerous world will come in this autumn’s budget, when she still has the option of raising taxes – though by then it may be harder to portray them as a “war tax”, the price of containing a rogue American president.Some Labour MPs wonder if she’s simply trying to show she’s exhausted all other options first before doing the one thing Labour swore it wouldn’t do, or buying time and hoping some green shoots of growth might have emerged by autumn – perhaps from what looks set to be a growing defence industry, creating jobs in Labour’s old manufacturing heartlands, or even from closer trading ties to Europe if those can be negotiated atMay’s summit.But the risk is that she merely unleashes six months of anxious and growth-dampening speculation about what tax rises might be looming, running battles with her own party over cuts some won’t be able to stomach, and a growing nihilism among voters who still can’t see light at the end of the tunnel. There is nothing more fatal, for a party of change, than slowly becoming the party of more of the same.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSpring statement 2025OpinionRachel ReevesLabourTax and spendingBenefitsDisabilityEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

But after misfiring albums, a legal drama involving bright hopes NewJeans and with domestic fans getting bored, the South Korean music industry is nervousShaad D'SouzaThu 27 Mar 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 27 Mar 2025 14.22 EDTShareEarlier this decade, it seemed as if the long-vaunted South Korean takeover of American pop was finally happening. In summer 2020, BTS’s Dynamite became the first K-pop track to top the US chart, and in 2023, girl group Blackpink became the first K-pop act toheadline Coachella. But just two years later, the story looks very different.RubyandAlter Ego, recent solo albums by Blackpink members Jennie and Lisa, each debuted at No 7 on the US album chart before dropping out of the Top 10 after one week, and neither album produced a single that peaked higher than No 68. Relative newcomers such as Tomorrow X Together, Ateez and Twice have achieved solid first-week chart positions, thanks to strong physical album sales, before facing precipitous drop-offs. NewJeans – a young, critically acclaimed new K-pop group who looked to be the genre’s strongest hope in the US after Blackpink and BTS – have been bogged down by controversies and legal dramas in South Korea, stopping them from capitalising on the success of their 2023 single Super Shy.Even back home the genre is struggling. “K-pop has lost a lot of market traction in South Korea – the music is not being written to appeal to a Korean audience, but more to this homogenised, globalised audience,” says Sarah, the host of the Idol Cast podcast, who uses a pseudonym for fear of reprisal from K-pop fans. “It’s trying to be all things to all people, and ends up being sort of nothing to no one.”Sarah says thatK-popmade by obsessed-over “idols” – performers hot-housed in training camps by entertainment agencies – is no longer seen as cool in trend-conscious South Korea. “A lot of older fans have entered the fandom, including older women. I’m not bashing them, I’m one myself,” she says, but these newcomers have alienated young would-be fans. K-pop has also, she says, “become a lot more siloed” away from the rest of South Korean culture. “You’re not seeing idols in TV dramas or variety shows; a lot of content is moving on to gated [online] platforms like Weverse.”View image in fullscreenBTS in 2020, around the release of hit single Dynamite.This shift coincides, says US reporter Tamar Herman, with a move away from Korean lyrics. “It’s built to be exported,” she says. “Because of Dynamite’s success as an all-English song, K-pop started leaning into English.”This also alienated Korean listeners – while more innovative acts such as Le Sserafim and Aespa, without the forceful marketing push thatBTSand Blackpink received, haven’t found a footing in the US market. “The US loves to invest attention into certain artists – once you have it, you become the [sole] representative of [K-pop],” says Herman. “We don’t care for the hottest thing – we want the artists we’ve followed since high school, like Taylor Swift.”The UK has only fitfully embraced K-pop, though there’s enough of a fandom for Tomorrow X Together to play London’s huge O2 Arena this week, and for Stray Kids to book two nights at Tottenham Hotspur’s stadium in the summer. But artists like these, Sarah says, could be losing traction in South Korea because they have “pivoted their focus from the domestic market to the global K-pop market”. The South Korean charts are filled out instead with J-pop acts, Korean rap and “2D idols” like Plave, a virtual boyband. Meanwhile, Bang Bang Bang, a 2015 hit by boyband BigBang, “has consistently been one of the most-streamed K-pop songs globally over the past few months, which is not great for K-pop,” Sarah says. “Where are the new songs?”In the US, one of the few genuine hits by a K-pop star in recent months has beenAPT, by another Blackpink member, Rosé. But it sounds nothing like K-pop, instead taking its cues from pop-punk and new wave, and is a collaboration with the eternally popular Bruno Mars. “Take him out of the song and I doubt it’s nearly as successful,” says Joshua Minsoo Kim, a critic who reviewed Jennie and Lisa’s albums for Pitchfork.View image in fullscreenFans watching Le Sserafim at Coachella in April 2024.Photograph: Christina House/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images“[Rosé] has done everything she can to separate herself from the brand of K-pop,” says Sarah. “She’s even moved her copyrights to an American company – so that should speak to her confidence in the South Korean industry to handle an actual global hit song.”The teen five-piece NewJeans were one of the biggest success stories in K-pop’s western expansion. Their breakout EP, Get Up, featured collaborations with the alt-R&B singer-songwriter Erika De Casier and experimental Norwegian duo Smerz, and their innovative sound found acclaim among fans and critics. “[Producer] Min Hee-jin’s creative direction was very strong,” says Kim, and the music “was often produced by Korean producers privy to stuff happening in the underground and internationally”.Here was an act that actually felt cool to gen Z and younger millennials – but over the past year, NewJeans have been stuck in a bitter war with Hybe, the K-pop company that formed them. The group attempted to terminate their contract with Ador, the Hybe subsidiary that formed them in 2022, alleging mismanagement. The group were also angry over the fact that Min Hee-jin was dismissed as Ador’s chief executive. Ador subsequently sued NewJeans, alleging that the band had no grounds to terminate their contract – though in February the label stated they “regret the escalation of this matter to court and believe that most claims advanced by NewJeans members thus far have arisen from misunderstandings”.The band are the rare K-pop act to break ranks from the genre’s rigid corporate system; last year, they aired a bombshell livestream in which they spoke directly to fans about their perceived mistreatment. The spat has since bloomed into a media storm, fuelling discussions around the rights of K-pop stars as workers,a status they have been legally denied.View image in fullscreenNewJeans in July 2024 in Incheon, South Korea.Photograph: The Chosunilbo JNS/ImaZins/Getty ImagesThe potential ramifications are grave – a coalition of trade bodies warned in February that the spat could “collapse” the K-pop industry – and NewJeans have continued to act as whistleblowers. This month, member Danielle said that when she was a trainee in one of the idol boot camps, she was constantly surveilled and had to have all meals approved by management (Ador and Hybe have not commented on those allegations).Last week, a South Korean court ruled infavour of Ador, granting a preliminary injunction that will stop NewJeans from working outside their Ador contract until the main lawsuit hearing in April – they had recently been performing as NJZ. Ador has said that it is “fully committed to supporting the artists going forward” so long as they perform as NewJeans; the band, posting as NJZ, have said they can “no longer remain with a management that has disrespected our identities and undermined our achievements”. They are now on hiatus and planning to challenge the injunction, saying in a statement to Time magazine: “It almost feels like Korea wants to turn us into revolutionaries.”The UK may be waning as a pop superpower – but a new generation is being nurturedRead moreKim is pessimistic about a new K-pop group breaking the genre’s losing streak in the west, and Sarah says K-pop companies have started milking fanbases more intensely than before to make up for the decline in new artists breaking, with fees to access elements like fanclubs and exclusive videos. “At a certain point, the audience becomes tapped out: you can only pay so much for your hobby, especially looking at a recession coming around the corner,” she says. “You can’t ask fans to sustain this multimillion-dollar industry. It’s a losing strategy in the end.”But Herman still believes there is great K-pop going untapped in the US – “certain groups who are huge in other parts of the world”, such as girl group Twice, “arguably the biggest K-pop girl group of this generation, if you look at money and album sales. I don’t know if they’re going to cross over or not, but I’m here for everything.”Explore more on these topicsK-popPop and rockSouth KoreaBTSfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Does the prospect of sudden ageing frighten you?BenderRodriguezIt’s not sudden. I was in [King] Lear when I was 64 and said: “I need a wig that’s grey because he’s supposed to be 80.” Now I’m 73 and I still think inside I’m a brunette. This is the 54th year of my career. The last decade has just galloped past. I waited for something like this – a project that I latched on to. There’s been a lot of stuff that I turned down. I’m now being very pernickety about what I commit three or four months of my life to.No doubt there was also a lot of work behind it, but was playingHector Barbossain the Pirates of the Caribbean filmsas much fun as it looked? Have you everreinhabitedthe character for a brief moment, to amuse yourself or others?Liam01Yeah, it was fun. [Director] Gore Verbinski had a kind of pop cultural sense of anarchy. Anyone who liked the Pirates films should also check out Rango, which has his cinematic fingerprints all over it. I’ve reinhabited the character for brief moments, for the Disney ride in Anaheim, and I think Shanghai, and maybe in Florida. I remember having to go and voice some lines after a day on another film, and rolling my eyes going: “Oh my God, will this never go away?” It’s the vanity of being a moment of cinema folklore. It’s fun.View image in fullscreenGeoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End.Photograph: Photographer Peter Mountain/Disney/AllstarHave you had much experience of care homes?BenderRodriguezMy mum died in 2022, quite sweetly on Valentine’s Day, which was very moving. She’d been in a care home for about three or four years. The last year there was a noticeable decline. She was in her 90s. My mother-in-law, also. So, yes, once you turn 60, the time is coming up for you to thank your carers.How did it feel having a Nobelprize winner playing your conscience? (Harold PinterinThe Tailor of Panama.)UrrurrshIt was three of the greatest days of my life. He was a hero to me when I was studying English theatre in the late 60s in Brisbane. And suddenly he was there. They’d done a painting of Harold in a three-piece, blue pencil-stripe suit with a tailor’s measure around his neck. He came in, a little sweaty and a little prickly, and he saw that painting and tears just welled in his eyes. He said: “My father worked in the East End as a tailor, like many Jewish émigrés did. So I find that overwhelmingly powerful.”Pinter told me that when he got his first royalty cheque for The Homecoming, he went down and said: “Dad, you’re coming home and you don’t need to come back here any more.”The Rule of Jenny Pen review – John Lithgow pulls the strings in care home horrorRead moreYou’ve played a lot of real-life characters includingTrotskyand nowGroucho Marx. How does your approach to these roles differfrom fictional characters?hubbahubba,Haider3, WomanofWolfvilleI have played a number of what people would sniff their noses at and call biopics. And we all know that, for some biopics in commercial Hollywood, you’re gonna get the Wikipedia tropes. With Elizabeth, the director Shekhar Kapur – being a man from India – never spoke to me like he was from the RSC. He just spoke about Krishna. He spoke about Elizabeth and Walsingham as being like gods: mythical as well as big political figures. So that’s always been a useful way to go. Even playing Einstein [inGenius] or Trotsky [in Frida], you’ve got to find what’s inside that character that has some kind of contemporary relevance you can portray without denying the historical context.Quills (2000)is a favourite and your performance was superb. What was it like working withPhilip Kaufman?BicuserI went into a meeting with Philip to say that I couldn’t possibly do the part and that Marlon Brando should do it, because in 1808, the Marquis de Sade was 300lb and I’m not.I learned a great lesson from that because he said: “No, the Marquis that Doug has written is the fantasy in the Marquis’ head. It’s as if he’s the hero of the story: a wry, lithe, elegant, muscular god in his own attic.”View image in fullscreenRush as the Marquis de Sade in Quills.Photograph: Cine Text/Sportsphoto/AllstarI very much enjoyedThe Best Offerin which you andDonald Sutherlandwere both excellent. It should have been a bigger success. Any other films you’ve done which deserved more than they got?pconlFilms get what they deserve. I would’ve liked The Warrior’s Way, originally called Laundry Warrior – which I thought was a much more kitsch and honest title – to have done better. It was struck down by the big financial crisis in 2008. The fact that the lead character was a baby, too, didn’t help. I thought they’d written a fantastic eastern western where what was at stake was the survival of the baby who was the last of the clashing clans. I thought it could have gone gangbusters, but yeah, not so much.What memories do you have ofToowoomba?DidgebabaWhen I was eight, my single mum and my sister and I went to live with my grandparents there. It was kind of artistic wasteland in regional Australia. But it also wasn’t.George Sorlie had created this travelling variety troupe which had been picked up again by his widow and a great clown, Bobby Le Brun. By night, they would do a variety show with jugglers and dancers and songs and speciality acts. And then by day, that whole troupe would do a panto.These people were deeply rooted in the smell of sawdust, the greasepaint, putting the tent up. There was also the Toowoomba Philharmonic Society, which gave me a lifelong love of Broadway musicals because their production in 1959 of Oklahoma is still deeply etched into my psyche.View image in fullscreenRush as Philip Henslowe in Shakespeare in Love.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyLantanais one of my favourite neo-noirs. Is noir an Aussie genre, or is can-do, sunny optimism more in line with the national psyche?StevefromNottinghamI’m always surprised that’s the film the gen Z audience knows me for.Both pessimism and optimism happen. When I did Shakespeare in Love, the young guys were all staunchly regional and proud of it, no longer the generation who had to crush their regional dialect into PR. They were proudly scousers or northerners. But they could do their stuff. Every afternoon we’d watch Neighbours and they were all really great at what they thought was a fantastic Australian accent. And I said: “No, that’s a television Australian accent. No one exists that actually speaks like that. It’s much more nuanced.”I think that is the sunny can-do image of Australia. There’s a cultural reality to theTen Pound Poms. But Australia also has films likeWake in FrightandNitram, the film that Justin Kurzel did about the Port Arthur massacre. We come from a country that has a lot of skeletons in the closet, a lot of regrets, a lot of difficulties, from white settlement onwards. The good film-makers don’t shy away from that. I think that’s why our boisterous, rough-edged sardonic sense of humour can be quite biting and quite satirical. A way of acknowledging that we’re just not surf culture.Was John Lithgow as scary as he looked [in Jenny Pen] and how do you rate his Aussie accent?BenderRodriguezYes! The first conversation we had on a Zoom he said: “I’ve got this guy to make some special teeth.” And I went: “You’re my kind of actor.” He’s got aDe Palmadegree in horror acting. And he had silver-grey contacts made and said: “The moment I put them in, the character was 98% there.”I did tell him to beware the New Zealand accent. It’s a trap for English-speaking people. Kate Winslet is the only person I know who has the kind of dialect chops to do it. Her impression of Jane Campion was forensic in its detail. John and I talked about what one of my voice tutors used to call having an “idiolect”, which is the distinct sound of your voice. And John went for something nasty and dry and deceptive and duplicitous, just in the nature of the character.What is your favourite Peter Sellers film? After preparing for your great performance as him [in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers], would you agree with his very sad assessment that outsidehis roles, he had no real sense of his own identity?Bauhaus66I was so lucky. I was in LA doing Pirates and at the end of Sunset Boulevard there were a lot of extraordinary DVD and VHS shops. We found pretty much every Peter Sellers film. So I did watch everything. He was blessed with a kind of extraordinary genius. But with success and fame and drugs and swinging London and everything, you have to confront a lot of stuff. I think that happened to him.I don’t care that Caravaggio murdered people. I don’t mind that Ripley murders people, because I thought Andrew Scott made that characterso alarmingly truethat I sort of hoped he got away with it. A lot of what was going on around him was privileged and he’s going: “Fuck off! You are dead, east coast rich people!”View image in fullscreenSwinging time … Rush in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers.Photograph: United Archives GmbH/AlamyYou’ve portrayedLionel Logue(inThe King’s Speech),Donovan Donaly(Intolerable Cruelty),Hans Hubermann(The Book Thief),Sir Andrew Aguecheek(Twelfth Night), and even voicedBunyip Bluegum(The Magic Pudding). Is it purely coincidental, or are you secretly drawn to alliterative characters?VerulamiumParkRangerThis made me actually go through my IMDb list, and my theatrical list, to see if they’d missed anything. I avidly read Superman comics as a child and I was obsessed by the LL syndrome: Lois Lane, Lana Lang, Lex Luther. I found that kind of phenomenal when I was 10 as I did when I read Ulysses inShakespeare and Company, where I was fortunate enough to blag a room for six weeks when I first moved to Paris.I have played a “Harry” more times than any other character – in The Tailor of Panama, The Banger Sisters, in some short film. I’ve been ‘Harried’. Michael Caine has the same thing. Caine would only ever call Joaquin Phoenix “Joe-a-quin”; “You read it, Geoffrey,” he’d say. “And it’s notRafeFiennes, it’s Ralph.” He was hilarious like that.View image in fullscreenRush as Lionel Logue in The King’s Speech.Photograph: Publicity image from film companyKia ora!What attracts you to roles first – the story or the character? I love your performance inHouse on Haunted Hill,even though it’shardly Proust. You seem to have a whale of a time, though, and that comes through every scene.WilfyFrederickI never assumed it was Proust. I liked the fact that it was a William Malone horror piece, avoiding CGI, with all of the old William Castle techniques to create a netherworld and creepy scenarios. I’d been in tights or period costume for so long and I thought: this is the ideal role to do because, as one of the producers – Robert Zemeckis or Joel Silver – said: “It’s low budget. We’ll make it for $15m and it will do two bumper weekends for Halloween.” Which it did; it made $40m. So they were like: “Hey, we just made $25m. Let’s move on to the next chapter.” There was something nice about that.When you get home and are not working, what do you do for entertainment?AwightmateMy obsession apart from Superman and vaudeville is the Mercury Seven [astronauts] and the James Webb telescope. I’m intrigued that it’s now however many million miles at a certain point in orbit around the sun, so that it can be at the right temperature. And that they ingeniously had to develop this massive shield which is made up of hexagons. And that was all folded up mathematically, like a chrysalis, like a moth in a cocoon. And it went up into space and then it opened itself and we’re now seeing stuff in the dark.I’m just completely obsessed by the otherness of what’s out there. Everyone says one day they’ll suddenly go: “There’s been definite communication with beings or creatures or overdeveloped insects that went into a different direction. They’re making contact with us.” The magnitude of it all! But that may not even happen. It may have happened millions of years ago and come and gone.So just be happy that we actually evolved on this bit of rock and became relatively sophisticated. But notthatsophisticated, because this is probably the worst time the planet’s ever really been through. There’s an edge, and in Jenny Pen audiences tap into that. What would it be like to be in that home in the last chapter of your life, to know that there’s really no hope?I also like dogs and cryptic crosswords. I have a greyhound and a regular series of generational pugs. The one we’ve got at the moment is nearing her end.

The sheer number of omissions in the TV Baftas is ridiculousFrom the Barry-Billericay finale, to Wolf Hall, Pachinko and Nobody Wants This, there are far too many cruelly overlooked shows this year. But the even bigger problem? Bafta’s Adolescence issueStalking saga Baby Reindeer leads 2025 TV Bafta nominationsMark LawsonThu 27 Mar 2025 10.24 EDTLast modified on Thu 27 Mar 2025 14.22 EDTShareThe latest Bafta TV awards again show the range of talent across UK television. Though drama characteristically dominates, the shows with most nominations – Rivals, Mr Bates vs The Post Office, Slow Horses and Baby Reindeer – represent a range of genres and source material (from real events via a 36-year-old Jilly Cooper bonkbuster to a solo theatre show) suggesting that the 2025 voters have largely avoided historical snobbery, long a problem in these prizes.Stalking saga Baby Reindeer leads 2025 TV Bafta nominationsRead moreThe awards also continue a belated honouring of overlooked talent. After improbably having to wait until last year for his first main Bafta nomination, David Tennant gets a rapid second, for his thrilling turn as a Richard III of the TV industry in the raunchy Cooper adaptation Rivals.It also seems rudely overdue that performers as great as Jonathan Pryce and Sharon D Clarke have had to wait until now: honoured for Slow Horses and Mr Loverman respectively. Danny Dyer also makes his debut in the lists, though oddly not for his career-transforming wigged romantic in Rivals but for Sky Max’s Mr Bigstuff.As always, we have our own regretted omissions. James Corden and Ruth Jones, for Gavin & Stacey: The Finale, feel cruelly overlooked in the scripted comedy section, as does Peter Straughan in the scripted drama category for Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light, a masterclass in the distillation of the 883 pages of Hilary Mantel’s novel into punchy dialogue that sounded plausibly 16th century while still comprehensible now.And in an international category with only six places, the number of omissions is becoming ridiculous. Although some shows made by streamers (Rivals, Slow Horses, Supacell) are judged British enough to compete in the main categories, the chosen international half-dozen – including Shōgun, After the Party and Colin from Accounts – crowds out Pachinko, Nobody Wants This and Disclaimer.View image in fullscreenThe Richard III of regional television … David Tennant as Lord Tony Baddingham in Rivals.Photograph: Sanne GaultIn awards covering the first political cycle since 1964 that UK and US elections have fallen in the same year, there will be some concern in journalism departments at the lack of recognition, although the director of the BBC election night gets a craft nod.Although the BBC remains the leading nom-magnet – with 49 nods in the television awards and 26 in the parallel craft awards – its director general and chairman may be alarmed at an apparent vertiginous tilt in the industry’s balance of power.The oldest British broadcaster’s almost half-century in the main television awards is well beaten by the 69 for other broadcasters, with Channel 4 (18) and ITV (15) having very strong years – the former helped by great comedy and current affairs, the latter by its dramas, Mr Bates and Until I Kill You – and the streamers growing in power.Bafta TV awards 2025 nominations: full listRead moreMost alarming for the corporation, ahead of renegotiations of its Royal Charter and funding system from 2027, is that 26 nominations are shared by shows that fulfil a key BBC remit – drama about contemporary Britain – and yet were not made by the BBC: Mr Bates (ITV), Baby Reindeer (Netflix), Slow Horses (Apple TV+) and Rivals (Disney+).There can be some sympathy for the BBC excuse that it doesn’t have the money: the awards ceremony on 11 May will take place in the context of warnings that British TV production and careers are becoming unsustainable due to pressure on budgets from streamer competition and UK tax breaks originally intended to help the industry. (Now renamed “expenditure credits”, these benefits can favour big budget projects that are more likely to be made by foreign broadcasters.)Even so, with Adolescence – another British story made with Netflix money – currently setting ratings records, candidates applying to replace the departing Charlotte Moore as BBC Chief Content Officer must surely be asked at interview: should you/would you/could you have made at the BBC Adolescence, Mr Bates, Baby Reindeer, Rivals and Slow Horses. And if not, what is the point of the BBC drama department?An Adolescence issue for Bafta is that, weirdly, this is the second year running that there is a sense of a deafening television conversation elsewhere: a TV drama that everyone is talking about but has to wait a year for Bafta recognition. Because the qualifying period is the previous calendar 12 months, Mr Bates vs the Post Office (premiered 1 January 2024) is only honoured now, 15 months later. And Netflix’s Adolescence (dropped 13 March this year) will only come into contention this time next year.View image in fullscreenWill voters be happy to wait this long? … Mr Bates vs the Post Office.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockAcademy voters have been happy to wait to vote for Mr Bates, although as at this week’s RoyalTelevisionSociety awards – where the Post Office drama won no trophies despite nominations – the show may suffer in voting rooms from a sense of being so early last year.It’s probably impractical to change the Bafta nominations window so shows that really want the gold mask on their shelves should arrange winter or autumn transmission: Wolf Hall: The Mirror and The Light (BBC One, from 10 November) and Rivals (mid-October) may have benefitted from transmission close to the filling in of ballots. (Disclosure: I am a Bafta voter, though with no insider knowledge of the voting process.)Another issue for the organisers is that while best soap clearly doesn’t have enough contenders – it is now effectively a matter of choosing three from four, with Hollyoaks missing out – the international category clearly has too many, calling either for more international categories or further redefinition between “domestic” content (the five terrestrial networks plus Sky) and “international”, a category invented to contain (in every sense) the streamers but which is stretched by the growing number of British stories they tell.Next year, Adolescence will surely have to be classified as British and will surely sweep the awards, continuing the sense that, for purely logistical reasons, Bafta is a year off the pace.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionBaftasAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

According todata publishedby the digital store Steam, almost 19,000 titles were released in 2024 – and that’s just on one platform. Hundreds more arrived on consoles and smartphones. In some ways this is the positive sign of a vibrant industry, but how on earth does a new project get noticed? When Triple A titles with multimillion dollar marketing budgets are finding it hard to gain attention (disappointing sales have been reported for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the Final Fantasy VII remakes and EA Sports FC), what chance is there for a small team to break out?And yet it does happen. Last year’s surprise hit Balatro has shifted more than 5m copies. Complex medieval strategy title Manor Lords sold 1m copies during its launch weekend. But what awaits a small developer after they achieve success? And what does success even mean in a continuously evolving industry?James Carbutt and Will Todd of Coal Supper are still trying to make sense of it. Their acerbic satireThank Goodness You’re Here!, in which players slap their way through bizarre quotidian scenarios in the fictional humble northern town of Barnsworth, is now an award-winning game. “It’s just not registered as a success in my head at all,” says Carbutt. “The numbers are going up on screen, and there have been YouTube playthroughs and some erotic fan art. Beyond that, it won’t register.”I can’t imagine making any more games. I don’t know where I would go from hereAfter spending three years working on the project, the pair now find themselves in the confusing glare of the spotlight, fielding questions about what’s next. “It’s horrible,” Carbutt jokes. “But I don’t think we feel any sort of second-album syndrome. The space it gives you to be a bit introspective about what you want to do next is the interesting quirk of a successful indie game.”Veteran indie developer Gabe Cuzzillo (Ape Out,Baby Steps) offered them sage wisdom. “He spoke about how you should focus not just on making something good – because how do you quantify that, it’s amorphous?” says Todd. “Instead we should look at what it is we want to explore and judge success intrinsically, based on whether we explored that thing. The pressure of speed to market doesn’t apply to us, because it’s never going to be possible to crank something out in six months to chase success anyway. It’s more like, in the wake of this being received well, what’s the next thing we want to explore? That’s something we’re interrogating at the moment.”Australian developer Grace Bruxner has also redefined success after leaving behind a trilogy of Frog Detective games: bite-size adventures co-developed with Thomas Bowker that quickly became cult indie hits.View image in fullscreen‘Has it impacted people’s lives in a positive way?’ … Frog Detective.Photograph: Wormclub“Success in games has always been a bit of a lie, a bit of an illusion,” she says, pointing to typical markers such as cultural impact, player numbers and financial gain. “My measure of success is: did I make something I’m proud of, and has it impacted my life and other people’s lives in a positive way? And yes, it did, so thumbs up.”Bruxner began working on the series during her final year at university as an experiment, to see whether she could produce a commercial game. After a relatively breezy first outing, the second Frog Detective game demanded that Bruxner and Bowker lock in, and spend most of their time on the project. By the third instalment, the hard work had paid off, though the pressure had begun to take its toll. Throw in the pandemic, as well as mental and physical health issues, and Bruxner was ready to take a break. “I wasn’t grinding super hard, but I also wasn’t having a great time,” she says. “It just was really nice to make that choice to stop.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unless you love making games. I’m not sure I love making games. I was quite young when we released the first Frog Detective, so it was like, ‘This is my entire identity for life. I don’t know how to be a separate person from that.”Three years after the series’ swan song, she is on indefinite hiatus, exploring alternative creative paths – such as pottery. “I can’t imagine making games, because of the expectations on me as a creator,” she explains. “I don’t even know where I would go from here.”Bruxner has been surprised by her ability to sustain herself on the modest amount of money provided by Frog Detective. “If your game continues to have a tail, and you can budget properly and live within your means, it is possible to have a passive income that isn’t tied to being a horrible landlord,” she explains. Even so, she knows how taboo it can be to talk plainly about money, especially in creative circles like the indie game scene. “I have the free time to chill and decide what I want to do, but I assume at some point I’ll probably need to have a career again. My biggest question is will this money last forever? Probably not, and then what happens when it runs out? I don’t know.”View image in fullscreen‘Opportunities are limited’ … Consume Me.Photograph: HexecutableIt may seem as though more indies than ever have broken into the spotlight in recent years. But enduring games industry turbulence has made finding financial support for follow-ups and debuts more complicated. “The elephant in the room is everything that’s happened over the past couple of years, with mass layoffs, studio closures and evaporating funding opportunities,” explains AP Thomson, a developer of the forthcoming indie Consume Me with fellow NYU Game Center graduate Jenny Jiao Hsia. “Before that, there was a pretty major change around the mid-2010s when indie publishers and funders started rising in prominence. Everything we’ve heard suggests that the same opportunities no longer exist or are incredibly limited.”Consume Me, the duo’s coming-of-age scheduling RPG doesn’t have a release date but has already been nominated for five gongs at the IndependentGamesFestival awards. As such, Jiao Hsia and Thomson are already under pressure to decide their next endeavour. “Multiple people have told us we should be moving forward once it launches,” says Thomson.Even with growing expectations, the pair aren’t keen to get ahead of themselves. “Everything we’ve heard suggests that now is really not a great time to be pitching, so we’re going to focus our energy on the launch and then read the temperature of the room after that,” Thomson adds.“I’m looking forward to finding enjoyment in making art again, instead of feeling like I have to show up to a job I never applied to,” explains Jiao Hsia. “The idea of making art for fun, without worrying about making money off it, is something I can’t wait to do.”Explore more on these topicsIndie gamesGamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But why did the artist do it?Sam Jonesin MadridThu 27 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTShareThree clumps of raised paint, an old X-ray and months of scientific analysis and dogged detective work have revealed that a portrait ofJoan Miró’s mother has lurked, undetected, beneath the cobalt-blue surface of one of the Spanish artist’s inimitable works for the best part of a century.Between 1925 and 1927, Miró created a small, oil-on-canvas picture,titled Pintura (Painting), which he gave to his great friend, the art promoter Joan Prats.By that time, having made the inevitable artistic pilgrimage to Paris, experimented with fauvism, post-expressionism and cubism – in the process comprehensively dashing his parents’ hopes that he might one day find stable employment as an accounts clerk – Miró had alighted on a freer, more individual style.View image in fullscreenA decades-old X-ray had hinted that something else lay beneath Miró’s brushwork.Photograph: R Maroto/Fundació Joan MiróPintura underlines what Marko Daniel, the director of theFundació Joan Miró, describes as the artist’s commitment to “exploding the conventions of painting, of pictorial space, of the way in which painting works”. But it may also hold a deeper, hidden meaning that reflects the artist’s attempt to break away from the bourgeois constraints of his family as he set out onhis famous quest to “assassinate painting”.Five years after Prats’ death in 1970, the painting became part of the collection of the foundation, which is based in Barcelona. Time, and humidity, had not been kind to the canvas, which had suffered microfissures and other damage.A year ago, experts at the foundation, led by Elisabet Serrat, its head of preventive conservation and restoration, decided to take another look at Pintura. A decades-old X-ray had hinted that something else lay beneath Miró’s brushwork, as had the edges of the painting, where the blue paint cedes to older, darker colours.Using X-rays, ultraviolet and infrared light, hyperspectral imaging, visible raking and transmitted light, Serrat’s team and researchers from organisations, including the Centre de Restauració de Béns Mobles de Catalunya and the Universidad Pablo de Olavide in Seville, discovered the portrait of a well-dressed, middle-aged woman, painted in a style that could not have been more different from Miró’s.A dustpan and brush with fine art | Brief lettersRead moreThey soon clocked that her earrings and the brooch at her neck corresponded to the three spots of raised paint already glimpsed on Pintura’s surface.“So now we had a good-quality image of the portrait, which looked almost like a photo,” says Serrat. “But we didn’t know who it was of.”Using X-rays, ultraviolet and infrared light, hyperspectral imaging, visible raking and transmitted light, researchers discovered the portrait.Pintura and the portrait of Dolors Ferrà i Oromí rotated 90 degrees. C/o Fundació Joan MiróUnable to find any clues as to the woman’s identity in Barcelona, Serrat headed to Tarragona a few weeks later to visit the Fundació Mas Miró, a museum situated in the farmhouse where the artist and his family spent their summers.“But none of the portraits there was a match,” she adds. “The director of the foundation said that the portrait could be in Mallorca, where Miró also lived and worked.”The steer was a good one. At Miró’s Son Boter studio on the Balearic island, Serrat found a 1907 portrait signed by the artist Cristòfol Montserrat Jorba. Not only did the face match that of the woman in the Pintura X-rays, its subject was one Dolors Ferrà i Oromí – better known as Miró’s mother.“The [Mallorca portrait] is exactly the same, bar a few differences: the dress was different and the earrings were different, but there’s no doubt that it’s the same face,” says Serrat.Such discoveries are vanishingly rare. Uncovering the face of Dolores Ferrà, Serrat adds with a degree of understatement, was “a delightful surprise”.Her team believes that Miró cut down another version of Montserrat’s portrait – Pintura measures just 49cm x 60cm – and flipped it from portrait to landscape, but deliberately chose to keep the central portion that showed his mother’s face.View image in fullscreenPortrait of Dolors Ferrà i Oromí (1907) by the artist Cristòfol Montserrat.Photograph: Fundació Joan MiróAll of which raises the obvious question: why?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Over-painting was also a technique he visited on the kitsch, tacky works of hack artists towards the end of his life, when he set about defacing what he saw as cheap, bad and cheesy art.“That said, the new discovery is not situationist over-painting, nor his own, revisionist over-painting,” says Daniel.“It is an act of rebellion. But Miró was already 32 when he started this, so it’s not a juvenile act of rebellion against his parents … [but] against the kind of world that his parents represented; the middle-class aspirations to being ever so slightly posher than you really are.”He is convinced Miró did not choose the Montserrat portrait by accident: “There was no technical need for him to paint on top of that; he wasn’t like Gauguin in the South Pacific, without access to materials. For him, this really was an act of choice.”View image in fullscreenX-ray image showing the portrait.Photograph: Fundació Joan MiróAnd yet, to Serrat’s mind, the artist’s odd gesture was not without a certain affection.“He could have chosen another portrait,” she says. “But he chooses this one, and he cuts it and keeps his mother’s face complete, so there’s a respect there.”She also notes that he left the trio of paint clumps – the x that marked the spot of his mother’s jewellery – intact, when he could easily have scraped them flat.The experts’ findings, which Daniel refers to as “CSI: Miró”, are laid out in a new exhibition, Under the Layers of Miró: A Scientific Investigation, and in an accompanying documentary, El Secret de Miró. The show, at the foundation’s Barcelona headquarters, will allow visitors to see both Pintura and Montserrat’s portrait of Ferrà.Living out of a suitcase: artist Ted Lott’s miniature homes – in picturesRead moreAlmost a century after the brilliant blue paint dried on Miró’s enigmatic painting, Daniel feels the world is finally beginning to understand the artist’s intentions.“In a way, Miró left us really good clues – especially the brooch, which is really three dimensional and you can see it in raking light,” he says. “He left us these clues, so he must be thinking, ‘Why on earth did it take you so long to discover this? A hundred years later, you’ve worked out what I did!’”Explore more on these topicsJoan MiróArtPaintingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mikko Mäkelä explains what inspired his film – and remembers his cinematic sexual awakeningRyan GilbeyThu 27 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTShareGrowing up in a small Finnish town close to the Russian border, Mikko Mäkelä knew he was gay from the age of 11. “I think I was happy until then,” says the shy 36-year-old, whose slippery second film Sebastian is about to be released. Isolated he may have been, but at least the young Mäkelä had movies. Alone in his room, he watched queer gems such as Mysterious Skin, Presque Rien and Beautiful Thing, keeping the volume low in case his parents heard. Then a trip to the cinema to see Brokeback Mountain changed everything.“When I got home, they asked me, ‘Did you like that film?’ They had read about it andwanted to make sure I wasn’t like the characters. That was the night I ended up coming out to them.” He didn’t stay in Finland much longer, movingNottingham to attend university. “My home town felt extremely homophobic, which was a big part of why I left. I told myself that when I stepped off the plane in the UK, I’d stop lying.”My parents sent me to gay conversion. They made me pray with them to purge myselfMäkelä is dressed in a black hoodie, with a ring in each ear, and we are sitting in a crowded cafe near his home in east London. He discusses his upbringing willingly. Only later do I have the nagging feeling that a big piece of the puzzle is missing. When we reconnect by video call a few weeks later, he is in a Lyon hotel and seems breezier and less guarded than in the cafe, where we were elbow-to-elbow with strangers. Now feels like a better time to ask how his parents reacted to him coming out.“Oh, badly,” he snorts. “Very badly. They were religious. My mum still is but we’re on good terms. My dad has passed away now. They tried to make me engage with gay conversion. I played along for a little bit, but ultimately realised it wasn’t going to work. That was why I had to put some distance between myself and my family.”His parents insisted on keeping his sexuality secret from his siblings. “They wanted to hide it from everyone. I was sent to a psychologist, who actually sided with me. Then I was driven to an evangelical prayer-and-healing group. When the priest asked me what I felt was the matter with me, I told him, ‘Nothing.’ My parents weren’t too pleased about that. They also tried to make me join them in prayer, to purge me of these thoughts. There was so much pressure.”But the horse had long since bolted, leaving the stable door in tatters. Mäkelä had been writing erotic stories, one of which he had posted online. This was bought by the Finnish porn magazine Kalle, which set aside a few pages for gay material. Mäkelä has never seen a physical copy of that issue, declined to have one sent to his home in case his parents found it, was too embarrassed to flick through it in a shop, and doesn’t know if it’s available now. “It might be,” he says, then dashes my hope of reading it. “It’s in Finnish, though.” What was it about? “The standard romantic fantasy of a horny teenager in a small town.”View image in fullscreenUnorthodox research … Ruaridh Mollica as Max.Photograph: Bêtes SauvagesMäkelä’s short-lived career in erotica is pertinent to Sebastian. The film concerns Max, a young literary journalist in London who moonlights as a sex worker as research for his debut novel, only to discover that he enjoys it. As the picture begins, Max, played by Ruaridh Mollica, is already well into this unorthodox research for the book, which is titled Sebastian after the alias he goes by when charging for his charms.When we first meet Max, a middle-aged client is inviting him to “tell me about yourself”. This idea of finding oneself through the stories we tell is pursued right through to the end of the movie, when Max goes directly from an afternoon assignation to a promotional Q&A at Foyles. He has continued to work his second job – one plus being that he doesn’t have to give 15% to his agent.View image in fullscreenFlirting with autofiction … Mäkelä.Photograph: Henni HyvarinenAt the bookshop, Max tells his interviewer: “You can ask me anything.” Talking to Mäkelä, then, is a faintly meta experience. Here I am, trying to discover what first-hand knowledge he has, if any, of sex work, all while we pick over a film that ponders whether an artist’s personal life is any of his audience’s business. As Max’s mother tells him after reading one of his stories: “You do have the right to keep some things just for yourself.”How much will Mäkelä keep for himself? He is not about to deny that his movies flirt with autofiction. In his recent short Nothing Special, a director is told: “I really liked your film but I wish it had a different ending.” Mäkelä heard the same remark from some audience members after the equivocal conclusion of A Moment in the Reeds, his 2017 debut about an affair between a Finnish academic and the Syrian builder renovating his father’s home. He has also given the hero of Sebastian some of his own characteristics: he’s an outsider who lives in east London, works as a journalist (as Mäkelä briefly did), writes erotic fiction and has a name beginning with M.Mäkelä assures me that he has neither paid for sex nor been paid for it. His interest in the subject came after arriving in London, where he noticed that some of his peers were earning money from sex. “You’d hear things like, ‘Oh, someone offered me money on Grindr and I needed the cash,’” he says. “The digitalisation of our lives has lowered the threshold for entering sex work. It’s no longer associated with renting a room above a shop. I was surprised to see how commonplace it had become among queer students and creatives in east London. What was striking was the sense of freedom it gave people to explore their sexuality.”To hear Max outlining his novel to a prospective publisher feels rather like listening to Mäkelä discussing the film. “I don’t want it to be another tragic sex-worker story,” Max says. Mäkelä had much the same objective. We might fear at times for Max’s wellbeing, especially when a client angrily discovers he has been fictionalising their encounters for his book, but events stop short of outright disaster.The movie’s most radical aspect, though, is its treatment of the ageing and elderly body. Whereas rent-boy movies such as My Own Private Idaho and Johns are squeamish, even ageist, in their view of the men who pay for sex, Sebastian deals in equal-opportunity eroticism. Max relishes the sex he has with much older men, while the camera duly regards their bodies without the customary wariness or revulsion.View image in fullscreenThe day job … with Hiftu Quasem in Sebastian.Photograph: Bêtes SauvagesThese older cast members may not have been invited to disrobe on-screen in decades, if at all, and the chance might never come again. “One of the actors did say they hadn’t been naked on screen before,” Mäkelä confirms. “I specified in the screenplay that we should see young skin touching older skin. I wanted to emphasise the poetry in those images. I thought that would be a beautiful thing to show.” It is only during Max’s interactions with men his own age, when no cash is changing hands, that he radiates awkwardness or inauthenticity. “It’s not a porno!” says one partner in response to his over-eager technique.Andrew Haigh, the director of All Of Us Strangers who made his debut with 2009’s rent-boy documentary Greek Pete, observed recently that there are overlaps between sex work and directing: “You’re trying to make the thing that works for people and makes them feel something,” he told me. Does Mäkelä share that view? “It’s an interesting one. I remember being surprised by how fully some sex workers had outlined all the possible questions and answers on their websites so clients knew what to expect.” Not unlike a film-maker reassuring nervous financiers, then. “That’s true. And their websites all have reviews and star ratings, too.” Another similarity. “Yes,” he says coolly. “It’s like a Letterboxd for sex workers.”Sebastian is in cinemas from 4 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsSex workfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His wife, Jess, would pretend to be a “pompous chef”, his son, Axel, would play the “downtrodden waiter”, while Please himself would act the part of a demanding customer.“The dynamic of these three characters was so rich, the setting so loaded with potential, and the opportunity to showcase my long-practised and long-underappreciated art of rearranging food to look funny, made the story impossible to resist”, said Please.Please is a writer, animator and illustrator whose works include the 2011 stop motion animated film The Eagleman Stag, which won a Bafta for best short animation.

Well, now there’s a word for it: gigil.Gigil (pronounced ghee-gill) is one of the new words that have made it into the Oxford English Dictionary (OED).Gigil, extracted from the Philippines’ Tagalog language, refers to what psychologists describe as cute aggression: “[a] feeling so intense that it gives us the irresistible urge to tightly clench our hands, grit our teeth, and pinch or squeeze whomever or whatever it is we find so adorable”.It can be deployed as a noun denoting the feeling or as an adjective for experiencing the feeling, such as: “That puppy is making me gigil.”With 600,000 words, the OED is one of the most comprehensive dictionaries in the English-speaking world.Its editors consider thousands of suggestions for new words every year that come from far and wide and from a variety of sources, including the OED’s own research and crowdsourcing appeals.Alamak, a colloquial cry used to express surprise or outrage in Singapore and Malaysia, also made the list.In its latest update, the OED said: “Wouldn’t it be useful for English speakers to have a specific word for sunlight dappling through leaves … Or a word for the action of sitting outside enjoying a beer?” The Norwegians have a word,utepils, for having a beer (pils) outside (ute). And the Japanese word “komorebi” (木漏れ日) describes sunlight dappling through leaves.People who speak English alongside other languages fill lexical gaps by “borrowing the untranslatable word from another language”. When they do this often enough, the borrowed word “becomes part of their vocabulary”, OED said.Most of the words added to the OED from Singapore and Malaysia are names of dishes, including kaya toast – jam made from coconut milk, eggs, sugar and pandan leaves spread on toasted bread; fish head curry – a Chinese and South Indian dish; and steamboat – a thinly sliced meat and vegetable broth.“All this talk of food might inspire one to get a takeaway, or to tapau,” OED said. Tapau is another new word originating from Chinese languages, meaning “to package, or wrap up, food to take away”.Other newly added Philippine words include videoke, the nation’s version of karaoke, which includes scoring, and salakot, a farmer’s hat.Words and phrases from South Africa and Ireland were also part of the update.Explore more on these topicsReference and languages booksSocial trendsLanguagenewsShareReuse this content"

Another story revisits the Bombay neighbourhood of Rushdie’s 1981 novel Midnight’s Children, where a magical musician is unhappily married to a billionaire. A third story, set in an English college, sees an undead academic unable to rest until he gets revenge against his former tormentor.“I’m happy that the stories, very different from one another in setting, story and technique, nevertheless manage to be in conversation with one another, and with the two stories that serve as prologue and epilogue to this threesome,” Rushdie added. “I have come to think of the quintet as a single work, and I hope readers may see and enjoy it in the same way.”The book “moves between the places [Rushdie] has grown up in, inhabited, explored, and left”, according to Rushdie’s publisher Vintage, a division of Penguin Random House. “In doing so, he asks fundamental questions we all one day face. How does one deal with, accommodate, or rail against entering the 11th hour, the final stage of your life? How can you bid farewell to the places you have made home?”Rushdie announcedthat he was working on the forthcoming book last October to an audience at Lviv BookForum. All the novellas “in some way consider the idea of an ending”, he said at the time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

So, it’s with sincere regret that due to Mr Mathis’s age and memory issues which have accelerated, we are announcing his retirement from touring and live concerts.”“Johnny Mathis and his entire staff send their heartfelt gratitude to all Mathis fans worldwide for your continued love and support of his music! It’s truly been ‘Wonderful, Wonderful.’”Mathis, 89, had a number of concerts booked for 2025 but will only perform four more scheduled dates, ending in Englewood, New Jersey, on 18 May.That show will bring a remarkable performing career to an end. Mathis is regarded as one of America’s great romantic balladeers, whose rich, sincere voice lit up hits such as Misty, Chances Are, and his 1976 UK Christmas No 1 When a Child Is Born. The last is one of Mathis’s many festive classics which remain popular today, including versions of Sleigh Ride and It’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas.Mathis was once the record holder for the album with the most weeks spent on the US chart: his compilation Johnny’s Greatest Hits, which was on the chart for 490 weeks between 1958 and 1968. Six of his albums became platinum sellers and he had 10 Top 10 albums in a row during the late 1950s and early 60s.Pop fashions changed and his crooning style fell out of favour come the middle of the 60s, but Mathis’s core fans stood by him while he maintained an extraordinary work rate, recording 53 studio albums between 1960 and 1990.The mid to late 70s were another successful phase for him, with his Christmas No 1 plus a US chart-topping duet with Deniece Williams – Too Much, Too Little, Too Late – and a deft embrace of the era’s disco sound. A lost album from this period made with Nile Rodgers, I Love My Lady, was eventually released in 2017. Mathis’s most recent studio album is Christmas Time Is Here, released in 2023.In 2018, he spoke about how the quality of his health would influence the length of his career. “It revolves around whether or not you’re physically able and in good health,” he said. “That’s the most important thing because you won’t feel like doing anything if you’re not healthy. And being a vocalist, you have another thing to worry about. The vocals cords are flesh and blood so anything can happen to them … You take care of the thing that got you to the dance.”Explore more on these topicsPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

Timothy, who is being investigated by the FBI over a money laundering scheme, has considered suicide; in one scene, he holds a gun to his head while wearing a T-shirt adorned with Duke’s logo.Frank Tramble, Duke’s vice-president for communications, marketing and public affairs,said in a statement to Bloombergthat the university did not approve of the use of its logo – particularly the scene where Timothy contemplates killing himself.“The White Lotus not only uses our brand without permission, but in our view uses it on imagery that is troubling, does not reflect our values or who we are, and simply goes too far,” Tramble said. “Suicide is the second-leading cause of death on college campuses. As imagery from the show is being shared widely across social media, we are using our brand to promote mental health awareness and remind people that help is available.”Tramblealso told the New York Times: “Duke appreciates artistic expression and creative storytelling but characters’ prominently wearing apparel bearing Duke’s federally registered trademarks creates confusion and mistakenly suggests an endorsement or affiliation where none exists.”The image of Timothy holding the gun to his head has become a meme in the lead-up to March Madness, the NCAA national college basketball championship – of which Duke, though much-reviled, is the favourite to win. On X,one user wrotethat it would be “an all-time meme” if Duke loses, in a widely liked post – to which the university replied that “some imagery goes too far”.Suicide is the second-leading cause of death on college campuses. Rivalry is part of March Madness, but some imagery goes too far. If you or someone you know needs support, call or text the Suicide Prevention Hotline at 988. 💙— Duke University (@DukeU)March 25, 2025But it is unlikely Duke can do much about being featured in the show. Jeanne Fromer, a professor who specialises in intellectual property law at the New York University School of Law,told the New York Timesthat artists are protected to use trademarks for artistic and expressive purposes under the first amendment.“On the one hand, I understand that Duke is trying to disassociate themselves from this,” Fromer said. “On the other hand, they’re drawing attention to it.”A representative for HBO declined to comment to Bloomberg and the New York Times.Piper, no! Parker Posey’s viral White Lotus accent is a gift to us allRead moreThis isn’t the first time a brand has taken issue with a TV show. In 2021, exercise bike company Peloton was miffed after a character in Sex and the City reboot And Just Like That... was shown dying of a heart attack after exercising on one of their machines. Peloton said that though it had approved of the use of its bike in the show, it didn’t know the context. One company representativeeven subsequently claimedthat the bike may have kept the character alive for longer.Earlier this year,California’s Pepperdine University sued Netflix and Warner Brosover trademark infringement after a fictional basketball team in the show Running Point was shown using their colours and their sports team name.

Sadly, the important thing in TV is to be firstLucy ManganThu 27 Mar 2025 18.20 EDTLast modified on Thu 27 Mar 2025 18.23 EDTShareIt is possible to make a cynical piece of television without anyone who appears on screen having a drop of toxicity in their veins. Documentaries with subjects ripped from the headlines are particularly likely candidates; documentaries centring the recently, appallingly bereaved even more so.We turn, then, to Brianna: A Mother’s Story. Brianna is Brianna Ghey, the 16-year-old who in 2023 wasmurdered in a premeditated attackby two 15-year‑olds – Scarlett Jenkinson, whom Brianna considered a friend, and Jenkinson’s friend (if that is the correct word for what seems more accurately to have been a murderous partnership between two disturbed individuals) Eddie Ratcliffe. They lured Brianna to a park, then stabbed her 28 times. Det Supt Adam Waller of Cheshire police says he still wrestles with “the level of depravity” on display in the attack. Brianna’s friends, still in their teens, remember that “she was kind, funny, could always make you feel better” and how “she brought me comfort”. They share videos full of giddy, youthful energy and laughter.The mother is Esther Ghey, who now campaigns for online protections for young people and better mental health support in schools. Brianna had transferred to a new school in February 2020 after being bullied. According to the headteacher, Emma Mills, Brianna was keen to make “a fresh start”.Then came lockdown. Esther describes Brianna retreating into an online world – using several accounts, so Esther could never quite be sure what was going on – and talking to people and accessing material that made Esther “afraid I was going to find her and Alicia [Brianna’s sister] raped and murdered”. Then Brianna “started growing her hair and came out as trans just before going back to school”.Esther’s grief is still so raw – she has not reached the stage where she can talk about Brianna without crying – that it makes you wish there was someone campaigning for greater television regulation, too. It should be forbidden to film someone when they are clearly still in the throes of the most awful misery. Clearly, though, the decision to take part was Esther’s – and she felt able to do so, as she did when she gavean in-depth interviewto the Guardian in February.‘I forgive the girl and boy for what they’ve done. If I didn’t, the hate would eat away at me’: Esther Ghey on life after the murder of her daughter BriannaRead moreBut the important thing in television is to be first. And the rawer the pain, the better it plays, in production terms. So what we get is that on parade. Anything that could add depth or meaning, or allow us to learn or draw conclusions, is not included.We do not learn what or whom Brianna was exposed to online. The coverage of the court case is minimal. We learn that Jenkinson was obsessed with torture videos and are left with the impression that Ratcliffe was more of a follower than a leader (although it was his clothes that were covered in Brianna’s blood and his house in which the murder weapon was found), but no proper parsing of their roles is undertaken. Ratcliffe’s anti-transgender messages are quoted and there is footage of the judge citing hatred of trans people as a secondary motivation, but it is not made clear that this was attributed to Ratcliffe only. Jenkinson seems to have been fixated on Brianna and said after her conviction that she tried to kill her (at first by poisoning her with painkillers in a McDonald’s milkshake) because she was afraid her friend was going to leave her.Knowing how to weight and sort the parts played by the various issues is impossible. There is a powerful interview with a former senior engineer at Meta,Arturo Béjar, who resigned when his warnings about the harm being done by the algorithms serving up ever darker content to curious children and teens were ignored. He says that, with the will to do so, feeds could be appropriately circumscribed by companies “within a year”. But his segment is brief and there is no time given to how this will can be inculcated, nor to looking at governments’ unwillingness to regulate the internet for the public good.In short, there is nothing that makes this documentary worthwhile, or that makes it feel like anything but an exploitation of a family’s unutterable sadness. The best that can be hoped is that it is so anodyne that there is no backlash that hurts these suffering people further.Brianna: A Mother’s Story aired on ITV1 and is on ITVX nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewKnife crimeCrimeNorth of EnglandDocumentaryreviewsShareReuse this content"

The existential terror of a man under attack by unknown forces begins when New York ad-man Roger Thornhill stands up to make a phone call in a hotel lobby and is mistaken for George Kaplan, a nonexistent spy created as a decoy by the US’s cold war-era security services. From thereon in he is pursued by enemies of the state. If everyone insists Roger is George, where does that leave his sense of self?Emma Rice’s adaptation is not concerned with the crisis around identity but with sending up the espionage genre through an archly played collection of spies and villains.It is delightfully playful, although there is not quite enough charge underneath. The drama’s themes of global crisis, security and the toxic legacies of war are raised rather too late, like an afterthought. There is little Hitchcockian brooding or darkness either, nor the jeopardy of the film.But the theatrical fun, games and entertainment are plentiful, along with witty subversions. Much of the film’s screenplay is preserved, some of its dated jokes delivered thick with irony, but the adaptation adds narration, wry commentary and fourth-wall puncturing moments which contain genuinely funny audience participation.Women play men, men play women, and characters break out into slinky dances or lip-sync to period jazz numbers (compositions by Simon Baker, combined with classics by Peggy Lee, Ella Fitzgerald, Cole Porter and more).Ewan Wardrop captures Cary Grant’s droll distemper from the film and appears like a comical Hitchcockian 007 with his dry martinis and smoothness. His romance with Eva Kendall (Patrycja Kujawska), clad in femme fatale red dress, is played tongue-in-cheek.View image in fullscreenMiniaturised invention … Katy Owen and Ewan Wardrop.Photograph: Steve TannerSpies in long coats and shades swirl around them; characters are vaguely reminiscent of the satirised British intelligence men from the musicalOperation Mincemeat(that second world war incident was one of the influences for the film).The six-strong cast, including Rice’s company stalwarts, do a remarkable job of conjuring the sense of a far bigger ensemble on stage. They excel at physical comedy, often set to jazz shuffles and shucks, with humorous choreography by Etta Murfitt. The professor-narrator is a highlight, played by Katy Owen (who was luminous inRice’s Wuthering Heights, too).It is a feat too to transpose the film’s action-led set-pieces featuring trains, planes and car chases on hairpin bends. Rice manages this with typically intelligent humour and imagination: the UN headquarters in which a murder takes place is gracefully conjured with a formation of telephone operators speaking a babel of languages while the iconic crop-dusting plane attack on Thornhill is full of miniaturised invention.Malcolm Rippeth’s witty lighting works well with Rob Howell’s elegant set design, a series of revolving doors and liqueur bottles. The effect is glorious and grand, filling the stage and gesturing towards the ever-changing disguises that the cast assume.It is a production that feels emphatically light and the final Mount Rushmore scene does not carry the precipitous danger of the film (how could it?). But this is an espionage crowd-pleaser for the summer – fun, intelligent and powered by Rice’s joyful whimsy.AtYork Theatre Royaluntil 5 April.

The pieces date from 2000 to 2023; all share a strong sense of momentum in these performances by the BBC Concert Orchestra and conductorJohn Andrews. Sometimes, it is clear how that onward drive is achieved: in Mighty River a constant, pulsing note is heard throughout virtually the whole 16-minute movement, underpinning quotes from Amazing Grace and references to spirituals. Often, though, it is more an undercurrent of restless agitation.View image in fullscreenErrollyn Wallen: Orchestral WorksTwo works include voices. By Gis and by St Charity is a short and effective setting of Shakespeare, compellingly delivered by Ruby Hughes, with the orchestral players’ chants of “shame!” drawing us into Ophelia’s claustrophobic inner world. Idunnu Münch is the vivid soloist in This Frame is Part of the Painting, which, setting Wallen’s own words, captures the vivid colours ofHoward Hodgkin’s paintings.The newest work, 2023’s Dances for Orchestra, zips through 1990s house music – with a repeating bass thudded out by low strings and timpani – to a perky folk-like dance for solo flute, to an 18th-century-style sarabande, and more. It is here that Wallen’s variety is heard to its clearest and sparkiest effect.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.music.apple.com.

Preserves, however, are all over Polish artist Rafał Zajko’s biggest solo show yet. Big jars of brine filled with salty cucumbers and little figurines in the shape of cryogenic preservation chambers. That combination of the fantastically sci-fi and the mundanely everyday is Zajko’s hallmark. The young London-based artist has spent the past few years showing ceramic and concrete sculptures filled with flights of cybernetic romanticism and nods to vaping, baking and pickling.In The Spin Off, as this show at Focal Point Gallery in Southend is called, he has gone on a deep dive into a vast mess of ideas about longevity and rebirth. The centre of the space is dominated by an ovoid floor sculpture that gets moved and reshaped throughout the week. Laid across its surface, ceramic tiles are assembled to look like a map of planetary systems or control panels for alien spaceships, covered in incomprehensible knobs, buttons and displays. Circular sections of it can be lifted out and replaced with items from the cabinets on the wall: little concrete eggs, ceramic kaiser rolls, jars of pickles.It's as if Zajko is asking what the point of living forever is – if you’re going to be watched the whole timeEggs are everywhere. They’re in vitrines cut into benches around the space. They’re formed into huge uncomfortable stools in the middle of the gallery (a nod to designer Philippe Starck’s iconic but useless lemon squeezer). They’re nestled in reliefs on the wall that look like maps of future cities. They’re symbols of rebirth, of perseverance and survival.View image in fullscreen‘Eggs are everywhere’ … installation view of The Spin Off.Photograph: Corey Bartle-SandersonIn the other main gallery space, a huge red eye in a vast plastic bubble blinks at you and flashes lasers as it burps out an endless cloud of vape smoke, a polluted miasma of surveillance state aesthetics, as if Zajko is asking what the point of living forever is if you’re going to be watched the whole time.Lining the walls between the galleries, Zajko has painted frescoes of eggs and those Philippe Starck juicers, surrounding a huge relief of grey humanoid bodies studded with pink chewing gum. Vitrines are filled with architectural sculptures made of upcycled church candles.The whole thing is caked in references to pop culture (each work is named after a film that’s had at least one remake, A Star is Born, Funny Games, Cruel Intentions), art and design history, Polish mythology, and on and on. It feels overthought and under-edited. It’s so excited by its own endless references that the story of the work gets a little lost in the process.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Zajko is unique: it’s like a pastel-coloured Alien; a gentle, cotton candy take on sci-fi horror; a 1990s McDonald’s designed by a xenomorph; a Mattel Metropolis. It’s attractive, alluring, you want to touch all of it, get lost in it.The main thrust of the show, the primary idea, is brilliant. It’s so full of the fear of death and anxiety about the future: this is the art of a mind buzzing with apprehension about what’s next and trying desperately to hold on to some sense of self. Yet this esoteric sci-fi and heavy theorising is rooted in the everyday – thanks to those bread rolls and pickles. It gives everything a sense of joy and humour, a link to the past, to reality. Living forever, seeing what the future holds, may be terrifying, but at least there’ll be pickles.Explore more on these topicsArt and designArtSouthend-on-SeaEssexPolandreviewsShareReuse this content"

The premiere recording was released by the Kaleidoscope Chamber Collective only four years ago, but this new one, by the chamber-music dream team of theTakács Quartetand pianistMarc-André Hamelin, offers a different slant, placing the work more firmly in the classical tradition of the Dvořák with which it is paired. A good example of this is the third of the four movements, which Price, as in her symphonies, casts as a juba – a dance from the plantations. In the Kaleidoscope performance, it sounds like a ragtime stomp; as played by Hamelin and the Takács it is fleeter of foot, jazzy and sparkling. The two approaches are complementary, equally worthwhile, yet if anything the Quintet as a whole sounds less self-conscious as the Takács and Hamelin have it.View image in fullscreenTakacs Quartet/Marc-André Hamelin: Price and Dvorak Piano QuintetsDvořák’s Quintet No 2 in A major – written in 1887, the year of Price’s birth – dates from before his move to New York and therefore predates his own wholehearted embrace of black American music. It is nicely paired with the Price here in a characterful performance in which the music’s passion is perfectly balanced with its charm.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.music.apple.com.

She and her colleague Dave (Gael García Bernal) try their hand at amateur sleuthing in a story of humorous, if mild, peril – until an almighty twist throws everything out of whack.Simon WardellExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The English distinction – not tied to a cathedral, a certain form of local government, nor population size – is whimsical, even if signed off by royalty. This selection of destinations is not about alpha cities. The smallest is ancient; the other two newly minted. None merit bypassing.CarlisleI arrived in Carlisle by way of theCumbrian coast lineand would later ride onward on the fabled railway to Settle. Arriving in this ancient city in a midway kind of mood is all too common. If Carlisle wasn’t between so many beauty spots – Lakes and Dales, Scotland and Northumbria, Hadrian’s Wall and North Pennines – it would be a tourism hotspot.Its origins lie in the Roman settlement of Luguvalium, a key military base by the third century and the administrative centre for keeping down the indigenousCarvetii. A castle first appeared in 1093; itssuccessorgreets you outside the station. A priory and city were founded and a bishopric decreed in the 12th century. Walls were speedily built; the western ramparts remain. Anglo-Norman historian Jordan Fantosme (died circa 1185) describes the “fair and well-defended city of Carlisle … resplendent in its beauty as the sun lights up its walls and turrets”. Myth swirled around them. French Arthurian poet Chrétien de Troyes identified Arthur’s court with Carlisle.From the 13th century, the gaze shifted to Scotland, with Carlisle as a base for invasion. Between-ness became bloodyWool was woven and dyed; leather was tanned. Both commodities were exported to Ireland. From the 13th century, the gaze shifted to Scotland, with Carlisle as a base for invasion. Between-ness became bloody. The so-calledDebatable Lands, formerly too poor to matter, became a seedbed of anarchy.Border reiversfrom both nations raided farms and settlements. This was the last part of Great Britain to be brought under the control of a state, beginning in 1530.Subsequently, Carlisle was a major trading post, for corn, cattle, horses, with three fairs and eight thriving guilds (merchants, tanners, skinners and glovers, butchers, smiths, weavers, tailors, and shoemakers). TheGuildhallis a Grade I-listed, timber-framed beauty. However, commercial activity waned. Daniel Defoe, visiting in 1724, reported that “the city is strong, but small, the buildings old, but the streets fair … There is not a great deal of trade here either by land or sea, it being a mere frontier”.Industry rebooted it all over again, through canal, roads and, especially, the railways. It became a substantial north-west city. Dickens and Wilkie Collins stayed at theCounty Hotelon their tours. The latter used his northern experiences while writing The Woman in White. I imagine him sipping a brew and scribbling at the VictorianJohn Watt & Son tearoomsin his final year.Things to see and do:Lanercost Priory(bus AD122 and 685), Hadrian’s Wall (Birdoswald) at Brampton;Carlisle CathedralDoncasterView image in fullscreenA remarkable contemporary building … the Danum Gallery, Library and Museum.Photograph: Dave Porter/AlamyOne definition of the north is “point of no return”. In 1603, Sir Robert Carey, deciding to deliver the news that Queen Elizabeth I had died to James VI at Holyrood, travelled by horse from London to Doncaster in a single day. Henry Bolingbroke was proclaimed Henry IV at Doncaster. Northern powers met their foes to negotiate near Doncaster during thePilgrimage of Grace, a revolt against Henry VIII and Thomas Cromwell.England’s envoys were following their Roman forebears. Doncaster was a natural forward base for summits and skirmishes. The Great North Road provides both entry point and focus for a day trip to Donny. The starting gate is the racecourse, here since 1776, also the first year of the St Leger.Doncaster gathers pace as you walk. Soon the old main drag bristles with pubs and barsThe Great North Road (A638) is an elegant boulevard. On South Parade are smart early 19th-century terraces. Extensive parks spread out on either side of the road. At Regent Square, leafiness comes into town. In the area areThe Earl, a 1930s hotel with its art deco shimmeringly restored;The Point, a thriving gallery, cafe and cultural space; andThe Salutation, a lovely boozer that has kept its arch for horse-drawn coaches.Doncaster gathers pace as you walk. Soon the old main drag bristles with pubs and bars. Hall Gate becomes High Street. On the pavement are two undulating timelines – one for Doncaster (Romans invade 55BC, founding of Danecastre 1152, floods 1750); the other for world events (braille 1837, cubism 1907, etc). Rising above it is theMansion House, one of two Grade I-listed buildings in the town centre, and the official base of the civic mayor. Free tours of the opulent staircase, meeting rooms and grand ballroom are offered monthly.The Roman name, Danum, is everywhere: Danum hotel; Danum plumbing and heating; Danum coffee. TheDanum Gallery, Library and Museumis a remarkable contemporary building, housing part of the old Doncaster high school for girls building. It has a superb railway memorabilia collection, with the Green Arrow and Atlantic locos built at Doncaster Plant Works as magnificent centrepieces. Above these are beautiful library areas for adults and children, a smart cafe, and an art gallery that juxtaposes old master-ish oils of race meetings and wigged grandees with contemporary work reflecting the mostforward-looking attitudes to mental health.St George’s churchis the other Grade I-listed building. Known as the minster, it is prominent, dark and godly, and visible from afar. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner deemed it the “proudest and most cathedral-like of … parish churches”. I walked beneath it, over the North Bridge, past the Danum retail park to the Sun inn, there to discover the Roman Ridge – a branch of the old Roman road called Ermine Street, green and filled with birdsong. At a bench I ate a ham pie from the revered local bakeryToppings. The Romans are said to have introduced the idea of topping pies, and I was having a Toppings pie on the road by which their legionnaires, and their recipes, arrived. A Roman pie on a Roman road.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wales’s isn’t in doubt – but that doesn’t deter putdowns. In a parody of Dylan Thomas’s oft-quoted “ugly, lovely town”, the corrupt cop Terry Walsh (played by Dougray Scott) in the 1997 filmTwin Town describesSwanseaas a “pretty shitty city”.I disagree: terrace houses ranged on steep-sided hills and sweeping Swansea Bay offer solace to the searching eye. If all of Swansea isn’t pretty, blame the blitz, which obliterated buildings, lives, livelihoods, part of the past. The name of the city has nothing to do with swans or the sea. It was once calledSweins egoreyc, Swein’s island. In Welsh, it’s Abertawe, meaning mouth of the Tawe river. Swein may have been a Norseman who built a fort on the island around AD1000 as a base for raiding the Welsh coast.Dylan Thomas is too famous, his ownership of Swansea (and Laugharne) too established to need revisiting. Other artists are worthy guidesThe town was founded in the early 12th century during the Norman conquest of Wales. A wooden castle was constructed on the site of Worcester Place, rebuilt in stone in the early 13th century – still standing at the southern end of High Street, somewhat hemmed in by modern buildings. A town, with a market and garrison, sprang up. Much later, Swansea grew around coal mining and iron ore extraction, shipbuilding and shipping, and in the late 18th century saw booms in copper, lead and pottery. In 1801 the population was around 6,800; by the end of the century, it had passed 100,000. During the last three decades, the docks have been redeveloped – and rebranded as the Maritime Quarter (or Marina).Dylan Thomas is too famous, his ownership of Swansea (andLaugharne) too established to need revisiting. Other artists are worthy guides. Vernon Watkins’s Ode to Swansea opens with precise images of its particular luminance: “Bright town, tossed by waves of time to a hill.” Alfred Janes’s paintingCastle Street, Swansea 1941-41captures the blitzed, violated urban heart. Daniel Jones’sFifth Symphonymay evoke the drama of the wild surrounding landscapes, inner turmoil, the sea, wartime memories, or none of those. It confirmed him “without serious rival as the principality’s leading symphonist”.These three, with other pals, and Thomas, were known collectively as the Kardomah Gang. TheKardomahcafe on Portland Street is not the original (that was on Castle Street) but is a lovely combination of 50s-style greasy spoon and 21st -century retro chic. The city is packed with sites iconic to locals and literary pilgrims alike: theNo Sign Bar(the city’s oldest wine bar); theTower of the Eclipticastronomical observatory; the graciousMorgan’s Hotel; the magnificently (mis)named Salubrious Passage off Wind Street; the old Carlton Cinema (now abookshop).Trainspotters and history buffs get misty eyed about the Swansea and Mumbles Railway, opened on 25 March 1807, to carry the first paying passengers in the world; a replica of the first horse-drawn carriage is on display in theTramshedin the Marina. I follow its trail to Mumbles and the Gower – which rises towards the sunset.Things to see and do:Swansea Jack memorial;5 Cwmdonkin Drive(Dylan Thomas’s house) and Cwmdonkin Park,Dylan Thomas Centre,National Waterfront Museum.Chris Moss’s visits were assisted byVisit England,Visit Walesand Doncaster CouncilExplore more on these topicsUnited Kingdom holidaysWhere tourists seldom treadWales holidaysEngland holidaysDay tripsCultural tripsShort breaksCity breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"
