How do people recover from decades-long rifts?Deborah LintonSun 17 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 17 Aug 2025 17.14 EDTShare“What happened?” Scott, 82, asked Bruce, 78, when his younger brother picked up the phone and called him after a 15-year estrangement. “I grew up,” Bruce said. “I’ve been stupid and I really miss you.”The brothers had missed a decade and a half of each other’s birthdays, milestones and memories made, but here they were, talking again as though no time had passed.A quarter of the adult population describe themselves as estranged from a relative; 10% from a parent and 8% from a sibling, according to research by Karl Pillemer, professor of human development at Cornell University and author of Fault Lines: Fractured Families and How to Mend Them. But when decades pass and rifts remain unhealed, what drives family members such as Scott and Bruce – or, rather more famously,the Gallagher brothers– to repair their ruptured relationships?As children, in San Fernando valley, California, Scott and Bruce were close. “He was protective and a great storyteller,” Bruce says. “We’d go to the movies together and I remember hiding behind a seat at the cinema watching The Blobandwaiting for Scott to tell me when to come out. We got along pretty well.” Scott had dyslexia and struggled at school, gaining less affection from their unemotional parents as a result. Bruce noticed: “He was undervalued. Our parents never acknowledged or celebrated his achievements.”View image in fullscreenScott and Bruce as children in California.Photograph: courtesy of Scott and BruceAs they entered teenage years, these differences began to come between them. “We started to have issues when I began having my own opinions,” says Bruce, now living in Santa Fe. “I was and still am a know-it-all. I was thin-skinned and not very self-aware.”Bruce gained a PhD and worked as a substitute teacher near Berkeley, California, while Scott became a screenwriter, got married, brought up two daughters and moved to Nevada City. The brothers met up a couple of times a year but Bruce remembers, “He would always say extremely hurtful things.” The comments festered until, during one trip in 2005, when the pair were around 60, Bruce “blew up”. “I’d bought us all seafood,” he remembers. “At the end of dinner Scott said, ‘This kitchen was clean, now it’s dirty – you should clean it up.’ It could have been anything but feeling belittled in front of my then girlfriend, it was egregious to me.”So he cut ties. Their late father had also been a screenwriter and when Scott sent a cheque containing his regular half of residuals, Bruce returned it: “I didn’t want any more connection. It was too painful.”“He never said he had a problem with me but it was clear,” Scott remembers. “I wasn’t deeply wounded. I didn’t have time to dwell on what was going on with him. I had to work and feed the family.” He imagined they would come back together someday and wondered, from time to time, if his brother was well. Bruce was “just glad to be out of the line of fire. I don’t remember missing him.”But in 2020, Bruce felt ready for change. Some years earlier he had turned down a suggestion from Scott’s daughter that the pair reconnect but, with the world in lockdown, he began thinking about his relationships. “I realised I’d been too judgmental. I’d never walked a mile in Scott’s shoes. He was saying cruel things to me because I was being an ass. I was the jerk in this story.”Bruce sought advice from a psychotherapist friend about how to reconcile, then picked up the phone. When Scott heard his voice again, he remembers, “We picked up exactly where we left off. There was no animosity. It was guilt free. We haven’t had a harsh word since.”They called each other every fortnight. “We had a hard time hanging up,” Bruce says. Six months later, he went out to visit and has done several times since. “We’ve spoken a lot about our parents, who were kind and bright but not loving,” Scott says. “Neither of us remember being kissed or hugged. Talking about it has allowed us to rediscover each other and ourselves.”Their time apart brought unexpected positives: “We have realised we’re similar in many ways. We think the same and have many of the same expressions. When we belly up to the bar together, you’d know we’re brothers,” Bruce says. He feels vastly happier: “I don’t feel I lost anything. In fact, it’s brought us closer than ever.”Scott agrees: “It’s all been a gain.”Pillemer says Bruce and Scott’s story is typical. “Common to most estrangements is a ‘volcanic event’ where pressure has built up to a single trigger, the capstone in a history of conflict or communication problems. Understanding what it signifies helps figure things out.” Those who reconcile go through a similar process, he adds. “There has usually been some self-exploration. Often, they come to realise they played a part in the rift.” A contemplation phase follows: “I call it anticipatory regret. They miss the person and start to think, if they don’t do this, will it be too late?”For Oliver, 62, a family bereavement made him reassess the 28 years he had spent apart from his twin brotherHenry (not their real names). “I remember thinking: what if he suddenly died and I never had the chance to talk to him? I picked up the phone and counted down: 10, nine, eight, seven … thinking: shall I do it?”The two were nonidentical and had always been different: “As twins, there’s a presumption that you’re cut from the same cloth. But he had his friends and interests, and I had mine. He was intellectual and introverted, and I was the opposite, more colourful.”It was like going on a first date. I realised we had to leave what happened in the past and talk about the present and futureBy their teenage years, Oliver says, “We were just two brothers living in the same house. There was a distance between us. It was hard to connect.” They moved to different cities and, at 21, Oliver emigrated. “Whenever I came back, I would suggest we meet. I felt it was always met with an excuse.”When Henry married, Oliver says, “I didn’t want or expect to be his best man and he didn’t ask. I just felt like a guest.” They headed further in different directions, speaking every few months until the early 90s when, on another trip home, Oliver asked Henry to dinner and found his excuse too painful: “It was always me initiating things; he didn’t once pick up the phone and ask how I was. Rejection is never easy but with family it hits harder.” Despondent, he thought, “OK, I’ve tried.”In the almost three decades that followed, no one in the family addressed the twins’ alienation: “My parents knew but they didn’t say anything; I kind of wish they had.” Oliver says he wanted to connect many times, “but thought I was setting myself up for rejection. I learned from family members he was suffering with his own problems. There were things I wished I could share.”‘I never want you around your grandchild’: the families torn apart when adult children decide to go ‘no contact’Read moreWhen, in 2009, their sister’s husband died from cancer, Oliver returned to the UK for the funeral. The brothers found themselves in the same room again. “I saw him walking up to the house. I thought: this is going to be uncomfortable for everyone.” They didn’t speak but Oliver recalls, “His wife asked, ‘Do you think you’d consider calling him? I think he’d respond favourably.’” He flew home reflecting on her words and the shortness of life: “We don’t get to choose another family.”A few days later, he called Henry. “It was like going on a first date. When we spoke I realised it’s not the point to talk about what happened, why you did this or said that. I thought, no, we’re going to leave that in the past; we’re going to talk about the present and future.”Oliver called Henry every month: “Part of my thought process was about accepting him for who he is and not who I want him to be. He doesn’t talk about emotions whereas I’m very open. So I will pick up the phone and ask how he is because I want him as part of my life.”Henry went out to visit Oliver and now, when Oliver comes back to the UK, he stays with his brother and has got to know his niece and nephew, too. “There’s no emotion, but I have peace with that. I accept him for who he is and it’s fine. We were in the womb together, we have a 62-year connection: you can’t deny that.”While estrangement from siblings – or close cousins, grandparents, aunts or uncles – is upsetting, cutting off a parent or child is especially hard. “We are less obligated to be in touch with siblings, but we are bonded to our parents,” Pillemer says. “It is quite a big thing to say I never want to speak to you again.”That is what happened to Choi, a 45-year-old digital marketer and DJ who grew up in a God-fearing Korean immigrant family in Buenos Aires. As a boy, he feared his father. “He was frequently physically abusive,” Choi says. “My sister and I would count how many days he’d been quiet, then he’d snap. I felt I was living in a prison.”At 17, Choi tried to kill himself; at 18, when his father locked him out for missing a curfew, he left home. “If I’d stayed it would have been the end of me, so I turned around, with no money and no prospects, and never said goodbye.”He was relieved to escape his father’s control, but missed his mother – the two were forbiddenView image in fullscreen‘It’s brought us closer than ever’: Scott (on left) and Bruce.Photograph: Andri Tambunan/The Guardianto talk and over the next two decades saw each other only a handful of times, at Choi’s sister’s wedding and when he visited her, alone, at his parents’ shop. “When I went we’d have a few minutes. She’d ask a lot of questions but we couldn’t have a serious talk. She would ask me to come back and apologise to my dad. I’d walk out feeling angry with her for expecting that of me.”So he stopped visiting; for 10 years, they didn’t see each other at all. Then, in 2022, Choi says, “I wanted to reconnect. My then girlfriend had cancer during the pandemic, so it was tough. When she recovered, I felt grateful and started to think about Mum and Dad.”Choi drove the four hours to his parents’ home and knocked on their door. “When Dad saw me he asked Mum, ‘Who is this?’” Choi remembers. “It was strange but not sad. I was mentally prepared for anything.” His father yelled at him, presuming he wanted money or somewhere to stay. “When his rant ended I told him, ‘I just wanted to see your face and say hello.’ They invited me in and he interrogated me, but I was happy.”Our relationship is complex and still challenging, but I’m grateful to have her in my life. This is a second chanceChoi began calling every Saturday. Conversations were “transactional”; occasionally his father apologised for his behaviour. “I told him I was also a bad son. I said, ‘Let’s not talk about the past, let’s try to build a new relationship.’” But on his next visit, a few months later, his father’s mood changed; he grew angry, then stopped answering his son’s calls. A year later, on a Tuesday morning in February 2023, an unknown number flashed up on Choi’s phone: “It kept calling so I answered.” It was the police station in his parents’ town. “My mum was there. She’d left him and asked if I’d go to get her.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I got her a phone and she called family in Korea she had also been cut off from. She told me about how my father treated her and controlled everything, about his outbursts and how hard it was.” A month later, the unknown number flashed up again. “I knew,” Choi remembers. “He’d killed himself.“It’s hard to grieve a person like my father,” he says. But the death represented a moment of “deep change” – one that allowed Choi to rebuild his relationship with his mother. She moved back into the family home but the pair continue to visit and speak three times a week. “Our relationship is complex and still challenging; I want to protect her but I’m still angry about the past. She says, ‘You have to let go’ but it’s not easy.” He admires her for leaving and, above all, “I’m grateful to have her in my life. This is a second chance.”Reconciliation is not the right choice for everybody, Pillemer warns: “There are situations where the relationship is dangerous or so damaging that it can be better to cut off contact.” And not everyone who attempts it gets the immediate response they had hoped for. “The most successful strategies are where they don’t give up completely and leave a door open.”When the path to reconciliation opens up, gathering information about the person from family members can be helpful. Turning up unannounced is riskier and “not always the best approach” but for Grace, 55 (not her real name), who went 35 years without seeing or hearing from her father, it was life-changing.Grace was 10 when he had an affair and left: “He went off to start a new life and I never saw him again. He didn’t seem interested in me and we didn’t have a strong connection. My mum, who was loving towards me, held a lot of animosity towards him and I felt I should hate him, but I didn’t.” She remained close to relatives on his side of the family who “went out of their way to make sure my feelings weren’t hurt by mentioning him”. Their paths never crossed. It was “a strange situation to be in” and the burden of being the girl, then woman, who didn’t speak to her father was “draining”.Grace spotted her father fleetingly 20 years later when, aged 42, she gave a reading at her grandfather’s funeral. “I expected seeing me would stimulate something in him but it didn’t. I was a bit crestfallen.”Two years after that, while driving with her cousins through the town where he happened to live, one pointed to the roadside. “There were two men chatting with newspapers,” Grace recalls. “‘There’s your father,’ my cousin said. ‘Oh yeah,’ I replied, but I didn’t have the faintest idea which was him. It really threw me.”It was not until my dad was dying that we talked about the years spent apart. I was sad but it provided a lot of closureGrace realised she was hungry for information about who he was and traits they shared: “It was the elephant in the room for so long. The longer the avoidance went on, the bigger it became. I wasn’t sure how I’d feel and I was also convinced Mum would see it as a betrayal.”The thought stayed with her until a couple of years later, going to a family wedding in Ireland, where her father now lived. Everyone was there but him. The next morning, without time to overthink, Grace walked to his house and sat on the doorstep: “I thought, if I go away now, I’ll never come back.” She didn’t have to wait long. When he returned, he didn’t recognise her at first. “Then he said, ‘You’d better come in. Do you want a cup of tea?’”Should I still see my difficult sister now our parents have died? | Ask Annalisa BarbieriRead moreThey sat at the kitchen table. “It felt surreal. I knew that if we were to have a relationship, uncomfortable topics were not to be broached. We talked about baking, feeding the birds, growing vegetables and his English pension. He asked if my mother was alive and I said, ‘Yes, she’s fantastic.’ I felt I had to fight her corner. That’s the only time we approached anything sensitive.”Overwhelmingly, the feeling was of relief. “I needed to get rid of the feeling that part of myself was somehow amputated,” Grace says. “As I was leaving, he hugged me and cried a little. That felt satisfying.” They settled into a pattern of Christmas cards, birthday phone calls and visits once or twice a year, always lasting an hour.She has thought a lot about why she sat on her father’s doorstep that day. “A lot of things in my life had come about through the actions or wishes of others,” she says. “I was no longer willing to be deprived of knowing my own father because of what that might mean to them: the possibility of hurting my mother, being rejected by my father or drawing relatives’ disapproval. And I couldn’t hold anyone else responsible for the rift when I was the only one capable of taking the necessary step.”She wishes she had done it sooner: “I’ve had problems over the years dealing with crap from my childhood. Knowing he was just a normal person and I wasn’t insufficient in some way could have helped.” Her father is in his 80s now and Grace says, “It’s given me the opportunity, late in the day, to be his daughter. If he had died and I had never regained contact with him, that loss would have been awful.”For some, reconciliation does wait until the end of life. Pillimer has found that, in cases of deep, unresolved harm, these moments can have negative consequences. “But when sincere and mutually desired, they can bring emotional closure, reduce regret and ease the grieving process for the one left behind.”It was a deathbed conversation with her own father that eventually delivered closure for Lynne, a 71-year-old lawyer based in Independence, Missouri, after the pair spent more than a decade estranged during her teens and early 20s. She was 36 when he died, aged 59, but she says, “It was not until my dad was dying that we talked about the years spent apart.”Lynne’s parents divorced when she was eight and her father moved out. “I remember seeing him regularly at first,” she says. “Then, when I was 13, my mother remarried, to a difficult man with several children of his own. We all moved in together. My father had problems paying child support for me, my brother and sister, so my stepfather forbade him from seeing us.”She felt her father’s absence: “Things weren’t good at home. I remember thinking I just want a boyfriend to hold me when I cry. When I was older, I realised it was my father I’d wanted. In my teens, my mother made an offhand comment – ‘It’s good your dad’s not around, it makes it easier’ – and I thought: you are so wrong.”View image in fullscreen‘I was resentful that he hadn’t fought harder to be in my life’: Lynne (on right) with her father and sister.Photograph: courtesy of LynneHer mother’s new marriage lasted four years but the schism with her dad continued. In her late teens, Lynne turned down an offer, via a friend, to meet him. “I was still somewhat bitter,” she says. When he had a heart attack soon after, she didn’t visit: “I feel bad now but I was resentful that he hadn’t fought harder to be in my life.”They did see each other when she got married, aged 21. “I didn’t want to get married without him there, so I invited him as a guest. He didn’t walk me down the aisle but we spoke, he gave me a gift and we hugged.”Three years later, she made contact again, impulsively, on Father’s Day: “I saw a card and sent it. I’d never done that before and don’t remember what prompted me.” That December, he called on her birthday. Then they arranged dinner with her siblings. “It felt warm and accepting, but we didn’t talk about what had happened.”Her dad had remarried, meaning Lynne now had a half-brother, and she and her father grew close again. She, her husband and son spent Christmases in Florida, where her dad lived. He visited them, too. “I discovered my father was very intelligent and his sense of humour was a little bit off, just like mine.”She often imagined what it had been like for him during their years apart but received answers only in his final days. He suffered a pulmonary embolism and Lynne and her siblings travelled to upstate New York, where he had moved, to be by his bedside. “They told us he had 10 days to live,” she remembers. “We laughed a lot and talked. He apologised for his absences. He told me the divorce had been his fault, he’d cheated, that he was proud of me for becoming a lawyer, and how much he loved me and regretted what had happened. I was sad he was dying but this felt like the best thing to come out of those circumstances. It provided a lot of closure.“Some relationships never heal, and some people are despicable, but that was not my situation,” she adds. “I’ve always thought those who hold grudges or stay resentful harm themselves most. It’s so much more freeing and life-affirming to forgive.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

This reality show about being an influencer is at times dull, and at others, deeply sadStuart HeritageSun 17 Aug 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 17 Aug 2025 16.01 EDTShareThere is something slightly sweet about the new ITV2 show The Princess Diaries. It is a reality series about a girl nearing 18, trying to figure out what she wants her life to look like. Which is perfectly relatable. The girl is awkward and self-conscious, doing her best to navigate a world more complicated than she expected.Except the subject of The Princess Diaries is Princess Andre, AKA Princess Tiaamii Crystal Esther Andre, AKA the daughter of Peter Andre andKatie Price. This immediately makes things less relatable, because Princess has grown up under the spotlight, with the tabloid furore that her parents delight in whipping up on a daily basis. Would you be that well adjusted if newspapers flew drones over your bankrupt mother’s mansion to show the world how unkempt her garden was? Or if your dad found himself in the middle of a cultural appropriation storm after wearing a dreadlock wig for a film called Jafaican? Or if one of your middle names was Tiaamii?View image in fullscreenPrincess attempts to look carefree on a ‘content' day’ … The Princess Diaries.Photograph: ITVThis is the bind The Princess Diaries finds itself in. On the one hand, Princess desperately wants to appear as a regular teenage girl. But on the other, there is a distinct possibility that the show was made to capitalise on all the rubberneckers who want to see what sort of trouble Price has got herself into now.If you are one of those hoping for news of Price’s exploits, you are going to come away disappointed. Because the main takeaway of The Princess Diaries is how relentlessly boring Princess’s life is. She is a 17-year-old girl whose job involves being an influencer. This means that her entire life is spent on her phone. She has “content days”, when she roams about, attempting to look carefree, in enough outfits to eke out a month’s worth of Instagram posts. She makes vague plans to launch her own beauty line, which at this stage means looking at pictures of other people’s beauty lines. She intermittently screws up her nose because a middle-aged man has DMd her a grotty message about her feet. It is excruciatingly monotonous.Princess lives withPeter Andreand his second wife. Andre and Price do not get along. So while we do get glimpses of Price, they are via video chats (of which we get only the audio, not least because Price is undressed in some of them) and descriptions (such as when Princess reveals that Price got the date of her birthday wrong).View image in fullscreenReality TV is all she has ever known … Princess’s dad Peter Andre on The Princess Diaries.Photograph: ITVThere is an undercurrent of impenetrable sadness. A little like the recentAlec Baldwin reality show, in which the scrappily chaotic idealism of his home life kept dropping away in segments where he addressed the accident when he shot and killed his cinematographer, there is a deep vein of melancholy to The Princess Diaries. For every film premiere and Ibiza fashion show, there is an introspective cutaway where Princess tells everyone how unhappy her childhood was, how she was picked on at school, and the feelings of self-hatred she experienced. But as soon as these bubble up, they are brushed away, because, look, a dog has just dribbled sausage grease on her new Louis Vuitton flip-flops! Everything’s fine again, promise!It was inevitable that Princess Andre would get her own show. After all, as she points out, reality TV is all she has known since she was born. She has been sucked along in the undercurrent of her parents’ careers – she has either appeared in or been adjacent to Katie & Peter: The Baby Diaries, Katie & Peter: Unleashed, Katie & Peter: Down Under, Katie & Peter: Stateside, Peter Andre: Going It Alone, Peter Andre: The Next Chapter, Katie Price’s Mucky Mansion, Peter Andre: My Life and Katie Price: My Crazy Life.However, on the basis of this series, it might have been worth waiting until Princess got her own gig. She is clearly smart and self-aware, and far better adjusted than you might expect. One day, when she has managed to clear the orbit of her ridiculous childhood, Princess Andre will be able to look back and put everything she has experienced into perspective. That day has yet to come. Instead, we have four hours of a 17-year-old girl looking at a phone. Surely that is too much reality for anyone.All episodes are available to stream on ITVX now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionPeter AndreKatie PriceDocumentaryReality TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She had found a company to provide them: Totally Rad, based in the West Midlands.Totally Rad Hub is one of the big players in a part of the education economy that has boomed as public funding for music in state schools has been squeezed: private companies that supply freelance instrument teachers. The company says it has a network of 200 freelance tutors providing instrument lessons to about 300 schools and 5,000 families.It offers one-to-one tuition delivered in either 15-, 20- or 30-minute lessons, charging parents prices equivalent to £40 an hour (excluding VAT). It’s a lucrative business: Totally Rad’s income from schools wasprojectedto surpass £1m in 2024.But according to the company’s promotional material, Totally Rad’s mission is all about the music. Because it is run by musicians, the company says it understands “the challenges of developing musical skills and pursuing dreams”. It promises “experienced teachers”. Its corporate communication style is chirpy and upbeat: one of its favoured catchphrases is “You’re awesome. We’re RAD”.At Hannah’s school, the experience didn’t quite match that hype.A drum kit from Totally Rad duly arrived and all the kids who had signed up had a first lesson from their new drum tutor. But on the second week he didn’t show up. Totally Rad hadn’t supplied Hannah with a phone number and she couldn’t find one online, so she asked why he had been absent using an email address she had been given. She got a reply four days later saying there had apparently been a “personal emergency”.The tutor returned for two more sessions but then disappeared again. The first explanation the company offered put his absence down to “unforeseen circumstances”, which was followed by news that his commute to the school had proved to be financially unviable.“He did three lots of lessons and that was him done,” Hannah said. Totally Rad said lessons were now “on hold” and assured her it was trying to find a replacement.If schools lack confidence and knowledge in music, the door’s wide open for people to come in offering a substandard productChris Walters, Musicians’ UnionWendy Hollands’ son Riley was then eight years old and had been thrilled that his mum had signed him up for drum lessons (he is a massive Pink Floyd fan, she says). “Each week he came home and I said to him: ‘How was drumming?’ He was like, ‘I didn’t go again – they didn’t get me.’ He was missing it,” Hollands said. Riley is awaiting an autism and ADHD diagnosis. “He was coming home and taking it out on us because he wasn’t doing the drumming.”Back at the school, Hannah had also been waiting for a Totally Rad singing teacher since April. One finally turned up in early June but only provided one day of lessons. The school were told this was due to a bereavement.The seeming lack of reliability was one thing but by now the parents she was dealing with had another very glaring grievance: they had paid upfront for drumming and singing lessons that hadn’t happened. Hannah said she contacted Totally Rad with a clear instruction: “You have to tell our parents that this is not happening and refund them immediately.” But that “took months and months and months”, she said.No more singing lessons ever happened. In September last year, Totally Rad finally sent the school a drum teacher. That lasted two months before the new teacher told Hannah he was leaving Totally Rad. The school, and its children, were once more in limbo.At this point Hannah decided to quit using Totally Rad. The company initially met her suggestion that their contractual arrangement should end in February 2025 with an insistence that it should carry on until Easter (at one point, Totally Rad recommended that the school hire independent legal advice to try to resolve this), and insisted it could fill the resulting gap with yet another drum teacher. But no one ever came.By the spring of 2025, though Totally Rad had not come to collect its drum kit, Hannah was confident she would not have to deal with the company ever again and that the issues with families’ money had been resolved. But in June she was contacted by around 10 parents who had either suddenly had money taken from their accounts by Totally Rad or been notified that it was attempting to do so.The company later told her that some of the invoices it demanded payment for “were raised in error”, but “in some instances they related to underpayments from parents during the period when lessons were active”. It offered no explanation of why it had suddenly contacted parents six months after its lessons had ended.One of these parents was Hollands. “I emailed them,” she said. “I was like: ‘Is there a reason I’m being charged again when my son’s lessons are no longer with you?’ They didn’t respond. And they tried taking more payments the following days – three times. They eventually replied. They tried telling me that I was overdue a balance from December, six months beforehand – but when I checked my Totally Rad account, it said ‘paid’.”Totally Rad said there was an unresolved balance in the account which triggered the automated payment system to issue a payment reminder. Once the company was alerted, the invoice was voided and no payment taken. They denied the allegation that there were multiple requests for payment.Totally Rad said the cancellation of sessions was “regrettable” and that any lessons that do not take place are not chargeable but do remain credited on an account for future sessions.It denied threatening the school with legal action and said it simply reminded the school of its contractual obligations. Totally Rad said it agreed to terminate its working relationship with the school with no financial penalty. It said this was a gesture of goodwill.These answers and claims from the company arrived in my inbox a fortnight ago. But at around the same time it became aware that the Guardian was investigating its affairs, Totally Rad seems to have started a comprehensive rebranding exercise. TheTotally Rad Hub websitehas now been cleared of all content, and brings up a single message: “This site is restricted and not publicly accessible.”At the time of writing, a Totally Rad website that recruits new freelance teachers is still live. There were residual traces of the company’s old corporate identity on YouTube. But it seems the people involved want to somehow move on. Many of the parents and teachers I have spoken to , by contrast, feel that Totally Rad still needs to be held accountable for a long list of failures.‘I’ve never taught music before’I first encountered Totally Rad in March this year. Until the end of the recent summer term, my son James went to an autism specialist school in Somerset called the Mendip school, and like many autistic people he is extremely musical. He told me he wanted to learn the piano, and when the school said it had arranged for Totally Rad to deliver its services, I provisionally signed him up.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Liudmila Chernetska/Getty Images/iStockphotoBecause of his autism, James has a singular learning style, and teaching him is best done by someone who understands neurodivergence. If things go wrong, it can poison his interest in whatever he is learning. So I emailed Totally Rad with a reasonable request: could I speak to the tutor involved? Two days later, I got an answer: “We don’t have a phone number to be contacted on but we are more than happy to discuss any of your concerns.” So I asked again: could the tutor who would be working with James call me? “We are happy to pass on any information to our teacher you may have,” said the reply.After more back-and-forth exchanges, I then received an email suddenly agreeing that “speaking with the teacher in advance” was in fact a “vital part” of “every child receiving the support they need to learn in a way that works best for them”. But by then I was fearing the worst. “I’ll leave it,” I said.Totally Rad says there is a phone line available for teachers and tutors and schools, but not for the parents of the children being taught. The company communicates with parentsvia a secure messaging platform called Intercom. This, it said, was for safeguarding reasons.What happened next echoes the experiences of many of the parents I have spoken to. Over 17 days, I was sent 24 text messages – sometimes at the rate of two a day, at completely random times – demanding money for lessons I had not agreed to (at one point, the fee went up from £78 to £120.90) and that were not going to happen.Totally Rad said these messages were from an automated system and related to amounts I would have owed had the lessons taken place. It voided my invoice, it said, as a gesture of goodwill.I later discovered what had happened after Totally Rad sent a teacher to the Mendip school, in a long conversation with the school’s spokesperson. “It was 16 May, which was a Friday, when we had the first lesson,” he said. “They sent this chap out … and I said: ‘What experience have you had working with children with special needs?’ He said: ‘I actually only found out it was a special school when I Googled it myself.’”As far as the school understands, the teacher had done this the night before he turned up. He was scheduled to teach 14 autistic children.“I said: ‘How much music teaching have you done?’,” the school spokesperson said. “He said: ‘This is my first day. I’ve never taught music before.’ He said to get the job he had had to send Totally Rad a video of him playing the guitar. His words were: ‘I think they just wanted somebody in the job quick, so they hired me within about three weeks.’”He was also scheduled to teach the piano, which he said he could play “a bit”. Fearing things might go badly wrong, a full-time teacher had to sit in on the first lessons and leave his class of nine-, 10- and 11-year-olds in the hands of support staff. “It very quickly became apparent that the Totally Rad teacher was just out of his depth,” the spokesperson told me. “He didn’t really know how to handle our children. There was none of the animation you’d need to get children excited. There was just nothing.“I have no issues with this lad – I mean, he really did try his best. But he shouldn’t have been placed in that position.”The Totally Rad branding on TrustPilot suddenly changed to that of ‘Winston Farriers’, a horse-riding company of which I could find no recordJohn HarrisThe school sent its first email alerting Totally Rad to serious concerns and raising the prospect of cancelling its arrangement on 16 May and received no replies, aside from a suggestion to try a different email address, and a claim – on 13 June – that the member of staff who could deal with this would be “returning shortly from annual leave”. By the start of July – six weeks after the first teacher had turned up – the Mendip school had still received no acknowledgment of its problems.The staff concerned made their grievances plain: “As a school, we are appalled with our experience with Totally Rad, from sending an individual who is unqualified to teach music, particularly to students with additional learning needs. Perhaps more upsetting, however, is the way in which your company has hounded our parents for payments, sending multiple emails and messages each day.”Totally Rad did not address the fact that its tutor did not know he was teaching autistic children and had never done so. It did say that suggestions a tutor was simply thrown in without verified checks on quality or suitability were “unfounded” and misrepresented its recruitment process. That process, it said, includes a performance video and interview, with responses assessed against an internal scoring system.The school also raised another issue: “There are parents who have unknowingly paid for music lessons for September who have since rung to request a refund, only to be told [by Totally Rad] that these lessons will be taking place. They will not.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two weeks ago, the school sent the company an email repeating the fact that it wanted to cancel its contract and informing it that a member of staff was speaking to the Guardian. A reply came back within an hour, along with confirmation that the contract would be ended.In researching the company, my attention was quickly drawn to a fascinating subplot in the story of Totally Rad on the consumer reviews website TrustPilot. In early June, when I read some profoundly negative descriptions of the company’s services posted on there (there are 43 one-star reviews, out of a total of 51), I posted my own. I mentioned some of my experiences and explained that I would soon be writing this article. At around the same time, the Totally Rad branding on the relevant page of that website suddenly changed to that of “Winston Farriers”, a horse-riding company of which I could find no record.There was also a review credited to “Anon” enthusing about “a five-star experience from start to finish”, in which the staff had “matched each rider to the right horse, and kept the pace right for everyone”. For a while, these changes meant any Trustpilot user had to scroll down to find any mention of Totally Rad’s music tuition.A spokesperson for Trustpilot told me this change happened when the owner of Totally Rad registered with the website decided to “claim” its profile, a change that lets companies reply to their reviews. “We were informed by a whistleblower report that the business had changed the name of the profile to a domain not associated with the company,” he said. “Once this was confirmed by our internal teams, we changed it back to the original name and sent an educational message as part of our enforcement process, which was acknowledged by the business owner.”The rebranding has been reversed and the horse-riding review has disappeared.Totally Rad’s lawyers told us “our client has no understanding of why the page was temporarily changed”, and that some of the reviews on Trustpilot were not reflective of their customer base.A spokesperson from Trustpilot confirmed that changes on the company profile were actioned by a user using a Totally RadMusicbusiness email address.Totally Rad has threatened at least two people who have posted reviews on Trustpilot with legal action. One is Hannah, the teacher in Kent. In June, she posted a negative review on the website. She then received two emails from Totally Rad’s “operations director”, Josh Hall. The first said: “I’ve been alerted to a public review containing defamatory claims which appears to align with your first name,” and asked for confirmation that she had written it.The second was legal. It said her review was “demonstrably false and malicious in nature” and threatened her with legal action under the Defamation Act 2013. As a result, Hannah spoke to me for this article under a pseudonym, and the school has declined to be named.‘They were terrible at communicating’Samuel Morgan was willing to speak to me on the record. He is a self-employed music tutor based in London, and one of several former Totally Rad tutors I spoke to, all of whom talked about late payments and poor communication; two of them have resorted to legal action to try to secure money the company owes them.Morgan is a drummer. To demonstrate his skills, he had sent the company a video of him playing Starless, by the 1970s prog-rock band King Crimson. But he says he was not asked any meaningful questions about his aptitude for teaching. “There was nothing like that,” he said. He also agreed to teach guitar and piano.View image in fullscreenA child being taught guitarPhotograph: South_agency/Getty Images“It was the first proper job I’d had after leaving uni,” he said. Totally Rad said he would be paid around four weeks after each working month had come to an end: for September, he was told, he’d be paid at the end of October. “But they were terrible at communicating,” he claims. “The first story that was spun to me was maybe two weeks after my invoice was overdue. They said: ‘Can you amend some things on your invoice?’ Another few weeks went by. I was sending emails like: ‘Just checking – are there any issues here?’ And then the finance manager said: ‘Sorry there have been delays, we’ve been switching over to a new payment system. We’ll get you paid shortly.’”By now it was “well into November”. He was finally paid for the work he had done in September after getting help from the Musicians’ Union. By then he had decided to stop working for Totally Rad.“When I handed in my notice, that’s when they started being ridiculously difficult with payments,” he claimed. “I had to pay my rent. I was having to borrow money off people. It was a miserable Christmas because of that.”He finally got paid for his work in October at the end of December, but then he began chasing Totally Rad for another two months’ worth of fees that had not been paid. “I remember sending emails with links to songs with money in the title: Money, by Pink Floyd, and Money For Nothing, by Dire Straits,” he said. His outstanding invoices were finally paid in February this year.Totally Rad said each candidate was put through a detailed and structured selection process, including a video performance and an interview. It said invoices were paid within 30 days of receiving correct invoices, and that it was within its right to delay payment until accurate invoices were received.The Musicians’ Union’s recommended hourly rate for instrument teachers who work in schools is £44 an hour. Its national organiser for education, Chris Walters, says the union has been concerned about privately run music tuition services for about a decade, but issues about the way they operate have noticeably intensified over the past few years.“If schools lack confidence and knowledge in music, they see these companies as a great solution,” he said. “And so the door’s wide open for people to come in who are actually offering a substandard product. And that includes the way that they treat their teachers and the way they prepare them to go into schools.”I’d cancelled the lessons, but Totally Rad then hounded me. And honestly, it made me ill.Beccy Marshall, parentThis is, at least in part, yet another story about the long shadow cast by austerity. A big factor in the rise of such companies, Walters said, had been a post-2012 funding freeze for music hubs: local organisations that are meant to coordinate music teaching in state schools, with finance provided by the Department for Education. Their financial problems have been reflected in a decline in instrument teaching, and a sense that much of what remains is delivered on a hand-to-mouth basis.In October last year, Totally Rad announced it had secured £100,000 in debt finance – from public money – from the Midlands Engine Investment Fund II, a scheme overseen by the state-owned British Business Bank.Those funds, Totally Rad said, would partly be used to support the development of a new online platform, which would “complement the existing service by enabling pupils to continue lessons during the school holidays or allow those in rural areas to access lessons when there are no local teachers available”.Meanwhile, there are people with grievances all over the country.Beccy Marshall lives in Saddleworth, in Greater Manchester. Last autumn, her daughter said she was interested in Totally Rad drum tuition at her school, but then she changed her mind. Her mum cancelled the lessons that had been planned.“But she came home from school and said they’d pulled her into a drumming lesson,” Marshall said. “I was really annoyed. I thought: ‘You’ve not had my consent to do that.’ I’d cancelled it. But Totally Rad then hounded me. And honestly, it made me ill.“It was constant texts, constant emails, and I kept trying to contact them to say ‘I cancelled this, I don’t want the lessons’. And the only time they would reply would be to say: ‘You didn’t cancel it’. I was sending them screenshots to say: ‘Look I’ve got this to show you I have cancelled it.’ And they would just keep hounding me for this money. The money was going up as well, they were putting charges on it, late payment fees.“I think I even said in one of my messages: ‘You are just a music provider to schools. My bank doesn’t hound me like this.’”In most of what she says, there is a familiar element of so many accounts of dealing with Totally Rad: a kind of grim amazement that something as simple – and potentially life-changing – as teaching music to children could be so fraught with difficulty and bad feeling. “It was bonkers,” she said. “Bonkers.”Totally Rad says bill payers are liable to pay for sessions unless cancelled in advance in writing, otherwise automated reminders are sent out until the issue is resolved. In many cases we have reported on, Totally Rad has agreed to cancel outstanding payments for lessons which have not yet happened. This, it said, was done out of good will.Totally Rad said it had attempted to deal with all issues raised in this article, many of which were caused by circumstances outside its control, in a professional and timely manner. It also said the business had supported schools, donated free instruments and provided lessons and opportunities for children from all backgrounds.Its lawyers, Taylor Hampton, said the allegations in this article “are not only inaccurate, they are also defamatory of our client”. This language closely mirrors that used in letters sent by Totally Rad to tutors and teachers, whose pupils have just wanted to learn to play music.Explore more on these topicsSchoolsMusicTeachingnewsShareReuse this content"

Now Zelenskyy and Europe are in an even more perilous positionRajan MenonTrump’s summit failed to achieve a ceasefire, but the Russian president will be very happy with how events are unfoldingSun 17 Aug 2025 09.19 EDTLast modified on Sun 17 Aug 2025 12.20 EDTShareDonald Trump portrays himself as a hard-nosed dealmaker. Yet in the run-up to Friday’s summit with Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, hisclaim that the Russian leaderheld him in high regard and was therefore serious about ending the war in Ukraine sounded naive. Putin doesn’t let sentimentality shape his political and military decisions. Nor has he disavowed his longstanding claim to four Ukrainian provinces: Donetsk and Luhansk, which together comprise Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, and Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in the south. Despite Russia’s overwhelming numerical advantage in troops and weaponry, Putin occupies only one province, Luhansk, almost entirely. Yet he persists.In the days before his meeting with Putin, Trump said the Russian economy “stinks” and that falling oil prices would cause Russia’s war to run aground. The war has certainly placed severe strains on Russia’s economy, includinghigh inflationandinterest rates,labour shortagesanda lack of investmentby private businesses. Earnings from oil sales, a key source of state income, have alsoshrunk by 18%this year due tofalling prices. There has even beentalk of a recession. But these pressures have not prompted Putin to reassess his war plans. He ignored Trump’s proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, which Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accepted right away. Likewise, he was unfazed by Trump’s threats to impose additional sanctions – with “severe consequences”, as he put it just before the summit – if Russia did not relent.Trump returned from Anchorage empty-handed for other reasons. Successful summits require painstaking advance work by leaders’ subordinates; this one was arranged in haste. Given the rush, it was unsurprising that the Anchorage talksended hours ahead of time. (The working lunch the two delegations were to have was cancelled.) During his post-summit press conference, Trump gamely praised Putin’s goodwill and said that they had agreed on “many points” during discussions that he described as “productive”. Yet he failed to identify a single point of agreement and, atypically, didn’t stay to answer reporters’ questions.Putin came out ahead in Anchorage. He didn’t agree to Trump’s pet proposal for a ceasefire. It was Trump who ended upaccepting Putin’s positionthat a ceasefire must be preceded by a comprehensive peace agreement that addresses the “root causes” of the war. Putin did show some flexibility byagreeing to freezethe frontline if Ukraine were to withdraw from Donetsk and Luhansk, and thus the entire Donbas, enabling Russia to acquire lands it has failed to conquer despite more than 40 months of fighting. Yet this offer could prove to be a trap. If Zelenskyy, who arrives in Washington for talks with Trump on Monday, refuses to do this, Putin may be able to look on as Trump tries to coerce the Ukrainian leader, forcing Europe to take sides. If Trump fails, Putin can paint Zelenskyy as the real obstacle to peace.1:55'There’s no deal until there’s a deal,' says Trump on Ukraine war after talks with Putin – videoTrump had declared that there would be no future talks if the summit failed – which it did, as he couldn’t obtain a ceasefire, his main objective – yet in Anchorage, he spoke of follow-up meetings. Putin concurred, mischievously suggesting Moscow as the venue, but without indicating that he was open to including Zelenskyy and European leaders. By agreeing to further negotiations and keeping Trump’s hopes for a peace deal alive, Putin may have ensured that the efficacy of additional US sanctions on Russia remains untested.By simply showing up in Anchorage, Putin demonstrated that the western policy of isolating him won’t work. Zelenskyy and European leaders are undoubtedly relieved that the duo didn’t unveil a deal to end the war by partitioning Ukraine. Still, Trump’s readiness to accept Putin’s insistence on this bilateral meeting after USefforts to include Zelenskyy failedhad already sown more mistrust between Washington and Europe. NowTrump has embraced Putin’s viewthat there can be no ceasefire without an overall agreement that addresses all aspects of the conflict. He has also in effectendorsed Putin’s callfor Ukraine to cede Donbas in exchange for a freeze of the frontline. These shifts will increase Ukraine and Europe’s distrust of Trump – to Putin’s advantage.Russia jubilant after Trump summit as Putin reportedly demands Donetsk and LuhanskRead morePutin’s confidence in Russia’s eventual victory has been bolstered by Trump’s decision, taken well before the summit, to cease direct weapons deliveries to Ukraine – assistancethat totalled $65.9bnwhile Joe Biden was the US president. Russia will continue bombing Ukraine’s cities, and its ground troops will keep pushing to grab even more land. In this respect, the summit has changed nothing. What has changed since Trump’s return to the White House, though, is the US’s role in the war. Ultimately, Trump believes that Russia’s invasion does not threaten the US so it’s up to the Europeans to support Ukraine’s defence, a pointJD Vance reiteratedshortly before the summit. European countries have been increasing itsdefence spendingandmilitary supportto Ukraine. But it had better be prepared to do even more and summon the unity to stay the course.Meanwhile, the lure of additional talks with Putin will keep alive Trump’s illusion that continued diplomatic engagement with Russia and his self-proclaimed deal-making skills will eventually end the war – clearing the path to theNobel peace prize he covets.Rajan Menon is a professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York and a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace StudiesExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinRussiaDonald TrumpEuropean UnionEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

How can we harness them sustainably?Liam ShawSun 17 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 17 Aug 2025 16.39 EDTShareIn 1954, just a few years after the widespread introduction of antibiotics, doctors were already aware of the problem of resistance. Natural selection meant that using these new medicines gave an advantage to the microbes that could survive the assault – and a treatment that worked today could become ineffective tomorrow. A British doctor put the challenge in military terms: “We may run clean out of effective ammunition. Then how the bacteria and moulds will lord it.”More than 70 years later, that concern looks prescient. The UN has called antibiotic resistance “one of the most urgent global health threats”. Researchers estimate that resistance already killsmore than a million people a year, with that number forecast to grow. And new antibiotics are not being discovered fast enough; many that are essential today were discovered more than 60 years ago.The thing to remember is that antibiotics are quite unlike other medicines. Most drugs work by manipulating human biology: paracetamol relieves your headache by dampening the chemical signals of pain; caffeine blocks adenosine receptors and as a result prevents drowsiness taking hold.Antibiotics, meanwhile, target bacteria. And, because bacteria spread between people, the challenge of resistance is social: it’s as if every time you took a painkiller for your headache, you increased the chance that somebody else might have to undergo an operation without anaesthetic.That makes resistance more than simply a technological problem. But like that British doctor in 1954, we still often talk as if it is: we need to invent new “weapons” to better defend ourselves.What this framing overlooks is that the extraordinary power of antibiotics is not due to human ingenuity. In fact, the majority of them derive from substances originally made by bacteria and fungi, evolved millions of years ago in a process of microbial competition.This is where I can’t help thinking about another natural resource that helped create the modern world but has also been dangerously overused: fossil fuels. Just as Earth’s geological forces turned dead plants from the Carboniferous era into layers of coal and oil that we could burn for energy, so evolution created molecules that scientists in the 20th century were able to recruit to keep us alive.Both have offered an illusory promise of cheap, miraculous and never-ending power over nature – a promise that is now coming to an end. If we thought of antibiotics as the “fossil fuels” of modern medicine, might that change how we use them? And could it help us think of ways to make the fight against life-threatening infections more sustainable?The antibiotic era is less than a century old. Alexander Fleming first noticed the activity of a strange mould against bacteria in 1928, but it wasn’t until the late 1930s that the active ingredient – penicillin – was isolated. A daily dose was just 60mg, about the same as a pinch of salt. For several years it was so scarce it was worth more than gold. But after production was scaled up during the second world war, it ended up costing less than the bottle it came in.It’s hard to imagine a more perfect anti-capitalist commodity than a product whose value depletes every time you use itThis abundance did more than tackle infectious diseases. Just as the energy from fossil fuels transformed society, antibiotics allowed the entire edifice of modern medicine to be built. Consider surgery: cutting people open and breaking the protective barrier of the skin gives bacteria the chance to swarm into the body’s internal tissues. Before antibiotics, even the simplest procedures frequently resulted in fatal blood poisoning. After them, so much more became possible: heart surgery, intestinal surgery, transplantation. Then there’s cancer: chemotherapy suppresses the immune system, making bacterial infections one of the most widespread complications of treatment.The effects of antibiotics have rippled out even further: they made factory farming possible, both by reducing disease among animals kept in close quarters, and by increasing their weight through complex effects on metabolism. They’re one of the reasons for the huge increase in meat consumption since the 1950s, with all its concomitant welfare and environmental effects.Despite the crisis of resistance, antibiotics remain cheap compared with other medicines. Partly – as with fossil fuels – this is because the negative consequences of their use (so-called externalities) are not priced in. And like coal, oil and gas, antibiotics lead to pollution. Onerecent studyestimated that 31% of the 40 most used antibiotics worldwide enter rivers. Once they’re out there, they increase levels of resistance in environmental bacteria: one study of soil from the Netherlands showed that the incidence of some antibiotic-resistant genes hadincreased by more than 15 timessince the 1970s. Another source of pollution is manufacturing, particularly in countries such as India. In Hyderabad, where factories produce huge amounts of antibiotics for the global market, scientists have found that the wastewater contains levels of some antibiotics that are a million times higher than elsewhere.Like the climate crisis, antibiotic resistance has laid global inequalities bare. Some high-income countries have taken steps to decrease antibiotic use, but only after benefiting from their abundance in the past. That makes it hard for them to take a moral stand against their use in other places, a dilemma that mirrors the situation faced by post-industrial nations urging developing nations to forgo the economic benefits of cheap energy.This may be where the similarities end. While we look forward to the day when fossil fuels are phased out completely, that’s clearly not the case with antibiotics, which are always going to be part of medicine’s “energy mix”. After all, most deaths from bacterial disease worldwide are due to lack of access to antibiotics, not resistance. What we are going to need to do is make our approach to development and use much more sustainable. Currently, many pharmaceutical companies have abandoned the search for new antibiotics: it’s hard to imagine a more perfect anti-capitalist commodity than a product whose value depletes every time you use it.That means we need alternative models. One proposal is for governments to fund an international institute that develops publicly owned antibiotics, rather than relying on the private sector; another is to incentivise development with generously funded prizes for antibiotic discovery. And to address the issue of overuse, economists have suggested that health authorities could run “subscription” models that remove the incentive to sell lots of antibiotics. In one pilot scheme in England, two companies arebeing paid a set amountper year by the NHS, regardless of how much of their product is actually used.Finally, we have to remember that antibiotics aren’t the only game in town. Supporting other, “renewable” approaches means we get to use the ones we do have for longer. Vaccines are vital to disease prevention – with every meningitis, diphtheria or whooping cough vaccine meaning a potential course of antibiotics forgone. And the 20th century’s largest reductions in infectious disease occurred not because of antibiotics, but thanks to better sanitation and public health. (Even in the 2000s, the threat of MRSA was addressed with tried-and-tested methods such as handwashing and cleaning protocols – not new antibiotics.) Given that antibiotics themselves emerged unexpectedly, we should also be investing more in blue-skies research.Just as we no longer burn coal without a thought for the consequences, the era of carefree antibiotic use is now firmly in the past. In both cases, the idea that there wouldn’t be a reckoning was always an illusion. But as with our slow waking up to the reality of the climate crisis, coming to appreciate the limits of our love affair with antibiotics may ultimately be no bad thing.Liam Shaw is a biologist at the University of Oxford, and author ofDangerous Miracle(Bodley Head).Further readingBeing Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the Endby Atul Gawande (Profile, £11.99)Infectious: Pathogens and How We Fight Themby John S Tregoning (Oneworld, £10.99)Deadly Companions: How Microbes Shaped our Historyby Dorothy H Crawford (Oxford, £12.49)Explore more on these topicsAntibioticsThe big ideaMedicineHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Like the idea of a more sustainable diet? Here is the answer - and baked beans are only the startRachel DixonSun 17 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 17 Aug 2025 16.34 EDTShareWorried about rising food prices, your diet’s carbon footprint or whether you’re eating healthily enough? Believe it or not, there could be a magic bullet: pulses.According to a studyby the University of Reading, published in the European Journal of Nutrition in March, adults who eat more pulses – dried beans, peas and lentils – have a higher intake of nutrients including fibre, folate and vitamins C and E; minerals such as iron, zinc and magnesium; and a lower intake of saturated fat and sugar. Similar results have been found inAmerican,AustralianandCanadianresearch.The UK study also found that eating pulses was associated with a more sustainable diet. In her book,Pulse: Modern Recipes with Beans, Peas & Lentils, Eleanor Maidment explains that growing pulses has a positive effect on the environment. “Many are ‘nitrogen fixers’, meaning they have the ability to convert nitrogen in the atmosphere into a form that can be used in the soil, making it more fertile for other crops,” she writes. Justine Butler, the head of research atViva!, says: “The lowest-impact beef still creates six times the greenhouse gases anduses 36 times more landper gram of protein than peas.”View image in fullscreenBroad beans, fresh from the pod.Photograph: Kjerstin Gjengedal/Getty ImagesPulses are filling and good value but, say the Reading researchers, the typical British adult eats only about 15g a day, with the average household spending just £1.68 on pulses a week. UK guidelines state that80g of pulses(about a third of a tin) counts as one of your five a day.The University of Reading study is part of theRaising the Pulseproject, which aims to increase pulse consumption to improve public and planetary health. One of its strategies is addingfava bean (dried broad bean) flourto white bread – similar to asuccessful programme in Denmarkusing rye flour to increase wholegrain consumption. Prof Julie Lovegrove, the director of the Hugh Sinclair Unit of Human Nutrition at the University of Reading, says: “These foods are not only nutritious but also incredibly versatile, affordable and sustainable.”If you want to start eating more pulses, here are 15 things you need to know.You don’t have to cook pulses for hours.“Don’t be put off by the idea that you have to soak dried pulses in advance,” says Maidment. “I am rarely organised enough to do so, but thankfully there’s a huge range of jarred and canned varieties that require no prep and are hugely convenient. If you can afford to spend a bit more, then jarred varieties have the edge over canned in terms of flavour and texture. Brands such asBold Bean Co,BrindisaorBelazuare consistently excellent.”But batch-cooking dried pulses is the best value.Jenny Chandler, the author ofSuper PulsesandPulse, soaks and cooks a big pot of pulses once a week. “You will finish up with well over double their volume – it’s a really economical way to have a ready supply. They will keep in their cooking water for five days in the fridge and you can freeze any leftovers. Use them in salads, soups, purees, curries, stews and even puddings – they will become the bedrock of your cooking.”View image in fullscreenDal tadka, a north Indian delicacy.Photograph: jayk7/Getty ImagesPulses are for everyone.“You do not have to be vegetarian or vegan to enjoy pulses – far from it,” says Maidment. “We shouldallbe eating more pulses. For instance, in a traybake, I’ll use one chicken thigh per person instead of two, and add a can of chickpeas or butter beans. I often add a can of lentils to bolognese. You’re still getting filling protein, but with the added benefits of gut-friendly fibre and numerous other minerals, vitamins and antioxidants.”View image in fullscreenA veggie burger made from black beans, sweet potato and brown rice.Photograph: LindasPhotography/Getty ImagesThey make meals go much further.“Most pulses are relatively cheap and quite mild in taste, making them ideal for bulking out soups, stews and curries without affecting the original flavour,” says Maidment. “You can often use different varieties interchangeably, depending on what you have to hand.” Chandler adds a handful of cooked pulses to all sorts of dishes. “Throwing a few chickpeas or cannellini beans into a simple tomato sauce with pasta not only ups the nutritional profile, but also keeps you feeling full for much longer,” she says.Baked beans are just the beginning.“By far the most eaten pulse in the UK is the haricot bean due to its starring role in tinned baked beans,” says Maidment. “Butter beans, cannellini beans, black beans and kidney beans are also popular, but there is a huge variety of beans to try. For instance, flageolet beans are delicate, pale-green beans popular in French cooking – try them in a slow-braised lamb stew with garlic, thyme and white wine.” Chandler loves yin yang beans, AKA calypso or orca beans. “These black and white beans are utterly beautiful and taste wonderful in chilli,” she says.But beans on toast still rules.“My favourite pulse-based dish is garlicky beans and bitter greens on toast, topped with chilli oil,” saysJoe Yonan, the author ofCool Beans.View image in fullscreenBaked beans on toast.Photograph: Anna Denisova/Getty ImagesYou can make (almost) anything with chickpeas.“The chickpea is my favourite pulse, for its versatility,” says Yonan. “It is the basis of hummus, the best dip on the planet. It’s great in a coronation chickpea sandwich, and it holds its shape in salads and stews.” For a snack, Yonan mixes cooked chickpeas with olive oil and spices (such as za’atar, Chinese five spice, chaat masala or smoked paprika) and roasts them in the oven for an hour at 150C/300F. “I then turn off the oven but leave them in there to completely cool – it dries them out and makes them really satisfyingly crunchy.” He also uses chickpea (AKA gram) flour to makefarinataorsocca, a savoury pancake;panisse(chickpea fries); and bhajis and pakoras. “Sometimes I use it as a base for a sort of non-traditional, don’t-tell-the-Italians pizza.”Lentils cook more quicklythan most pulses.Red split lentils are especially quick, cooking in about 15 minutes. Lentils don’t need soaking, but it does reduce the cooking time. Maidment likes to experiment with different dals. “Regional Indian dals can be made with a range of lentils – yellow moong, black urad, chana dal – each bringing a slightly different flavour and texture,” says Maidment. But she also has a soft spot for tinned lentils. “I often roast drained, tinned lentils with olive oil and crushed garlic to boost their flavour and add crispness before throwing them into a salad – perhaps ricotta and prosciutto, or chopped fresh and sun-dried tomatoes, mozzarella and basil.”Pulses make delicious dips.“Hummus is the classic, but you can blend most pulses into dips,” says Maidment. “Fava, a fabulous Greek split yellow pea dip, is absolutely worth making.” Blend cooked split yellow peas with caramelised onions and garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, salt and a little of the beans’ cooking liquor or water to make.Pulse liquid has many uses.“Jarred and canned pulses are usually stored in a liquid known as aquafaba,” says Maidment. “It can be great for adding creaminess to savoury dishes or used as an egg alternative in baking.” She advises checking the salt levels and ingredients list before using – some pulses have added preserving and firming agents.Who needs quinoa? 17 overlooked and affordable superfoods, from peas and potatoes to popcorn and even sugarRead moreBlack beans make the best veggie burgers, says Yonan. The Guardian’sMeera Sodha agrees. She mashes a drained tin of black beans with breadcrumbs, garlic and onion powders, chipotle paste, dijon mustard, tomato ketchup and a splash of aquafaba, shapes them into patties, then fries them in olive oil until crispy.British pulses are having a revival.Maidment and Chandler both recommend carlin peas, pleasingly also known as black badgers, which are a heritage British pulse. They are available dried and cooked from companies such asHodmedod’s.“They’re small, nutty brown peas, and make a great alternative to chickpeas, with a similarly impressive nutrient profile,” says Maidment. She roasts cooked carlin peas until crispy, then adds them to salads such as quinoa, broccoli and halloumi. Chandler uses them in dips and curries, and to make a version of refried beans. “They’re much more versatile than yellow or green dried peas as they don’t have such a pronounced ‘pea’ flavour,” she says. In the US, Yonan suggests the lady pea, a spherical white bean that is popular in southern cuisine.Pulses make great protein shakes.“A handful of cooked pulses added into a smoothie will give it a great creamy texture and make it more nourishing,” says Chandler. She adds black beans or borlotti beans to dark berry smoothies, and chickpeas, cannellini beans or butter beans to green smoothies.View image in fullscreenA plate of mochi, the Japanese dessert.Photograph: TorriPhoto/Getty ImagesPulse-based pasta is worth a try.There is an increasing range of high-fibre pasta made from pulse flour: peas, lentils, chickpeas, black beans, mung beans … Chandler enjoys this alternative pasta, but says she doesn’t use it in classical Italian dishes: “I may use it in a pasta salad, say, or team it with a blue cheese and walnut sauce.” Yonan agrees that pulse pasta is best paired with “pungent flavours – super-garlicky or spicy”.Pulses aren’t just for savoury dishes.Yonan makes a chocolate and chickpea tart, and adds adzuki beans to brownies. “Adzuki beans are used in a lot of Asian desserts, such as mochi and ice-cream,” he says. Maidment prefers to use kidney beans in her brownies, while Chandler has a recipe for a simple chocolate and cannellini bean mousse. Drain and retain the liquid from a tin of cannellini beans. Blitz the beans with 150g of melted dark chocolate and an optional tablespoon of cocoa powder. Whisk the liquid for five to 10 minutes, until frothy. Fold into the melted chocolate and bean mix, and sweeten with a couple of tablespoons of maple or date syrup. Chill the mix before eating, perhaps topped with some chopped stem ginger in syrup, or served with fresh raspberries.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

You don’t have the cards right now.”Trump, after his summit on Friday with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, has reportedly endorsed the Kremlin’s one-sided plan to end the war inUkraine. It includes Kyiv giving up territory that Russia has been unable to seize and no ceasefire until a final deal has been agreed.Posting on Truth Social, Trump accused the media of misrepresenting his “great meeting in Alaska” – an encounter widely seen as a victory for Putin and a humiliation for the US president. On Sunday, Trump claimed he had made “big progress” onRussia, without giving details.European leaders on Monday will reaffirm their support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and argue against a land swap plan that rewards Russian aggression. They will also seek further clarity on what security guarantees the US is willing to offer in the event of a settlement.Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s envoy to international organisations in Vienna, said early on Monday that Russia agrees that any future Ukraine peace agreement must provide security guarantees to Kyiv, but added that Russia “has equal right to expect that Moscow will also get efficient security guarantees”.In a conciliatory statement announcing his visit to Washington, Starmer praised Trump for his “efforts to end Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine”. At the same time, Starmer reasserted Europe’s red lines. He said the “path to peace” could not be decided without Zelenskyy and said Russia should be “squeezed” with further sanctions.Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN that Putin had agreed for the first time for the US and Europe to provide protection to Ukraine as part of a deal. This would be outside the auspices of Nato but would be the equivalent of the alliance’s article 5 self-defence pact, Witkoff indicated.Ukraine mapSpeaking in Brussels alongside von der Leyen, Zelenskyy rejected Putin’s latest demand for more land. The Russians want Ukraine to cede the entirety of the Donetsk region, including a number of Ukrainian-controlled cities, as well as Luhansk province, which Moscow mostly occupies.Zelenskyy said Putin had been trying for 12 years to fully capture Donetsk oblast, without success. He said the current frontline should form the basis for negotiations, adding that territory could only be discussed in a three-way format with Kyiv at the table. A powerful Ukrainian army was the best security guarantee, he added.Starmer, Merz and Macron hosted a video call with European allies on Sunday before their Washington trip. “Ukraine must be a steel porcupine, indigestible for potential invaders,” von der Leyen said, stressing there could be no Russian-mandated limits on Ukraine’s armed forces.According to the New York Times, Trump told European leaders he believed a peace deal could be negotiated if Zelenskyy agreed to give up the Donetsk region. They were unconvinced. The EU shares the Ukrainian view that Putin would use any new territory as a springboard for a further attack.Two sources with direct knowledge of the talks in Alaska told the Guardian that Putin had offered to freeze the frontline in southern Ukraine if he got Donbas. The plan would mean thousands of civilians would be forced to abandon their homes in key eastern cities such as Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, which have withstood years of Russian attacks.Before Friday’s Alaska summit, Trump said he wanted an immediate ceasefire. Over the weekend, however, the US president endorsed Russia’s demand for a peace deal first and a truce second. Ceasefires “often times do not hold up”, Trump saidin a social media post.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump greets Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersTrump also appears to have dropped his threat of economic penalties on countries that buy Russian oil if Moscow refuses a deal. He has repeatedly threatened to impose secondary sanctions, setting various deadlines and failing to follow through when they expire.Trump on Sunday expressed his frustration at recent media coverage. “It’s incredible how the Fake News violently distorts the TRUTH when it comes to me,” he posted. “There is NOTHING I can say or do that would lead them to write or report honestly about me. I had a great meeting in Alaska on Biden’s stupid War, a war that should have never happened!!!”He added: “If I got Russia to give up Moscow as part of the Deal, the Fake News, and their PARTNER, the Radical Left Democrats, would say I made a terrible mistake and a very bad deal.”Speaking to the BBC, the former British defence secretary Ben Wallace described Trump’s apparent support for Putin’s demands as 1930s-style “appeasement”. He said the strategy – with pressure piled on Ukraine to agree – may save lives “in the short term” but in the long term “would probably put us at greater risk”.Ajoint statementissued by European leaders on Saturday said they were “ready to work with US President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy towards a trilateral summit with European support” but “it will be up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory. International borders must not be changed by force.”They said they welcomed “President Trump’s efforts to stop the killing in Ukraine, end Russia’s war of aggression, and achieve just and lasting peace”.View image in fullscreenThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, the president of the European Council, António Costa, the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, and the France defence minister, Sébastien Lecornu, attend a video conference with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, last week.Photograph: Philippe Magoni/EPAZelenskyy said ina statementafter his conversations with Trump and the European leaders: “The positions are clear. A real peace must be achieved, one that will be lasting, not just another pause between Russian invasions. Killings must stop as soon as possible, the fire must cease both on the battlefield and in the sky, as well as against our port infrastructure. All Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilians must be released, and the children abducted by Russia must be returned.”Donald Trump reportedly delivered letter from first lady to Vladimir PutinRead moreOlga Tokariuk, a fellow at the Centre for European Policy Analysis, said Zelenskyy had a “difficult task” in Washington. He had to “demonstrate that Ukraine wants peace, but not at any cost, to ensure Ukraine still gets US support,” she said. At the same time he could not make concessions “unacceptable for Ukrainians”.Trump was unlikely to treat Zelenskyy with the “same friendliness as Putin”, she predicted. “The US under Trump is no longer willing to stand by its democratic allies, while instead it is embracing the tyrants,” she added.Additional reporting byPeter WalkerExplore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpKeir StarmerEmmanuel MacronFriedrich MerznewsShareReuse this content"

Stop the war!” shouted the vast crowd, which had converged on the so-called Hostage Square in Tel Aviv plaza – a focal point for protesters throughout the war.The Hostage and Missing Families Forum, the initiator of the day of protest, estimated that about 500,000 people joined the demonstration in Tel Aviv – a figure not confirmed by the police. “We demand a comprehensive and achievable agreement and an end to the war,” said Einav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan and a leading figure of the protest movement.Israeli media ‘completely ignored’ Gaza starvation – is that finally changing?Read more“We demand what is rightfully ours – our children. The Israeli government has transformed a just war into a pointless war.”National media published a video message by Matan Zangauker on Sunday, in which the hostage, weak and emaciated, addressed his family and told them he missed them. The video was filmed by Hamas and found in Gaza by the army, the family said.“This is probably the last minute we have to save the hostages,” demonstrator Ofir Penso, 50, told AFP.The protests come more than a week after Israel’s security cabinetapproved plans to capture Gaza City, 22 months into a war that has created a dire humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territory.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum campaign group vowed on Sunday that protesters would “shut down the country” with the goal of bringing back the hostages and ending the war.Throughout Israel, demonstrators blocked roads, set tyres on fire and clashed with the police. More than 30 protesters were arrested, law enforcement said.Netanyahu criticised the protesters, saying their actions “not only harden Hamas’s position and draw out the release of our hostages, but also ensure that the horrors of 7 October will reoccur”.View image in fullscreenVast crowds in Tel Aviv demanded the government abandon its decision to fully occupy Gaza City and sign a prisoner exchange agreement.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesEgypt said in recent days mediators were leading a renewed push to secure a 60-day truce deal that includes hostages being released, after the last round of talks in Qatar ended without a breakthrough.Some Israeli government members who oppose any deal with Hamas criticised Sunday’s demonstrations. Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, decried a “perverse and harmful campaign that plays into the hands of Hamas” and calls for “surrender”.However, Benny Gantz, an opposition leader, condemned the government for “attacking the families of the hostages” while “bearing responsibility for the captivity of their children by Hamas for nearly two years”.Israel’s military offensive has killed at least 61,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry, most of them civilians.

So I think it is the famous phrase – don’t panic,” he said.The former cabinet minister saidLabourfaced not only a terrible economic inheritance, but fundamental damage to the fabric of democracy by the previous Conservative governments, primarily Boris Johnson.“Johnson polluted British politics and although he’s left the stage, that pollution carries on, and has been very profound,” he said. “People look at the first Blair period with kind of rose-tinted spectacles. It didn’t always feel that it was easy at the time, but the inheritance was much easier.”Straw said there had at least been an appreciation in 1997 that his predecessors had been competent people. “These people [in the last Tory government] were not competent. They couldn’t do the job. In the space of four years, I think there were five home secretaries,” he said.Straw, who was foreign secretary during the invasion of Iraq, which he later admitted had been a mistake, said he had spent time in the run-up to last year’s general election with David Lammy and dismissed the idea Labour that had not been adequately prepared to enter government. “The issues that they’re dealing with have become much more intense,”he said.“I was talking to someone who worked for years in the Treasury, he was saying how these ministers are head and shoulders above what he described as the Fourth XI of the previous government.”Straw represented his Blackburn constituency for 33 years, and has often talked about how he had been proud that a Labour government had helped to heal racial and social divisions in Britain, which many in Westminster now feel have fractured with tensions exploited by Farage and others.View image in fullscreenJack Straw campaigning in Blackburn in 2005. He represented the Lancashire constituency for 33 years.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianHis seat is now held by Adnan Hussain, a pro-Gaza independent. Straw, who until recently still chaired a youth centre in the town and still chairs a chain of academies including Muslim faith schools in Blackburn, said it was hardly surprising given the strength of feeling about Gaza.He said he knew Hussain and thought he was “throughly decent” and added: “Politics there has always been complicated.”But he said it was clear that politics was fracturing in a way that would start to produce unpredictable results – particularly under first past the post, which he favoured abolishing.“The party needs to think about that,” he said of electoral reform. “And it would get through, I think people understand that in a multi-party situation, first past the post is potentially unfair. It can produce really quirky results. Farage could come through on that.”Could he envisage Farage as PM? “There is a chance. I think it’s a small chance, smaller than he thinks. The Tory party appears to me to just be collapsing,” he said.Although he admitted he did not expect such a plummet in popularity for Starmer and Labour, he urged the party to remain calm. “In 2000of course we lost the mayoral election to Ken Livingstone; that was regarded as a great humiliation for Labour.“So, not being Pollyanna-ish about this, but my instinct is that things will gradually improve.”He said he hoped a sceptical UK public would begin to make the connection between Starmer’s successful diplomacy,especially with Donald Trump, and the kind of statesman he could be at home.“The way Starmer has navigated the challenge from America has been extraordinary,” he said. “This government has made missteps, which all governments do, and not least about things like [welfare].“But at some stage I think that people will start to make the connection between the stalwart international statesman and Starmer the domestic prime minister, and realise that we’re talking about the same person and the character.”View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer with Donald Trump. ‘The way Starmer has navigated the challenge from America has been extraordinary,’ says Straw.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersIn one of his first acts as home secretary Straw was the architect of theHuman Rights Act1998, incorporating the European convention on human rights (ECHR) into UK domestic law.His ruthless approach to crime and law and order was often contrasted with his commitment to the act – which survived threats of abolition under the Conservatives.Shabana Mahmood: justice secretary and rising star of the Labour partyRead moreBut Straw has become increasingly sceptical of the sweeping reach of the Strasbourg court – and said the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, should consider legislating to stop such an interventionist approach on asylum, which rightwing parties have denounced.“I’m not remotely in the position of people on the right who say just abolish the Human Rights Act and withdraw from the ECHR,” he said.“But we need to look at two things. One, if you can persuade the court in Strasbourg that they have to be less interventionist, and that if they’re not, they will write themselves out of the script.“The second thing is considering ways in which you progressively decouple the Human Rights Act from Strasbourg. The Human Rights Act says British courts should ‘take account’ of the decisions of the ECHR. But that’s basically been interpreted as ‘to follow’. And that was never, never our intention.”He said the court should be “concentrating on the original purposes, which was to stop really serious breaches of rights, not everyday asylum issues.”As home secretary, it was also Straw’s Terrorism Act that introduced the proscription of terror groups – used against al-Qaida and others. At the time, addressing concerns that it would affect civil disobedience by organisations such as Greenpeace, Straw said there was “no evidence whatever” they would be affected.But he said now he was fully behind the decision to proscribePalestine Action, because of the attack on military planes at RAF Brize Norton.“This was a very, very serious breach of the security of the base. And if I’d have been in Yvette’s position, which I have been, I would have done exactly what she’s done,” he said.“You can’t proscribe on a whim. And you need clear evidence. Much of that evidence is based on intelligence, but also just the fact that they are attacking our military assets and military bases. I think we certainly would have taken the action that she has taken.”But Straw said he had been delighted to see Starmer take the decision to recognise a Palestinian state – saying it was “barefaced cheek” of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to say it was playing into the hands of Hamas.“I applaud the decision whichKeir Starmerhas taken. I’m really glad that he’s done that. I think that the conditions imposed were quite skilful,” he said.Straw said he did not know yet whether the Israeli offensive in Gaza would ultimately be deemed a genocide. “Whatever label you put on it, it’s absolutely amoral and unacceptable and just terrible.Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerReform UKJack StrawNigel FarageProtestIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Patients can access them through a referral from their GP or clinical teams at hospitals.The government has revealed that 100 CDCs are open 12 hours a day, seven days a week – an increase of 37 CDCs with such opening hours compared with July 2024 – with the hope that the service will allow patients greater and speedier access to diagnosis.The move to provide more convenient care is part of the government’splan for changewhich, it says, aims to transform healthcare and make the NHS fit for the future, with an expansion of community-based services a key part of the approach.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said: “This government is determined to offer healthcare that fits around working people’s lives and not the other way around.“From early morning MRI scans to late evening blood tests, we’re meeting patients where they need it most by extending the operating hours for community diagnostic centres and putting patients first.”View image in fullscreenWes Streeting said the government wanted healthcare to fit around working people’s lives.Photograph: Ben Montgomery/Getty Images for ActivateThe government has also committed to building up to five more CDCs in 2025-26 and is planning to extend opening hours for all CDCs at evenings and on weekends.It saidlatest datashowed the NHS delivered more than 1.6 million more tests and scans from July 2024 to June 2025 compared with the same time the previous year.Sarah Sleet, the chief executive at Asthma + Lung UK, welcomed the expansion of opening hours for CDCs.“Making it easier for people to access tests close to home is crucial to improve diagnosis rates for lung conditions,” she said.Extra cancer scans for women with dense breasts could save 700 lives a year – UK studyRead more“Receiving an early and accurate diagnosis is essential for treating and managing someone’s lung condition, it can lead to a reduction in hospital admissions and even lengthen their life. We hope this focus on neighbourhood diagnostics will lead to quicker diagnosis of lung conditions, the UK’s third biggest killer, at a time when a historic lack of access to tests is leaving tens of thousands of people breathless and anxious.”Laura Challinor, the senior policy manager at Blood Cancer UK, also welcomed the expansion of out-of-hours appointments but said further action was needed given blood cancer was the UK’s third biggest cancer killer and survival rates were lagging behind those of similar countries.“For CDCs to be of most benefit to people with blood cancer, we also want to see a commitment to end regional variation in diagnostic testing practice, including full blood count (FBC) tests available for those presenting with non-specific symptoms, and timed diagnostic pathways developed for blood cancers,” she said.Charlotte Beardmore, the executive director of professional policy at the Society of Radiographers, said CDCs offered patients improved access to routine imaging investigations, while timely diagnostics through CDCs were essential to ensure patients could access treatments sooner.But while Beardmore said the location, and extended opening hours of CDCs, could make it easier for patients to attend, she stressed a growing demand for imaging meant the government must invest in the radiography workforce.“This means investment in newNHSposts for radiographers to ensure all CDCs offer the capability, flexibility and the range of services for patients in their local community,” she said. “Without radiographers CDCs cannot function.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthHealth policyEnglandWes StreetingnewsShareReuse this content"

Its executives were paid a total of £212m, according to the analysis.The High Pay Centre, which campaigns for fairer pay, found that the highest paid chief executives were the current and former boss of Melrose, Peter Dilnot and Simon Peckham respectively, who between them took home nearly £59m for the last financial year, mostly thanks to long-term incentive payments.Melrose sparked outragelast Juneby handing out a reward pot worth more than £175m to 21 current and former executives in shares under a bonus scheme set up in 2020.The lion’s share was received by Peckham, one of the business’s co-founders, along with the company’s former chair Christopher Miller and the former finance director Geoffrey Martin.The use of long-term incentive payments (LTIPs) by large listed companies rose in the last financial year, with 84 out of 100 chief executives paid an LTIP in the last financial year, compared with 81% a year earlier.Pascal Soriot, the chief executive ofpharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, who spent the last two years as the FTSE 100’s highest paid boss, was pushed into third place in the last financial year after earning £14.7m.Soriot is now ranked behind theMelroseexecutives as well as the current and former bosses of the education publisher Pearson on the High Pay Centre’s league table. Andy Bird, Pearson’s current chief executive, and his predecessor Omar Abbosh, together earned almost £19m in the last financial year.The number of FTSE 100 companies paying their leaders £10m or more increased in the past year, rising from 10 to 13, at a time when Britain’s cash-strapped households continue tofeel the squeeze of the cost of living crisis, and the Bank of England has warned that rising food prices could fuel further inflation.The figures also revealed a gender pay gap at the top of corporate Britain, as female leaders of the largest listed companies still tend to earn less than their male counterparts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We only add words where we think they’ll have staying power.”Older generations and those not on TikTok will have just to get used to words such as skibidi. Children often use it to add emphasis to statements. It became popular thanks to Skibidi Toilet – a viral animated video that began on YouTube featuring human heads protruding from lavatories.The Cambridge Dictionary defines skibidi as “a word that can have different meanings such as ‘cool’ or ‘bad’, or can be used with no real meaning as a joke’, an example of its use is: ‘What the skibidi are you doing?’”People older than generation Alpha tend to greet the use of the word with despair . The US writer and artistLee Escobedo wrote in the Guardianearlier this year: “Skibidi brainrot encapsulates a generation fluent in irony but starved for meaning. This kind of hyper-chaotic media serves as both entertainment and an ambient worldview for young men raised online. Their minds normalise prank-as-expression.”The tradwife phenomenon, which dates to a least 2020, has also beenwidely criticised. It refers to socially conservative influencers who celebrate looking after their husbands, children and homes and post about it onTikTok, Instagram and YouTube. The dictionary definition says a tradwife is “especially one who posts on social media”.Delulu, an abbreviation of delusional, is less controversial, but has become associated with a post-truth world where personal beliefs are more important than reality. Its dictionary entry defines it as “believing things that are not real or true, usually because you choose to”.Delulu emerged more than 10 years ago as an insult directed at obsessive K-pop followers fans to question their belief that they would date their idols. The term“delulu is the solulu”for manifesting your wishes has been viewed billions of times on TikTok. The phrase“delulu with no solulu”was used earlier this year by Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to attack his opponents in parliament.“Broligarchy”, a term for the tech industry leaders on whose platforms many of these new words are spreading, also makes it into the dictionary.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was an honour to have directed him.”Stamp became one of British cinema’s glamour figures in its most fashionable decade, scoring early high-profile roles in Billy Budd and The Collector for the directors Peter Ustinov and William Wyler respectively.His relationship with the model Jean Shrimpton in the mid-60s ensured both were key faces of the decade. Stamp became one of its most photographed people and a significant part of the new wave of working-class actors and musicians that fuelled Britain’s pre-eminent position in the entertainment industry.View image in fullscreenTerence Stamp in The Limey.Photograph: United Archives GmbH/AlamyTerence Stamp: ‘I was in my prime, but when the 60s ended, I ended with it’Read moreBorn in Stepney in east London, Stamp grew up the son of tugboat sailor in the slightly less tough area of Plaistow, and won a scholarship to drama school. His brother Chris also became a high-profile figure as manager of music acts including The Who and Jimi Hendrix.After meeting during a tour of The Long and the Short and the Tall, Stamp shared a flat with his fellow up-and-coming actor Michael Caine, whom Stamp later described as his guru.His first major screen role was in 1962 in Billy Budd, for which he received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. This brought him to the attention of Hollywood and he was given the lead role in Wyler’s 1965 adaptation of John Fowles’s thriller novel The Collector.View image in fullscreenTerence Stamp and model Jean ‘The Shrimp’ Shrimpton, London, 1964.  The couple were regarded as the ‘faces of the 60s’ by Vogue magazine.Photograph: Terry O’Neill/Iconic ImagesStamp’s subsequent acting career in the 1960s was erratic. He lost out to Sean Connery for James Bond and was replaced in the lead role of Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow-Up by David Hemmings. However, he starred opposite Antonioni’s favoured star Monica Vitti in Modesty Blaise, directed by Joseph Losey, appeared in Ken Loach’s hard-hitting debut Poor Cow, and starred opposite his former girlfriend Julie Christie in Far from the Madding Crowd, adapted from Thomas Hardy’s novel.View image in fullscreenGuy Pearce, Terence Stamp and Hugo Weaving in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, 1994.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyIn 1968, Stamp appeared in two films for Italian auteurs. Federico Fellini cast him in his section of the three-part omnibus film Spirits of the Dead adapted from Edgar Allan Poe, while Pier Paolo Pasolini gave him the lead role in his allegorical masterpiece Theorem. Stamp later said: “Pasolini told me: ‘A stranger arrives, makes love to everybody, and leaves. This is your part.’ I said: ‘I can do that!’”Stamp’s profile declined sharply at the end of the decade and work dried up. “It was a mystery to me. I was in my prime. When the 1960s ended, I just ended with it,” he said. “I remember my agent telling me: ‘They are all looking for a young Terence Stamp’ … I couldn’t believe it.”View image in fullscreenStamp with Julie Christie in Far from the Madding Crowd.Photograph: Vic/Appia/Rex/ShutterstockHe went to India and stayed on an ashram and was eventually recalled by the film industry with an offer to play the villainous General Zod in Superman: The Movie and Superman II, which were filmed back to back.Stamp later said he had to come to terms with no longer being the lead actor. “I had transmuted myself. I no longer saw myself as a leading man,” he said. “What had happened inside of me enabled me to take the role, and not feel embarrassed or depressed about playing the villain. I just decided I was a character actor now.”Stamp returned to British cinema in the 1980s, starring opposite John Hurt and Tim Roth in Frears’ The Hit, and had a cameo as the devil in Neil Jordan’s literary horror film The Company of Wolves. He subsequently alternated safe-bet Hollywood roles with more adventurous work. In 1994 he played the trans cabaret performer Bernadette Bassenger in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, for which he received Bafta and Golden Globe nominations, followed by a lead role in Steven Soderbergh’s revenge thriller The Limey.The subsequent decades saw more high-profile castings as interest grew in his earlier work, including roles in Star Wars Episode I – The Phantom Menace, Wanted and The Adjustment Bureau, while another juicy British cinema role came his way opposite Vanessa Redgrave in Song for Marion. More recently he appeared in Big Eyes and Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children for Tim Burton, and his most recently released film credit was Last Night in Soho, the retro-inspired horror thriller directed by Edgar Wright.Despite a string of high-profile relationships, including with Christie and Shrimpton, Stamp married only once, in 2002, to Elizabeth O’Rourke. They divorced in 2008.Explore more on these topicsTerence StampShareReuse this content"

Workers would routinely “hit pigs with boards, paddles and their fists, deliberately targeting areas such as their snout and eyes”.One piglet, which “showed clear signs of extreme pain”, was reportedly left dying for 33 hours as other piglets cannibalised an open wound. “He had no escape from being eaten alive,” said the narrator of the film published on the AJP website, claiming that workers ignored the pig’s squeals of distress.“During our filming, Somerby Top [Farm] was audited by Red Tractor,” the narrator said. “Yet just two weeks later, when we returned, we were met with the same squalid conditions.”Red Tractor said it could not verify this, but responded to the “deeply distressing” footage by suspending Somerby Top Farm’s certification with “immediate effect” and referring the farm to the government animal welfare regulator, the Animal and Plant Health Agency.“Red Tractor is conducting a thorough review of both current and historical footage, compliance and staffing on the farm,” the organisation said in a statement. “The farm will remain unassured if Red Tractor is not satisfied our standards are met.”They said footage had only been presented to Red Tractor this month. “This delay is concerning and suggests that these activists have prioritised ideology over protecting animal welfare. Red Tractor provides a free anonymous whistleblowing service and we actively encourage anyone with concerns to raise these so that we can investigate immediately.”In a statement, Cranswick said the health and welfare of its pigs was the company’s “highest priority”: “We are horrified to see the unacceptable treatment of pigs at Somerby Top Farm, [which was] historically recorded and brought to our attention this week.”The company added that since May, when covert footage filmed by AJP showed apparent abuse at another of its farms,North Moor Farm, it has installed CCTV at all its indoor pig farms, recruited five new welfare officers, retrained all its farm workers and commissioned an independent veterinarian-led review across all its farms.It said it had launched an investigation as soon as the AJP shared the footage: “The staff involved are no longer with the business.”Morrisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Water companies and the government prayed desperately for rain as reservoirs ran low and the groundwater was slowly drained off.Contingency plans were drafted to ban businesses from using water; hotel swimming pools would have been drained, ponds allowed to dry up, offices to go uncleaned. If the lack of rainfall had continued for another year, it was possible that taps could have run dry.That, however, was just a taster of what could come down the line. On Tuesday, the government announced a“nationally significant” water shortagein England, which means the whole country is at risk of running out if the dry weather continues. People across England are already banned from using hosepipes, with more restrictions probable over coming months. The UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH), an independent research institute, has warned of exceptionally low river flows. Reservoirs are also at extremely low levels and groundwater is dwindling.View image in fullscreenThe dried grass of Greenwich Park, London, during the drought of 2022, when contingency plans included draining hotel swimming pools.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyDroughts are generally two-year events. A year of dry weather means water supplies are running out – that is what is happening now. Things really come to a head if the following year does not bring above average rainfall. That is when the shortages start to bite, with farmers unable to irrigate and households and businesses hit with sweeping restrictions. With reservoirs at record lows and stream flows exceptionally low, England is desperate for rain.Forecasts indicate that by 2055 England’spublic water supplycould be short by 5bn litres a day without urgent action to future-proof resources, the equivalent to more than a third of the supplies available today. The effect on the economy will be profoundly negative. The thinktank Public First has estimated that the economic cost of water scarcity could be £8.5bn over this parliament.So how on earth did famously rainswept England, notorious the world over for being green and wet with our national symbol pretty much a furled umbrella, come to this?Britain’s geology and climate means there should be plenty of water. Underground in the south of England the rock is made of chalk, which is very soft and porous. These layers of rock filter rainwater into some of the cleanest water in the world, collecting in huge aquifers that have been tapped by local residents for centuries.Watercompanies now use those aquifers to provide the majority of the drinking water in some parts of the south.View image in fullscreenLyd Well, one of the sources of the River Thames, gushing from subterranean aquifers in the Cotswold Hills near Kemble, Gloucestershire.Photograph: Steve Taylor/AlamyFurther north, the rock underfoot is harder; sandstone and limestone, so lacking the benefits of the chalk aquifer. But it tends to receive more rainfall than the south, so there has generally been plentiful water from the skies to fill the reservoirs on which the northern water companies rely. There are also the rivers that crisscross the country, which (when clean) include gin-clear chalk streams buzzing with mayflies and thronging with salmon and other fish.The UK isone of the rainier placesin Europe. Some areas are wetter than others. In England, the Lake District generally receives an average of 2,000mm of rainfall a year, while in parts of the south-east it is as low as 700mm.Perhaps it is because the country has always had such rich resources, that they have been taken for granted. Running out of water has never really been in question. But with population growth and climate breakdown, this is starting to look like folly.It was in the 17th century that the New River Company began piping water intoLondon’s homesfrom the springs in nearby Hertfordshire for the very rich. Slowly the technology began to spread and grow in popularity. Over the next decades, England’s population would rise dramatically and the water systems of its rapidly growing cities would come under increasing stress.View image in fullscreenA view from Westminster Bridge of the Thames embankment under construction.Photograph: Lordprice Collection/AlamyWhen the Great Stink hit London in 1858 during a heatwave, the civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette had already been commissioned to draw up plans to urgently update the city’s sewage system. Known for his tirelessness, Bazalgette checked every connection himself, making thousands upon thousands of notes, and saved many lives as the system diverted sewage away from the city and into the Thames estuary. Later, treatment centres were added to purify the water.View image in fullscreenJoseph Bazalgette.Photograph: GL Archive/AlamyToday, consumers are used to having water coming out of a tap and they want to use a lot of it. Future generations, who will be dealing with long, dry summers, would probably be shocked at the profligate way clean tap water was used to flush toilets, water gardens and run washing machines. UK households use more water, mostly on showering and bathing, than other comparable European countries,at about 150 litres a day per capita. For France the average is 128, Germany 122 and Spain 120 (although in Italy its 243 litres a day).And the waste starts long before it gets to people’s taps. Water companies in England and Wales lose about 1tn litres of water through leaky pipes each year. The industry has said that about 20% of all treated water is lost to leaks. The water firms have pledged to halve leakages by 2050.Meanwhile, the annual pipe replacement rate is 0.05% a year across all water companies: much of the sewage system in London, for example, has not been significantly updated since Bazalgette and his colleagues installed it in the 19th century.0:58Drone footage shows extremely low reservoir levels in England – videoNo new reservoir has been built in 30 years despite significant population growth and climate breakdown meaning longer, drier summers during which the country desperately needs to store water. The reservoirs England does have are at their lowest levels inat least a decade, just 67.7% full on average. According to Dr Wilson Chan, a hydroclimatologist at UKCEH, “above average rainfall over several months is needed to ease pressures on water resources”.A line graph shows reservoir levels in England from January to December since 2014Was it the privatisation of the water and sewerage industry in 1989 that has led to this situation? England’s water system has beenwidely criticised, and privatisation has been blamed for a lack of investment in infrastructure. Some say this is owing to the water companiespaying out dividendsrather than using the money raised by customer bills solely for investment in infrastructure; others blame a privatised regulated monopoly system that has prioritised low customer bills over investment.Experts have also pointed to the regulatory system. Water company drought plans compel firms to follow a series of steps before they can increaseabstraction, taking more water from reservoirs, rivers and the ground to supply customers, beginning with reducing consumption (a hosepipe ban).View image in fullscreenResidents help clean up after a burst water main floods homes during a hosepipe ban in Swindon.Photograph: Manor Photography/Alamy“Water companies must now take action to follow their drought plans – I will hold them to account if they delay,” says the water minister, Emma Hardy. “We face a growing water shortage in the next decade.”But water companies believe that people hate being told to reduce their water consumption, so avoid hosepipe bans as much as possible. It does not help that bans may also lead to customers giving low satisfaction marks for their company, which are then taken into account by the regulator.The end result of these incentives; unsustainably high levels of abstraction from the natural environment, most of which will not be replaced by rain on the same timescale. Stores of water such as fossil aquifers and chalk streams recharge over centuries. The Environment Agency (EA) assess that 15% of surface water bodies and 27% of groundwater bodies in England have unsustainable levels of abstraction.“We are calling on everyone to play their part and help reduce the pressure on our water environment,” says Helen Wakeham, the EA’s director of water and chair of the National Drought Group.“Water companies must continue to quickly fix leaks and lead the way in saving water.”View image in fullscreenA recently sown rapeseed field in Shropshire is watered to help the seeds germinate during the hot weather this week.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesThis is not just a management problem. As climate breakdown accelerates, rainfall patterns are changing fast, and water will increasingly become less available at certain times of year. As Sir David King, a former UK chief scientific adviser who chairs the Climate Crisis Advisory Group, says: “Drought in England is no longer a warning. It is a clear signal that climate collapse is unravelling our water, food and natural systems right now.“This crisis demands a fundamental shift that places real value on our planet and environment, invests in nature, restores water cycles and transforms how we use every drop. If we rise to this moment we can turn crisis into opportunity, delivering economic resilience, ecological renewal and climate leadership.”The UK is not the only country that is already struggling to deal with changing weather patterns. Almost half of Europeis in drought, withwildfirestearing across the continent and farmers struggling to grow crops.Many of the economies of Southern Europe are dependent on sunny weather that has historically made the region the perfect place to grow vegetables for export. Scientists are concerned that farming in certain southern European countries will becomeless and less viable. More than 90 million people in eastern and southern Africa are facing extreme hunger after record-breaking drought across many areas has led towidespread crop failuresand the death of livestock.View image in fullscreenVillagers raise dust from the dry ground near K’elafo, Ethiopia, in 2023.Photograph: Eduardo Soteras/AFP/Getty ImagesAs the impacts of the climate crisis unfurl around the world, is the UK government awake to the scale of the problem? Nine new reservoirs are in the pipeline to be built before 2050, while there are consultations on reducing demand for water. But this may be too little, too late; many housing developments are on pause because of water scarcity.The first new reservoir planned for Abingdon in Oxfordshire issited in the same placeas the government’s new datacentre zone, leading to fears the water will be used to cool servers rather than serve customers in one of the most water-stressed areas of the UK.Green homes experts have said government building codes for new housing should include rainwater harvesting for internal use such as in lavatories and washing machines. People with gardens could use a water butt in summer, so that clean tap water is not being pumped through a hose into garden plants.View image in fullscreenNot all those living near the proposed Abingdon reservoir are keen on the plan.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverReducing time in the shower by a minute can save water, says Waterwise, while green building groups recommend the use of water-saving shower heads. A recent government commissioned report recommends smart water meters are installed nationally, so households who use sprinklers and fill swimming pools are charged more than those who are more frugal with their use.More broadly, farmers could build reservoirs on their land to reduce the need for irrigation. Nature-based solutions could be used too, such asreleasing beaversthat create dams and hold water in the system, or restoring wetlands.View image in fullscreenA shower passing over the Lake District. ‘We need to use rainwater where we can, such as car washing, gardening, washing pets, filling paddling pools, and flushing the loo.’Photograph: Nigel Wilkins/Alamy“We need to build more resilience into our rivers and their catchment areas with nature-based solutions at scale, such as healthy soils that allow water to filter into the ground and not rush off taking the soil with it; riverside tree planting to provide shade and further slow the flow of water; wetlands to store and slowly release water, and rewiggling streams to raise the water table and purify pollutants,” saysMark Lloyd, the chief executive of theRiversTrust.“We also need to finally implement the use of rainwater rather than drinking water where we can, such as car washing, gardening, washing pets, filling paddling pools and flushing the loo. Other water-stressed countries have used this approach for decades and we need to join that party.”"

Inside Israel, however, the reaction has been markedly different.In a poll conducted in late Julyby the Israel Democracy Institute(IDI), more than three-quarters of Jewish Israelis – 79% – said they were either “not very troubled” or “not troubled at all” by reports of famine and suffering among Gaza’s Palestinian population.View image in fullscreenFourteen-month-old Hazar Arfa, receiving treatment at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, was in critical condition due to severe malnutrition.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesAccording to Anat Saragusti, an expert on the media, the reason is simple: most people in Israel are unaware of those reports because for months they have never seen them.“Until a couple of weeks ago, you could count only a handful of reports from Gaza not filtered by the IDF,” said Saragusti, the head of freedom of the press at the Union of Journalists in Israel. Except for a few newspapers such as the leftwing Haaretz, she said, “all the other mainstream media completely ignored what’s going on on the Palestinian side – the human casualties there, the numbers of children killed in this war. The Israeli audience simply did not see that at all.”In the past few weeks, the growing focus on the issue in the international media has led to some Israeli newspapers and TV channels reporting on hunger in Gaza for the first time, albeit as a debatable issue.Since the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023, public debate in Israel has largely centred on national security, the plight of the Israeli hostages captured by Hamas, and the country’s military goals in Gaza. In that climate, the humanitarian disaster caused by the Israeli assault on Gaza has tended to occupy a marginal place in the minds of many Jewish Israelis, who largely view the conflict as a legitimate act of self-defence in response to Hamas’s attacks – althoughpolls also showa clear majority want a deal with Hamas to end the war in exchange for the freedom of the remaining Israeli hostages.View image in fullscreenAn anti-government protest calling for action to secure the release of Israeli hostages held captive since the 7 October attacks.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianMedia analysts say Israel’s main broadcasters have largely embraced the narrative of a government described as the most far-right in the country’s history.For months, the Israeli media have responded to international outrage by focusing on Israeli claims that the widespread hunger documented by numerous aid agencies is “a Hamas-orchestrated starvation campaign” – summed up by Benjamin Netanyahu’sclaim last month: “There is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza.”According to UN World Food Programme, one-third of the Palestinian population in Gaza isgoing for days without eating, and half a million are on the brink of starvation.“The worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,” the UN-backed group the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)said last month, calling for an urgent ceasefire to alleviate “widespread starvation”.View image in fullscreenFive-month-old Ammar Muhammad Ammara has suffered from a persistent high fever and severe malnutrition since birth.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesAccording to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), another five people died last week due to malnutrition and starvation, bringing the total number of malnutrition-related deaths to 227, including 103 children, since October 2023.Even Donald Trump, Netanyahu’s key international ally, when asked if he agreed with the Israeli PM on the issue, said: “I don’t know … those children look very hungry … that’s real starvation stuff.”In a rare press conference with foreign journalists in Jerusalem last Sunday, Netanyahu displayed photographs of skeletal children in Gaza anddismissed them as fake, claiming they were part of a Hamas plot to attack Israel.He compared these images with aphotograph of the Israeli hostage Evyatar Davidreleased by the Palestinian militant group early in August, pointing out that while the man held in Gaza appeared to be starving to death, the arm of a Hamas fighter visible in the frame looked strong and muscular. The implication was clear, according to the prime minister: the fighters of Hamas were eating well and keeping food from the Israeli hostages and from the public of Gaza.View image in fullscreenAmira Muteir holds the hand of her five-month-old baby Ammar, who she says is wasting away from malnutrition.Photograph: Mahmoud Issa/ReutersSaragusti said: “Despite images of emaciated children published by major newspapers around the world, Israel pushed back. And Israeli media outlets adopted the narrative set out by the Israeli leadership, insisting that there is no starvation in Gaza.”Although Israel appears to exist within its own bubble, shielded by a narrative that leaves no room for the suffering of people in Gaza, thousands of demonstrators who recentlyfilled the streets of Tel Avivare now urging the government to halt the atrocities against the Palestinians.“I think it is horrendous what is happening in Gaza,” said Lenny Kadmon, 19. “I think that the main reason not everyone here is against it is because most people find it too difficult or too scary to look at themselves and at what we do in Gaza.”Gal Alkalay, 28, said: “I come here to protest in Tel Aviv every weekend. We ask our PM to end the war. Only in this way we can end the starvation in Gaza and the return of our hostages.”And yet, despite a growing number of Israeli intellectuals using the word “genocide” to describe their government’s actions in Gaza – as the award-winning author David Grossmandid just a fortnight ago– analysts say they remain a small minority.In Jerusalem, where tensions between Arabs and Israelis are sharper, the majority of Jewish residents continue to align themselves with the narrative of Israel’s political leadership.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Asked what she thought of the suffering of Palestinian children in Gaza, Myriam Israel, 34, said: “I think people should also see the suffering of our children terrorised by Hamas. But the world thinks only about children of Gaza. I think Hamas needs to think about their own children. And we need to think about the security of our country.”Zalman Coleman, 21, said: “All you have to do is use your brain five seconds and you can see that Hamas’s ultimate aim is to get that number [of deaths] as high as possible. And then from that, turn the whole world’s face against Israel. [In this conflict] the media had so much potential to do so much good in the world. But they chose fake news.”View image in fullscreen‘Hamas’s ultimate aim is to get that number [of deaths] as high as possible,’ said Zalman Coleman (left) a 21-year-old Israeli living in Jerusalem.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianSince the Hamas-led attacks of 2023, Israel has almost completely barred foreign journalists from entering Gaza – an unprecedented move in the history of modern conflict, marking one of the rare moments that reporters have been denied access to an active war zone.Reporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists have formallycalled for Gaza to be opened to foreign media, warning that current measures severely undermine press freedom.Many argue that the Israeli ban is a deliberate tactic to restrict independent scrutiny, limit international visibility of the conflict, and thus control the narrative.View image in fullscreenUltra orthodox Jewish at the men's section of the Western Wall.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian“The only way to enter Gaza and cover the war is to embed in Israeli army units,” said Saragusti – and even that is rarely allowed. “There is no independent press in Gaza. There are only the Palestinian journalists, who many of them have been killed. Israel claims that there is no starvation but doesn’t let the foreign press in to check by itself whether there is starvation or not.”Up to now, she added, “the press blockade has succeeded very well in its goal”.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPress freedomMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Bondi has been AG for seven months now. How long does it take to go through these documents?“I think we’re waiting for something that’s never going to come to fruition.”Victims’ advocates have also noted that theTrump administrationis capable of releasing these documents so that those whom Epstein and Maxwell preyed on can get justice.“For the last 20 years the victims have always wanted the full disclosure of information regarding Epstein and Maxwell’s sexual-trafficking scheme. They have always wanted all individuals to be held accountable for their part in the sexual exploitation,” said Spencer Kuvin, the chief legal officer of Goldlaw, who has represented multiple Epstein victims.“The current administration has the power to release everything by merely signing an executive order. Instead of trying to help victims and expose sexual predators, they are more worried about protecting their friends who socialized with these criminals.”Analysts have voiced differing views on whether there is longterm political liability for Trump if the documents are not released.Susan MacManus, a professor emerita of political science at the University of South Florida, said there are several possibilities. Republicans might hope that people grow bored with the issue and start focusing on other subjects.A smaller cohort of ultra-conservative Republicans, however, is dissatisfied that the documents have not been released.“They’re disappointed in Trump because they think that there’s something hidden there, and they believe in transparency,” MacManus explained. Some Republicans might think that “ultimately, at least some of this stuff will come out”, implicating Democratic and Republican politicians alike.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t think they’ve got an easy way out of this,” Wilson said.Wilson said that recent polling he’s conducted indicates that the controversy is not going away.“Americans, and Republicans in particular, are paying attention to this story because there is a ‘there’ there for them,” he said.Judge rejects Trump administration request to unseal Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury transcriptsRead moreMatt Terrill, a Republican strategist and managing partner of public affairs firm Firehouse Strategies, said that at the moment, interest in the issue has died down for the time being. Americans are focused on issues such as the economy, and many are on vacation.When Congress returns, however, Terrill expects the controversy will also return to the forefront, but that doesn’t mean the attention will be entirely on Trump. The House oversight committeesubpoenaedBill and Hillary Clinton, as well as several former attorneys general and law enforcement officials, to testify about Epstein.“That could take the spotlight off President Trump,” he said. Even if this diverts attention from the president, Terrill said it would behoove the administration to be more open about whatever is going on.“There are many people in the Maga base who joined the Maga base because they want government transparency and they want accountability. They want justice and, for right or wrong, many people in the Maga base, and even those outside of the Maga base, feel as though they’re not getting that right now with this situation.”“So I do think it’s important, if you’re the administration, the Trump administration, to continue to put out everything you have in terms of this case,” he said. “If you can’t put things out, explain to the American people why you can’t put those things out.”Explore more on these topicsGhislaine MaxwellJeffrey EpsteinDonald TrumpSex traffickingUS crimeTrump administrationUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it happens several times in Aoife Kelleher’s feature-length profile of the former Irish president, Mary Robinson. Whether it’s pride in the Irish national identity, sympathy with the disenfranchised or grave fear of how the climate crisis will affect future generations, Robinson is not afraid to let her emotions show and is, indeed, unable to avoid it. In those moments, we see the core of her enduring popularity. As captured by this programme, Robinson is a leader who actually, genuinely cares, about people and principles.A conventionally structured film – archive clips, journalist talking heads, an interview with Robinson herself – begins with her latter-day incarnation as an environmental campaigner before flipping us back to postwar County Mayo, where Mary Bourke grew up competing with four brothers. Despite being “shy” and a “bookworm”, she was filled with an impulse to “make life more fair”, and sought to implement that via the study of law at Trinity College, Dublin, where she met her future husband, Nicholas Robinson. A spell at Harvard meant she was in the US to witness protests against the Vietnam war and the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. “What is law when all of this is happening?”, Robinson remembers thinking.View image in fullscreenA reforming lawyer in her early career, Mary Robinson detonated an electoral earthquake by winning the Irish presidential vote in 1990.Photograph: Central City Media/HBOBack at home, she practised law but was soon drawn into politics and was persuaded to run in the 1990 presidential election. Her initial misgivings about the post being an irrelevant ceremonial institution soon gave way to a realisation that it could be a platform from which to advocate globally for human rights.And so, at a time whenIrelandwas still deeply misogynist, this little-known woman stood as a rank outsider against the slicked grey hair, ballooning double-breasted suit and contrived bar-room bonhomie of old warhorse Brian Lenihan. Lenihan’s party, centre-right traditionalists Fianna Fáil, had never lost a presidential election, but the charismatic Robinson’s ability to connect with a tired, downtrodden populace was already seeing her begin to draw level in the polls when a Lenihan acolyte launched a sexist personal attack on her in a radio interview. This gaffe provoked many female Lenihan supporters to switch sides.Robinson’s campaign, depicted to the sound of Cannonball by the Breeders, became unstoppable: the footage of her accepting the nomination, smiling freely while Lenihan and beleaguered Fianna Fáil taoiseach Charles Haughey stand behind her looking as if they’ve sucked on lemons, is a moment of purely joyful underdog triumph.Her presidency was profoundly different from any of her predecessors. Setting up a continuously lit lantern in the window of her official residence to represent members of the Irish diaspora who had been driven away by discrimination and oppression, Robinson made headlines by meeting with Queen Elizabeth II and Gerry Adams – not at the same time – before travelling to Somalia to draw attention to famine, and to Rwanda in the aftermath of genocide. At home, Ireland’s positions on gender equality and sexual freedom fundamentally changed, with Robinson’s drive to give voice to the voiceless playing a major part.View image in fullscreenA delegation from The Elders – a global organisation advocating for peace – in Rafah, Egypt. Mary Robinson was their former chair.Photograph: Ali Moustafa/Getty ImagesShe quit in 1997 before the end of her term, a move that is not the only decision she candidly describes as a “mistake” – although why it was so bad to renege on her deal with the Irish when her presidency only had a few months to run isn’t properly explained. She’d been lured away by the prospect of becoming the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and here the film gently prompts questions about Robinson’s politics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The US responded by levering her out of her job, then awarding her the Presidential Medal of Freedom some years later. Watching this film, it’s hard not to wonder whether Robinson represents the best of and the limitations of rational, progressive liberalism: she spoke truth to power, her admirers would say, but others might say that she often politely asked power if it wouldn’t mind awfully reining it in a bit, and power said no.The concern abides as we see Robinson, now 81, acting as chair of The Elders, a prestigious pressure group founded by Nelson Mandela. Doing the rounds of conferences, seminars and campaign launches, Robinson is seen being brought to tears by melting glaciers, while giving speeches to green activists. The climate crisis might be the ultimate example of asking nicely not working, but perhaps someone listening to Robinson will take a more radical step forward: if they do, they’ll be the latest in a line of countless people inspired by a woman whose desire to do the right thing has never wavered.Mrs Robinson airs on Sky Documentaries and streams on Now, on Sunday, 17 August.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewIrelandPolitics pastDocumentaryFactual TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

An elaborate storyline, conveyed through GCSE-level acting and colossal set design, lands on the deaf ears of an audience who came to listen, not watch.External factors cause a rocky start. Their set time is changed at the last minute to 5pm, clashing with every other stage. As crowds reluctantly drag themselves to the East Stage, they wait until 6pm for anything to happen: a full hour of inactivity. Worse, Cleo Sol, Chronixx and Sault are billed as Providence, meant to perform until 11pm, holding audiences hostage without set times, clarity, or other stages to go to.A towering pyramid looms in the crowd, visually impressive but obscuring the main stage for many. Then an equivocal drama performance begins. As a collective, Sault revel in mystery: aside from Cleo Sol and Inflo, its members are anonymous. But the actors’ dialogue is inaudible, and the audience grows restless.Finally, a traditional African choir opens before the collective launches into Glory and Free. The aesthetic – simultaneously Star Wars Tatooine futuristic and biblically ancient – looks polished, and fits with Sault’s knack for blending classical and contemporary genres in their music.Standout moments include Warrior, with Chronixx joining on stage, Son Shine and Wildfires, perfect for London summer evenings. Yasiin Bey (formerly Mos Def) also delivers a seamless guest verse on Stop Dem.For the rest of the show, the dancers appear to be the focus, but the visual impact is impaired by the massive pyramid. Hits like Masterpiece are diminished. Pray for Me and SOTH feel overly artistic, bordering on pretentious. Theatrics might work in an intimate venue, but for the festival crowd, the inaccessible themes feel alienating.After another awkward drama piece, Chronixx brings the evening back with a captivating reggae set. But things unravel when Bey returns for a surprise 30-minute set, spinning like a whirling dervish while questioning societal progress in his freestyles. Neighbours gently explain, “This guy sang Ms Fat Booty.”When Cleo Sol finally appears at 10pm, she thanks the crowd “for your patience”. Real name Cleopatra Nikolic, she looks pharaonic atop the pyramid with an ethereal voice, but by then, the crowd has thinned significantly.Spellbinding singing can’t save Sault. The interstitial skits occupy nearly as much time as the performance, and the audience members strain to wrap their heads around something they shouldn’t have to understand.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockFestivalsSaultreviewsShareReuse this content"

At age 18, in the mid-noughties, I packed up and left forManchester, moving into the university halls of residence. I was thrilled.On my first night out, I went to a popular gay club night and got stupendously drunk. The university halls were only a five-minute walk away, but I was alone. Around 2am, I found myself propped against a wall outside a takeaway, unable to remember how to get back to my bed.Spotting me in trouble, Nana, who was lovingly known as the oldest drag queen in Manchester, came up to me and asked: “‘Are you OK, chicken?”The kindness of strangers: I was five years old when a woman I’ll never know gave me an extravagant dollRead moreNana was a Manchester institution. She had campaigned a lot during the HIV/Aids crisis in the 1980s and 90s. In the 2000s she’d often show up late at night to hand ice blocks out to drunk young partiers to help sober them up. She’d say: “Here’s something to suck on, boys,” which made everyone laugh.I told Nana I lived at the university, but that I’d just moved here and didn’t know where I was going. Without hesitation, she replied: “Come on love, let’s get you home.”Nana escorted me back, got me safely into my room, tucked me into bed and saw herself out. All of this, dressed in drag. Her parting words were: “Nana loves you – now be careful.”Looking back now, I can see how much of a vulnerable situation I had put myself in, as an 18-year-old in an unfamiliar environment. But Nana, who was probably in her early 60s at that point, took me under her wing. She got me home safely then just disappeared, like a gay fairy godmother.Nana died about three years ago. Canal Street, the gay strip in Manchester, effectively went into mourning. Nana had touched so many lives but it wasn’t until after she passed and we all started trading stories of what Nana had done for us that we realised how wonderful she really was. For years there had been this fabulous person in the background who was looking after her community but not expecting any thanks for it.

Sheknows,they realised! This is because Eilish’s Oscar-winning track What Was I Made For? – a lachrymose Barbie cut lamenting adulthood’s entailing ennui – has become the default soundtrack for a new breed of cat video.You may recognise it: the song often plays over the top of these AI-generated fantasias featuring a cartoonishly fat cat or an equally buff feline with a suspiciously veiny human body. The cat cheats on her lover, falls pregnant or seeks revenge in a weirdly condensed soap opera. And like all soap operas, these videos are extremely addictive.Here’s one, for example. While working an honest job, Mr Whiskers – wearing a red flannelette shirt – accidentally cuts his paw off while endeavouring to saw some wood into shape. He is fired (in fact, the signs around his warehouse explicitly state that all workers “must have two arms to work”), his wife divorces him and he attempts to pick up the pieces of his hard-knock life in 30 neat seconds. It’s all going swimmingly until his scorned ex-wife tries to kill him with an axe a little while later, but all is well … she falls into a puddle and humiliates herself.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

They’re kind of people, too. Moggies with rugged, athletic human physiques who occasionally live in mansions, drive convertibles and work corporate jobs. And yet, some – despite their seemingly exquisite set of circumstances and comically immaculate bodies – find themselves routinely grief-stricken, sick or in danger, as uncanny pop covers accompany their downfall.They find themselves pushed off ships, snared in house fires, drug-addled, arrested and bullied.

It’s the hero’s journey, only furrier.And they get dark … quickly. Inone disturbing video, a cat-lady is stuck in the antebellum South picking cotton before being lashed by a white cat in overalls. Each video is sickeningly gaudy, sometimes violent and always melodramatic. And even when other AI-generated animals feature, such as crazed eagles or depraved sharks, the cats maintain their human six-packs and two-legged swagger.Inanother, “Luigi Meowgione” watches in pain as his cat-grandmother collapses in the grocery store. Her health insurance is denied at the hospital, so he faces up to the “evil Corp Insurance” company, scales it from the outside and fills the building with Catnip gas. Now that the security guards are incapacitated with a terrible case of the munchies, Luigi Meowgione is able to hack the system – and, by the end of the video – he discretely enters the CEO’s office … presumably to seek revenge.

It just took me a while to truly see itSun 17 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 17 Aug 2025 10.18 EDTShareThere is a painting that I think about often. TheMadonna del Parto, a masterpiece painted by Piero della Francesca in about 1460, is housed in a dedicated museum in the Tuscan town of Monterchi. It depicts a heavily pregnant Virgin Mary flanked by two angels. To local women, this painting is considered a protector of fertility and the lives of pregnant women during birth. During the second world war, local women surrounded two men whom they had mistaken for Nazis intent on stealing it. In 1954, they led a protest against its proposed movement to Florence for an exhibition. I remember reading as a student that the women had lain down in the street to block its departure.I thought about those women again yesterday, as I walked around the Jenny Saville exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, tracing the influence of the Renaissance on her work. Saville’s dialogue with great painters began when she was young and an art historian uncle took her to Venice. It has continued throughout her career, most notably in hermotherhood pictures, which show her wrangling a baby, or both her babies, heavily influenced by Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. The ghosts of their Madonnas seem to linger in the sketch lines that swirl around Saville’s mother figure. One of her most famous works, the stunning, sculptural, charcoal and pastelPietà I, is a result of her study of Michelangelo’s The Deposition.I’m worried I’ll lose you in my nerdiness, so back to the protesting women of Monterchi. In my early 20s, I marvelled that anybody could care so much about a Renaissance painting as to lie down in the street as these women had. Such art left me cold, and no doubt my personal lack of religion was a factor. I dismissed it as all geriatric-looking baby Jesuses, and people pointing and kneeling. I understood, academically, its importance – the dawn of perspective! I studied and analysed the Titians and the Michelangelos as required, even passed a Socratic oral examination in Italian about the works of Leonardo. Yet where I had the choice, I always veered towards the abstract and the contemporary. None of it spoke to me the way a Rothko or a Joan Mitchell did.I knew the problem was me: I just wasn’t getting it. That strange alchemy wherein some works of art fizz with resonance eluded me. Standing more than a decade later in Saville’s room of mother paintings, it seemed clear that my inability to “understand” certain paintings had been less about my irreligious upbringing and more about my lack of life experience. When I was 23, a man tried to kill me and the trauma of that seemed to partly manifest in a taste for the baroque (pretentious, yes, but we all work through our traumas using art, most commonly music. Consider this my death metal). I dragged my then boyfriend around Rome’s churches to look at Caravaggios; stood in front of Artemisia Gentileschi’sJudith Slaying Holofernesat the Uffizi and felt her rage.View image in fullscreen‘I didn’t cry at the Saville show, but I came close in front of Aleppo, her Pietà for the children of Syria.’ Jenny Saville’s Aleppo.Photograph: Lucy Dawkins/© Jenny Saville. Courtesy GagosianWhen I was younger, nothing felt more exposing than earnestness, so like many people in their 20s I hid my greenness behind an affected world-weary cynicism. But things happen in life. Significant, sometimes awful, things, and I think there’s also something about growing older that makes caring deeply and being open about it simply feel less embarrassing. As a young person, there was a closed-offness to the emotional complexity of certain experiences – not only death, but anything to do with pregnancy or motherhood. I didn’t want to go there.Then, around the time I started thinking about having a baby, I began looking at paintings of the Annunciation. The depiction of that moment when the young Virgin Mary is told by the angel Gabriel that she will have a child – lack of belief in virgin birth aside, the artistic distillation of that feeling, of how much life is about to change – became interesting to me almost overnight. Only more so once I found out I was pregnant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a woman standing in front of it in Florence, all I could focus on was the expression on her face. Seeing things in person helps, but so, I suspect, do hormones.This summer, a good friend discovered she was pregnant – it had happened so quickly that she was as shocked as I had been.

I understood that the women of Monterchi weren’t only acting to protect a masterpiece, but to protect, as they saw it, one another, and their babies.

Dakota Johnson plays Lucy, a matchmaker with a talent for pairing her exacting clients with someone who ticks most of their boxes and is also likely to accept them. She is less cupid, more market analyst – capable of seeing through her singletons’ self-serving bluster and spin to appraise their actual worth – then matching it with someone of equivalent value.A thirtysomething woman of only average good looks, for instance, can’t hope to land a “unicorn” – a 6ft-tall high earner with his original hairline. Unicorns want to date twentysomethings – and they can get them, too.Lucy herself is jaded as a result of her job, and pragmatic, having grown up poor. Her last serious relationship – with John (Chris Evans), an aspiring theatre actor/cater waiter – ended after he admitted, just before their anniversary dinner, that he didn’t have $25 to pay for parking.Now Lucy is resolved to stay single or marry rich – preferably eye-poppingly rich. When she is wooed by Harry (Pedro Pascal) – one of those unicorns her clients seek – and returns home with him to his multimillion-dollar apartment, her head swivels round mid-embrace, totting up its approximate worth.Obviously one matinee screening in Norwich doesn’t count for much in terms of market research, but I got the impression – from the audible and repeated tuts, tsks and groans around me – that the (mostly older) audience was dismayed by these explicit conflations of romance with finance.I kept quiet in my seat, uncomfortably conscious that I was finally watching a romcom that showed a version of dating and romance I recognised.That it’s Tough Out There for single people is a truth pretty much universally acknowledged, and widely blamed on dating apps. The technology – mainstream now for more than a decade – has become inextricable from the experience of dating; even if you don’t use dating apps yourself, you can feel their influence in the normalisation of ghosting, for instance, or “situationships” of convenience.Materialists, written and directed by Song, was inspired by her own brief experience working as a matchmaker in New York. But Lucy’s clients, with their checklists, seem to be an embodiment of the apps’ consumerist logic. Your profile is essentially a billboard on which you display your most marketable self and specify the traits you seek (and won’t accept) in others. Swiping is an instant, binary value judgment, appraising someone as being worthy (or not) of your attention. Your choices seem infinite. Meanwhile, access to the most in-demand – and therefore the most desirable, per the algorithm – matches is increasingly reservedfor paying members.It is at best a crude way of creating connection, and at worst explicitly capitalistic in a way that is at odds with attraction, commitment and intimacy. Now, as described by the sociologist Eva Illouz (notably inThe End of Love), that hyper-rational, self-serving approach has escaped online dating to infiltrate all of modern love.US man arrested for allegedly using dating apps to scam matches out of $2mRead moreYears of swiping have primed people to expect to feel the same instant feedback that someone is right for them, before they commit to finding out. A relationship, meanwhile – a costly endeavour in a culture that prizes individualism, freedom and choice – must offer a return on investment.You might not express this as baldly as Lucy or her clients, but it is in the air, the unspoken calculation behind many of our romantic decisions (and even our platonic ones:consider the brittle discussionof “friendship breakups” and “toxic friends”). Illouz terms it “emotional capitalism”, whereby “emotional life – especially that of the middle classes – follows the logic of economic relations and exchange”.What has really given teeth to this clinical number-crunching is wealth inequality, foregrounding the financial support of a partner – and incentivising some to find the richest one possible. Thecomparisonswith the marriage market of Jane Austen’s time aren’t just qualitative, butbacked by data. Stagnating salaries and rising costs mean that if you don’t come from wealth yourself, the only way to improve your material circumstances – or just achieve financial security – is through a relationship.A recent survey by the financial services provider OneFamilyfound thatone in five young adults aged between 18 and 40 are choosing to live with a partner primarily to make living costs more affordable, “because the bills are too high to contemplate managing on their own”, as the OneFamily CEO put it. Even if you are in a happy, reciprocal relationship, you can’t block out this influence altogether: do you love your partner, or do you love paying 50% less rent?Though I am largely contentedly single, I’m uncomfortably conscious that as a self-employed person in a struggling industry, my best shot at improving my circumstances, or even changing my life, is finding a partner. This doesn’t influence my decisions in dating – but I can’t say that I don’t fleetingly think, when I meet a nice doctor who owns a three-bedroom house in south London, that it would be especially nice if it worked out. (It didn’t!)It is naive to believe that we can separate romance and even relationships from financial reality. Against such a brutal backdrop, financial stability is arguably a sound reason to prioritise the search for love. If that strikes us as unsavoury or regressive, we should push for affordable housing and more financial and society safety nets, so that we can enter into relationships freely and set love apart, as best we can, from finances.For now, the challenge faced by modern singles – as Materialists acknowledges – is striking a balance between pragmatism and idealism, and holding on to hope against, often brutal reality checks. “Some people just want more” is the film’s tagline. I can’t begrudge anyone for dating for money more than for love, when the two are so entangled. But we might ultimately be better off pushing for more from society, rather than our partners.Elle Hunt is a freelance journalistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But in a world of dwindling resources, aren’t the real weirdos the ones throwing yacht parties and sending Katy Perry into space?Sun 17 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTShareHere’s a silly season story for you: a 51-year-old woman in the German town of Spaichingen in Swabia is under criminal investigation on suspicion of filling watering cans from her neighbour’s water butt. The total estimated value of the purloined water: €0.15.It’s wonderfully daft. She allegedly hid behind a bin to evade detection and, according toreports, the police declared, with Solomonic gravity: “Once it is in the barrel, [the water] no longer belongs to the heavens.” Who knows what motivated this nano-crime: a moment of midlife madness? Some kind of grudge? But water is metered in Germany so there might a kind of extreme parsimony at work (Swabian housewives arelegendarily thrifty, apparently).Extreme frugalitycan be quite funny. Not the kind motivated by financial hardship, which is as unfunny as it gets (anddeepening and wideningin the UK, with “Dickensian levels” of child poverty being reported by the children’s commissioner). But the other kind – the Uncle Scrooge variety, where people choose the teabag-redunking, loo-roll-square-counting life – is presented as an entertaining personality type, the kind you might see spotlighted on a Channel 5 show (perhapsset in Yorkshire; after all, my people aren’t famous for their largesse).It’s probably too late to pitch Channel 5, though, because “Extreme Cheapskates” – a US import – already exists. I watched a bit, while thinking about the Swabian butt theft, and some of these people are, to put it mildly, exceptionally dedicated to thrift. There’s a woman who flosses with her own hair (it must be freakishly strong, what does she use on it?) andkeeps chewed gum in the freezerto reuse multiple days, another – apparently amillionaire! – whopees in jarsto keep her water bills down, and a man whodoes the washing up and warms soup in his hot tub.Other so-called cheapskate tricks, though, seem perfectly reasonable. Using roadkill for its fur sounds sensible (it’s dead anyway), as does reusing bathwater or keeping jeans in the freezer instead of washing them. Over time, I have started to find frugality more appealing myself, albeit inconsistently: I will place a leftover half potato on a saucer in the fridge with a reverence usually reserved for holy relics, but spend £4 on a basic cake I could make for pennies. But I certainly get more and more pleasure from minor domestic acts of meanness: I hoard and reuse plastic food bags and boxes eternally (microplastics be damned; I’m sure something else will kill me first) and redunk teabags, though purely for my own consumption and mostly camomile, which tastes of nothing in the first place, so no harm done. I even dunk myself in my husband’s bathwater occasionally.Does that sound weird and gross? Maybe, maybe not – there’s a spectrum, from last days of Rome profligacy to making lasagne in the dishwasher (another Extreme Cheapskate trick), and we are mostly somewhere in the middle. The extremely frugal by choice, though, measuring out their lives in coffee spoons pinched from the work canteen, are mostly seen as comical, silly and slightly sad.We have internalised an idea that lavishness is life-affirming – live a little, use the good bath oil, as Nora Ephron said (impossible: I’ll die with the good bath oil dusty and unopened, taking a grim last satisfaction at having saved it). But isn’t the opposite true? Aren’t the real sad weirdos the ones throwing yacht foam parties and sending Katy Perry into space? Appreciating every drop and crumb and being careful can be life-affirming, and life- (on Earth, in the wider sense) prolonging. We’re not facing the kind of horror we are seeing in Gaza, but this summer,UK farmers are sounding alarm bellsat the prospect of poor harvests and the difficulties they are facing feeding livestock, and I have just read ableak French news storyabout the effect of extreme heat on poultry farms (apparently 750,000 chickens died there as a result of 2023’s less dramatic heatwaves; worse is predicted this year). Nicking your neighbour’s water isn’t OK (and disturbingly end of days), and I’m not up for hair flossing – I don’t even have hair to floss with. But when natural resources are becoming scarcer, a “scarcity mindset” starts to make a lot of sense and the extremely frugal might have the last laugh.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSocietyClimate crisisFarmingEurope weatherWatercommentShareReuse this content"

It’s time to embrace Mancunian swaggerRichard PartingtonManchester is closing the gap on London, with public money having helped to ‘crowd in’ a lot of private investmentSun 17 Aug 2025 06.06 EDTLast modified on Sun 17 Aug 2025 13.13 EDTShareOver the summerRachel Reeveshas been on a road trip around Britain. From Cornwall and Kent, to Aberdeen, south Wales and Belfast, in search of the solutions for a national economy that is stuck in a rut.Inspired by this tour,the chancellor used a Guardian articlelast week to set her autumn budget priority: boosting productivity. Tax and spending may dominate news headlines, but this is the real problem facing the country, and no politician of the past two decades has managed to fix it.Productivity is a dull word of vital importance. Growing the measure of output for each hour of work is an economic secret sauce, enabling growth in wages and living standards over the long run without stoking inflation.On the hunt for solutions, Reeves could have extended her trip. Leaving Westminster on a (most probably delayed) Avanti train from Euston, or an overcrowded TransPennine Express from her Leeds constituency; for the wetter side of northern England, whereManchesteris having a moment in the sun.Unlike the rest of Britain, there are signs of life in Greater Manchester’s productivity. Between 2004 and 2023, the city region recorded thehighest rise in gross value addedfor each hour worked of any combined authority in the country.London – once the driver of UK growth – has effectively stalled. The capital is still streets ahead in terms of productivity and the UK is still one of the most regionally unequal countries in Europe, withno regions outside London and the south-east of England above the national average. But Manchester is beginning to close the gap – with growth of 31% since 2004.To anyone familiar with the north-west, this will probably come as no surprise. Manchester has changed beyond all recognition in recent years, never mind the past two decades. The Haçienda has been a posh block of flats for longer than it was at the epicentre of the “Madchester” music scene. Theclass of ‘92swapped Old Trafford for building luxury hotels long ago, petrodollar cash hasflooded the east of the city, and Oasis have just added, by some counts,£1bn to the British economyat large.“Manchester has got this buzz about it,” says Jim O’Neill,a former Goldman Sachs chief economist, and a proud Mancunian, who is life president of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership.“It’s always been there for years in the [city] centre. But most importantly it’s now spreading. Some would say it’s that Manchester swagger. It all relates to an attitude that ‘we can do this; we want to see it happen’. I don’t know another part of the country where it has that vibe.”For years Britain’s productivity growth has been a dismal disappointment. Before the 2008 financial crisis growth averaged 2% a year, but has trickled to well below 1% since. Figures last week showed growthcontracted in the year to June.With the autumn budget not far off, this is fuelling a sense of alarm in the Treasury. Whitehall is abuzz with speculation that the Office for Budget Responsibility is poised to hand Reeves downgraded productivity forecasts – with the potential to blow a£20bn hole in her tax and spending plans.To turn things around, Reeves could take the ingredients behind Manchester’s renaissance and apply them elsewhere. She could also double down on the “Northern Powerhouse” strategy for good measure.Sources close to Labour say that is exactly the plan: Keir Starmer and Reeves are expected to launch an intensified regional growth strategy next month, with the revival of theNorthern Powerhouse Rail projectas its centrepiece.Those who know Manchester best say there are a few golden threads to the renaissance of Cottonopolis: devolution; political stability and coordination between its policymakers, businesses and institutions; the involvement of its top universities; and sustained investment.Andy Burnham, the mayor ofGreater Manchester, says London hasn’t entirely cottoned on. The city symbolised by the worker bee has done well, but could have done even more with extra money and power from the Treasury.“The learning for Whitehall is, if you want productivity growth, and growth more broadly, you have to let go and trust places. And you have to invest. Because you can’t get it without investment.“[But] there is a bias against cities outside London and the south, and as long as this remains, the country will not achieve its full potential.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s been a major shift. The momentum is there now, and it’s what you do with that next.”In truth the Manchester revival has deep roots. The timeline before Burnham’s arrival as mayor in 2017 is well known: the1996 IRA bombas catalyst for city centre regeneration; the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the opening of Salford Media City, the Lowry, Bridgewater Hall and the expansion of the Metrolink.Led by the city council’s former chief executive Howard Bernstein, and ex-leader Richard Leese, their “Manchester family” approach to coordinating investment proves Reeves’s theory that public money can “crowd in” the private sector: Manchester has ranked top outside London for foreign direct investment projects for three of the past five years.A UK headline wealth tax? It may be simpler to put up existing taxesRead moreHowever, the transformation isn’t all plain sailing. House prices and rents are rocketing, crowding out families from Manchester’s poorer suburbs. For those who, like me, grew up around these parts, the skyscraper-sprouting skyline is a source of both pride,but also nagging worry. Could the pace of change sweep away something special, in a city used todoing things differently? And are the proceeds of growth lining Mancunian pockets, or flowing out of the Irwell to an offshore bank account?Burnham is alive to the danger. “I use the phrase that, the kids can see the skyscrapers from their bedroom window but they currently don’t see a path to the modern Greater Manchester economy. The next phase is about making that path.”Still, the addition of glass-fronted flats and office blocks among the converted Victorian mills has helped Manchester to create more jobs at a faster pace than the UK average. They reflect Labour’s hopes for Britain more broadly: that a fairer distribution of growth, in theory, will become easier if there is some growth in the first place.Reeves could do with a few more Mancunian economic miracles. The national economy will not come unstuck without Britain’s biggest regional cities reaching their full productive potential.In herfirst conference speech as chancellor last year, along the M62 in Liverpool, Reeves promised a Labour government would mean “shovels in the ground. Cranes in the sky. The sounds and the sights of the future arriving.”To the next critic who asks ‘well, when exactly do you mean?’, a Manchester reference may help.Explore more on these topicsProductivityEconomics viewpointManchesterRachel ReevesGreater ManchesterEconomic policyEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

What happened to shouting up the stairs to turn that music down?Sun 17 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 17 Aug 2025 03.18 EDTShareSome things you know without being told. Kids reached peak summer holiday boredom last week – on 12 August to be precise – according toa survey. If you’re a parent you may have laughed hollowly there, in the unlikely event you still have enough energy.Exhausted and bankrupt after standing in endless queues for more wholesome activities, we’ve started Cinema Club, which is totally different from just watching a film on the sofa, in ways I’ll explain, er, later. I was excited to share a particular childhood favourite of mine with my son, who turned 11 a fortnight ago, although this can be a risky business (ooh, is he too young to watch Risky Business?).Showing your offspring movies you remember fondly but haven’t seen in decades is often disappointing. Sometimes, they are so slow to get going that everyone loses interest, and many have aged astonishingly badly and are now problematic, to put it lightly. Luckily, the 1988 body-swap comedy Big was a hit straight away – fast paced, funny and poignant. The giant piano dance routine completely holds up. The only issue? A sex scene I’d forgotten. The protagonist has an adult form but is really 13 years old, and that wasn’t even why it was awful.I recall the excruciating experience of enduring these kind of TV moments with my mum and dad all too well. How two onscreen minutes could feel as if they lasted roughly nine millennia. Cheeks burning, buttocks clenched, dying inside. I’d never considered if it was as embarrassing for them as for me, which I now presume it must have been because boy-oh-boy did that part of Big go on for ever. Oddly, it felt exactly the same as it did back then, despite being on the other side, the grownup.Being a parent is different now; 40 is the new 30, so we feel younger than our parents did at this age. The only involvement my parents had in the music I was listening to was yelling, “Turn it down!” up the stairs. However, my son and I share a love of the pop star Lola Young. I’m not sure if that’s OK, for a few reasons. There are clean mixes of her songs, but you have to ask Spotify, or whatever you’re using, for them specifically, or you’re treated to lyrics that make you long for the comparatively tame lovemaking of Tom Hanks.But worse than the awkward conversations some of the spicy versions have provoked is the uncomfortable feeling all is not right with the world. The title of Young’s second album, released last year, is a bit too on the nose:This Wasn’t Meant For You Anyway. Maybe she has a point. I’m not sure if my kid and I are allowed to like the same things, if I should be disapproving rather than singing along. Have the times a-changed or am I doing parenthood wrong?The traditional role of the parent here is to be terminally uncool and not get it. To suspect that the Beatles are bad influences because of their hairstyles, to get outraged over Madonna’s antics. Not to be vogueing around the kitchen in a conical bra, like the ‘I’m not a regular mom, I’m a cool mom’ from Mean Girls.It isn’t just Young, I am also a huge fan of YouTuber Ryan Trahan. My kid and I learned the viralCharli xcxApple dance together (not to post on social media, I hasten to add). My husband is a dab hand at Mario Kart on the Nintendo Switch and they race regularly.These are not pastimes we grin and bear, like watching Frozenagain, or the lengthy train obsession that meant we spent most weekends standing on cold platforms, waving our blue hands at drivers as they passed by. This is all of us genuinely enjoying what we’re doing, nobody faking it or making any kind of sacrifice.It goes the other way too – our boy’s first proper late nights were due to the wait for the next episode of The Traitors being unbearable. He accidentally overheard a podcast I love, Dax Shepard’s Armchair Expert, and now listens every week with me on purpose. And recently he joined us down a Sean Hayes wormhole that culminated in a Will & Grace marathon in which he demonstrated admirable stamina.Maybe the secret is not to question it. Perhaps this is actually the sweet spot. The teenage years are fast approaching, in about five minutes, us thinking that anything is good will probably be the kiss of death. I can only pray, when that dark day comes, I get custody of Lola Young.Explore more on these topicsFamilyParents and parentingcommentShareReuse this content"

Especially a male one. They’re always so confident. Never rattled, completely immune to others’ opinions.”Julie’s* intelligence and quick wit seemed to belie the very reason for attending therapy – despite reams of qualifications and years of professional experience, she felt dissatisfied with her work achievements. Having never put herself forth for a promotion, Julie had spent the better part of two decades being surpassed in position and remuneration by younger, less qualified (and mostly male) colleagues. Deflated and discouraged, Julie’s avoidance of career advancement only sought to reinforce negative self-beliefs about her intelligence and competence.“I know I could do a higher role. Sometimes, I think I could do it with my eyes closed. But what if I can’t, and then I’m found out to be a fake?”Our internal narratives can hold us back. Changing them is tough but rewarding work | Modern mindRead moreJulie was exhibiting hallmark characteristics of impostor syndrome. This phenomenon is defined by consistent doubt of one’s own accomplishments, feeling undeserving of success or achievement, and fear of being exposed as a fraud, despite evidence to the contrary. While not a clinical diagnosis, this “therapy speak” term is now very much entrenched in everyday language.I empathised with Julie’s position. As a psychology student and trainee therapist, I also experienced feelings of imposition. Competitive selection criteria and demanding training requirements make psychology studies an ideal breeding ground for impostor syndrome. Convinced that my admission to postgraduate training had been a clerical error, I’d spent a long summer fretting that I would be found to be a “phoney” on the first day of semester.First identified and investigated in the 1970s,research into impostor syndromefocused on the self-doubt commonly experienced by high-achieving professional women. Men were observed to experience less impostor syndrome than women, even in instances where they had less professional experience or objectively inferior qualifications.Like many pseudo-diagnostic terms,concept creepmeans that “impostor syndrome” is now used beyond its original definition. Psychological discomfort in a work or social setting is not necessarily impostor syndrome; most people feel nervous in situations such as starting a new job, going on a first date, speaking in public, or attending a social event where they are expecting to know few other guests.Rather, impostor syndrome is defined by thoughts and feelings about one’s intellectual parity and deservedness of success or achievement. The comparison to an individual or group of people must also be unfair or unrealistic. An amateur footballer is not expected to play at the same level as a professional; feelings of inferiority or envy that arise from this comparison are a reflection of reality, rather than indicative of impostor syndrome.Overcoming impostor syndromeUnderstandably, we often seek to push away or suppress psychological discomfort or distress associated with impostor syndrome. Many people convinced they are impostors seek consolation from others about their skills or the unfairness of a situation (such as a colleague being promoted). This provides temporary reassurance but does little to ameliorate the underlying causes of impostor syndrome.As impostor syndrome is not a clinical diagnosis, no recognised or standardised treatment exists. Instead, therapeutic work can focus on specific aspects of impostor syndrome, such as self-esteem, identity and anxiety. Assertiveness training can also be helpful. Exploring these underpinning characteristics can be effective in shifting mindset and behaviour around deservedness.Using Generative AI for therapy might feel like a lifeline – but there’s danger in seeking certainty in a chatbotRead moreFor Julie, valuable insight was gained by viewing impostor syndrome as a defence mechanism: in never seeking a promotion, Julie never risked rejection, thus defending herself against disappointment or failure.Understanding the origins of Julie’s impostor syndrome was an important step, but a practical element was also needed. Together, we devised a whimsical approach. Rather than “fake it until you make it”, we termed the approach “making it, not faking it”.In moments of self-doubt, Julie adopted the internal voice of a well-known male politician. How would he answer questions about qualifications and work experience? What would he say in a job interview or meeting with colleagues? What would be the tone of his voice, the cadence of his speech? This challenged Julie’s thinking and temporarily quelled thoughts of being an impostor.Julie’s personality and temperament would never transform into that of the politician being channelled, nor would we wish her to become someone or something she is not. But gaining a glimpse into that alternate persona allowed Julie to stop apologising for her success – and move towards celebrating it.* Julie is a fictitious amalgam to exemplify similar casesDr Bianca Denny is a clinical psychologist based in Melbourne.

It was a grimly apt postscript to a “peace summit” that allowed a pariah leader to posture on the world stage, but signally failed to achieve the outcome that its host claimed to desire.Mr Trump hadsuggestedthat he would be “unhappy” if a ceasefire were not agreed during discussions with Mr Putin. There would, hewarned, be “severe consequences” if his guest proved unwilling to end the war. Predictably, no ceasefire announcement was forthcoming, and the sanctions Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened, but never imposed, have been kicked into the long grass. Instead, the US president offered a crucial concession to Mr Putin, concurring that a cessation of hostilities should come only after a “comprehensive” peace agreement.This was a betrayal of hollow assurances given to Kyiv and European allies by Mr Trump before the summit, and a gift to the Kremlin. As Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,preparesto meet the US president in Washington on Monday, he consequently finds himself in a deeply invidious position.According toreports, Mr Putin’s core demand is that Ukraine surrenders all unoccupied territory in the Donbas region, in exchange for a supposedly permanent ceasefire. There are, of course, no good grounds to take the Russian president at his word. Hisreferencesin Alaska to the “root causes” of the war indicate that he remains determined to force Ukraine back into Moscow’s orbit, and restrict its capacity to act as an independent state.A “deal” on anything like those terms would amount to precisely the carve-up feared by Kyiv. Mr Zelenskyycannot, should not and will not acquiesce. But having retreated from his threats to make life tougher for Mr Putin, the US president is returning to his default bullying stance towards Mr Zelenskyy. Asked what advice he would offer the Ukrainian leader, Mr Trumpresponded: “Make a deal. Gotta make a deal.”The peremptory tone is worryingly reminiscent of February’s notorious Oval Office meeting, when Mr Zelenskyy wastold: “You don’t have the cards.” In vague terms, Mr Trump has alluded to a future US role in security guarantees following a deal. But as Ukraine fights for a viable future, he appears impatient to move on to doing lucrative future business with Moscow, andanglingfor a Nobel peace prize.Given that ominous backdrop, the presence of Sir Keir Starmer and other European leaders in Washington on Monday will represent a crucial counterweight. Mr Putin will attempt to force Ukraine’s negotiating hand by taking more territory in the east, where Russian forces have beenadvancingat the fastest rate for months. Europe must ensure that, as Kyiv battles for a just peace, Mr Zelenskyy does have enough cards to play. As well as displaying solidarity in the White House, that means upping the economic pressure and military support, and urging Mr Trump to do the same.Ukraine must remain in control of the future of its own territory, and the use of force must not be rewarded by the summary redrawing of borders. With enormous bravery and skill, and at immense cost,Ukrainehas resisted an illegal invasion for more than three years.

Changing norms and aspirations about appearances, and theway that these are marketedmainly to women and girls, are a cultural and economic phenomenon that requires wider consideration. While attitudes to these procedures and aesthetics vary, many people – including some cosmetic surgeons – are concerned thatyounger womenaccount for a growing share of a highly lucrative and growing market.The death last year of 33-year-oldAlice Webbin Gloucestershire, after a non-surgical Brazilian butt lift, as well as multiple reports of injuries, and the deaths ofat least 28 womenwho have travelled to Turkey for cosmetic treatments, have increased the pressure on ministers to tighten the law. Wes Streeting’s announcement ofnew licence requirementsfor UK businesses, and tighter regulation of higher-risk treatments, is probably overdue. The Chartered Trading Standards Institute recentlywarnedthat untrained people have given cosmetic injections in public toilets and hotels.Altering the law in order to exclude such “rogue operators” ought to make high streets and the internet – where many clinics advertise – safer.Talking about the risks, as the health secretary has been doing, and holding a consultation on proposed changes, may have the beneficial effect of raising awareness even before changes are introduced. But councils will need resources if they are to be expected to enforce new rules by issuing licences, checking premises and so on. As in many other areas of economic activity, the law on its own is unlikely to be enough. Mechanisms are needed to ensure that businesses comply.It is already illegal to administer Botox or dermal fillers to children in England – although, worryingly, it isstill allowed in WalesandScotland. Mr Streeting’s announcement that rules regarding children will be tightened further is particularly welcome. Strenuous efforts should be made to place them off limits for the industry as a whole. The reported preoccupation of some children withanti-ageing productsis not healthy and should be discouraged.Mr Streeting did not refer to the cost to the NHS if cosmetic procedures go wrong, when announcing plans to tighten the law. But Karin Smyth, one of his ministers, has raised this. And Prof Sir Stephen Powis, who was NHS England’s national medical director until last month, made the same point specifically in relation to butt lifts – the cosmetic procedure with thehighest death rateof all.Ministers should expect pushback even though many experts, including plastic surgeons, favour tighter rules. The pro-growth mood of the Treasury means proposals for new regulations are unlikely to be smiled upon there. The more restrictive approach being proposed for England will also do nothing to prevent surgical tourism and could even increase it, if tighter regulation of the domestic industry results in higher prices. The gap in safeguards that allows foreign cosmetic surgery providers to market directly to the public needs to be addressed separately, which the government has begun torecognise.There is no single or instant fix. But by cracking down on cowboy operators, ministers will send a message that appearance-altering injections and other invasive treatments must be treated seriously. They are a different order of activity from applying makeup or painting nails.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus a letter fromMark StringerSun 17 Aug 2025 12.51 EDTLast modified on Sun 17 Aug 2025 12.58 EDTShareRe your editorial (The Guardian view on construction workers: the country needs more of them, fast, 13 August), as a bricklayer with decades of experience, I see the skills shortage in the construction industry as the result of years of neglect. The problem is not only attracting new people, but keeping them in the trade once they see the reality of working conditions.Most site bricklayers are self-employed subcontractors. We don’t get pensions, holiday pay, or sick pay. If you’re ill or injured, you simply don’t earn. That insecurity pushes many skilled people out of construction entirely.On top of that, wages have barely moved in years – in fact, the rates many bricklayers receive today are lower than four years ago. Large housebuilders often pay good rates to main contractors, but by the time it filters down to the bricklayer, they can end up with far less.If the UK is serious about meeting its housing targets, we need more than training schemes. We need to make construction a job you can build a life on – fair pay directly to the tradespeople, proper benefits, and conditions that match the skill and physical demands of the work.Until that changes, we’ll keep losing good people faster than we can train them, no matter how much money is thrown at recruitment.Matthew OrdPeterlee, County DurhamLarge construction firms routinely depend on multiple levels of subcontracting, involving an ecosystem of small and medium-sized enterprises that source labour through a myriad of different routes. Those who do the work are often unsure of their own employment status. People working alongside each other frequently have very different terms and conditions, or indeed, no written terms and conditions at all. Career paths do exist, but only in sheltered pockets.The fractured nature of the employment model brings obvious advantages to “employers” in terms of low overheads. But training is invariably seen as someone else’s problem. Many small firms would much prefer to invest in direct employment and apprenticeships, but such investment isn’t feasible given the competitive dynamics of the marketplace. This is the end point of the industry’s 40-year quest for modernisation. Simple solutions are few and far between. But the first step for policymakers is to recognise the highly fissured nature of the construction employment context.Stuart GreenProfessor of construction management, University of ReadingThere are plenty of decent tradespeople out there and, of course, some not so good. Yes, we need to bring in more for the future, and I’ve no problem with them having formal qualifications. But that doesn’t make a tradesperson.I got my City & Guilds in carpentry in 1997. As I understand it, once my Construction Skills Certificate Scheme card runs out, it won’t be renewed unless I make a significant spend to get an NVQ. I’ve been in the trade for over 30 years, and I’ve diverged my skill base significantly past carpentry alone, all learned on the job.Currently, I have no problem getting work, as I’m fairly adept at most building trades. A rush to have only the formally qualified working on site will be counterproductive. As a self-employed tradesperson, if my work isn’t to standard, I cannot work. I’m 51, still fit.

This desire for economy also often leads to the reduction of natural elements (such as tree planting in urban areas), which may otherwise assist in tempering heat buildup.Second, too often we seek to solve fundamental flaws in the building design with bolt-on solutions, when instead we should design for climate resilience from the outset. The move towards air conditioning as a response to overheating problems illustrates this. Even the new Part O building regulations – which cover ensuring that homes do not overheat – allow the use of machinery rather than requiring an adequately responsive building fabric.Design expertise from environmentally minded professionals such as chartered architectural technologists can help to overcome these problems without using energy-hungry machinery. Considering the orientation of the building, incorporating a natural ventilation strategy and utilising materials in the building’s fabric that mitigate heat gain can greatly reduce the risk of overheating. But such principles are often disregarded in order to cut costs.The climatic situation we find ourselves in requires a shift in the very basics of building design. The knowledge is available. It just needs to be employed.Chris HalliganChartered Institute of Architectural TechnologistsExplore more on these topicsExtreme heatHot PropertyHousingClimate crisislettersShareReuse this content"

Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, might consider this as she ponders why so many ordinary people, not previously political activists, are volunteering for arrest as terrorist sympathisers.The proscription of Palestine Action sits among egregious violations of international law. People outraged by atrocities in Gaza and the West Bank are dismayed at the continued prevarications of our government.This is one motivation for those seated terrorists. However, there is another – the relentless attack on our civil liberties. This did not begin with Keir Starmer’s government, but it has doubled down on suppressing freedoms with renewed zeal.When the Terrorism Act (under which Palestine Action was proscribed) was debated in 1999,it was acknowledged: “We will have handed the terrorists the victory that they seek if … we descend to their level and undermine the essential freedoms and rule of law that are the bedrock of our democracy.” This was the then home secretary, Jack Straw. He reassured the Commons that the bill was “not intended to threaten in any way the right to demonstrate peacefully – nor will it do so”. Never would a British government misuse the huge power it was being given.More than 700 arrestsfor supporting Palestine Action testify to his error.Not-so-ordinary people are risking jail sentences, travel restrictions, asset confiscation and ruined employment prospects. They are outraged at Gaza, but also outraged to see counter-terror legislation pressed into supporting a morally moribund government.Dr David KillickKendal, CumbriaAndy Beckett’s account of his sortie into the recent London demonstration in support of Palestine, and reports of the rightwing protest groups gathering outside hotels housing asylum seekers, are both indicators that few people now have a sense that Keir Starmer’s Britain reflects their views or priorities.As well as in London, people here in Derbyshire and other towns around the country gathered to express their frustration with our politicians’ response to some of their deepest concerns. We have become a country without a shared agreement on what constitutes right or wrong, on what is an acceptable form of dissent, or on what constitutes the real threats to the survival of our democratic freedoms.This government thrashes about desperately trying to make sense of the events happening all around it and making ill-judged knee-jerk responses that provoke even more hostility. It seems unable to articulate a narrative that will help people feel heard, or which can help foster a sense of social cohesion. The UK has become a country devoid of spiritual, moral and political leadership. The threats from without and within are beginning to fray the very fabric that once held everything together.The critical task for this government now is how it is going to heal and unite this fractured, divided country before it heads into yet further chaos and conflict and everything begins to fall apart.Peter RiddleWirksworth, DerbyshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The sun may have been shining and the temperature in the mid‑20s. There may have been new kits on the pitch and new flags in the stands. There may have been an obsessive focus on the new signings. There may, among home fans, perhaps especially those refreshed in the new marquee behind the Stretford End, have been a giddy expectation that this season couldn’t be as bad as last for Manchester United. But the roots of a game run deep, stretching back into the mulch of the past. This was a game shaped by events last December.Calafiori strikes after goalkeeper’s error as Arsenal grind to win at Manchester UnitedRead moreArsenal are good at set pieces; United are vulnerable to inswinging deliveries. In December last yearArsenalbeat United 2-0 at the Emirates Stadium, both goals the result of corners. United had André Onana in goal for that one, but Tottenham had taken notice of the susceptibility to balls arced into the goalmouth, the way United struggled to protect their keeper.Two weeks later,Spurs played Unitedin the Carabao Cup. Altay Bayindir was in goal for that one and endured the indignity of being beaten direct from a corner by Son Heung-min.United don’t like inswingers and Bayindir really doesn’t like inswingers. Declan Rice is good at taking inswingers. And so there was a certain inevitability to what happened after 13 minutes. United had looked vaguely threatening. Arsenal had been rattled enough to commit four fouls in that period. Then Arsenal won a corner from their left.Rice whipped it in, Bayindir flapped and would have scored an own-goal had Riccardo Calafiori not nodded the ball over the line from the goal-line.View image in fullscreenAltay Bayindir makes a vain attempt to punch Declan Rice’s corner clear.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty ImagesUnited, perhaps, could point to the way William Saliba, having grappled with Mason Mount, bumped into him just as the ball arrived, and perhaps, given thenew directives to refereesto crack down on holding, a foul could have been given. But then there were half a dozen incidents that could have been penalised one way or the other in the box from that one corner; any refereeing decision in such circumstances could not but feel arbitrary.Fundamentally, with more decisive goalkeeping there wouldn’t have been an issue. David Raya’s assertive punch to clear an inswinging free-kick from Bruno Fernandes early in the second half, cuffing Matthijs de Ligt out of the way, showed the way to do it.Maybe the analogy was never entirely apt. Maybe building from the foundations up doesn’t necessarily mean getting the defence right.Maybe as football increasingly becomes about content production there is some sort of commercial logic in prioritising the goalscorers and the creators, the players who will look good clipped up or, to continue the metaphor, the spire, the ornamentation on the roof. But on the other hand, it doesn’t much matter if you’ve spent £200m on forwards if you’re going to concede goals like that. Particularly if you don’t then actually score yourself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

United, perhaps, would consider themselves unfortunate. Patrick Dorgu hit the post and Raya had to make seven saves, more than any other goalkeeper on the opening weekend. But only his reflex stop down to his left to keep out a Cunha effort from a narrow angle was a save that he would not necessarily be expected to make.To point out that Uniteddrew this fixturelast season and that they’re therefore doing worse this season is on one level meaningless.But equally this is a manager whose win percentage is 37.2%, the worst in half a century – and if United fail to win at Fulham next week, he will drop below both Frank O’Farrell and Wilf McGuinness to have the worst win percentage of any United manager since Herbert Bamlett, who was sacked in 1931. Context matters.There was plenty of mitigation on Sunday afternoon. The closer you zoom in the more excuses can be found: a goalkeeping error, new players settling in, a couple of close-run things. But it won’t take many more bad results for faith in Amorim to wane. When form has been so bad, it’s only natural to catastrophise: if they don’t win at Craven Cottage, the next home match, against newly-promoted Burnley, takes on a ghastly aspect: not merely a game they should win, but a game they have to win.This season is not discrete from the last. New signings, a resetting of the table, new hope, cannot erase the footfalls that echo in the memory. Poor results are a problem not only in themselves but for the impact they have on games to come: time present and time past are both perhaps present in time future.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedArsenalanalysisShareReuse this content"

Real Madrid are understood to have raised the issue of moving to a two-year cycle during talks with Fifa in Miami in June, a proposal that has gained support from other clubs who failed to qualify for this year’s tournament, including Barcelona, Manchester United, Liverpool and Napoli.Could latest seismic legal challenge leave Fifa wobbling on its perch?Read moreChelsea received £85m in prize money forwinning the competitionand other big European clubs want the opportunity to take advantage of Fifa’s huge revenue streams, which are being funded largely by Saudi Arabia’s Surj Sports Investments.Liverpool in particular were unfortunate not to take part this year, as they met one of the qualifying criteria by being among the top eight ranked clubs in Europe, but missed out asFifaopted to admit a maximum of two sides from a country. Chelsea and Manchester City took the English slots as recent Champions League winners. There is an exception to the limit if more than two clubs from a country win their continental competition during the qualifying period, as was the case with Brazil this year.Fifa sources said that while there is no serious consideration being given to staging the Club World Cup in 2027, the situation is likely to change after 2029, with the prospect of another tournament being held in 2031 to be explored.Fifa’s hands are tied in the short-term as the international match calendar is fixed until 2030, with only the 2029 Club World Cup in the schedule, as part of a memorandum of understanding signed between Fifa and the European Clubs Association two years ago.With Fifa already facing legal action from World Leagues, an international lobby group that includes the Premier League, there is no appetite to inflame it further by ripping up the current schedule. World Leagues has filed a legal complaint to the European Commission with support from the global players’ union Fifpro, accusing Fifa of “abuse of dominance” for allegedly failing to consult them over the scheduling of the Club World Cup.Staging the new competition every two years would increase tensions still further, but there is an acknowledgement on both sides that the entire global calendar after 2030 is open for negotiation.View image in fullscreenAleksander Ceferin (right), the president of Uefa, would likely take issue with Fifa’s Gianni Infantino making the Club World Cup biennial.Photograph: Gualter Fatia/UEFA/Getty ImagesAs part of a quid pro quo for moving into the club game, sources have indicated that Fifa may be willing to remove the June international break to ease player workloads and create space for events such as the Club World Cup, although that would be opposed byUefa, which uses summer dates to stage the finals of its Nations League competition.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIn a pre-season address last week the Premier League chief executive, Richard Masters, outlined his concerns with expanding the Club World Cup, although the biggest top-flight clubs appear to disagree. “Fifa was put on earth really to regulate the global game and to run international football, and the Club World Cup is a move into club football,” Masters said. “The leagues and the players have not been consulted at all on the timing and scheduling of the competition, and I think whatever iteration of it may come next, we do need to be consulted on that.“Obviously, it does have an impact on the scheduling of the Premier League season, that much is clear. We’re asking for a seat at the table, a proper discussion for the leagues.”Fifa is the process of reviewing the qualifying criteria for the 2029 Club World Cup and may lift the cap of two clubs per country, and as previously reported by the Guardian it is consulting on whether to increase the number of teams involved from 32 to 48. The men’s World Cup next year and the 2031 Women’s World Cup will involve 48 teams for the first time, so expanding the Club World Cup would be consistent with Fifa’s tournament model.Having awarded hosting rights to this year’s competition to the US without inviting tenders, Fifa is planning to run formal bidding process for future tournaments. Qatar, Spain and Morocco have all expressed interest in staging the 2029 Club World Cup, with details of the tender process expected later this year.Explore more on these topicsClub World CupFifaUefaPremier LeagueFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was an eye-opening lesson for the new head coach, as Nuno Espírito Santo and his players showed they are ready to build on last season’s success story.Chris Wood scored twice and Dan Ndoye netted on his debut to finish the match as a contest before 45 minutes had elapsed.Brentfordcould not cope with the hosts, who dictated the game from the start, while the visitors offered little indication of what style they plan to play under Andrews, who could take no enjoyment from Igor Thiago’s late penalty.Match of the Day’s new era: reassuring dad jokes and a lot of Wayne Rooney | Paul MacInnesRead more“We will learn a lot from that 45 minutes, especially me,” Andrews said. “[It was] very disappointing in terms of your preparation, how you envisage it, looking from a tactical perspective, not too different really. I felt, I’ve kind of stressed this most of the week, I felt it would be a game of structure that was needed to be very respectful of what Forest have, how they play the game. Basics is a word in football and sport that is seen sometimes as a dirty word. I’m big on it – unless you do the basics, you don’t give yourself an opportunity to play the game that you want to play.”Nuno complained in the buildup about the lack of summer transfer activity. He has since been appeased by the arrivals of Omari Hutchinson and James McAtee, who were paraded in front of the supporters before kick-off.Forest scored once in seven pre‑season matches, producing five goalless draws. Those statistics were rendered irrelevant within five minutes when Wood reacted quickest to a bouncing ball in the box from a corner, after Brentford failed to clear, to direct it home. Nuno looks poised to get a new striker in the coming days in the form of, Arnaud Kalimuendo from Rennes but the New Zealander Wood offered a reminder that his 20Premier Leaguegoals last season were not a fluke.View image in fullscreenThe Swiss winger Dan Ndoye scores on debut to put Nottingham Forest 2-0 up.Photograph: Darren Staples/AFP/Getty ImagesWhat Andrews would have done for the talismanic forwards of 2024-25 but Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo were not available. The latter is at Manchester United and the former has at leastone foot out of the door. It was a less than ideal situation for his first game in senior management and his team sat too deep, ceding control to Forest. Considering Andrews’ previous role as set-piece coach, the manner in which the goal was conceded will have greatly irritated him.Nuno wants his team to dominate possession more often and Brentford were willing to allow Forest to settle into this new style. Morgan Gibbs‑White was given space in which to receive the ball, further emphasising why Forest did everything in their power to stop him departing for Tottenham. Gibbs-White drifted into the areas he felt he could do most damage, picking up the ball and finding a forward pass to keep Brentford on the back foot.Andrews was constantly tested by Nuno, to see how quickly he could adapt his team. Forest’s wingers swapped positions, Gibbs‑White moved out wide and Ndoye spent time playing as a second central striker. If Andrews was under pressure before the start, Nuno was putting his tactical acumen in a vice.Forest had their own new era with Ndoye giving their fans more than a glimpse of what to expect after a summer move from Bologna. The Swiss attacker showed trickery on the wing but provided more than anticipated with a smart run to meet a Gibbs‑White cross into the box and head beyond Caoimhín Kelleher.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The striker was not tracked and calmly rounded the goalkeeper before tapping into the empty net and wheeling away in front of an ecstatic home crowd.“I just want to go home and celebrate, because it’s a beautiful start,” said Nuno, who wants the club to be busy in the market this week. “I’m delighted. I think the way we started the game was amazing. We dominated, controlled, [and had] good combinations.”Knowing the game was done, despite Thiago’s calm penalty after Ibrahim Sangaré handballed, the tempo in the second half dropped, giving Andrews some time to ponder what he will need to change.Jordan Henderson was given a debut off the bench and his experience will be vital because it is apparent that Andrews is learning on the job, while Nuno’s methods once again look assured. Life will become more difficult once the Europa League starts but Forest do not give the impression of being worried.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNottingham ForestBrentfordmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Salford arefighting for their futurefollowing a disastrous takeover that has left them with just two senior players due to the repeated late payment of wages, which has led to several Super League fixtures being cancelled.Wood initially returned to the RFL in March as senior independent director and has since been appointed chair of Rugby League Commercial, the body which manages the sport’s broadcasting and sponsorship sales.The RFL receives £16m over five years from government in a deal managed by Sport England, with the money used to fund the elite end of the sport, as represented by England’s international teams, and the development of the grassroots and recreational game.View image in fullscreenHull FC overwhelmed Salford 80-6 last week, which has raised concerns over the fielding of younger trial players.Photograph: Steve Mower/ProSports/ShutterstockSport England’s concerns revolve around the processes involved in the return of Wood after the resignation of the former RFL chair Simon Johnson and three other directors this year. Wood was previously RFL chief executive for 11 years and received a £300,000 severance package after his departure in 2018, which accounted for almost one-sixth of the governing body’s losses at the time.The Code for Sports Governance states the chairs of governing bodies must be independent, but Wood was chair of the Championship club Bradford before being appointed. While he has relinquished that Bulls role he remains on the club’s board.Wood initially returned to the RFL in March as senior independent director and has since been appointed chair of Rugby League Commercial, the body which manages the sport’s broadcasting and sponsorship sales.In addition to Wood’s links to Bradford, Sport England is expected to ask questions about the processes involved in his appointment, and whether any other candidates were interviewed.In March RFL sources insisted it would not be a long-term arrangement, but that does not appear to be the case.Since returning to the RFL Wood has been instrumental in driving through anexpansion of Super Leaguefrom 12 to 14 clubs for next season, although Hull FC, Hull KR and Wigan Warriors failed to endorse the plan when it was voted through by the other nine clubs last month. In another twist Bradford are one of the clubs pushing to be promoted from the Championship to the expanded Super League, which has raised eyebrows given Wood’s previous role.As the Guardian revealed last month,Sky Sports has also yet to endorse the expansionand has made it clear it will not provide additional funding for the extra clubs to cover the final season of its three-year TV deal, which expires at the end of next season. In addition, it is unclear who will cover the approximate £500,000 cost of televising an extra game across 27 rounds next season.Some Championship clubs vying for promotion as part of expansion plans have indicated they are willing to enter Super League without central funding next season, which has raised further concerns about its competitiveness in the light of the Salford debacle.Salford were thrashed 80-6 by Hull FC last week before the fixture on Sunday against Wakefield was cancelled due to concerns over the safety of the younger players and triallists they were planning to field.Salford’s owner, Dario Berta, has said the club will not go bust.

The Pole had her hands full in the early stages of the 98-minute match but took advantage of a sudden dip in Rybakina’s form to win four consecutive games and wrap up the first set before easing through the second.‘I am tough’ – Emma Raducanu on legacy of US Open win, stalking ordeal and why therapy won’t help herRead more“That was a tough match,” Swiatek said. “At the beginning the level was pretty crazy. We played so fast that sometimes we couldn’t even run to the second ball. But I was there to play with intensity and good quality and I am super happy with the performance. I served much better, so for sure it helped and I wouldn’t change anything.”In the final, Swiatek will play the Italian seventh seed, Jasmine Paolini, who beat Russia’s Veronika Kudermetova 6-3, 6-7 (2), 6-3. Paolini served for the match in the second set only to see her advantage slip away, but she eventually completed the job, with Kudermetova’s tally of 75 unforced errors costing her.In the first semi-final, Rybakina, the ninth seed, used a cross-court forehand that caught the line for a break and then held for a 5-3 lead in the first set but a focused Swiatek came back from the precipice and attacked the Kazakh’s serve to draw level at 5-5. From there, the Wimbledon champion held serve before wrapping up the opening set when she broke for a second time after a Rybakina backhand attempt came up well short.Rybakina, who enjoyed a swift victory against the world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka, in the previous round, was broken for a third time early in the second set after a backhand error put Swiatek ahead 3-1. Swiatek faced some resistance from Rybakina three games later but dug deep to recover from 15-40 down to protect her serve and reach 5-2 before wrapping it up on serve when Rybakina sent a forehand return long.View image in fullscreenJasmine Paolini overcame the disappointment of losing the second set on a tie-break to beat Veronika Kudermetova in her semi-final.Photograph: Daniel Kopatsch/Getty ImagesSwiatek, who has not lost a set in Cincinnati, will be seeking her second title in her past three tournaments.She won Wimbledon when she swept aside Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0in the final and then lost against Clara Tauson of Denmark in the fourth round in Toronto.Swiatek will be a heavy favourite in the final on Monday as she looks to go to the US Open with another title under her belt. She is 5-0 in matches against Paolini, including in last year’s French Open final.“Anyone who is going to be in the final will be super tough,” Swiatek said. “I will just focus on myself and try to continue the work that I’m been doing.

MacIntyre’s big overnight advantage was whittled to a single stroke after he started Sunday with two bogeys and, despite a gallant effort, he could do nothing to quell the American’s momentum.Back within touching distance with two to play, MacIntyre watched as Scheffler nailed a remarkable chip from the rough to in effect confirm his victory on the penultimate hole. It was hard to take for MacIntyre, who had produced his own memorable moment on the final hole on Saturday when he sunk a 41ft putt to retain his significant advantage.Europe’s Ryder Cup class of 2025 shapes up with familiar feel for US showdown | Ewan MurrayRead moreSeeking the win that would have sealed his place in Europe’s Ryder Cup team, MacIntyre made a nightmare start on Sunday but Scheffler was also far from perfect, a missed putt restoring the Scot’s two-stroke lead after three holes. The American hauled level on the 5th after MacIntyre found a bunker on his approach shot, and Scheffler looked to be in irresistible form as he moved two clear on the 13th.A Scheffler bogey five on the 14th reduced his lead again but the 15th proved pivotal as the Oban man failed to capitalise on Scheffler finding a bunker with his approach shot. He missed a birdie putt, while the American nailed his.But MacIntyre hadn’t given up, and cut the lead to one shot again with two to play, with a birdie four at the 16th after finding the green in two with a 265-yard second shot. However, after Scheffler’s uproarious response on the 17th, MacIntyre failed to respond with more final hole magic and putted out for a three-over-par final round of 73, two shots off Scheffler’s 15-under-par total of 265.View image in fullscreenBob MacIntyre would have secured his Ryder Cup place if he had managed to hold on to his lead after starting the fourth round with a four-shot advantage.Photograph: Andy Lyons/Getty ImagesThe title was Scheffler’s 18th on the PGA Tour, and the fifth this year, the second season in a row he has managed that total, something done before only by Tiger Woods.A final round of 67 shunted Tommy Fleetwood up to a tie for fourth place behind American Maverick McNealy, but England’s Harry Hall, who started Sunday tied for fourth, fell back with a disappointing 70 to finish in sixth place.Rory McIlroy was hampered by back-to-back double bogeys on the 5th and 6th holes as he failed to make inroads on the chasing pack, matching Hall’s final round of 70 to finish down in a tie for 12th.Explore more on these topicsGolfScottie SchefflernewsShareReuse this content"

A World Cup winner in 2014, the 35-year-old will compete in her fourth successive global showpiece for the Red Roses after being duly confirmed in the 32-player squad for the host nation. But Packer has been through a lot in the past 12 months. She was named world player of the year in 2023 and during the two seasons that she led England, the side won all 20 games.Then, in January, the openside flanker had the captaincy taken away, with the second-rowZoe Aldcroft given the armband. Packer was made a vice-captain for the 2025 Six Nations but was included in only two matchday squads.Defiance and determination have been hallmarks of her 111-cap international career. She has built a resilience and is keen to push the message that whatever is right for the team to put them in the best position to win the World Cup when it gets under way on 22 August is the decision she will always agree with. But she also describes decisions out of her control in 2025 as “tough”.View image in fullscreenMarlie Packer celebrates with the Six Nations trophy in 2022.Photograph: Ryan Byrne/Inpho/ShutterstockWhen asked which hurt more, having the captaincy taken from her or being left out of matchday squads Packer lets out a little laugh, looks away out of the window and is a little emotional before saying: “That’s a question isn’t it?”She adds: “When me and Mitch [the coach John Mitchell] sat down and talked about the captaincy, I am an openside flanker and what he sees and wants from his flanker is to cover six and eight; I don’t cover six and eight in the role he wants it to be.“The game has changed and evolved, that is the way he wants to play. I knew if I wasn’t starting that I am more likely not to be in that matchday 23. He has told me that in black and white. I know where I stand and where I sit.“Anything can happen, injuries happen so I always have to make sure I am ready. But with that, all I can keep doing is when we do extras at the end of training sessions I am showing I am upskilling myself in those areas so if I ever was called upon I know I can do what is asked of me. That’s all I can do.“I’m not going to lie to you and sit here and say that being left out of the matchday 23 wasn’t hard but what happened is that even though I wasn’t in the matchday 23, I still travelled with the squad, I was still a massive part of it. I felt so much value in that.”Nonetheless, being left out for the France game at Twickenham – when Englandsqueaked to a 43-42 victoryto seal their grand slam in April – stung.“It’s always tough not to be selected for the France game,” Packer says. “Playing at Allianz Stadium is everything. Two years ago when I captained my country to a world-record crowd and my son was mascot, that is one moment I bottle up and it means everything.View image in fullscreenZoe Aldcroft (right) has replaced Marlie Packer (left) as England captain.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA“But at the start of the game week [in 2025] Mitch says: ‘I want you in the coaching box with us.’ The value of learning what it’s like to be up there, what he is thinking, what he is seeing, the plans. You’re in the know, you’re trusted. That does mean a lot.“He’ll say it; it’s one man’s decision and it’s tough. But he genuinely cares and I know he does and I genuinely care about him and this squad as well.”Mitchell was full of praise for Packer at the World Cup squad announcement and it is clear she remains a key aspect of the Red Roses machine. She is also one of the most experienced in the squad with only Emily Scarratt – who is poised to feature in her fifth tournament – having played in more. But still doubt remained in her mind over her own selection.“Oh yeah,” Packer responds when asked if there were any worries around her selection. “100%, of course. Any athlete would tell you that in any sport. If you get comfortable being where you are then it’s going to get taken from underneath you.“You get swamped down with things but you have to keep pushing yourself to be the best of the best. We ain’t got time for people to be complacent in their role and in their job. We need to keep elevating each other and being the best of the best because that is the difference between winning and losing a World Cup.“I put myself in the best possible step to go to this World Cup. I came into pre-season, I felt fit, strong, and good.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For me I know where I’m at, head down, keep going, keep working hard and keep elevating everyone around me.”The warm-ups have not gone completely to plan, though, with Packer being sent off against Spain on 2 August, risking a suspension that would rule her out of the tournament. A disciplinary panel, however, handed her only a one-game ban, putting her out of the warm-up against France, but leaving her free to play at the World Cup.This may be Packer’s fourth World Cup but it is her first at home, something she describes as the “icing on the cake” with the cherry coming if the team win the trophy. The tournament has already broken records, selling the most tickets of any Women’s Rugby World Cup with 350,000 sold so far. The final at Twickenham is expected to be sold out which would set a new milestone for the highest-attended women’s rugby game.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Marlie Packer was sent off against Spain in August but avoided a ban that would threaten her World Cup.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersThe Red Roses have the opportunity to do something special by winning the trophy at home but they have fallen at the last hurdle in the previous two tournaments, losing both finals to New Zealand.The talk around that will inevitably grow the further England go in the competition but it is apparently not a focus in the Red Roses camp.Packer says: “That was three years ago and the one before that was eight years ago, there is no point living in the past. This is a whole new group of players. This is a whole new coaching staff apart from Deacs [the forwards coach Louis Deacon]. You have to be in the here and now.“The media can say and do whatever they want. Some players are going to read into it, some won’t but it’s what we know within. That’s all that matters.“We know we are going to be under scrutiny, we are the Red Roses. We have been a professional team for a lot longer than a lot of these other nations.We are the team that is ranked No 1 in the world with the highest-ever ranking that has ever been in rugby – not just women’s rugby. We are an outfit that can be scrutinised but what we know is we have got to keep living in the moment and enjoying it.”For Packer, past World Cups are chapters already written. Now, with doubts behind her and selection secured, her eyes are on the story England aim to write in this one.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025England women's rugby union teamWomen's rugby unionRugby unioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

The 29-year-old started only seven league games for City last season and was left out of their 27-man squad for the Club World Cup this summer. He was also omitted from the England squad last summer for the European Championship after losing his place following City’s 2023 treble-winning campaign.Premier League 2025-26 preview No 9: EvertonRead moreMoyes “tried to get as much information as I could” on Grealish’s problems at City, although he has not spoken to Guardiola about what occurred, but says the player’s hunger to recapture the form that made himBritain’s first £100m footballerbanished any doubts over the loan.“The knowledge that he thinks he’s got a little bit to prove and to stand up,” the Everton manager said on what convinced him to sign the England player. “I’ve had to do that myself. I’ve had to come back from being knocked down. Sometimes you have to have that resilience to bounce back, to fight back and to show everybody. I just sense Jack is carrying that with him now. I hope it shows through this season because, if it does, then we’ll get a lot of good things from Jack.”Grealish was Everton’s sixth summer signing – a seventh soon followed in the goalkeeper Tom King – but the squad remains light in several departments with various transfer targets missed. Moyes believes the legacy of recent relegation scraps and no European football has deterred some players but, with Grealish on board, Everton have stated their ambitions clearly.“It is a big thing for me,” Moyes said. “The club have done brilliantly to build a new stadium. I think now there has to be a building of a football club back inside it, to get it back to where it was and more importantly to get the team back to where it was. We are a long way off at the moment. I don’t think we can do that in this window and make the team what we want it to be, but we are going to need people along the journey to make it more exciting and make people want to come and play.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not since 2014 had Marc Márquez claimed six Grand Prix wins on the bounce as he inches closer to a seventh MotoGP crown with nine rounds remaining.Gresini Racing’s rookie Fermin Aldeguer found late race pace to finish second while Aprilia’s pole sitter, Marco Bezzecchi, who kept Marc Márquez at bay for as long as he could, finished third. Alex Márquez finished 10th after serving a long-lap penalty.“Super, super happy to finally take the first victory here in Austria,” Marc Márquez said. “I’m happy with six victories in a row, but (I need to) keep focus, next week we have another race.”Bezzecchi had claimed his first pole with Aprilia on Saturday and, despite finishing fourth in the sprint, this time he had the perfect launch to lead Francesco Bagnaia and Marc Márquez into turn one.View image in fullscreenMarc Márquez of Spain behind Marco Bezzecchi of Italy in the early stages of the race.Photograph: Guenther Iby/Getty ImagesThe two Ducatis went side by side on lap one when Marc Márquez briefly overtook his teammate but Bagnaia did not relent and took the place back to stay in second. However, Marc Márquez made the same move on the next lap to take second and set his sights on Bezzecchi, waiting for the right opportunity to pounce.“In the first part he [Bezzecchi] was super strong but then I just waited, I tried in the beginning but it was too risky, then I preferred to wait and attack in the end,” Marc Márquez added.Alex Márquez had a poor start and with a long-lap penalty to serve for causing a crash at the Czech Grand Prix, falling out of the top 10 when he rejoined the field.Explore more on these topicsMotoGPMotorcyclingMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The president vowed to take over DC – a promise he attempted to fulfill this week. Earlier this year, hesentnational guard troops to Los Angeles amid protests despite Californiaopposingthe move, which led to alawsuitfrom the state.City leaders say there are appropriate ways for the federal government to partner with them to address issues such as crime, but that Trump is using the pretext of crime and unrest to override their local authority, create chaos and distract from a bruising news cycle about histiesto Jeffrey Epstein.Many cities have worked to bring down violent crime rates – they are on the decline in most large cities, though mayors acknowledge they still have work to do to improve the lives of their residents.Democrats introduce joint resolution to end Trump’s ‘lawless’ DC takeoverRead more“President Trump constantly creates a narrative that cities likeSeattleare liberal hellholes and we are lawless, and that is just not the fact,” said Bruce Harrell, the mayor of Seattle. “We are the home of great communities and great businesses. So his view of our city is not aligned with reality. It’s to distract the American people from his failures as a president.”By sending in the military, some noted, Trump was probably escalating crime, contributing to distrust in the government and creating unsafe situations both for residents and service members.Even Republican mayors or mayors in red states have said they don’t agree with Trump usurping local control for tenuous reasons. The US Conference of Mayors, currently led by the Republican mayor of Oklahoma City, David Holt, pushed back against Trump’s takeover of DC, saying “local control is always best”.“These mayors around the country, by the way, from multiple ideological backgrounds, they love their city more than they love their ideology,” said Jacob Frey, the mayor ofMinneapolis.Mayors told the Guardian they are ready to stand up for their cities, legally and otherwise, should Trump come knocking. They are working with their chiefs of police to ensure they agree on the chain of command and coordinating with governors in the event the national guard is deployed. Because Trump has so frequently brought up plans to crack down on cities, large Democratic cities have been strategizing with emergency planning departments and city attorneys.This is not something that we should be used to, and we shouldn’t let this administration break yet another norm or standard in our societyBrett Smiley, Providence mayorBut Trump has shown he’s willing to bend and break the law in his pursuits against cities. The Pentagon isreportedlyplanning to potentially put national guard troops at the ready, stationed in Alabama and Arizona, to deploy to cities experiencing unrest. He has indicated this is just the beginning of an assault on cities. His attorney general sent letters to a host of Democratic cities this week,threateningto arrest local leaders if they don’t cooperate with federal authorities on immigration enforcement.The idea that troops could be on the ground for any number of reasons in cities around the US should alarm people, said Brett Smiley, the Democratic mayor of Providence, Rhode Island.“This is not something that we should be used to, and we shouldn’t let this administration break yet another norm or standard in our society, such that a couple years from now, we don’t think twice about when we see troops in our cities,” Smiley said.Why Trump is going after citiesThe roots of Trump’s battle with cities stretch back to his first administration, and they align with common narratives on the right about how cities today have fallen off because of liberal policies.Project 2025, the conservative blueprint, called for crackdowns on cities, including withholding federal funds to force compliance with deportation plans.His campaign promisesincludeda commitment to “deploying federal assets, including the National Guard, to restore law and order when local law enforcement refuses to act”. In avideofrom 2023, he explained: “In cities where there has been a complete breakdown of law and order, where the fundamental rights of our citizens are being intolerably violated, I will not hesitate to send in federal assets including the national guard until safety is restored.”In 2020, hereportedlywished he cracked down much harder and faster on protesters and rioters during the demonstrations after George Floyd’s murder. Now, he’s using smaller problems – anti-immigrationprotestsandcrimeagainst a government employee – to declare emergencies.Doing something like that in Minneapolis, it would be just a blatantly illegal usurpation of local control ... We would take immediate actionJacob Frey, Minneapolis mayorMinneapolis, where the protests began after a police officer killed Floyd, has at times made Trump’s list of rundown cities. Frey, a Democrat, said he didn’t know whether 2020 protests played a role in Trump’s current actions.“I don’t think anybody can pretend to know what’s in Donald Trump’s head,” Frey told the Guardian. “It’s an utter mess of idiocy. I don’t know what he’s thinking. I don’t know what he’s thinking or what the rhyme or reason is. I mean, clearly there’s a focus on Democratically run cities.”When Trump called out other cities on his radar, he named blue cities run by Black mayors –Baltimore, Oakland, Los Angeles, Chicago.“The fact that my city and all the others called out by the president on Sunday, led by Black mayors, are all making historic progress on crime, but they’re the ones getting called up – it tells you everything that you need to know,” Baltimore’s mayor, Brandon Scott, said in a press call this week.DC is differentThe federal government can often partner with cities to address crime – several Democratic mayors noted that they worked with the Biden administration on this front successfully. But those partnerships are mutually agreed upon collaborations, not overrides of local policing.“We’re not anti-federal help. We’re anti-federal chaos,” Frey said.Detroit’s mayor, Mike Duggan, said in a statement that his city is seeing its lowest homicides, shootings and carjackings in more than 50 years, crediting a partnership with federal agencies and the US attorney as a major part of that success.“This partnership is simple and effective: DPD does the policing and the feds have strongly increased support for federal prosecution,” Duggan said. “We appreciate the partnership we have today and are aware of no reason either side would want to change it.”Washington DC and White House agree to scale back Trump ‘takeover’ of city policeRead moreMayors are not saying they have solved the issue of violent crime, Scott said, though they are acknowledging they have reduced it and will continue to work toward further reductions. “We need folks that want to actually help us do that, versus try to take and show force and make us into something other than a representative democracy that we all are proud to call home,” he said.Mayors throughout the US made a clear distinction between Trump’s authority inWashington DCcompared to other cities. Washington has a legal provision in the Home Rule Act of 1973 that allows for a president to take over its police department during an emergency on a temporary basis, though Trump is the first to use this power. Other cities have no similar concept in law.Even with the Home Rule Act, Washington officials sued Trump after his attempt to replace the city’s police chief, saying the president was mounting a “hostile takeover” of DC police. Trump and the cityagreedto scale back the federal takeover on Friday, keeping DC’s police chief in place.“We know when people want to say they’re going to be a dictator on day one, they never voluntarily give up that aspiration on day two,” Norm Eisen, an attorney who frequently sues theTrump administration, said in a press call this week. “That is what you are seeing in the streets of the District of Columbia.”Cities are preparingIn Minneapolis, Frey said the city has prepared operational plans with police, fire and emergency management and readied itself legally.“Our chief of police and I are lockstep, and he reports up to the commissioner of safety, who reports up to me,” Frey said. “There’s no lack of clarity as to how this reporting structure works, and it certainly does not go to Donald Trump. Doing something like that in Minneapolis, it would be just a blatantly illegal usurpation of local control were this to happen here. Of course, we would take immediate action to get injunctive relief.”Trump’s decision to send in national guard troops to Los Angeles is also legally questionable. Governors typically direct guard troops. The California governor, Gavin Newsom,suedTrump for using the military for domestic law enforcement in defiance of the Posse Comitatus Act. The case washeard by a judgethis week.Trump is targeting sanctuary cities to settle political scores and potentially arrest his opponentsRead moreHarrell, of Seattle, said he is confident he will be able to protect his police department and the city’s residents if Trump sends troops.“What I have to do is make sure that the people under my jurisdiction as mayor feel confident in an ability to fight his overreach, and that our law department is well geared to advance our legal arguments,” he said.Scott, of Baltimore, said he was prepared to take every action “legally and otherwise”.Still, there is some uncertaintyand unsteadiness about how cities can respond if Trump calls up the national guard.“It’s very difficult to know what our options are, because we’re in unchartered territory here,” Smiley, of Providence, said. “It’s unprecedented and I don’t know what my options are with respect to preventing troops from coming in, which is one of the reasons that I’m trying to be so proactive about making it clear that it’s not necessary, it’s not wanted.”This article was amended on 17 August 2025. An earlier version stated that tanks were present in Washington DC, when they were actually Humvees.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsTrump administrationWashington DCDemocratsDonald TrumpUS militaryUS crimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

If the policies have not been withdrawn by then, we will lodge the summons for calling, and the government will have to defend its policies in court.“We are asking the court to issue a declarator that the school guidance and the prison guidance are unlawful and that they be reduced in whole. We are also asking that both policies are suspended in the meantime.”A Scottish government spokesperson said: “It would be inappropriate to comment on live court proceedings.”For Women Scotland previously brought a series of challenges over the definition of “woman” in Scottish legislation mandating 50% female representation on public boards.The last step of these ended in the supreme court ruling, which the campaign group’s supporters hailed as a “watershed for women”.Explore more on these topicsScotlandTransgenderScottish politicsPrisons and probationSchoolsGendernewsShareReuse this content"

But the “extreme hydraulics” of the waterfalls pushed Wardwell off his rappelling lines and trapped him behind a cascade of the Kern river, according to the sheriff’s office.His failure to return to his car that night prompted local law enforcement to spend 11 August searching for him with infrared technology and aircraft. Difficult terrain and fading daylight thwarted their efforts that day. But rescuers found Wardwell the next day after flying a drone behind the cascade in question.Wardwell was alive and conscious when rescuers spotted him, and he told them how he had become stranded there, the Tulare county sheriff’s office said. ACaliforniahighway patrol helicopter crew then managed to hoist him to safety to cap off what the sheriff’s office declared a “stunning survival story”.One dead and two missing after six people swept down waterfall in OregonRead moreWardwell received treatment for dehydration and “only minor injuries”, and he was reunited with family who had gone to the scene, the sheriff’s office said.The agency published video of Wardwell’s rescue on Facebook, where it captured attention from news media outlets that reported on the situation. The clip showed the helicopter whipping around foliage and water around the cascade before the crew lifted Wardwell onboard.An attraction for hiking and outdoors adventure enthusiasts, the Seven Teacups are in a secluded area about two hours south of the Sequoia national park, which itself is east of Visalia, California.Wardwell had rappelled the falls several times before,the San Francisco Chroniclereported. On his 10 August trip there, friends had accompanied him, though they opted to stop going further after seeing the rushing water’s power, Mike Crane, a California highway patrol flight officer paramedic, told the Chronicle.According to the outlet, Wardwell’s friends left a note on his car telling passersby to report him missing if the vehicle was still there the next day, which it was.Wardwell ended up nestling himself in a dark cave beneath the waterfall – completely soaked – after being thrusted off his rappel lines, the Chronicle added.Tulare county sheriff’s office captain, Kevin Kemmerling, told the Chronicle that Wardwell fought to escape for two days, “but there was nothing he could do to break through”.“There was no way for him to warm up or dry out in there, so it had to have been miserable,” Kemmerling said to the newspaper.Crane, speaking to the Chronicle, added: “I got the impression that maybe he didn’t know if he was ever going to get out of there.”The Tulare sheriff’s office said in its statement that it reminded members of the public “to always be aware of their environment and capabilities, especially when navigating white water rivers” like the one at the Seven Teacups.“Stay safe, stay smart and stay alive,” the statement from the sheriff’s office said.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Previously, it was just corporate consumers, company car drivers,” Schmidt said.While electric cars aremuch cheaper to ownthan their petrol equivalents, they often come with a higher purchase price. However, the arrival of smaller and cheaper models is seen as an important step in persuading lower-income buyers to make the switch from fossil fuel vehicles.European carmakers, such as Citroën-ownerStellantisand Renault, have started to introduce more affordable models to attract price-sensitive potential buyers and bring down the average emissions of their vehicle fleets in line with EU regulations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The EU introducedtariffs of up to 35% on Chinese-made EVsin late 2024, after a year-long anti-subsidy investigation, a move that has not been followed by the UK. Currently one in 10 electric vehicles currently on European roads are Chinese-made.In the final months of the year, the revival of a social leasing scheme in France combined with the re-introduction of a UK governmentelectric vehicle subsidy scheme– which will cut the price of some electric carsby up to £3,750– is also expected to increase sales.However, in the UK, a discount of up to 10% will only be available for the “greenest” cars and those priced at less than £37,000, meaning neither Teslas – which start at about £40,000 – nor Chinese-made cars from makers such as BYD will be eligible.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryMotoringElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsTravel and transportRenaultTeslaStellantisnewsShareReuse this content"

However, these birds come from a growing population in southernScotland. A recent project to reintroduce the birds in Scotland is likely to be a model for any reintroduction in England.Owing to persecution from gamekeepers and farmers, the species has been in effect extinct in England for about 150 years. The last native golden eagle, which lived alone on a reserve in the Lake District, disappeared in 2015.But after a decision to legally release beavers in England – a pair of the animals werereleased in Dorsetin March – the environment secretary, Steve Reed, is overseeing plans that could lead to golden eagles being brought back.Forestry England has carried out a feasibility study into whether and how the species could be reintroduced. While this is not due to be published for several months, it is understood that it concludes there is the capacity to support a population of the birds.Reintroducing extinct species is a complex process and needs to follow guidelines set out by the France-based International Union forConservationof Nature (IUCN), as well as being licensed by Natural England, the government’s nature watchdog.TheSouth of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectoffers a recent example to follow. While there are thriving populations of the birds in the Western Isles and Hebrides and in the north of mainland Scotland, with up to 600 breeding pairs in all, there were formerly only a handful in the south of the country. However, an official reintroduction programme begun in 2018 has led to the population growing from little more than three or four pairs to more than 50 – more than had been recorded in the region for more than 300 years.According to Duncan Orr-Ewing, the head of species and land management at the bird charity the RSBP, an English scheme would most likely follow the same model, with the focus likely to be the north of England.In the Scottish scheme, single chicks were taken from broods of two in established populations when they were about six to eight weeks old and then fed remotely with minimal human contact before they were released at specially chosen sites, with food initially provided until they could hunt for themselves.Such a method has also been used in reintroducing red kites and sea eagles, and has tended to work well, Orr-Ewing said, with high survival rates for the southern Scotland golden eagle project.While this depended on there being enough suitable sites containing sufficient prey, in the north of England this is unlikely to be an issue.Orr-Ewing said: “The main prey of golden eagles are things like grouse, rabbits, hares. But they can also take other things like deer calves, we’ve seen badgers, fox cubs, all of these sort of things. And you’ve got grouse moor estates. So I don’t think prey availability is going to be a problem.”The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said a reintroduction programme for England would also look at public engagement and would consider the impact on other species and the wider environment.A Defra spokesperson said: “The recovery of golden eagles offers hope for the future of the species in Britain. Any next steps of their reintroduction in England will be set out in due course.”Comeback storiesReintroducing birds and animals to places where they were previously extinct is a complex process, but there have been a series of examples in recent years.BeaversThe Eurasian beaver is native to Britain but was hunted to extinction about 400 years ago. About 20 years ago some were seen in Scotland, believed to have been illegally released into the wild. A formal reintroduction scheme in Scotland began in 2021 and the country now has an estimated population of about 1,500. After a similar scheme was begun in England, the first legally released animalswere set freein Dorset in May. In Julyit emergedthat no subsequent licences for beaver release had been granted, despite 40 expressions of interest.BisonIn 2022, three bisonwere releasedinto Kent woodland, the first wild examples of the creature in Britain for thousands of years. While this has so far been a one-off, the herd hasexpanded to six, and the bisons’ impact on the area has been credited with boosting biodiversity. The same conservation project has since also released a species known as the iron age pig, a cross between wild boar and domestic pigs that are similar to the wild pigs that roamed much of Europe thousands of years ago. It has also released longhorn cattle and Exmoor ponies.Red kitesRed kites had been common but loss of habitat and egg stealing meant that by the 1980s they had gone from England, with only a few pairs in Wales. In July 1990, two Welsh red kites and 11 from Spain – the chicks were brought in on a British Airways flight –were releasedin the Chiltern Hills, a process repeated over the next four years, with similar schemes happening in other areas. Red kites are now commonly seen in the Chilterns and there are an estimated2,000 breeding pairsin England, distributed across almost the whole country.Explore more on these topicsBirdsWildlifeConservationEnglandNorth of EnglandScotlandAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

The goal now is to vaporize it, along with the rocks on top.Crouched 1,000ft away from the blast site, Jack Greenhalgh, the US Forest Service master blaster veteran, shouts: “Fire in the hole!”He presses a remote detonator. Seconds later, four 50lb bags of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil (Anfo) go off.A boom echoes across the valley, and the air goes liquid as a shockwave sweeps over the group, causing workers to grip hard hats. Football-sized splinters of granite shoot into the sky. Leaves flutter to the ground. A cloud of acrid smoke blows over.“Stand by until we clear the area,” Greenhalgh mumbles, climbing out from behind his berm to inspect the damage – or success, depending on how one looks at it.View image in fullscreenWorkers slide a sled built of spruce saplings loaded with explosives into a metal culvert left by loggers in the 1980s and 90s.Photograph: Brendan Jones/The GuardianThe area where the group works is called Cube Cove, a 22,000-acre (8,900-hectare) addition to the 1m-acre Kootznoowoo wilderness on Admiralty Island, where the Tlingit people have lived, hunted and fished for at least 10,000 years. The wilderness makes up a chunk of the 17m-acre Tongass – by far the largest national forest in the United States.The Tlingit have long considered Admiralty Island, or Kootznoowoo, as sacred ground – a place of spiritual significance, ancestral knowledge and connection to a traditional subsistence lifestyle. Chartreuse-colored leaves of the spiny devil’s club, mustard-colored seaweed on the rocks and citrus-scented spruce tips create a distinct rainforest aroma.Kootznoowoo means “fortress of the bear”, a fitting name for a landscape home to the highest density of brown bears in North America. The landscape carries the marks of centuries of stewardship – from strips of yellow cedar used for ceremonial baskets to totem poles reflecting intricate clan histories. Eagles soar high above, chalky heads on pivot as they watch for herring or juvenile salmon.This morning, Daniels wears a bright orange safety helmet, his hands calloused from carving a 12in (30cm) block of Sitka spruce into a brown bear’s head. He lives in Angoon, 15 miles (24km) south of Cube Cove along the coast of the island, population 341. His clan house is shd’een hit, the Steel house, and he comes from Deisheetaan Naahaachuneidii, the original Raven Beaver clan of the Edge of the Nation people.Daniels emerges onto the old logging road, and gestures across the valley. “All of this, it’s not just land to us. It’s our ancestors’ land. We’re here doing more than just fixing roads or removing culverts – we’re reconnecting with our history, our identity and our future. Every culvert we remove, that’s a promise to our children that the land will heal.”View image in fullscreenJimmy Carter being given the name ‘Haa Hoo Woo’ by Chief Matthew of the Tlingit tribe during a White House ceremony in Washington, 4 May 1979.Photograph: Charles Tasnadi/APIn the 1970s, Daniels’s relatives along with others from Angoon fought to protect the island from clearcutting, holding bake sales, bingo games and raffles to fund trips to Washington DC. In 1978, elders met with Jimmy Carter. In 1980, the Alaska National Interest LandsConservationAct (Anilca) formalized protections for the Kootznoowoo wilderness, now part of the Admiralty Island national monument.However, that designation came with an asterisk: the sale of 22,890 acres of ancestral Tlingit hunting and fishing grounds to the Shee Atiká Corporation, one of the 13 Native corporations created during the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971.Over the next three decades, more than 80% of that land was clearcut. Culverts, like the one the team is blowing up today, were inserted, blocking the passage of baby salmon upriver.In 2020, the forest service purchased the Cube Cove land from Shee Atiká for $18m. The agency, alongside Kootznoowoo Inc, the Indigenous corporation based in Angoon, and SAWC, embarked on a five-year project to restore ecological functions, reconnect streams and support the traditional practices of the Tlingit people. The addition of Cube Cove signified the largest transfer of land into formal wilderness designation in the forest service’s history.“The purchase of this land opened a door,” Daniels reflects. “It gave us the chance to reconnect with these lands in a way that honors our ancestors and what they knew – how to live in harmony with nature, not dominate it.”View image in fullscreen‘Kootz’ crew member Walt Washington.Photograph: Brendan Jones/The GuardianWhen he was growing up in Angoon, Daniels recalls, his uncles and cousins talked about hunting and fishing in the area before the clearcutting.“My grandmother spoke of a ‘small sockeye run’ from here. I always thought she was talking about just a few fish. But actually, it’s thousands of fish – just kokanee salmon, which look like small sockeye.”Since 2022, Daniels and his crew – including his 24-year-old son Justin; 33-year-old Roger Williams; and 41-year-old Walt Washington – have been working to undo decades of damage.“We’re trying to get this forest back on its feet,” Daniels explains. “But it’s not just the trees. We’re restoring the entire ecosystem: the fish, the wildlife and the cultural traditions connected to this land.”Alegacy ofrestorationFollowing the all-clear from Greenhalgh, SAWC watershed scientist Kelsey Dean slings a forest service Pulaski – part ax and part adze – over her shoulder and follows the old logging road to the blast site. She describes dense thickets of spruce as “dog hair trees” where deer can’t forage, and bears can’t hunt deer.This six-day hitch we’re participating in is just the second blasting session in a much larger effort. At the end of five years, the team will have removed 80 of the 89 culverts left by loggers, and three bridges, Dean says.“We’re restoring habitat, improving hydrologic function and strengthening the land’s resilience. After that, it’s hands off,” she says, releasing the Pulaski to underline the point.Up ahead, a reddish-brown haze settles over the blast site. The crew gathers along the banks and stares into a triangular trench where the culvert once ran.Sean Rielly, a former wilderness ranger and forest service recreation specialist, slaloms down the mud and begins removing shards of the shattered culvert. Daniels and his crew follow, pushing boulders out of the new streambed. Suddenly, the goop of mud and alder leaves releases, flooding downhill. After an hour of work, a small mountain stream flows freely.“Now,” Dean says, “we watch for fish.”The fish are anadromous, she explains – a fancy word that means they spawn and then die. Their decaying bodies provide food for the carnivorous spruce, hemlock and cedar trees in a healthy stand of old growth. The salmon also sustain the brown bears prowling the island, their coats glossy with salmon oil, their humps shifting as they patrol the rivers, waiting for the salmon to arrive.View image in fullscreenA truck carrying recently cut old-growth trees in the Tongass national forest on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, on 2 July 2021.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesThe Cube Cove project reaches its midpoint at a moment when theTrump administrationrenews logging efforts in the Tongass. In June, the US Department of Agriculture announced plans to remove the Roadless Rule protections, exposing 7m acres of the Tongass to extensive clearcuts. Ecologists warn that cutting much of the old growth could release massive amounts of carbon stored in the trees.In fact, Dean says, when federal funding dried up, Cube Cove progress stalled. Luckily, SAWC was able to use wetlands mitigation money from the state of Alaska to account for the shortfall.“It’s unfortunate, what’s happening. The region is just now starting to recover from the violence of clearcutting,” says Rob Cadmus, director of SAWC. “At Cube Cove, what we’re doing essentially is cleaning up the mess left from logging. Going back to those timber bonanza days would be unconscionable, from an economic, environmental and psychic standpoint.”View image in fullscreenMaster blaster Jack Greenhalgh writing notes.Photograph: Brendan Jones/The GuardianFederal subsidies have long made old-growth logging in the Tongass artificially profitable. By selling timber below market value and covering high costs like road building and transportation, the government incentivizes larger logging companies from the lower 48 to cut down trees, despite the fact that south-east Alaska’s economy is shifting toward eco-tourism and fishing – industries that depend on preserving the Tongass intact, rather than transforming the mountains into a moonscape, with no habitat left for salmon to spawn.As the crew works with hand tools, Dean inspects the flow of water, while Greenhalgh examines the composition of dirt. The two assess whether a second “cleanup shot” of explosives might be necessary before abandoning the site. Hand tools can take care of the rest, they decide.As the sun sets over the mouth of the valley, the group begins a 3.5-mile hike along the logging road back to the ATVs and forest service truck. Along the way, Daniels nods toward an alternating series of oven-mitt-shaped prints in the ground – evidence of the island’s apex predators.“Bear have survived here for thousands of years,” he says. “And so have we. All of that makes what’s happening today feel really personal.”Rielly catches up and talks about all the time he spent behind a desk justifying the need for mechanized equipment and explosives and the minimum tool necessary to help the region’s recovery. In 2024, a youth group from Angoon removed a culvert barely beneath the ground using only standard forest service hand tools: Pulaskis, shovels, mattocks and rakes.The effort took seven days.“If we don’t do this work, the land will continue to degrade. Culverts clog, landslides are triggered, watersheds are blocked,” Rielly says. “This is the only way to get the job done quickly, especially in such remote terrain.”Through the scrim of spruce saplings, stumps of ancient old-growth loom: cedar, hemlock and spruce recorded at more than 1,000 years old. The group crosses the Ward Creek bridge, held in place by steel girders 8ft wide covered by creosote timbers. These will be removed at the end of the project, when the crew erases their footprints. On the other side of the bridge, Daniels, Washington and Williams hop on the ATVs, while the rest of the group pile into the truck for the 12-mile trip back to camp.View image in fullscreenA totem pole at the entrance of Náay I’waans, the Great House/the Whale House, the only traditional Haida longhouse left in the US, in the town of Kasaan in the Tongass national forest on Prince of Wales Island, on 4 July 2021.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesAfter showers in the ocean, the group congregates around a driftwood bonfire on the beach, where thousands of logs were once dumped and rafted together, on the way to the mill. Dean sips from a can of lime sparkling water – a treat in the remote area. Dressed now in flannel pajamas, Washington perches on a rock. He describes his work in the forest as engaging in a cycle of “destruction and renewal”.“The land will heal itself if left alone,” he says. “But sometimes you have to set a bone before it can heal properly. I know that this hard work we’re doing out here is for my children, and for their children down the line.”“What you’re seeing here is a version of the next generation of conservation – partnerships that connect people, place and purpose,” Cadmus of SAWC says. “When we’re out here working side by side, we build a bond that’s stronger than words. At the end of the day, that’s what heals us. We’re all in service to the land.”Explore more on these topicsAlaskaTrees and forestsFishConservationIndigenous peoplesWildlifeTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But after realising these flaws, some architects began using new technologies to designed buildings that do not rely on AC.“We wanted to show positive examples,” said Crimi. “Architects were implementing both modern ways of tackling heat, such as the building in the photo, but as well reviving ancient architecture. A solution exists for alternatives to air conditioning, but it requires affluence.”View image in fullscreen28C|71%|A family on a scooter in the Kemayoran neighbourhood of Jakarta, with high-rise buildings in the background, 2022Squarci said the streets of this subdistrict in Jakarta were crammed with scooters with multiple riders on them.

A luxury sports brand with a “spy-ready” ski-suit.HasJames Bondassembled a crack team that can successfully take on his latest adversary?Lawyers representing Danjaq, the US company that controls the rights to worldwide James Bond merchandising in conjunction with the UK company Eon Productions, have filed evidence running to 227 pages as it battles to retain control of the superspy’s name across Europe.In February,the Guardian revealedthat a Dubai-based property developer had filed claims in the UK and EU arguing that lack of use meant various protections had lapsed around James Bond’s intellectual property, including his name, his 007 assignation and the catchphrase “Bond, James Bond”.Nearly all nine of the trademarks being challenged relate to the merchandising of goods and services under the Bond name, which can be challenged after five years of “non-use”.Josef Kleindienst, an Austrian who isbuilding a $5bn (£3.7bn) luxury resort complexcalled the Heart of Europe on six artificial islands off Dubai, has argued that thetrademarks have been commercially underexploited.Boehmert & Boehmert, one of the largest intellectual property (IP) law firms in Europe, representing Danjaq, has hit back, filing evidence to the European trademark office from a who’s who of high-end partners still using the Bond name.The filing starts with the 140-year-old Jermyn Street tailor, Turnbull & Asser, which describes itself as the “definitive British shirtmaker” andcreated shirts for Sean Connery in the first Bond film, 1962’s Dr No, continuing to do so since for Bond actors including Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig.The firm is the personal shirtmaker to the king, who bestowed the company with his first royal warrant when, as the Prince of Wales, he was given the power to do so in 1980.View image in fullscreenLock & Co Hatters in London’s St James’s Street, which has existed since 1676, features in the evidence file.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianTurnbull & Asser created theshirt Charles wore on his coronation day in 2023, and a year later he renewed its royal warrant.The evidence file also features Lock & Co, the world’s oldest hatters with roots dating to 1676, whose heritage includes being responsible for fitting out first world war soldiers in their now familiar “Mark 1” tin helmets before being deployed overseas.The company, based in London’s St James’s Street, started its Bond relationship with one of its hats appearing in the now famousopening credit gun barrel scene in 1960’s Dr No.Lock & Co was also behind henchman Odd Job’sfamous lethal Coker, or bowler hat, in 1964’s Goldfinger.Bond fans can pay £537 for theJames felt trilby, Dr No editionwhile women might take to the£662 Vesper,originally created for Eva Green to wear as Vesper Lynd in 2006’s Casino Royale.“In cases such as this the brand owner should respond by providing a robust package of evidence, assuming they are able to do so,” said Mark Caddle, partner and trademark lawyer at the European IP firm Withers & Rogers. “Commercial use is often shown by sales figures and a selection of invoices to support them, as well as by evidence of marketing and communications activity, such as brochures, online advertising, physical advertising and social media posts.”Commercial information has also been provided for the luxury sports lifestyle brand Bogner.Willy Bogner Jr, who took over running the company founded by his father in 1932, has been credited for creating theworld’s first action skiing scenes for 1969’s On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.He went on to create alpine scenes for Bond productions including The Spy Who Loved Me, For Your Eyes Only and A View to a Kill.View image in fullscreenDaniel Craig as James Bond in No Time to Die.  Product information is provided by a luxury seller of No Time to Die combat trousers.Photograph: Pictorial Press/AlamyLast year, the company launched its “spy-ready” ski range – the Bogner X 007 collection –with products priced from $290 to $2,300(about £205 to £1,700).There is also product and commercial information from luxury cashmere and accessories brand N.Peal, founded in 1936 with a flagship store in London’s Burlington arcade, which stocks a modern take on Bond,including a pair of £245 No Time to Die combat trousers.Boehmert & Boehmert has called the trademark action an“unprecedented assault”on the multibillion-pound global franchise.“We will file evidence of use for each trademark,” said Rudolf Böckenholt, at Boehmert & Boehmert, in a defence filing. “Considering the number of goods/services at issue for each trademark, this will be a submission considerable in length and size, including numerous attachments and exhibits.”Kleindienst has extended his attempt to try to take control of the spy’s various brands by also submitting his own trademark for James Bond in Europe. He has not, however, done the same in the UK.The developer has said that he has launched the trademark action because he is concerned about the commercial future of the spy franchise, arguing that Bond“will not die” on his watch.Daniel Craig’s last outing as 007,in No Time to Die, was released in 2021. With no announcement yet of his replacement or timeline for production of the next film, the franchise is on track to beat the previous longest gap between instalments of six years and four months.Danjaq also co-owns the copyright to the existing Bond films, along with MGM Studios, which wasacquired by Amazon for $8.5bn in 2021. Days after the report of Kleindienst’s legal challenges, it emerged that Amazon hadpaid more than $1bn to gain full “creative control”of the franchise from Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, the longtime stewards of the Bond films.With creative control, Amazon now has the power to move forward with new films and potentially TV spin-offs, without approval from the two British-American heirs to the film producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli, who had overseen the integrity of the character originally created in 1953 by the author Ian Fleming.Denis Villeneuve, the man behind the Dune franchise, is directing the next Bond film. And Steven Knight, who is the co-creator of the gameshow Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and penned Peaky Blinders, has reportedly beenbrought on board to write the next 007 outing.In March, Amazon confirmed thatAmy Pascal and David Heymanwould produce the film, although no release date or lead actor has yet been named. Pascal has experience with the Bond series in her previous position as Sony’s chair of film, overseeing Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall. She also had producer credits on the latest Spider-Man series.Heyman is best known as the producer of the Harry Potter films as well as the Fantastic Beasts franchise and is now in pre-production onthe HBO TV series adaptation of the stories. He is the second most commercially successful film producer of all time, with credits including Gravity, Paddington, Barbie, Wonka and Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood.“We have the utmost respect for the legacy of James Bond,” said Kleindienst in response to the latest developments in the trademark case. “Yet we must acknowledge a simple truth: there are clear trademark and copyright laws, which exist to prevent prolonged inactivity and ensure that cultural properties continue to serve the audiences that value them. Our goal is straightforward – to respect the legacy while ensuring that Bond remains relevant and accessible to all fans.”This article was amended on 17 August 2025 to correct the spelling of the brand Bogner and of Willy Bogner Jr.Explore more on these topicsJames BondIntellectual propertyManufacturing sectorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The hearing, which has already been deferred several times, could force SSUK into compulsory liquidation, leaving a court-appointed official receiver to run the business.SSUK is the UK’s third-largest steel producer and employs nearly 1,500 people. The South Yorkshire-based business includes anelectric arc furnace at Rotherham, plus steelworks in Stocksbridge near Sheffield making steel for the car industry, as well as for use in construction and engineering.Financialpressure has been mountingon Gupta’s metals and energy companies stretching from Australia through Singapore and Romania to northern England, known as the GFG Alliance.The group has been in trouble since the 2021 failure ofGreensill Capital, which collapsedafter lending GFG about $5bn (£3.7bn).

He has pleaded not guilty.Some industry figures have said they expect the government tostep in to ensure the plants keep runningif they fall into liquidation – although it is not thought that the government will give financial support to Gupta’s companies.A spokesperson at the Department for Business and Trade said: “We continue to closely monitor developments around Liberty Steel, including any public hearings, which are a matter for the company.”Continued financial pressures on Gupta’s companies have followed years of difficulty for the wider UK steel industry. British steel production fell to its lowest level since the 1930s in 2024, and the government in effecttook over the British Steel blast furnaces at Scunthorpein April, amid fears of more than 2,700 job losses and the end of primary steel-making in the UK.Explore more on these topicsSteel industrySanjeev GuptaManufacturing sectorNorth of EnglandSouth YorkshireRotherhamSheffieldnewsShareReuse this content"

However, that timeline was thrown into question after the union told Reuters it would challenge the return-to-work order, which it described as unconstitutional.It was the latest twist in talks that have dragged on since March as the flight attendants seek to address the fact that they are not compensated for work carried out when planes are not in the air such as time spent on the ground between flights or helping passengers to board.On Saturday, Canada’s federal jobs minister, Patty Hajdu, said it was clear the talks had reached an impasse and that the impact was being felt by Canadians and visitors across the country.“The talks broke down,” said Hajdu as she told reporters that she had asked the Canada Industrial Relations Board to order an immediate end to the strike and to impose binding arbitration. “It is clear that the parties are not any closer to resolving some of the key issues that remain and they will need help with the arbitrator.”She appeared to link her actions to the toll thatUS tariff increaseshad taken on the Canadian economy. “In a year in which Canadian families and businesses have already experienced too much disruption and uncertainty, this is not the time to add additional challenges and disruptions to their lives and our economy,” she said in astatement.Hajdu’s power to halt the strike stems from a section of the Canada Labour Code, which gives the ministerunilateral authorityto end work stoppages in order to “maintain or secure industrial peace”. While the section was rarely used by previous governments, the Liberal government has invoked it several times in the past year,quelling strikesby workers at Canadian ports, the post office and railway companies. Analysts havevoiced concernsthat the use of the clause may be undermining workers’ rights.The union representing the flight attendants decried the Liberal government for stepping in within hours, accusing it of violating their right to take job action. Air Canada had reportedly previously requested that the government intervene to impose binding arbitration.Wesley Lesosky, of the Canadian Union of Public Employees,saidthe government was giving “Air Canada exactly what they want – hours and hours of unpaid labour from underpaid flight attendants, while the company pulls in sky-high profits and extraordinary executive compensation”.According to the aviation analytics firm Cirium, the airline had cancelled 671 flights by Saturday afternoon, leaving some travellers stranded overseas and others scrambling to find alternatives during the busy summer travel season. About 130,000 customers a day could be affected by a disruption, according to the airline.The airline said earlier it had offered its flight attendants “an increase of more than 38% on global compensation”, but the union said the figure failed to fully account for inflation. Air Canada also said it was willing to pay flight attendants 50% of their wage for work done before planes take off, leading the union to reply that its members should be fully compensated for their labour.About 70% of the airline’s flight attendants are women, said Natasha Stea, a local union president and flight attendant. She questioned whether they were being treated fairly, given that Air Canada pilots, thevast majorityof whom are men, received asignificant raiselast year.“We are heartbroken for our passengers,”she told the Associated Presslate last week. “Nobody wants to see Canadians stranded or anxious about their travel plans, but we cannot work for free.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAir transportUnionsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Gusty winds and flooding tides could wash out parts of the highway that connects the North Carolina Outer Banks by midweek, the US’s National Weather Service (NWS) said.Bermuda could have similar conditions as Erin is forecast to turn to the north and then north-east, forecasters said.Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, reached category 5 status before weakening, with maximum sustained winds of 125mph (205kph) late on Sunday morning, according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami.The winds decreased as the storm went through internal changes. Erin is expected to remain powerful for the next several days, forecasters said.The storm’s center was about 170 miles (270km) north of San Juan,Puerto Rico, and nearly 270 miles (435km) east of the Grand Turk Island, moving west-northwest at 14mph (22 km/h).The rain and winds from Erin’s outer bands leftmore than 147,000 customers without power Sunday morning inPuerto Rico, a US territory, according to Luma Energy, a private company that oversees the transmission and distribution of power on the island. The weather canceled more than 20 flights, officials said.Swells were also expected to affect portions of theVirgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and the Turks and Caicos Islands during the next couple of days, the NHC reported.A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, and in this case, within 24 hours, the NHC said. Heavy rain is still expected across the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, with rainfall of 3-6in (about 7.6-15cm), with 8in in some isolated areas.The government of the Bahamas also issued a tropical storm watch for the south-east Bahamas.Scientists have linked the rapid intensification of hurricanes in the Atlantic to theclimate crisis, which is driven by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Global warming is causing the atmosphere to hold more water vapor and is spiking ocean temperatures, and warmer waters give hurricanes fuel to unleash more rain and strengthen more quickly.Explore more on these topicsHurricanesPuerto RicoVirgin IslandsCaribbeanUS weathernewsShareReuse this content"

The goal is to show that the campaign isn’t a flash-in-the-pan win, but instead a burgeoning tide shift toward a leftwing political future divorced from capitalism, despite criticism from traditionalistDemocratsand Republicans alike.“Zohran Mamdani’s win in New York or Omar Fateh in Minneapolis, also poised to become a socialist mayor of a major city – these are things that come after years of structure that DSA helped build up in a bunch of chapters … This is also why DSA is growing so much and having all this new energy, because we’re just really demonstrating what the alternative is,” said Ashik Siddique, the national co-chair of the DSA. “The Democratic party has not really presented a meaningful alternative.”With the DSA’s membership havingsurged in recent months, and both the 2026 midterm and 2028 presidential elections on the horizon, this weekend’s convention was a key opportunity for many to strategize on how to capitalize on expanding influence and recent wins.“There’s so much excitement around our huge victory, Zohran Mamdani winning the primary,” said Gustavo Gordillo, co-chair for theNew YorkCity chapter of the DSA. “People are coming up to us and asking us about the campaign, wanting to learn from our experience as well, and I’ll say that the big change that I’ve seen over the years is that DSA as an organization has matured politically.”While the NYC-DSA continues its work, other chapters will attempt to follow its lead, organizing around their own socialist candidates while the national DSA organization reaffirms its position on Palestine, organizes to end US aid to Israel, supports the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement – which calls on consumers to stop supporting both Israeli companies and companies that have supported Israel – and stands against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in solidarity with immigrants.The Mamdani effect: how his win spurred more than 10,000 progressives to consider run for officeRead moreThat and a clear economic agenda that supports the working class “over billionaires, the bosses, the corporations that are raising prices, that are keeping our wages low” are what will lead to further success for democratic socialist candidates, in Gordillo’s eyes.Persistence can also be helpful.It helped Alex Brower, who won his election forMilwaukeecommon council district three alderman in an April special election after the death of his predecessor, in his third bid for office as a democratic socialist.“That happens to a lot of socialists because … if socialists were 100% successful, we’d have a socialist America right now. So there’s a lot of losing, but I think, honestly, I think we learn more by losing than winning,” Brower said.Many DSA-endorsed candidates will also be deep in the throes of fieldwork in the coming months: knocking on doors, attending events, meeting with neighbors and being visible in communities, all key to keeping the DSA’s recent momentum going, according to Ephros, who is currently running for the Jersey City council on a platform of affordable social housing, universal rent control, universal childcare, public healthcare and the Green New Deal, among other issues.“It goes a long way to just demonstrate: ‘Oh, this isn’t some shadowy, weird, fringe guy who calls himself a socialist and that means scary things to me; it’s my neighbor and he’s active in the community and he’s showing up,’” he said.Over the three days of the convention, the conference’s largest in its history, DSA members gathered to deliberate resolutions that will guide chapter actions and concerns over the next two years.Members voted to approve a measure for “a fighting anti-Zionist DSA”, a resolution that prompted much debate and some resistance due to a clause that would expel members for supporting Israel. Arguments both for and against the measure were raised to the crowd of voting members on Sunday afternoon, delayed by calls from DSA leadership to hold applause in favor of the silent American Sign Language motion for clapping, consisting of the waving of both hands. The request was only mildly successful.Members also voted to prioritize efforts to put up a DSA-endorsed socialist candidate for the 2028 presidential election, and elected both new and returning delegates to the DSA’s national political committee, the 16-person body that serves as the organization’s board of directors.On Friday, members heard from Rashida Tlaib,the keynote speaker for this year’s convention. As one of Congress’s most outspoken supporters of Palestine, Tlaib largely spoke about the responsibility Congress has to condemn Israel’s bombing and starvation of the people in Palestine. She also emphasized the work she believes the DSA still has to do.View image in fullscreenRepresentative Rashida Tlaib questions the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, during a hearing on Capitol Hill on 24 June 2025.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images“For DSA to live up to our potential, we have to be willing to grow ourselves. We need more members for more diverse communities and leadership roles, y’all. We are failing, and again, I’m telling you as a big sis, we are failing when a room like this only has a handful of our Black neighbors. You need to be intentional,” Tlaib said to Friday’s intently listening crowd.“A lot of working-class folks have strong historical ties to the Democratic party. They know they have been let down, and they’re looking for a new home. They want to envision the alternatives, and we have it.”Álvaro López, an electoral coordinator for NYC-DSA who assisted Mamdani’s campaign, attended the DSA convention for the first time after being a member since 2017. He’s grappling with what to take from the convention’s more introspective measures.“In this convention, unfortunately, Donald Trump was not raised. Zohran’s victory was not strategically discussed, and I think that’s a product of our larger, big-tent organization that we have. I think there is a lot of work for the left and the DSA to still get to a point where we are really thinking about how do we build power, and how we are not so inward looking and think of ourselves as the protagonist of everything around us,” López said.The NYC-DSA’s strategy for creating successful campaigns has previously involved contesting local and state-level positions, before shifting to one that seeks to place democratic socialists in the highest levels of local politics. With many DSA chapters strategizing what that looks like for them back home, taking similar steps may help, Gordillo believes.“Many working-class people, for example, don’t really know what the state assembly is,” he said.“It’s harder to get traction or to do mass communications that way, so we decided to run a socialist for mayor,” he said of reaching voters in local elections. “We need to do that, not just in New York City. We need to do it inMinneapolis. We need to do it in Los Angeles and in Detroit and Michigan, eventually in 2028. I hope that we take that to the federal stage in the presidential run.”A resolution brought up at this year’s DSA convention would create a strategy to build socialism in each of the 50 states and help the DSA build more statewide organizations. The DSA has also previously expanded an electoral program to provide more support to chapters that want to learn how they can run their own candidates and develop class-struggle elections.It’s political actions like these that can be the key to winning races, even by the smallest of margins, Tlaib said on Friday, reminding DSA members of her win in 2018 by only 900 votes.“We are standing at a crossroads in American history,” Tlaib said. “We are going to take this country back for our working families and defeat these pathetic, cowardly, hateful fascists. We’re going to win because we don’t have any other options, and yes, we are going to free Palestine. They don’t have any other choice. Our movement isn’t going anywhere, and we’re just getting started.”Explore more on these topicsSocialismUS politicsDemocratsNew YorkMinneapolisZohran MamdaniChicagofeaturesShareReuse this content"

But as the country goes through itssecond-worst burn on record, the blazes come with a twist: few are coming from the western provinces, the traditional centre of destruction.Instead, the worst of the fires have been concentrated in the prairie provinces and the Atlantic region, with bone-dry conditions upending howCanadaresponds to a threat that is only likely to grow as the climate warms.Experts say the shift serves as a stark reminder that the risk of disaster is present across the thickly forested nation.Canada wildfire season already second worst on record as experts warn of ‘new reality’Read moreIn recent weeks, tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes due to the wildfires. Saskatchewan and Manitoba have been the worst hit, covering more than 60% of the area burned in Canada. But the fires have also seized strained resources in Atlantic Canada, where officials in Newfoundland and Labrador are struggling to battle out-of-control blazes.In response to the crisis, the Newfoundland premier, John Hogan, said on Wednesday morning he would temporarily ban off-road vehicles in forested areas because the province “simply cannot afford any further risks, given the number of out-of-control wildfires we have”.The ban follows a similar move by Nova Scotia, where a 15-hectare (37-acre) out-of-control fire is burning outside the provincial capital, Halifax. In addition to barring vehicles in wooded areas, Nova Scotia officials so shut down hiking, camping and fishing in forests, a decision reflecting the troubling fact that nearly all fires in the province are started by humans.“Conditions are really dry, there’s no rain in sight, the risk is extremely high in Nova Scotia,” the province’s premier, Tim Houston, told reporters. “I’m happy to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to protect people, to protect property and try to just get through this fire season and really just pray for rain.”Fires have even erupted in Ontario’s Kawartha Lakes region, a collection of rural communities less than 100 miles (160km) north of Toronto that are a popular summer destination for residents of Canada’s largest city.For a country of sprawling landmass, fires have long been a common feature of the hot spring, summer and autumn. But for the last century, a mix of geography, climate and industry meant that the biggest and hottest fires – and the vast majority of destruction – have been concentrated in Canada’s western provinces.That changed in 2023 when Canada had its worst fire season on record and thethick haze of smoke blanketed the US.View image in fullscreenNew York blanketed with smoke from Canadian wildfires in 2023.Photograph: David Dee Delgado/Getty Images“We had fire everywhere. We had evacuations everywhere. We had smoke at a scale that was remarkable,” said Paul Kovacs, the executive director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction at Western University. “And so for the first time, we had a different thought about wildfires as a country. With all of the smoke, it became a global conversation. This year is repeating all of that. This is a national issue. This can show up anywhere.”Kovacs, whose organisation focuses largely on preventing structural loss, said more buildings had been destroyed this year compared with 2023, and he warned that a majority of the residents of the most fire-prone parts of the country, such as British Columbia and Alberta, had not yet taken steps to protect or “harden” their homes from fire risk.He hopes that a broader national recognition of fire risk spurs people in other parts of the country to reassess how vulnerable their home or business might be to a fast-moving blaze.“That’s the behavioural change we’re hoping to see next, because there will be many years of fires to come,” he said. “The size of the burned area will not go back to where things were 25 years ago. This is just our new reality and we need to be prepared. We need a change in mindset and a recognition that this can, and probably will, happen in so many parts of our country.”Already, nearly 7.5m hectares (18.5m acres) have burned across Canada in 2025, far above the 10-year average.Despite the national threat, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to reducing risk, said Jen Baron, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia’s Centre for Wildfire Coexistence.“British Columbia and Alberta have long been the poster children for this wildfire problem for a long time, but other regions are beginning to experience some of those same challenges,” she said. “This speaks to the pervasiveness of climate change: even if a location was relatively low fire risk in the past, with the extended droughts that we’re seeing, that’s no longer the case now and into the future.“Even though some parts of the country are having a wet year on average, things across the board are still warmer and drier than they were in the past.”Canada: generations old and new scramble to contain fires burning at record paceRead moreThat uncertainty has prompted amultimillion-dollar funding effortfrom the federal government to study risk and adaptation, because “there are very few parts of Canada that would be totally protected from wildfire”, Baron said.With aninternational focus on wildfires, experts like Baron hope the recent years of immense blazes and choking smoke can spur a response that acknowledges thelegacy of forestry industry practices, urban encroachment into the wilderness and theIndigenous stewardship of forests.“We’re just starting to catch up to the scale of the problem,” she said. “Wildfire is a natural ecological process, but it’s become increasingly challenging to manage with changing climatic conditions.”The concerns in Canada echo those emerging across the Atlantic as southern Europe grapples with one of its worst wildfire seasons in two decades.In Spain, officials were scrambling on Sunday to contain 20 major wildfires. The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said during a visit to the north-western region of Galicia: “There are still some challenging days ahead and, unfortunately, the weather is not on our side.”After fires killed three people and burnt more than 115,000 hectares, Sánchez said his government would seek to put forward a “national pact” to deal with the climate emergency.“We need to reflect deeply on how we can rethink our capabilities, not only in terms of responses but also in terms of preventing everything related to the climate emergency, whether it be fires, storms, or any other climate-related natural disaster,” he said.In Portugal, the area burned by wildfires this year is 17 times higher than in 2024, at about 139,000 hectares, according to preliminary calculations by the Institute for the Conservation of Nature and Forests. Across Europe, countries such as Greece, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Albania have requested help from the EU’s firefighting force as exhausted officials battle forest fires, fuelled by record-breaking temperatures, dry conditions and strong winds.In Canada, Baron said the mild nature of this year’s western fire season provided a glimpse into the country’s future.“Instead of one big fire year every 15 or 20 years, every year will be big in some part of the country,” she said. “We really don’t know exactly how climate change is going to continue. It doesn’t drive things in linear ways. And we can’t predict where there’s going to be a drought next year. But it will be somewhere.”Additional reporting by Ashifa KassamExplore more on these topicsCanada wildfiresCanadaWildfiresClimate crisisExtreme weatherAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, the Booker prize-winning author of Shuggie Bain sits down with the record-breaking artist to talk early success, bad reviews, and the joys of making artDouglas Stuart & Jenny SavilleSun 17 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTShareIn the summer of 1992, I was a 16-year-old who was watching his mother drink herself to death. I had a desperate need to find work and somewhere to stay, and so remaining in education didn’t seem like a possibility. I had two teachers who saw how I was struggling. They dreamed a future for me that I could never have imagined for myself. One evening they took me up to the degree show at the Glasgow School of Art, and there I came face to face with the paintings ofJenny Saville.The power of that encounter has never left me. Those images were fierce and confrontational. A few months after the degree show, I lost my mother to her addiction. With the support of my teachers, I eventually finished school and went on to art school and built a career in design. Meanwhile, the GSA degree show formed a body of work that would lead to Jenny’s ascension into the Young British Artist movement – with her works appearing on the covers of Manic Street Preachers’ albums The Holy Bible and Journal for Plague Lovers – and help cement her reputation as one of the greatest British painters of any generation.View image in fullscreenJenny Saville’s Compass, 2013.Photograph: Mike Bruce/© Jenny Saville. Courtesy GagosianI have often returned to Jenny’s paintings as inspiration for my writing, especially when thinking about the body, the clarity of a child’s gaze, a mother’s vulnerability. Writing is my way of painting. I try to conjure pictures in the minds of my readers and surround them with a world that feels as vivid as any visual work. Jenny’s paintings contain many narratives; that of the image, loaded with emotion, tenderness, brutality, movement. But they also contain the narrative of their own making. You can read the journey a painter takes, following her decisions through every brushstroke. It is not unlike the sketching and building and drafting of a novel.On the occasion of Jenny’s crowning retrospective at the National Portrait Gallery in London, I wanted to revisit what her paintings have meant to me. So, 33 years after that fateful summer in Glasgow, we spent the afternoon together in her studio in Oxford and finally had the chance to talk.Douglas StuartLooking back now, what do you think your 22-year-old self would think about this show at the National Portrait Gallery?Jenny SavilleWell, it’s exciting. My 20s were an incredible time. Before that, I had waitressing jobs alongside being at art school. But during the summer between my third and fourth year, I worked to put enough money in the bank so that I wouldn’t have to. And I learned a lesson about time: that it was the most precious aspect of life. It was wonderful to be able to paint every day: everything came together, and my degree show had my first mature pictures.DSDid you always know that you wanted to work in paint?JSI always painted or made things from a young age. The permission for creativity was strong in my upbringing. My parents were teachers and would encourage creativity.View image in fullscreenJenny Saville’s Propped, 1992.Photograph: © Jenny Saville. Courtesy GagosianDSIn a lot of ways, you were the one who gave me my first creative awakening. Growing up in Glasgow, I’d never been to a museum or a gallery. A couple of art teachers at school could see I was struggling. One night after school, they said: “Look, just come with us,” and took me up to the Glasgow School of Art to the 1992 degree show. A lot of it was lost on me, because I was only a kid. But then I turned the corner and there was Propped, and although I didn’t understand all the layers of it, I was blown away. In that one moment, your work changed the course of my entire life.JSWas that the first time you went to the building?DSFirst time. I grew up less than a mile away from it and hardly knew it existed. Even if I had, I would have been intimidated; working-class kids don’t always feel that they’re invited into those circles.When I was writing [Douglas’s 2020 debut novel]Shuggie Bain, I looked at Trace (1993–94) a lot. It was an image that I had of Shuggie when he takes off his mother’s bra to care for her because she can’t care for herself, and he’s looking at her back, at the lines left in the flesh, and rubbing them and hoping they would lift. As if he could erase them, he could take away some of her pain.JSHilary Robinson, my theory tutor for my dissertation, had written an essay where she said: “A body is not a neutral ground of meaning but a copper plate to be etched.”DSThose paintings were helpful in slowing me down. They ask us to observe closely. They challenged me to write about bodies in a similar way, and it’s essential because the body is a very political thing. It’s often the only thing that my characters have: their bodies are shaped by what they do, and their lives are shaped by how they use their bodies to survive.JSThere’s a lot of attention concentrated on our bodies. You see that shift in the high street, the way the shops change over the years: you used to have a post office, a stationer’s, a butcher; now many have transitioned to nail bars, tanning salons, tattoo parlours.View image in fullscreenThe art of us … Jenny Saville and Douglas Stuart.Photograph: Courtesy of GagosianDSI was at a university a couple of weeks ago to do a reading of Shuggie Bain. It’s only five years old but I can’t yet look back on him with fondness. All I wanted to do was rewrite the book. I wished I had a red pen. Do you look back with kindness? With fondness?JSFondness sometimes, or I find my fearless naivety a bit amusing. Often I hear the music that was playing at the time, look at passages of paint and remember making that mark, the size of brush I used, the feeling inside. When I see my paintings I often think: “Oh, that part worked, but maybe I should have put another bridging tone there.” People say: “Oh, that’s a great painting,” and you think: “It’s not as good as it was in my head.”DSIt’s similar with writing: your audience encounters the finished artefact and they don’t see the journey and the loneliness.JSI wouldn’t call it loneliness. I enjoy making paintings.DSI find writing very lonely because I worked for 20 years in fashion. Now, writing in contrast to fashion feels incredibly lonely because I sit around and talk to imaginary people all day.JSDo you have a routine?DSI find that imaginary people are chattiest in the mornings, so I try to get up at six o’clock and I work till two or three in the afternoon. How about you?JSI’ve had different working rhythms and routines in my life. Recently I’ve been getting up about 6.30 in the morning and then I’ll paint until I feel that lull, which tends to be around four, and then I might do another session. I like painting eyes first thing in the morning.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It has evolved so much. In the early work I can actually feel Glasgow in the paintings.Portraits so powerful they override reality – Jenny Saville: The Anatomy of Painting reviewRead moreJSGlasgow can have beautiful light. My first home there was on Hill Street, and you’d look over toward the flats and mountains and see this silvery light. I’ve never seen it anywhere else quite the same way. Over the last few years I’ve thought much more about nature and light. I’d travel, look at other approaches to painting. I went to Paris and New York and saw how [Willem] de Kooning painted flesh and thought: “What great colours and fluidity.” Then after 11 September and the Iraq war, we were flooded with images that had a lot of intense colour and emotion and I responded to the atmosphere of that time. My work evolved and I started using ranges of red and blue pigments, for example, like in my Stare heads. If you’re curious you experiment, and on that journey you discover possibilities.DSThe same in writing. You’ve got to write through it, to free yourself of it, and then get to the thing that you’ve got no idea that you were heading toward. You’re feeling a character and you’re not quite sure what they’re going to do, so you build this world for them and then you see how they react.View image in fullscreenJenny Saville’s Chasah, 2020.Photograph: Prudence Cuming Associates Ltd/© Jenny Saville.

I often think: “That’s almost what I meant, that’s got something.” And this moves you forward to the next painting.DSTruth is essential in writing. And there’s power in writing truths that people would rather leave unsaid – maybe like depicting a body that some might rather not see? I must admit, I was horrified looking back at the journalism around some of your earlier work, and the fact that reviewers would use the word “grotesque” to describe it. Obviously those works haven’t changed, but the world around us keeps shifting, so hopefully reactions have changed as well. Has that journey been interesting to you, or do you not pay attention to it?JSI just get on with my work. You can’t predict how work will be perceived. And you evolve as well. In the early 90s there were fewer spaces to show, and only a small minority of artists got major platforms. Now art is exhibited from all over the world and different voices are being heard. And then once you’ve been accepted, it’s like, you’ve won the Booker prize, you can’t stay annoyed about that.DSI felt really overwhelmed by the feeling of being on the outside and nobody knowing me. And then suddenly everybody looked at me like: “Where the hell did youjustcome from?” There was 15 years of work behind my novels so I hadn’tjustarrived, I’d just been quietly over there where no one was paying attention to me. I miss that.JSIt’s important to have time to develop, be playful, use your imagination. I’m often judged on those early degree show works and I’ve developed my painting a lot since then. You have to make the work the way it should be. You can’t make work to appease people who have written a bad review. And if you’re mature about it, the bad review of a new body of work is OK.View image in fullscreenJenny Saville’s Aleppo, 2017-18.Photograph: Lucy Dawkins/© Jenny Saville. Courtesy GagosianDSThat’s very big of you. I’m not sure I’m quite there yet. That’s why the world is so nostalgic for the 90s: a time before the internet, for that sense of being by ourselves inside our own lives, without constant commentary and feedback.I’m fascinated by what Cy Twombly told you once about working: about trying to be ignored for as long as you can in your career, which is so smart.Douglas Stuart on Shuggie Bain and his tough start: ‘Living with an alcoholic, there wasn’t much I didn’t see’Read moreJSBy the time he’d told me that, everybody wanted to know Cy, to show his work and talk to him. And your impulse is to look at that with admiration, but I could see there was a kind of suffering in his words, because you need to concentrate, you need time to play, and that’s probably why he worked in isolated places, so he could focus. You can’t have judgment when you play. You want to be like that child sitting on the floor making a painting when nobody cares: that’s the most precious thing because it’s a space without judgment, and you need to feel that.DSYou’ve got to retreat from the world. But was your early success overwhelming at 22, or did it just feel like permission?JSMany opportunities happened in a short space of time. I was fortunate to sell my degree show, which was the first time I had enough money to work for a prolonged period. I had this run of wonderful things happen. And as I moved forward I just said to myself: “Get this work right, make this work the best you can.” I stayed quiet and concentrated. And that’s the lesson I learned: that the prize is the journey.

She discusses confidence, self-consciousness, growing up in the spotlight, the pain of social media and dealing with her parents’ very public divorceSun 17 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTSharePrincess Tiaamii Crystal Esther Andre is no stranger to TV. She made her debut in the reality show Katie & Peter: The Baby Diaries which documented the first six weeks of her life. Her first two years were chronicled in subsequent reality shows, until her parents, the model and entrepreneur Katie Price and the singerPeter Andre, split up in 2009. Andre continued to make regular appearances on her parents’ solo reality shows.Now that she has come of age, 18-year-old Andre has her own four-part reality show, The Princess Diaries, on ITV2. As you would expect, it has already made headlines. While her father is a regular on the show, her mother is not. As I approach the cafe in Surrey where we are meeting, the Sun and the Mirror publish stories saying that Price is devastated not to have been invited to Andre’s 18th birthday party or to have been included in the show, adding that her daughter is “too scared” to tell the truth about the family rift. So, business as usual.Andre is here today with her manager, Marie-Claire Giddings – another echo from the past. When Peter and Price were making reality shows together, their manager, Claire Powell, was omnipresent. After their bitter divorce, Powell continued to manage Peter. Neither she nor Peter talk to Price today. Giddings works for Powell.I tell Andre that we have met before. She looks surprised. No wonder. Andre was eight months old at the time and I was interviewing her mother. There is a symmetry to their lives that astonishes Andre. Price, then known as Jordan, was queen of the Page 3 slot in the Sun by 18. “As I started building my own career, Mum said it’s crazy that I was your age when I started doing these things. I was like:really!I was shocked.” About her doing topless modelling at such a young age? “No, that she was so successful at that age.”View image in fullscreenAndre with her parents and her brother Junior in 2009.Photograph: Amy Graves/WireImageAndre says she probably wouldn’t do topless modelling herself. “That’s not as popular nowadays and it just doesn’t appeal to me. But I have nothing against anyone who does it, obviously.” She orders a hot chocolate.Price became a hugely successful brand. By the time we met in 2007, she had lines in makeup, books, bras – you name it – and was worth an estimated £30m, although she was subsequentlydeclared bankrupt twice(in 2019 and 2024). Andre says in her show that few people are aware of her own ambitions to be a successful businesswoman.I show her the headline from the 2007 piece I wrote about her mum: “Who wants to be a billionaire?”“No way! That’s crazy.” Would the same headline be appropriate for her? “Would I want to be a billionaire? Well, that’s my aim!”“You just want to be successful,” Giddings corrects her.“Yeah, I just want to be successful and be able to provide for my future and my family when I have one,” Andre says.View image in fullscreenAndre with her mother, Katie Price, in 2015.Photograph: Beretta/Sims/Rex/ShutterstockShe sips her drink thoughtfully. Then she has a brainwave. “I want to take a picture of my hot chocolate,” she says. Will it be Instagrammed? She shakes her head. “No, this will be Snapchatted.” Giddings laughs. “This isliterallymy life,” she says apologetically. “So don’t feel insulted!”Did Andre always want to star in her own reality show? “I always loved being in front of a camera.” She thinks back to when she was a toddler on TV. “I’d come in the room and …” She tilts her head to the side, in modelling mode. “I loved the entertainment. When I was asked to do my own, I was sceptical because of my age, but, yes, I’ve also always wanted to do it.”As well as the obvious similarities, there are also huge differences between Andre and her mother. While Price is a funny, reckless, potty-mouthed force of nature, Andre is more like her father – polite, respectful, more reserved. I ask if she ever fancied being a doctor, like her father’s wife, her stepmother Emily MacDonagh, who is also prominent in the show. “No, the doctor path was never for me.” She went to a private school in Surrey and left to study beauty at 16.Were you swotty at school? “What does that mean?” Did you work hard? “Oh, yes, in the subjects I liked, I was good. I left after GCSEs.” Did you pass them? “Yes,” Giddings answers on her behalf. Andre says: “I passed three of them. Music, fashion and English language. I like creative writing. I’m quite good at waffling.”Perhaps Andre was destined for a life in reality TV. Yet she says she is self-conscious. In the show, she says she always thought her nose was too big and her lips too thin and that she “hated” the way she looked. Whereas surgery was the answer for her mother, makeup is Andre’s solution. “You can change anything with makeup,” she says. “Now, I feel a lot more confident.”What made her so self-conscious? “Social media,” she says instantly. “When I was younger, I got comments about my appearance.” If this was Price, she would tell you every detail. But not Andre. She simply smiles and asserts herself. “I don’t let the comments get in the way of anything.”In The Princess Diaries, we see her showing her father some of the comments. When she tells him that one man has posted about her “finally being legal”, he is furious. But that is simply the generational difference, she says. “Dad grew up with TV. Social media, TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat weren’t around then. Those comments are everyday, normalised, so they don’t really shock me.”In Andre’s world, you live and die by social media. As an “influencer”, you are nothing without it, however hurtful it can be. I tell her that, as an old git, I have never quite understood what it is to be an influencer; I ask if she can explain. “I guess it’s someone who influences people to do stuff. I influence younger people with what I post.” Does she influence what they wear and buy? “Yeah. My content is very organic, though – very real. Make up stories, which is what I do.”View image in fullscreenWith Junior in the first episode of The Princess Diaries.Photograph: ITVGiddings, a former tabloid journalist, rushes to the rescue. “Makeup! Not as in ‘making up stories’. I didn’t want you to think she’s sitting there busy making up stories.”Does she get paid to promote stuff? “Yes. I don’t get paid for normal posts. I like to post for my audience out of choice, not because I’m getting paid for it. But then there are branded posts or PR posts that I would get paid for.”Giddings: “But it’s only brands that she’s using already.”Andre: “I would never promote a brand that I don’t like or don’t have an interest in.” Are you making a good living out of it? “Yeah.” Are you wealthy? “Well, you could say so!” How much do you earn in a year? “I can’t tell you that, sorry.”The most important brand is, of course, Andre herself. She prides herself on being natural (no fillers, no Botox), but stresses that it’s neither a political nor a permanent position. When she was training as a beautician, it was an area of interest. “I would have loved to have done that as a job,” she says. “I was going to go into aesthetics, doing other people’s fillers and stuff, ’cos the way it works interests me. But personally I don’t think I will get any, just because my audience is so young. I want to be an inspiration for them. You should love yourself for you and not have to change yourself.”Has her mother, who has had numerous surgical augmentations and reductions, advised her on this? “Yeah. Mum said: ‘Don’t ever get anything done to yourself. You’re so beautiful the way you are.’ I found that interesting because I get told I look a lot like her at a young age. She’ll say to me: ‘In that picture, you look just like me when I was younger.’” Does she think Price regrets all her surgery? “No. There are pictures that I’ve seen of her before [surgery] and I was like: ‘You look so beautiful then,’ and she’s like: ‘No!’She doesn’t see it. So I don’t think she does regret it.’”In her show, Andre says she wishes her childhood had been happier, but she doesn’t go into details. Today, I ask if she can explain a bit more. Instead, she chooses to explain a bit less, telling me that she has so many happy memories from childhood – holidays, riding horses, having fun with her siblings. You sense she wants to give just enough to satisfy reality TV, but not so much that she ransacks her privacy.I ask again about the unhappiness. “Oh!” she says. Giddings prompts her. “You talk about South Africa in the show.”“Oh yeah, we got hijacked in South Africa when I was 10 and [her brother] Junior was 12. I was terrified. We were filming for a show with mum and her best friend.” It does sound terrifying. They were surrounded by six gunmen and her mother was sexually assaulted. “It’s one of the worst things I’ve experienced in my life. You don’t think of anything else apart from trying to survive it. The police said it was a miracle that we all survived.”It still affects her. “I get scared of the dark and driving at night-time, ’cos that’s when it happened. I get random flashbacks. If I’m driving at night, I’m like: ‘Oh my God, just get me home.’ I don’t even look behind me.”I don’t think I will get any fillers, just because my audience is so young. You shouldn’t have to change yourselfThere are other sources of unhappiness that she prefers not to go into: her parents splitting up; Price’s separation from her third husband, Kieran Hayler, the father of two of Andre’s siblings. She had been close to Hayler, but now they don’t see each other. Many of Price’s reality shows were set in the aptly named Mucky Mansion, a nine-bedroom property in Sussex formerly owned by Price. Did Andre like living there? “No. It was a really scary house. A lot went on there. So I didn’t really like it.” Again, she doesn’t go into details. “I guess when you have bad experiences somewhere you don’t like the place.”A few years ago, Price experienced severe depression and became suicidal. In 2021, she hada terrible car crashwhile under the influence of alcohol and drugs. By this point, Andre and Junior had been living with their father full-time for three years. “There was a period of time when me and Junior actually had to live with my dad,” she says, referring to a 2019 family court ordermade public this weekby her father. (In response, a spokesperson for Price said she was “at peace with the situation”.)Andre says Price is in a much better place; she moves between their homes depending on how she feels. “Dad’s house is a lot quieter, a lot more peaceful, a lot more organised. Whereas my mum’s house is much more just do what you want.” Does she prefer discipline or chaos? “I love being in the middle. I love the two different houses, because if I fancy a bit more chaotic and busy I’ll go to Mum’s and if I fancy more relaxed I’ll go to Dad’s.”Has her father been a stabilising influence? She looks at Giddings anxiously. “This is going to come across really bad, isn’t it?” she asks. “Like, it’s talking about how Mum’s a mess and Dad is stable, d’you know what I mean?” It’s touching how protective she is of Price. She turns back to me. “Right now, Mum is completely different to how she was four years ago. If we’re talking about the past, yes, my dad was more stable and Mum is naturally more crazy than my dad.”“Not crazy!” Giddings corrects. “Out there!”“If you saw her now, she’s way different,” Andre says.View image in fullscreenWith Junior and her father at the premiere of Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning in London in May.Photograph: Joe Maher/Getty ImagesShe talks about how close she is to all seven of her siblings, giving a special mention to Theo and Millie, the eldest of Peter and MacDonagh’s children, who are born entertainers, she says. Has she learned a lot from growing up with Harvey, Price’s eldest child, who is severely disabled and a reality star in his own right? Her eyes light up. “Yes, 100%. You learn patience. Ways of communicating. How to deal with his outbursts. How to calm him down. And as much as he is hard work, he isthefunniest person I know.” I ask if he is still into trains. “Helovestrains. He loves frogs. He loves rainbows. And food.”“Well, you’ve got that in common,” Giddings says.I mention the stories that have just been published online, saying Price is upset with Andre. The thing is, Andre says, there will generally be some truth in the tabloid tales, but it won’t bethetruth. Take the reality show. While it’s true that Price wasn’t filmed for it, we do hear mother and daughter chatting lovingly on the phone. “There’s been a lot of articles about ‘Princess doesn’t want her mum in the show’,” she says. Why was that decision made? “There was actually no decision, really. But because I’m living with Dad at the moment, he was in it more.” Well, that and the fact that her management team is also Andre’s management team. “It was never true that I said I didn’t want her in it,” she insists.Katie Price on survival, surgery and severe PTSD: ‘I’m good with anaesthetic – I like being put to sleep’Read moreAs for the idea of Peter Andre and Price being in it together, that never would have happened. “They don’t like each other,” she says, simply. Which takes us to Birthdaygate. Yes, it’s true that Price wasn’t invited to the party Princess had with Peter’s family, but that was never on the cards. “It would be quite strange for my mum and dad to be in it at the same time, just because that’s never been the case in my life since they split up.’’ The reality is she would usually spend part of her birthday with each parent, she says. “The problem is the media like to twist the knife,” she says.Ah, but this time it isn’t the media twisting the knife, Giddings says. “It was your mum that put that story out there.”“Yeah,” Andre says, searching for a diplomatic response. “Which is …interesting.”“That was Kate that said all of that about her and her family not being invited,” Giddings continues.Why don’t you just ring your mum and ask her what she is playing at, I suggest. No, she says, it’s not worth it. “Mum can be annoyed about something and then we send each other a message and we’re fine.”Blimey, I say, it’s not easy having parents is it? “No,” she says. “Especially divorced parents.”Andre hopes her reality show is the gateway to a successful business career. She says she understands the positives and the pitfalls. “No matter what I do in my life, I’ll get compared to my mum. I guess it’s always going to be a headline.” And now it’s up to Andre to show the world whether that has been her fortune or misfortune.The Princess Diariesis on ITVX nowDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Icansay with confidence – assuming I didn’t unknowingly consume magic mushrooms beforehand and hallucinate the entire thing – that the story follows a teenager, Kim (voice of Yolande Brown), who gets pulled into a surreal alternate universe that they explore with their new pal Jeff (Yunkaporta), a bright-green alien dog.The script was conceived early in the pandemic via Indigenous mentoring program AIME’s educational projectImagi-Nation TV, which compiled contributions from more than 150 young people. This partly explains the film’s skittish spirit and scattershot structure.View image in fullscreenImagine’s voice cast includes Yael Stone, Wayne Blair, Ian Thorpe and Taika Waititi.Photograph: MIFFLike Alice tumbling through the rabbit hole, Kim travels through a vortex-like thoroughfare filled with swirling colours and crazy patterns, before floating past a giant glowing green Buddha and riding a psychedelic dragon-like snake thing, because why not?

They’re less like a protagonist than a sponge, absorbing the strange goings-on around them. Or perhaps more like a video game character, having a degree of agency and input but functioning essentially as a vessel to guide us through candy-coloured bizarro worlds.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningIn Imagine, these worlds take the form of five islands, where Kim and Jeff bump into various Aboriginal elders and eccentric creations – including, among many others, a rainbow serpent (voiced by Wayne Blair) and an animated version of Taika Waititi (voiced by the man himself), who wears a Thriller jacket and shares his thoughts on pursuing your dreams with Kim and a trio of insect-like creatures. Other supporting cast members include Yael Stone, Radical Son, Irmin Durand and even Ian Thorpe.View image in fullscreenPhone-obsessed 15-year-old Kim and alien dog Jeff must travel to five islands over the course of 24 hours.Photograph: MIFFWe’re obviously not intended to take the film too seriously during its many whacked-out moments, though it also dips in and out of all kinds of meaty monologues and profundities. Before long, Jeff is engaged in deep philosophical discussion with a Viking about knowledge, race, culture, fascism and the foundation of life. As they talk, weird pirate-like rats ride jetskis towards them but never arrive. I’m not sure what happened to our yo-ho-ho rodent pals; this film has a habit of introducing things that visually pop, like firecrackers, then disappear quickly, shuffled off to some parallel dimension. The texture and style of the animation is an eclectic mixture – sometimes beautifully vivid and polished, other times intentionally scratchy and lo-fi.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In one scene, based in Jeff’s home world, the lead characters are guided through a museum (called “HISTORY ‘n’ Other Stuff”) by an elder, who tells Kim that “this isn’t like the museums your people made … your people took memories and called them artefacts. Your people took stories and stuffed them. You put barriers, and walls, and ropes, and glass, between you and the past.”It’s ruminative, big-thinking dialogue, incorporating ancient and contemporary perspectives. This scene could have been wonderful, but the film’s ever-frantic approach boots us out of the museum posthaste. How might this moment have played out if the setting had been properly explored, fleshed out, mined for its narrative and thematic potential?I appreciated Imagine’s chaotic energy, but watching it felt a bit like sitting in a car that’s whizzing through all sorts of amazing environments, rarely slowing down so you can have a proper look. It’s certainly a one-of-a-kind production, and I suspect it’ll linger in the memory.Imagineis screening as part ofMelbourne international film festivalon 23 August.Explore more on these topicsAustralian filmFamily filmsAnimation in filmIndigenous AustraliansreviewsShareReuse this content"

The irrepressibly energetic ensemble has been transfixing audiences with collective tightrope walks ever since. This year – 50 years since the composer’s death –Shostakovich’s Fifth Symphony came in for the look-mum-no-music treatment.To be clear, the memorisation element is a red herring, not in itself guaranteeing a satisfying performance. That depends on interpretation and rehearsal technique. What memorising a piece on the scale of Shostakovich’s monumental Fifth does mean, however, is that every musician knows the work inside out, in all its 3D complexity – and every musician (whether a rank-and-file violin or a woodwind principal) is equally exposed.The result was a high-intensity, high-impact performance. The volume dropped from blistering climaxes to pianissimo whispers as if the musicians had hurtled off a cliff. The tone ranged from the rudely rustic (all biting strings and gritty dollops of brass) in the Scherzo to a single silken thread spun slowly into a finely shimmering fabric in the Largo. ConductorNicholas Collonwhipped tutti passages into a frenzy but left this orchestra of soloists to craft their own moments in the spotlight. The coordination was military-grade, the finale’s close a searing, passionate catharsis. The standing ovation felt inevitable.View image in fullscreenEvery musician is equally exposed… the Aurora orchestra perform Shostakovich’s Fifth by Heart conducted by Nicholas Collon.Photograph: Andy Paradise/BBC/Paradise PhotoBut it was also inflected by the preceding “musical and dramatical exploration”, a collaboration withFrantic Assembly. Actor/dancer Max Revell was a silent, knock-kneed Shostakovich, prone to physical collapse as his Soviet credentials were scrutinised by a three-person committee. Collon introduced the Fifth Symphony (cue live musical extracts) as Shostakovich’s response to recent condemnation from Stalin himself: first arguing for the composer’s political rehabilitation, then suggesting a counter-reading.Demonstrating in real time how musical meaning is flexible, always subjective, was virtuosic indeed and a final loosening of gravity’s grasp on the musicians themselves (upended by dancers as they played) was spectacular. But repressive regimes and artistic censorship are not historical curiosities – and sudden changes of state policy towards the arts are all too familiar. Poking fun at the committee’s arbitrary preferences and presenting Shostakovich as devoid of agency told its own disappointingly cosy story.At Usher Hall, Edinburgh, on 18 August.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

My parents were living in a poorly heated flat in Kilburn, north-west London. My mother was working at the Ministry of Food. She was deeply involved in BBC Radio’s Kitchen Front which tried to help people conjure nutritious meals from their rations. My father became literary editor of Tribune magazine in November 1943. He was only required in the office three days a week, which gave him the time to write Animal Farm.Every evening, my father would read what he’d written to my mother under heavy blankets in bed. It was the only warm place in the flat. They would discuss the developing story and where it might go next. Lettice Cooper, the novelist and my mother’s Ministry of Food colleague, remembered my mother updating them every morning with the animals’ latest adventures. That my father and mother worked together so closely is no surprise. My father respected my mother’s talents greatly and later told a friend she had helped plan Animal Farm.Indeed, for some years, my mother had been typing and copy-editing my father’s writing and offering him detailed corrections and revisions. She was probably more deeply engaged with Animal Farm than with his previous work, perhaps even suggesting it should be a “beast fable” rather than the originally planned political polemic. The result of my parents’ teamwork, by the time Animal Farm was finished in February 1944, was one of the most beautifully written books of the century.On one level, Animal Farm is an ever-relevant satire of the Russian revolution and its betrayal into Stalinist autocracy. That was an evil my father and mother knew first hand. During the Spanish civil war they had witnessed the Stalinists slander, imprison, torture and murder dozens of their friends and comrades who did not slavishly follow the Soviet party line. They even had to flee Spain themselves under threat of Stalinist arrest and execution. Nothing dispels political illusions quicker than being pursued by fanatical murderers. These experiences, and the endless darkness of Stalin’s famines, gulags and purges, convinced my father that Soviet Russia was the very opposite of true socialism. He believed fervently that if democratic socialism was to flourish in the west, then the “myth” that Russia was a socialist state had to be debunked.But there were profound challenges that had to be overcome before Animal Farm could be published. There was a deep-rooted institutional reluctance to allow any criticism of Soviet Russia while it was a British ally leading the destruction of Nazi Germany. This attitude was compounded by relentless Soviet government lobbying and the comprehensive infiltration of British institutions by Soviet agents. Peter Smollett (AKA Smolka, Soviet agent codename ABO) was head of Soviet relations at the Ministry of Information and the now notorious Cambridge spy Guy Burgess was a BBC producer.TS Eliot doubted ‘that this is the right point of view from which to criticise the political situation at the present time’Everywhere, negative stories about Russia were quietly downplayed or suppressed and positive ones megaphoned. In this climate, five major publishing houses (at least one of them advised by Smollett) turned down Animal Farm as an inappropriate attack on a vital wartime ally. Even Faber, followingits director TS Eliot’s advice, doubted “that this is the right point of view from which to criticise the political situation at the present time”.Finally, in July 1944, Fredric Warburg of Secker & Warburg, known for courageously publishing controversial leftwing books, agreed to take it on. Even then, paper shortages and possibly ongoing reluctance to offend Britain’s ally, meant Animal Farm was not published until 17 August 1945. When it finally appeared, my father was surprised at how little fuss there was about his bold satire of Stalinism and dictatorship. But relations with Russia were by then rapidly cooling and, as my father said, people were “fed up with all [this] Russian nonsense”. Animal Farm’s time had come. Since its first publication 80 years ago, it has sold more than 11m copies and never been out of print.But Animal Farm is more than just a satire of the Russian Revolution. This “fairy story” (as my father called it) is an eternal warning against political leaders who hijack potentially noble movements for their own selfish purposes. My father thought all politicians should be watched hawkishly, confronted truthfully (whatever the price) and kicked out when they put their interests before those of their country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Queueing for her latest show, In the Bushes, we’re given a handout of an interview where the French choreographer cites her influences, from Guy Debord’s The Society of the Spectacle to Henry Gee’s The Accidental Species. It’s the idea of human exceptionalism that’s at the heart of her thinking: we’re just animals, she says. What makes us think we’re above the rest of our kingdom? And if you take away society’s manners and constraints, who are we then? What goes on in the bushes when nobody’s looking?In truth, the appearance of the six dancers is less animal, more like a bunch of toddlers who’ve been let loose in the dressing up box, tottering about on tippy toes, squawking and cooing and twittering. They come across like Teletubbies (you might find this irritating, or hilarious). She paints us as simplistic beasts, sensory-seekers, rolling on the floor, rubbing against each other, doing what feels good. There’s naivety and lack of embarrassment about bodies – it brings to mind Emma Stone in the filmPoor Things, especially later when things get a bit less naive with biting hands, slapping bottoms and giggly kisses.The Unstoppable Rise of Ben Manager review – tales of the unexpected at the officeRead moreBut then there’s the intrusion of shame, fear, and innocence lost. Nakedness and the dawning of self-consciousness. These parts are cleverly, amusingly done, along with the creeping in of rituals, for the dead, for example – something that’s been observed in animals, too. The climax is a huge outpouring of fake emotion. The dancers play at being distraught, tears dripped from a water bottle, revelling in the big feels, even when they’re completely fabricated. This surely is a true marker of human behaviour – what else do we use art for, if not to fabricate emotions?The emotions produced here seem fairly surface level. It’s a funny and silly piece of dance, even though it’s also deeply concerned with the very nature of who we are. They are a truly impressive clan of performers, to keep up this level of jittery, full-body energy and intense character for a constantly moving hour. Humans are often enthralled to watch animal behaviour that we don’t necessarily understand, and this is not dissimilar.AtSummerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreDanceComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

If that were the thinking behind this fringe debut by NYC four-pieceSimple Town– well, it might just be smart, fresh and funny enough to revitalise the form. It’s sketch with something of the energy of improv, a hint of an easygoing get together with your coolest friends (OK,farcooler than my friends) – and the kind of freewheeling, elusive-logic comedy with whichSheepshave in recent years sustained sketch’s flagging pulse.Identified as “four teens in their 30s”, Simple Town introduce themselves as they mean to go on: super-casual, faux-naive, coming at one another, and at our expectations, from odd angles. Their first sketch takes us back vaguely in time, to three Nasa bros aghast that a woman has been recruited to their space programme – because “she can do multiplication in her head!”. Like later scenes, this one contains several movements, the borders porous between them, the comic point forever evolving and slipping beyond your grasp.Jena Friedman: Motherf*cker review – political zingers and all-too-raw griefRead moreIf you like that sensation, of laughing without ever fully pinning down why, Simple Town are your new best friends. What’s going on in the skit that pairs two cagoule-clad spare thumbs left alone together at their respective partners’ reunion? This dotty choreography of social awkwardness extrapolated ad absurdum is as beguiling as it is barely explicable. You could read their firing squad sketch as a brilliant riff on the polarised US, where fierceness of conviction is matched only by woolliness of argument. It’s also just a nugget of Pythonesque nonsense about dopey executioners.Some routines are simpler, like the solipsistic inner monologue of the audience member whose suggestion is accepted for an improv scene. Or like the show’s closer, burlesquing middle-class American reverence for old Europe – although even that one morphs halfway into a four Yorkshiremen-style race to the bottom of US education. It’s all accomplished with artless slacker panache by Will Niedmann, Caroline Yost, Felipe Di Poi Tamargo and Sam Lanier, posting a welcome reminder of how exciting team comedy can still be.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Actor-musicians interweaving folk songs, murder ballads, blues and bluegrass is one idea. Framing the story as a sort of true crime podcast is another. So is making it a macabre comedy. How about the cast stepping in and out of performance as if in rehearsal? What about getting the audience involved?Out of the Forest Theatre’s production adopts all these approaches, muddying the water for an already complicated story. Writer Sasha Wilson stars alongside Lawrence Boothman and David Leopold in Vicky Moran’s production, which rattles along at such a pace that even if you know the bare bones of the case it can be hard to keep up.The cast spend little time in character as the principal figures of Borden, her sister, the family’s maid and the couple, Abby and Andrew, respectively given 40 and 41 whacks of the axe according to the grisly rhyme. The result is curiously emotionless, the script overloaded with footnotes to a story that feels stifled.How scary can theatre really be? My horror marathon in search of stage frightsRead moreEvidently well researched, there is some captivating detail – not least about “America’s most haunted house”, where the killings took place, now operating as a hotel – but a leaner account would be far more haunting. The show never chills and has a jarring combination of occasional earnestness and throwaway comedy (complete with talking corpse) akin to the Borden rock operaLizzie. It does, however, raise evergreen questions about sensationalism and sexism, and captures the historical era, including the limited scientific knowledge hindering the investigation.In one of several inspired touches, a violin is delivered in lieu of a baby for a birthing scene. While the story is frustratingly stop-start, the music is richly delivered, from the opener Feeling Good to The Wayfaring Stranger, Down in the Willow Garden and Little Sadie, its lyrics now name-checking Borden who will be for ever cast as both killer and victim.AtPleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

One of the many clever touches in this distinctive comedy by Dan Bishop is that his characters do exactly the same when they are introduced. Yaz, Mitch, Duggan and Bathsheba are to each be paid £2,000 for volunteering in a clinical drug trial; they’ve swallowed their pills and are now scrutinising every possible side-effect. It builds a hyper-awareness that accentuates the awkward exchanges that Bishop writes so well.The setup leads you to expect a broadside on gen Z’s financial precarity – it was amalaria drugs trial that fundedsuperb standup John Tothill’s first fringe run – but there are other interesting ideas at play. One of the group has got her place through a relative (nepotism is rife even in volunteering); one is an activist extolling freeganism and the “anti-work movement”; one doesn’t need the money but is simply lost and lonely. From the bead-worrying Bathsheba’s dreamworld to Duggan’s excitable bursts of “broski!”, the characters are neatly juxtaposed while each, in their own way, wants to change the world they live in. By the fifth and final Saturday of their weekly appointments, they part ways refreshingly unchanged and without any Breakfast Club-esque transformation.View image in fullscreenGreat ear for words … playwright Dan Bishop, centre, in Brainsluts.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianBishop has a great ear for words: the doctor’s mock bombast that falls flat in a workplace, the deadening legalese she adopts when her guard is up, the decisive delivery of a breakup. Blurted confessions, mangled phrases, forced small talk, bullshit banter and occasional standup-style lines hang in the air as Bishop stresses the stasis in these lives through the characters’ passive income streams and anti-go-getter ideals. The play nails their malaise when, through a shared meditation exercise, they feel uncomfortable imagining the peace of a beach or forest and substitute them with a big Tesco.Threaded together by quirky musical beats, this TV-friendly script is tightly directed by Noah Geelan and deftly performed by Bishop (Mitch), Bethan Pugh (Yaz), Martha West (Bathsheba), Robert Preston (Duggan) and, in a standout performance, Emmeline Downie as the doctor. These volunteers are told side effects could include nausea and dancing; audiences may experience considerable changes in brain activity and severe laughter.AtPleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

Then they were stopped at a bogus checkpoint in County Down – and three were shot dead. Fifty years on, survivor Des Lee looks back on that terrible nightSun 17 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 17 Aug 2025 08.14 EDTShare‘It was absolutely despicable,” says Des Lee, his voice trembling with emotion, “to think that those people who were supposed to be protecting us had planned our murder …” I’ve never heard a story as astonishing as Lee’s. His memoir, My Saxophone Saved My Life, recounts the events of half a century ago, in which his much-loved pop group, the Miami Showband, were ambushed by loyalist paramilitaries operating a fake army checkpoint, with half his bandmates murdered as he lay still, playing dead to stay alive.Though the attack carries strangely little traction in Britain, the Miami Showband massacre of 1975 is deeply etched into Irish cultural memory. Even amid the context of the Troubles, whose bleak statistics – more than 3,600 dead, more than 47,500 injured – made slaughter almost normalised, the killing of three members of the Miami Showband leftIrelandin shock. Fifty years after the atrocity, Lee, 79, tells me about a tangled plot with its roots in the uniquely Irish phenomenon of showbands.In their heyday in the 1950s to 70s, showbands – besuited troupes, closer to cabaret than rock’n’roll, performing contemporary hits with slick routines choreographed down to the last synchronised leg kick – fulfilled a need for glamour and escapism at a time when overseas stars seldom visited Ireland. Showbands, who typically took the stage around midnight, provided a crucial context in which young people from the Catholic and Protestant communities could forget their troubles (and the Troubles), and let their hair down.View image in fullscreenThe lineup of the Miami Showband in 1967.Photograph: Courtesy of Des Lee“As far as we were concerned,” Lee recalls, “a punter was a punter, no matter what religion, creed or colour. They would mingle, and you could have a Protestant meeting a Catholic and getting married. It was incredible.”Born John Desmond McAlea on 29 July 1946, Lee grew up in the Catholic suburb of Andersonstown, West Belfast, in a relatively comfortable working-class family. He would supplement his pocket money in audacious ways. On 12 July, AKA The Twelfth or Orangemen’s Day, the Protestant community would hold rallies at which the likes of Reverend Ian Paisley would vehemently denounce Republicans and Catholics. Lee would go along and blend with the crowd, collecting bottles discarded by the Loyalist throng and claiming the penny deposits.Lee found a job at a plumbing supplier but his head was soon turned by rock’n’roll, and he quit to follow in the footsteps of his nightclub musician father. He served his apprenticeship on a thriving Belfast scene centred around Cymbals instrument shop, where he rubbed shoulders with a teenage Van Morrison (“A strange guy,” says Lee, “but an exceptional talent”) and future members of Thin Lizzy.The main road was the most horrific scene I’ve ever seen in my lifeIn 1967, the circuit’s leading act, the Miami Showband, underwent one of its periodic reshuffles and drafted in Lee on sax, along with a handsome, charismatic singer-pianist called Fran O’Toole. Fronted by Dickie Rock, who had represented Ireland at Eurovision, the Miami were as big as it got. When Des calls them “The Irish Beatles” with a twinkle, it’s only slight hyperbole: they topped the Irish singles chart seven times. “When I got the deal to join,” says Lee, “I thought, ‘My God, all my birthdays are coming together.’ I jumped at it.”View image in fullscreenDes Lee on the right, with Fran O’Toole.Photograph: Courtesy of Des Lee“Girls were screaming,” he says. “We would have 2,500 people inside watching us, and 2,500 outside trying to get in. I couldn’t go to the shop without people wanting my autograph. It was stardom with a capital S.”Lee developed a close friendship and songwriting partnership with O’Toole, who later replaced Rock as frontman. Lee became the bandleader. His responsibilities included repertoire and finances, and ensuring everyone looked immaculate (70s footage shows them in dazzling-white suits with glittering lapels). He also instilled discipline. “My job was to make sure everybody was squeaky clean,” he says. “No going on the piss before a gig. We weren’t saints or angels, make no mistake. What goes on afterwards, behind closed doors, nobody knows. But we had to put on a professional show.”The Miami Showband entered the summer of 1975 in an optimistic mood. The band had scored major hits with Charlie Rich’s country standard There Won’t Be Anymore and Bonnie St Claire’s bubblegum-glam nugget Clap Your Hands and Stamp Your Feet. O’Toole was being groomed for solo stardom, and had been booked to play Las Vegas to launch his Lee-penned single Love Is, with the intention of positioning him as the next David Cassidy.View image in fullscreen‘Girls were screaming … It was stardom with a capital S.’Photograph: Courtesy of Des LeeBut that show never took place. On Wednesday 30 July 1975, the Miami played the Castle Ballroom in Banbridge, County Down, about 10 miles north of the border. “It was just a normal night, nothing untoward. We came off stage and did the usual thing: signed autographs, chatted to the fans, then we had a cup of tea and a sandwich, and got ready to do the journey back to Dublin.”Road manager Brian Maguire went ahead in the equipment van. Drummer Ray Millar drove separately to visit family in Antrim. The rest of the band – O’Toole, Lee, Brian McCoy, bassist Stephen Travers and guitarist Tony Geraghty – climbed into the Volkswagen minibus and headed south.Eight miles into the journey, at 2.30am on Thursday 31 July, they were flagged down by the red torch of an army checkpoint, a commonplace occurrence in the North. “You would be asked the same questions: ‘Where are you going, where are you coming from?’” says Lee. “We would be sitting in the van with a bottle of brandy or whiskey, and we’d occasionally offer a drop to the soldier who stopped us.”They were asked to step out of the van – again, not entirely unusual – and made to line up facing the roadside ditch. At first, the soldiers chatted casually, but their demeanour changed when someone with an English accent joined them and began giving orders. McCoy found this reassuring, telling Travers that they were dealing with the British army rather than the less predictable, locally recruited Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR).Before the search, Lee asked permission to fetch his saxophone to show it wasn’t a weapon, laying it on the road a few feet away. Suddenly, an almighty explosion tore through the van, throwing all five musicians across the ditch into the undergrowth.View image in fullscreenThe scene of the Miami Showband killings, at Buskhill in County Down, Northern Ireland.Photograph: Independent News and Media/Getty ImagesThe soldiers had not been soldiers at all – at least, not on duty. The fake army patrol were members of the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), although at least four of them were also serving with the UDR. Their intention was to plant a briefcase bomb under the driver’s seat, timed to explode further down the road. The timer malfunctioned, instantly killing two members of the UVF’s Mid-Ulster Brigade, Harris Boyle and Wesley Somerville. In the chaos, an order was given to shoot the fleeing musicians to eliminate witnesses. Lee lay still with his face in the grass, slowing his breathing and pretending to be dead – a trick he had learned from watching Vietnam movies – as he heard the murder of his friends taking place around him.First to die was McCoy, 32, shot in the back with a Luger pistol. Travers, 24, hit by a dumdum bullet, was seriously wounded. As Geraghty, 24, and O’Toole, 28, attempted to drag him to safety, they were caught by gunmen, pleading for their lives before being executed with Sterling submachine guns. O’Toole was shot 22 times, his long-haired head so badly mutilated that a doctor would later ask Lee if there was a girl in the band.View image in fullscreenThe Miami Showband at Dublin Airport.Photograph: Courtesy of Des LeeTravers lay next to the body of McCoy and, like Lee, played dead. Once the attackers had apparently left the scene, Lee cautiously went to fetch help. “The main road was the most horrific scene I’ve ever seen in my life,” he remembers. “There were bits of bodies lying all over the place. It was horrendous.”The first passing vehicle, a truck, refused to give Lee a lift. Eventually, a young couple agreed to drive him to nearby Newry, where he alerted police. “My hand was on the door handle just in case, ready to jump out, because I didn’t trust anybody at that stage.”The killings stunned Ireland, and thousands lined the streets for the funerals of the murdered musicians. The Miami Showband had represented hope. Not only did their shows unite communities, but their membership was mixed: McCoy and Millar were Protestants, the rest were Catholics. Is it fanciful to suggest that they were targeted because someone, somewhere, resented this pan-sectarian fraternisation?View image in fullscreenRemembering the Miami Showband massacre, as families demand a proper investigation into the truth behind The Troubles.Photograph: Paul Davey/AlamyLee doesn’t think that was the motive. “We were the No 1 band, and this gang wanted maximum publicity. If that bomb had exploded when they intended, the Miami Showband would have been accused of carrying weapons for the IRA.” (Indeed, within 12 hours, the UVF accused the band of being bomb-traffickers, describing their killing as “justifiable homicide”.)Lee agreed to testify at the trial in Belfast on condition he was helicoptered to and from the Irish border, with 24-hour protection. His life was threatened by relatives of the accused; he has, he says, been looking over his shoulder ever since.Lance corporal Thomas Crozier and Sgt James McDowell, both of the UDR, were sentenced to life in the Maze prison, as was John Somerville, brother of the deceased Wesley and a former soldier. (They were released under the Good Friday agreement.) Everything pointed towards collusion: covert collaboration between paramilitaries and the organs of the British state.Travers, Lee and Millar relaunched the Miami Showband with new members before the year was out, to familiar scenes of hysteria – but their hearts weren’t in it. Travers felt they had become a circus, and that audiences had come to stare rather than dance; he left the band the following year. For Lee, now lead singer, it could never be the same without his lost band members. “I looked around and there was no Fran, no Brian and no Tony, and I didn’t enjoy that.”In 1982, tired of feeling that he and his family were in danger, Lee started a new life in South Africa, performing as a saxophonist and band leader on the Holiday Inn circuit. He remained there for two decades, only returning after his wife, Brenda, died.Travers, meanwhile, went on a tenacious, meticulous search for the truth, engaging with numerous investigations and initiatives. A 2019 Netflix documentary, Remastered: The Miami Showband Massacre, is centred around his dogged efforts.View image in fullscreenGrenadier Guards Capt Robert Nairac talking to children. He was named as a leading conspirator, and was executed by Republicans.Photograph: PAThrough the years, the finger of suspicion has repeatedly pointed at two men: Capt Robert Nairac of the Grenadier guards (later executed by Republicans), and Robin “The Jackal” Jackson, a former soldier from County Down and a key figure in the notorious Glenanne Gang, were believed to have planned the ambush. Both were named by British intelligence whistleblowers, and Ken Livingstone named Nairac as a conspirator in his maiden speech as an MP.In December 2017, 80 documents were released including a 1987 letter from the UVF to the then-taoiseach Charles Haugheyon headed notepaper, which openly admitted collusion with MI5 in the attack. The evidence was now overwhelming. The historic activities of the Glenanne Gang, including the Miami Showband Massacre, fall under the purview of Operation Denton, due to report this year.The massacre hasn’t faded from Irish memory. A sculpture commemorating the dead musicians, unveiled in 2007 by former taoiseach Bertie Ahern, stands on Parnell Square in Dublin. One person who apparently didn’t remember, however, was Bono, who described the 2015 shootings at the Eagles of Death Metal show in Paris as “the first direct attack on music”. He later apologised, and U2 incorporated a slide of the Miami Showband into their show.View image in fullscreenSurviving showband members (left to right) Ray Miller, Des Lee, Stephen Travers, and former road manager Brian Maguire at the memorial on the 50th anniversary of the attack.Photograph: Rebecca Black/PAThe survivors don’t have the luxury of forgetting. The trauma has left an indelible mark. Travers was diagnosed, in later life, with enduring personality change. Lee has, he tells me, experienced profound survivor’s guilt.Miami Showband massacre: UK government accused of ‘lies’ after £1.5m payoutRead moreIn 2021, Lee was awarded £325,000 compensation, in a package he says was presented to survivors and families as a take-it-or-leave-it deal. He considers the sum to be “peanuts, for 50 years of anger and pain”. More than financial recompense, he says what he hopes for, with up to five perpetrators still officially unaccounted for, is closure: “Just tell the world the truth.”My Saxophone Saved My Lifeby Des Lee with Ken Murray is out now (Red Stripe Press)Explore more on these topicsMusicIrelandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toOlivia LadanyiSun 17 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTShareLaura, 43Sex is still so important to me and I’m happier after – I’m just struggling to get in the moodWe have two children under 10, and being a mother to them nearly always takes priority. I rarely have time to do the things that nourish and sustain me – go to the gym, wash my hair, see friends – and by the end of the day I’m too exhausted from mothering to have sex. But when I’m more relaxed and rested, and able to prioritise myself, I’m more in the mood.Scheduling also helps, so if we say, “Let’s have sex on Wednesday,” I go to bed earlier and make time for it. Rich is a great dad and does loads around the house, but I take on more of the mental load and have lost more of myself in parenthood. It’s just the way it is.Rich and I met at college. When we reconnected in our 30s, I immediately knew I wanted to have sex with him. We went on a couple of dates and the sex was great; it felt natural, but also exciting and full of desire. We fitted together perfectly. I thought it was just a sexual thing at first, but the morning after the first time, I had this knowing feeling that it was going to last.I love Rich, so I’m trying to be more available to him, but I don’t want to have sex out of dutyAfter a difficult first birth, I couldn’t physically have sex for nine months. I had scarring, didn’t want anything near there and thought it was the ultimate turnoff. Rich was supportive and patient. We took it slowly, and when we eventually had sex again it felt like a huge relief.Sex is still so important to me, and I’m happier after. I’m just struggling to get in the mood, balancing being a mum with looking after myself and being a sexual being. We now have sex once every month or two, which isn’t often enough for Rich. I’ve never had a high sex drive, and before we had kids we had sex about once a week, usually on a long, lazy Sunday morning.We’re going through a tough time, and Rich isn’t happy about a few things in our relationship, sex being one of them. I love him, so I’m trying to be more available, but I don’t want to have sex out of duty. We’re going to start marriage counselling, and I hope that this busy parent stage will pass, and our love, sexual chemistry and commitment will get us through.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

I’m careful not to reject her advancesLaura and I are very compatible; we have shared values and similar temperaments. My previous relationships were more challenging, so I was surprised how easy it was with her. But once kids came along, that changed. Our lives are now completely absorbed by raising our kids, and we struggle to find time for each other.This is how we do it: ‘I need some emotional connection before sex, but he is ready to go at any time’Read moreI was the one who pushed to have children; Laura took some convincing. When trying to conceive took a year, sex became less about pleasure and more of a chore. Then, when you have kids, there’s less mystery, and having the same mundane, routine interactions doesn’t help to create an erotic environment. Our sex life doesn’t fulfil me the way it used to, and I’ve stopped initiating because it’s hard to keep doing that and getting rejected.We build up anticipation by talking about it before, so half the work is done before we’ve even taken our clothes offWhat we need is to have fun outside the home, get out and be ourselves in the world, and bring more joy and colour back into our lives. When Laura does initiate sex out of the blue, it feels reassuring. I’m careful not to reject her advances, even when I’m feeling a bit unwell, because I don’t want months without sex to lead into more.We try to make time four to six times a year to enjoy and pleasure each other. It can be hard to get into the headspace, but we build up anticipation by talking about it, so half the work is already done before we’ve even taken off our clothes.As I get older, I am reminded that life is finite. I’d love to have the joy and possibility of being more sexual, to feel confident to initiate again, and even get that dynamic back from 10 years ago, when we had sex once a week. Just non-spectacular, comfort sex that says: “I see you, I want to be with you, I love you.”Sex makes everything feel more positive, and life is a little easier.Explore more on these topicsSexThis is how we do itRelationshipsChildrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The reason is simple: they dry quicker because the pockets no longer form big wads of wet cloth trapped inside.

Non-iron clothes look fine, especially now I’m retired and don’t need to meet customers. I do recall visiting someone with my mother; the lady of the house was doing the ironing and started on a batch of underwear. Even my mother thought that a bit extreme.canyoudosoI always assumed it was to stop rivets, zips etc from rubbing against or catching on other garments. I certainly find that zips stay done up more if the puller is on the inside of the garment. It’s definitely nothing to do with ironing, because I avoid ironing at all possible opportunities.EBGBDenim is yarn dyed in such a way that the colour is only on the surface of the yarn. The dye particles are vulnerable to abrasion, which is why the fabric goes white at the stress points, where the original colour of the yarn starts to show through. Washing inside out reduces the chance of abrasion against the drum of the machine and premature fading.rigolettoJeans are about the only garment I don’t wash inside out. The idea is that the lack of abrasion against the machine and other clothes means the colour holds better and the garment looks less worn; this is usually the case and why shirts (usually made from heavier fabrics) look darker on the inside. It’s also wise for anything with printed or applied designs, T-shirts in particular – unless, like me, you prefer workwear to look worn and faded.orsoExplore more on these topicsJeansNotes and queriesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Memory foam, sothe internet tells me, repeatedly, was developed by the US space agency in the 60s to cushion astronauts during flights. Nice story, but there’s no extreme G-force in my bed, just a pair of middle-aged people wanting to sleep. Do we really need Nasa’s pricey wonder material for that?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It does help, in small doses. I’ve found that a layer or two of memory foam can turn agood mattressinto a great one. This soft, cosy material moulds to your body and does a brilliant job of tempering the solidity of springs in hybrid mattresses, such as theSimba Hybrid ProandOtty Original Hybrid. It also absorbs bounce so well that it’s helped me and my husband sleep in peace despite each other’s fidgeting.A mattress made entirely from memory foam, though? I wasn’t sure I’d enjoy lying on 25cm of chewy marshmallow. Mercifully, Tempur uses foam of many different firmness levels, including high-density base layers designed to provide support as strong as springs. I set out to discover how well it works by testing one of Tempur’s most popular mattresses, the Pro Plus SmartCool.View at TempurView at Bensons for BedsHow I testedView image in fullscreenTesting involved a lot more than simply sleeping on the job.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianTempur sent me a double-size Pro Plus SmartCool for sleep-testing in July. It was the best of times and the worst of times to test this mattress, because my bedroom was stifling. I was sent a medium mattress instead of the requested medium-firm, and this was unfortunate because heat can make memory foam even softer – and I find firmer mattresses more comfortable. At least the balmy conditions were perfect for testing the claimed cooling properties of the SmartCool fabric cover.Before any snoozing could take place, my husband, Alan, and I ran our usualmattress-testing experiments. Memory foam tends to trap heat, so we were keen to see if the SmartCool cover could offset this. We used a heat pad, a thermocouple and our bottoms to measure how efficiently the surface cooled down, and we also took the temperature of the foam beneath.View image in fullscreenThe medium SmartCool mattress has four layers of foam, of varying densities.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianWe then deployed weights and wobbly cups of water to measure factors such as sinkage, motion isolation and edge support. Our family testing panel came over to score the mattress out of 10 on firmness, breathability and comfort.I prefer to sleep-test mattresses for much longer than a week because even the firmest cushioning materials soften over time.The SimbaandPanda Hybrid Bamboofelt significantly softer after a couple of months. The Tempur was soft from the start, though, and Alan and I found it too cushioned for comfort. After a week of poor sleep, we gave it to my dad, Don, 85, to see if its pressure relief might help soothe the joint pain he’s been suffering in his hip and shoulder (more on which below). He returned it to us for a second leg of sleep testing once temperatures had cooled down in late July.What you need to know, from price to firmnessView image in fullscreenWell cushioned: the sleeping surface sank a generous 4.2cm under 7.5kg of hand weights.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianView at TempurView at Bensons for BedsTempur, founded in the US in 1992, was among the first brands to make mattresses from viscoelastic polyurethane foam. “Memory foam” is how you know this stuff, but Tempur calls it “Tempur Material” and uses its own proprietary formulas that cover a range of densities.Memory foam moulds to your body and doesn’t spring back quickly when pressed. It feels quite different from the simple seat-cushion polyfoam used in many sprung mattresses under the sleep surface (in theIkea Valevåg, for example). It’s also more expensive.And so, as with many mattresses that contain high proportions of memory foam, Tempur mattresses are expensive. The Pro Plus SmartCool sits in the middle of Tempur’s range, costing from £1,499 for a 21cm-deep single to £4,299 for a 30cm-deep 200 x 200cm (“special size”). The 25cm-deep double I tested costs from £2,299, almost twice the price of the Simba, the next most expensive mattress in theFilter’s roundup.The medium SmartCool has four layers of foam, of varying densities: a 5cm upper layer of soft, elastic memory foam for cushioning and pressure relief; then 5cm of adaptive foam; and then 3cm of even denser supportive foam. Finally, the 12cm “DuraBase” layer of even denser foam provides support and durability.Everyone on my panel rated it 5/10 on the soft-firm scale, so the “medium” description is accurate. The sleeping surface sank a generous 4.2cm under 7.5kg of hand weights. That’s well cushioned, but only marginally more than the Eve Wunderflip Hybrid, which sank 4cm and is described as medium-firm.Tempur doesn’t say how the SmartCool’s “QuickRefresh” polyester fabric cover dissipates heat; it simply cites “cool-to-the-touch” technology. The cover unzips easily with its stylish green handles, and it can be washed at 40C. You can also unzip and wash the base cover. Trying to wash or sponge the mattress inside, however, will invalidate your guarantee.View image in fullscreenGreen handles make unzipping the mattress cover a breeze.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianThe double-size mattress weighs a chunky 40kg, a few kilos more than the Otty or the Simba, but much less than the 65kgMillbrook Wool Luxury 4000. The Tempur’s weight and floppiness – plus the absence of any turning handles – make it tricky to manoeuvre, but once you’ve got it on your bed, you’ll never really have to. You don’t have to turn it, although you can rotate it occasionally to maintain even support, according to thecare guidelines.Tempur has several showrooms where you can try its mattresses before buying, although you’ll need tomake an appointment. Locations include Castleford in West Yorkshire, Bridgend, Swindon, Milton Keynes, Durham and both Westfields in London. Whether you buy in person or online, you get a 10-year warranty and a 100-night trial.SpecificationsType:memory foamFirmness:advertised as medium, panel rated as 5/10Depth:21,25 (as tested) and 30cmCover:unzip to wash at 40CTurn or rotate:don’t turn; you can rotate “to maintain even comfort”Trial period:100 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:not offered in UKSustainability credentials:Oeko-Tex Standard 100certified; Pro mattresses areDanish Indoor Climate labelled; UK warehouse operations are zero landfill; Tempur aims to be carbon neutral by 2040DeliveryView image in fullscreenThe Pro Plus SmartCool arrived ‘full-size and flat’.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianYou wait years for a mattress to turn up without being vacuum-shrunk, then they all come at once. As with theMillbrook Wool Luxury 4000, the Tempur arrived full-size and flat. That meant it was ready to sleep on immediately, unlike the oodles of bed-in-a-box mattresses I’ve tested, and it came packed in significantly less plastic wrapping than they did.The downside of receiving a non-shrunk mattress is that it’s harder to get it up the stairs. Tempur’s helpful delivery team would have done it for me, but I wanted to see how my husband and I coped (sorry, Alan). The Tempur-branded delivery team was nice to see after so many third-party couriers, but I had to wait three weeks for the mattress to arrive.New foam often has a chemical “off-gassing” smell, and the Tempur is quite stinky (or fragrant, depending on your preferences) for its first couple of weeks. I don’t mind the smell, but you may find it distracting, especially when you’re trying to get to sleep.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Iggy the cat was particularly keen to hog the stitched fabric when July’s night-time temperatures exceeded 20C, perhaps because his 4kg body couldn’t sink into the heat-trapping memory foam.Our bodies did sink into it, however. As we slept, the foam formed a cocoon around us (mainly our bums), and made us feel like we were floating in the mattress rather than on top of it. There was no sense of sagging, just of strong, deliberate cradling. Firmer mattresses are more to my taste, but they can give me niggling pain from an old rib injury, and the Tempur never did. If you live with pain and find it hard to sleep as a result, the memory foam upper layers of this mattress could be just what you need.View image in fullscreenDon, and dusted: the reviewer’s father had a positive experience with the mattress, though he prefers firmer bed support.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianMy 85-year-old dad, Don, also enjoyed the pain relief of the mattress but has since switched back to the firmer surface to which he’s more accustomed. He first tried it lying on his back and said: “Oh, I like that … I think,” which echoed my own thoughts. I asked him to turn on to his right side to test his recently injured shoulder and hip, and he said there was no pain – a welcome relief for us both.The mattress’s motion isolation is exceptionally good. This is something I’ve learned to expect from highly cushioned memory foam because it absorbs the movement of your body and dramatically cuts down on bounce. Alan and I are fidgety sleepers, so motion isolation helps us rest without being disturbed by each other.What we don’t loveView image in fullscreenThat sinking feeling? ‘If your sleep style involves plenty of tossing and turning, a firmer mattress will suit you better.’Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianAs mentioned, some of the higher-density layers of Tempur’s mattress are decidedly firm. The Pro Plus SmartCool is also available intwo firmer versionsthan the one I tested. But the medium version quickly turned out to be an over-enthusiastic hugger, at least for our tastes. After the initially pleasurable cradling, it just kept going until it seemed to be swallowing us.“My bum is disappearing into it,” said Don. He and I are very small, so we didn’t sink as far into this mattress as a person of larger build would. My husband, Alan, thoroughly average size, sank too far for comfort and declared it “like being sucked into quicksand”.We wanted to give the Tempur a fair chance, so we used it on our slatted bed base for several nights, then Don used it on his solid divan base. It never felt lumpy or saggy, but my lower back felt unsupported, and our sleeping bodies made impressions so deep that it became difficult to roll over. If your sleep style involves plenty of tossing and turning, a firmer mattress will suit you better.Edge support is frankly poor for a mattress that costs this much. Even a soft mattress should have some firm reinforcement around the sides to make it easy to get into and out, but when we tried sitting on the edge, we all felt like we were sliding off it. Sitting up to read is difficult because your weight is concentrated on your bum, and you just, well, sink.View image in fullscreenToo soft at the sides: the mattress’s edge support was felt to be lacking.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianEven the cover’s cooling ability had its limits, as Alan and I discovered when sinking into the foam beneath it. We woke in the night, complaining that we felt we were cooking in the heat of our sleeping bodies. The cover helps by forming a barrier between you and the foam, but we found – in our experience and our heat-retention tests – that it couldn’t stop the foam getting hotter than a mattress that contains springs. If you tend to overheat at night all year round, an all-foam mattress isn’t for you.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe Pro Plus came in significantly less packaging than bed-in-a-box mattresses.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianEnvironmental kudos is a challenge for a company that uses this much foam. High-viscosity polyurethane foam is non-biodegradable, has a chemical-intensive manufacturing process and is harder to recycle than fabric or springs. Given all this, Tempur has made decent strides in sustainability.The most noticeable example for me was the dramatic reduction in plastic packaging compared with bed-in-a-box mattresses. There isn’t even any cardboard to get rid of. Behind the scenes, Tempur’s products areOeko-Tex Standard 100-certified, and its Danish production facility is ISO-certified for quality, environment, health and safety, and energy. Tempur mattresses are made in Denmark, and its Pro and One mattresses are certified by theDanish Indoor Climate Labellingscheme, a voluntary but internationally recognised standard for chemical compound emissions.Tempur’s UK warehouses and distribution centres have been zero landfill since 2019, and the company aims to be carbon neutral by 2040.Foam isn’t easy to recycle, but Tempur offers ideas on itsenvironmental sustainability page. Old foam “can be cleaned and shredded for use in new products, such as carpet underlay”, it says, so I’m disappointed that the company doesn’t offer to do this with its UK customers’ old mattresses. Mattress collection is offered in the US “on request”, but not here. Tempur UK does at least run an onlineoutlet storewhere you can buy refurbished products, including mattresses that have been returned by buyers within the 100-night trial.Tempur Pro Plus SmartCool: should I buy it?The medium version of the Pro Plus SmartCool is a soft, cradling mattress with excellent pressure relief. If you love your beds on the plush side, you may decide it’s worth every penny. However, this sumptuous mattress is not for everyone – including my family and me. Perhaps the quicksand sensation was too close to our childhood nightmares to give us the sleep of our dreams.View at TempurView at Bensons for BedsJane Hoskyn is a features journalist and WFH pioneer with three decades of experience in rearranging bookshelves and “testing” coffee machines while deadlines loom.

As a law-abiding citizen, I prefer to use an oven, but I have to concede that those naughty bandits knew a thing or two about flavour.Prep20 minMarinate8hr+Cook4½ hrRest30 min+Serves61 bone-in lamb shoulder(about 2kg)1½ heads garlicOlive oil1 tsp cinnamon1 tsp dried oregano1 tsp salt2 lemons1kg waxy potatoes(see step 3)1 large red onion1 red pepper12 cherry tomatoes2 bay leavesView image in fullscreen1 A note on the meatKleftiko is traditionally made with lamb shoulder, which is ideally suited to slow cooking. You could use a shoulder from an older sheep or goat instead, but neither will be as tender as lamb; they will be stronger in flavour, though. If you prefer leg, treat it in the same way, but bear in mind that it will probably require a little less time in the oven.2 Marinate the meatView image in fullscreenPeel and crush the half head of garlic, and rub the meat all over with olive oil. Sprinkle the cinnamon, oregano and salt all over the lamb, then top with the crushed garlic and the juice of one lemon, and rub in using your hands (wash and rub your hands with the cut lemon to help get rid of the smell of garlic afterwards). Cover and chill for eight to 12 hours.3 A note on the potatoesShortly before cooking, heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas 3. While it’s heating up, prepare the vegetables. Waxy potatoes (such as charlottes, maris peers, anyas or anything described as a salad variety) are the best bet here, because they will keep their shape during the long cooking time. There’s no need to peel them unless they’re very dirty.View image in fullscreen4 Prep the vegetablesCut the potatoes into wedges (if they’re small, just cut them in half; leave them whole if they’re real babies). Peel the onion (a yellow onion would also be fine here, as would shallots, peeled and cut in half), then cut it into chunky wedges. Halve the pepper, remove and discard the stalk, pith and seeds, then cut the flesh into thick strips.5 Other flavouringsView image in fullscreenWash the tomatoes – if you prefer, use larger ones, in which case cut them in half or, for really large fruit, into wedges. You could also add big chunks of feta (don’t crumble it, otherwise it will dissolve into the gravy) orkefalotyri, a few sprigs of fresh oregano, fennel, or even chunks of courgette or aubergine, though those aren’t strictly traditional.6 A note on the cooking vesselTake a large lidded casserole dish that’s big enough to hold the lamb with the lid on tightly, or use a roasting tin lined with enough baking paper to fold over the top of the joint on both sides (you’ll probably need at least two sheets of paper set at right angles to each other).View image in fullscreenPut the potatoes, onions, pepper and tomatoes in the casserole or tray.7 Add lemon, garlic and bayView image in fullscreenLay the marinated lamb on top of the vegetables, then pour any remaining marinade over the top. Cut the remaining head of garlic and lemon in half across their thickest points, squeeze the lemon briefly on top of the lamb (no need to wring it absolutely dry), then tuck the lemon shells, the half garlic heads and the bay leaves in and around the joint.View image in fullscreen8 Cover and bakePour 200ml water into the dish. If using a casserole dish, tuck a damp piece of greaseproof paper on top of the meat, then cover with the lid; if using a roasting tray, sprinkle the overhanging paper with water, then fold it up and over the meat and tuck in to form a sealed package. Bake for four to five hours, until the meat is very tender.9 Finishing touchesView image in fullscreenWhen the lamb is soft, turn up the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 6 and remove the lid and/or greaseproof paper. Roast for a further 10-15 minutes, then lift out the meat and set aside to rest for about 30 minutes. Put the pan of vegetables back in the oven for 15 minutes, until they’re starting to brown, keep warm until the meat has finished resting, then carve and serve up.Explore more on these topicsStewFelicity Cloake's masterclassGreek food and drinkFoodLambMeatPotatoesTomatoesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No, the stoves in this part of town have been bubbling away for decades – once upon a time,Keith Floyd, the original firestarter of the kitchen bad boys, held court on this very road. If you’re a young thing and blissfully unaware of our man Floyd, please avail yourself of thehundreds of YouTube clipsout there and count the many moments when his wit, snark and, in many cases, boggle-eyed drunkenness would not be deemed fit in these modern-day puritan times.Floyd may be long gone, but the 21st-century Chandos Road is home to, among others, the well-lovedLittle Hollows Pasta Coand the much-lauded farm-to-forkWilsons, and last autumn they were joined byKorean restuarant Dongnae, from husband-and-wife team Duncan Robertson and Kyu Jeong Jeon. The pair met atL’Atelier de Joël Robuchonin Paris, moved on to run the now defunct L’Envie in Brive-La-Gaillarde, south-west France, before spending the best part of a decade in Jeon’s native Korea. In 2019, they settled in Bristol to open the very popularBokman, where dumplings, kimchi fried rice and cherry-flavoured soft-serve Jersey ice-cream are the order of the day.View image in fullscreen‘Cute’: Dongnae’s charcoal-grilled dayboat mackerel comes with generousssamand sauces on the side.Their latest venture is a little more earnest, authentic and pared back, though. It’s billed as a traditional neighbourhood Korean barbecue restaurant, but it’s actually a little stranger and more homespun than that. While London restaurant investors might splurge tens of thousands of pounds on imported chandeliers, Dongnae uses Ikea-alike student bedsit paper lanterns in its two-store shopfront space, and has spent very little indeed on furniture, wallpaper and counters. Rather fittingly, in fact, it feels a bit as if you areina student bedsit, only with Robertson doing the communal cooking every night.In keeping with this general aura, the menu itself is delicate, bespoke and thoughtful, too. Expect octopus and lamb fatkkochi(skewers), assorted punchy kimchis, hand-dived scallops, cockle and mussel bibimbap, and Korean beef tartare. Expect cold, bracing Korean soups and peculiar but unforgettable pond-green puddings – but more of that later. At lunch, there is an à la carte and a £24 set menu and, at dinner, the option of ahanjeongsik,an omakase-style seven-course menu that changes daily, and offers a handpicked flurry of Korean loveliness.View image in fullscreen‘Like beef tartare, but not’: Dongnae’s yukhoe.Dongnae is odd, unique and absolutely a roaring hit with Bristol’s diners. It may not be to everyone’s taste, especially if your only knowledge of Korean cooking is generous portions of Brit-pleasing scallion pancakes, bulgogi and, of course, bubbling sweetcorn in cheese sauce, all washed down with peach soju. Instead, here there are ginger old fashioneds, a low-intervention wine list, delicate servings of grilled monkfish with octopus alongside tiny bowls of seasoned seaweed or mustard leaf kimchi, and a very good raw sea bassmulhwesoup made with fresh sugar tomatoes. And if you get a bit lost trying to make head or tail of the menu, Dongnae’s staff will expertly guide you through it and explain the difference between yournaengchaeand yournaengguk. Yes,yukhoeis like beef tartare, and here it comes with a mound of leaves, cucumber and radish, all designed to be rolled up in sheets of nori. Bowls of soft, glossy yellow tofu come festooned with whiffy grated bottarga, though the front of house couldn’t, of course, help me transfer it to my mouth when it evaded my attempts to capture it with the dainty chopsticks. We ate a hunk of hot grilled mackerel and cubes of wagyu that arrived on a cute little grill with generousssamand sauces on the side.View image in fullscreen‘One of the greatest things I’veevertasted’: Dongnae’s mugwort and black sesame cake.Dongnae is an ornate feast of sweet, sour, sharp, puzzling and powerful. It is little wonder that Bristol’s food scene is fighting for a table and feeling slightly irked that those tables now come with a limited time span. I didn’t really expect much from dessert, because on the face of it these people seem so very serious, but how foolish I was, because Jeon’s mugwort cake is one of the greatest things I’veevertasted. Yes, it looks like it ought to be dished up at a Harry Potter-themed tea party, and yes, it’s blue in places and algae-green in others, but the novelty ends the moment you bite into its complex, soft, creamy, buttery richness. Mugwort cake, it turns out, is the sponge cake it has taken me until my vintage years to discover, and now I pine for it daily. This higgledy-piggledy restaurant is causing a stir on Chandos Road, just as Floyd once did, but for very different reasons. Grab a seat if you can. Buckle up. Enjoy the ride.Dongnae5-7 Chandos Road, Redland, Bristol BS6, 0117 302 1034. Open Tues-Sat, lunch noon-3pm, dinner 5-11pm.

My father has a terminal illness and, realistically, won’t be with us much longer. My mum is therefore slowly and, with difficulty, contemplating a life without her partner ofmore than 50 years. I want to help her appreciate that a life without my dad can still be fulfilling, and I wonder whether a part of that could be to discover self-pleasure. Is that possible at her age? And, if so, could it be more traumatic todiscover that she lived for so long without knowing the sensation of orgasm or sharing that with her partner? Just as importantly, is this a conversationthat an adult child should have with their mother, and how should I go about it?I know a lot of people will feel uncomfortable about this, but I think it’s great that your mother is able to talk to you about these issues. She may also be wanting to impart some wisdom to you, perhaps about how important women’s pleasure is. And it’s interesting she’s spoken to you and not her friends. Did she ask for actual help? How was it couched?Your mother also has a condition which you asked me not to mention, and the medication for this can cause a reduction in desire or a heightened sexuality, so that is also something to consider. It may indeed be the latter, given the conversation happening now. There’s a lot going on in your lives, not least the prospect of profound grief, and I am very sorry about your dad’s illness.The good news is that of course your mother can be helped at 83 – 10% of people over 90 are still sexually activeIt’s never too late to discover the joys of self-pleasure. I went to counselling psychologist and psychosexual and relationship therapist Jo Coker, who is also director of therapy and training standards at COSRT, theCollege of Sexual and Relationship Therapists. She pointed out that it is not too late for your mum to have psychosexual and relationship therapy, either now or at a later date. “Your parents’ marriage has been a long one, and I expect your mother may have held on to the hope that an orgasm would eventually happen. Your father’s illness not only ends that hope, but incurs great loss and grief at losing her life partner and considering her future.“The good news is that of course she can be helped at 83 – 10% of people over 90 are still sexually active. If she does go to specialist therapy, the first thing would be to take a full history of her sexual development and sex life. Is there anything that may be preventing her from being able to orgasm?”There will also be questions relating to her understanding of sex, Coker explains. “Women of your mum’s generation may not be aware that clitoral stimulation is often needed to orgasm and there are several ways to achieve this.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I am guessing you won’t want to show her this reply, but that could be useful. Going to see a therapist may be a huge step – maybe one too far – for your mum, but it may also help her with the pre-emptive grief she feels.If we remove the idea of any sort of shame about sex, what we’re left with is a conversation about pleasure.

This is a definite low for the rubbery perforated clogs: theshare price is down nearly 30%– its lowest level for three years – and revenues are expected to drop by between 9% and 11% in the current quarter.To blame? Donald Trump mostly, and his tariffs. It’s not the first time Crocs have suffered at the hands – or feet – of a Republican US president, as it happens.I remember the beginning. They’d actually been around since 2002, but it was 2006 when the revolution properly got going. A bunch of cool people – Nicole Kidman, Matt Damon, Al Pacino – began to be seen out and about in them. George W Bush too, over presidential seal-emblazoned golf socks (the crocs’n’socks debate is an issue in itself), but even that didn’t stop Crocs’ inexorable rise.View image in fullscreenMichelle Yeoh in Crocs at the premiere of Ne Zha II this month.Photograph: Eric Charbonneau/A24/Getty ImagesFearful of missing out,I got myself a pair, in black (play safe to start with). I remember putting them on for the first time, a Cinderella glass slipper moment. How can they be so comfortable? So light? (Answer to the latter: because they’re not in fact made from rubber, but a proprietary cell resin called Croslite).They took me on holiday – the beach, boats and rocks – with no need for any other footwear. And then back from holiday, home, gardening, putting the bins out in the snow (socks allowed). I began to wear them at work; not just me: kitchen workers, hospital workers, cleaners, nurses, surgeons. As well as pairing well with scrubs, they’re easy to clean, comfortable to stand in for long periods and the little nodules on the inside massage the undersides of our feet. I’ve worn them ever since.The revolution didn’t meet with universal approval. The style police came for us, brandishing truncheons. Crocs are ugly they said, they look like clown shoes. Maxim magazine ranked them the sixth worst thing to happen to men in 2007; they made a Time magazine worst invention list in 2010; blogs popped up, likeIHateCrocs.com; plus a Facebook group,I Don’t Care How Comfortable Cros Are, You Look Like a Dumbass.Ha, guess what though: we were right and they were wrong. Fashion was the dumbass, and finally saw sense. Christopher Kane sent Croc-shod models down the catwalk at his 2017 spring show. Balenciaga hopped on the bandwagon, and then up, with a 10cm platform version, encrusted withwhat Vogue saidlooked like “the kind of plastic fridge magnets sold at airports.” Yours for just £600.View image in fullscreenBalenciaga’s 10cm platform Crocs.Photograph: BalenciagaCrocs had a good pandemic, with record £1bn revenue in 2020, and continued to do well in the early 2020s. The Crocerati continued to grow too – Justin Bieber, Post Malone, Ariana Grande, Nicki Minaj (the Crocs website crashed after she posteda picture of herselfin a hot pink bedazzled pair). Some of us smiled quietly to ourselves; yeah all right Nicki, we’ve known for some time.Royal approval too. When David Hockney – David Hockney! – went to lunch at Buckingham Palace he wore a checked suit and a pair of yellow Crocs. “Yellow galloshes!” declared King Charles, alighting on the nearest thing from his own world. “Beautifully chosen!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My colleague Tim Dowlinghas been spottedwandering around in what seem to be a pair of foot-gloves. Ridiculous!

Fashion – and the markets – are fickle things, they go up and down, like the tides. Class is permanent though. We the faithful will stand steadfastly, like Antony Gormley figures (does Gormley wear Crocs, anyone know?), while those tides – along with fads and US presidents – come and go. The water and the sand will pour out through the holes, we will be comfortable and happy, and yes, cool, because we will be wearing, and continue to wear, Crocs.Explore more on these topicsFashionTrump tariffsMen's shoesWomen's shoesRetail industryTariffsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Would letting them bring plus-ones make it work?Nick DuerdenSun 17 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTShareThey’ve packed too much, surely? The cabin crew do not look thrilled as I try to help squeeze each bag into the overhead lockers or the footwells under the seats in front. My 19-year-old has brought five and a half bikinis – we are away for a week – and her sister, four. (For comparison, I’ve taken my one and only pair of trunks.) The 19-year-old’s boyfriend has mercifully adopted a more minimal approach – just one wheelie for him – while the 17-year-old’s best friend has a different outfit for every day.If there is an unusual sense of excitement among us right now, then it’s because of the extrahumanbaggage in tow. The fact that each daughter has been permitted a plus-one on our family summer holiday this year means that we can still be together, but mostly apart.It’s how they like it these days.View image in fullscreenIt happened slowly at first, and then all at once. We had previously been a tight family of four who enjoyed each other’s company and loved going abroad. But then the girls grew fully into their Kevin and Perry years, and abruptly our holidays became protracted affairs, pierced by arguments, sulking and occasional stormings off, my wife’s attempts at diplomacy mostly failing. One daughter wanted the beach, the other the swimming pool, and then both decided they would much rather just stay in bed all day. Their phones made everything so much worse.View image in fullscreenStrolling in Cádiz’s old town.Photograph: Stefano Politi Markovina/AlamyI was ready to give up on such holidays altogether, but my wife persisted. Our last attempt was two years ago. I recall one particular evening in Skiathos, when the then 17-year-old announced she was craving cocktails, so we went to a bar filled with young people and bought three full-powered ones and a non-alcoholic equivalent for the 15-year-old. The gesture failed. We sat in silence as my daughter fumed at our very presence (me in sandals), and I reeled at the €50 bar bill.The 19-year-old wants only to tan, the 17-year-old to swim in the pool. The boyfriend wants a football to kick, while the friend wants to have ‘fun’Each of us by now wanted different things from our time away. There was bickering over breakfast options and wifi reliability, while my wife maintained the conviction that any loose collection of bricks upon the island – which she quaintly termed “historical ruins” – was worth a 30-minute trek in 32C heat to go visit. All I wanted to do was sit in a cafe with a sea view and read my book.Which is why this summer we said yes to them bringing guests. Add to the soup to dilute the soup. We’re in southern Spain. Here, the 19-year-old wants only to tan, the 17-year-old to swim in the pool. The boyfriend wants a football to kick, while the friend wants to have “fun”.“Relax,” my wife tells me. “It’ll be fine.”We arrive in Seville to thick heat and cicadas, and an immediate atmosphere of crop tops and flip-flops. Our hire car is enormous, a seven-seater, which the teens fill with pale, sprawled limbs. They are asleep within seconds of us hitting the motorway. It’s two hours to Cádiz, and I keep turning to look at them, to make sure they’re OK, these people we’re required to keep alive for the next seven days. When our daughters were younger, we would routinely meet their friends’ mothers and fathers, but all this stopped the moment they reached secondary school, when it became paramount to keep parents hidden over fears of public embarrassment.And so these are the children of strangers, essentially. The weight of responsibility hangs heavy. Whenever we go away, the dog-sitter sends us photographs of the dog, presumably to show us that she is safe and well. Should we be doing the same here for the kids’ parents, and have them holding up today’s newspaper to confirm the date?View image in fullscreenThe writer’s daughters when family holidays were simpler affairs.Photograph: Nick Duerden“I’ll deal with it,” my wife says, a woman with more numbers in her phone book than I have in mine.We are staying in the small coastal town of Zahara de los Atunes, famed locally for its tuna, and where Spanish tourists appear to outnumber Brits by 99 to one. It is close to midnight when we arrive. The air-con is complicated, and the bedroom fans appear stricken with seizures. I’m exhausted, but the children experience a second wind. They want to go into town, which is a 20-minute walk or five minutes in the car. One of us will have to take them. We toss for it. My wife loses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

There are leftovers from their post-midnight snacks on the kitchen table, alongside the dregs of sticky alcoholic drinks, which the ants have found and are now busy informing all their friends about. My wife and I enjoy a quiet breakfast on the balcony, then pad early to the beach before the winds pick up. (By afternoon, the wind here, known as thelevante, is strong enough to lift you from your towel and carry you across the Strait of Gibraltar before depositing you in Morocco.) We check our phones repeatedly for signs that the young ones have woken. When they do rouse, gone midday, they send us a list of requirements from the supermarket: chips and Haribo and Bacardi. We buy them fresh ingredients for summer salads instead.The weight of responsibility hangs heavy. Whenever we go away, the dog-sitter sends us photographs of the dog. Should we be doing the same here for the kids’ parents?All of us revert helplessly to type. We nag them about sunscreen and riptides, and make sure they know where the calamine lotion is. They sigh and mutter “yes, yes” and then ignore everything. We encourage them to drink plenty of water, and we navigate the minor squabbles that arise with nothing like aplomb. (It is too hot for aplomb.)My wife suggests excursions, the usual tourist preoccupations: souvenir shops, a museum, one of those churches with the nice stained windows. But none of them seem much fussed. They want rum. I, meanwhile, have the latest Sally Rooney and 800 pages ofHelen Garner’s diariesto get through.View image in fullscreenThe sisters outside a bakery in Cadiz.Photograph: Nick DuerdenWe do occasionally come together as a group, like normal people. One day, we drive an hour to Cádiz, its picturesque old town full of narrow streets and a vibrant food market. We eat tapas and drink wine, and the plus-ones listen patiently while we tell silly family stories in the way that all families do – and, as with all families, probably reveal ourselves as eccentric at best, or else certifiably mad. But they tolerate us, the plus-ones, and that’s the main thing. It’s a lovely evening.There’s a curious anticipation in the air when the time comes to go home. My wife and I are staying on for a few more days to explore the region in a smaller hire car, while the kids are returning for August jobs to help fund college and university.At the departure gate, I surprise myself by crying. All four of them look so beautiful and tanned, glowing with youth and vitality, their wrists full of friendship bracelets. I watch them stride away, specifically towards customs but also on into adulthood, without us, and I am overcome with emotion and love. I want them to come back, to extend the family holiday, because I’m not ready to consign it to the past, not just yet. But I know, too, that this is life; that it’s wise to let them go, be free.“Safe flight,” I cry out to them, a little too loudly. “Please remember to text when you land.

Archive photograph: courtesy of Tom GrennanBorn in 1995 in Bedford, Tom Grennan found fame as a guest vocalist on Chase & Status’s 2016 track All Goes Wrong, which led to his inclusion on the BBC Sound of 2017 list. Known for his blend of soul, pop and indie rock, he released his debut album, Lighting Matches, in 2018 and has since had more than 1.5m album sales and 2.5bn streams. His new album, Everywhere I Went Led Me to Where I Didn’t Want to Be, is out now. He tours from September.This was taken in my mum and dad’sfirst house in Bedford. It must have been Halloween but I’m not sure what kind of monster wears socks on his hands or a Tom and Jerry T-shirt. I look very happy but boisterous, too – that graze on my face was probably because I’d fallen off my bike.My childhood was rich in love: my mum was a teacher and my dad is a builder, and while they worked hard, they were always there. Mum played a lot of pop like Madonna and Robbie Williams in the house, and my dad liked Irish music and had an accordion. It was a very working-class background, and while we didn’t have a lot, I wouldn’t have noticed. We lived on a quiet street, we had a back garden and all I needed was a football. As well as being a handful, Mum says I was a kind boy who was quite emotional, too.‘People thought I was off my face’: indie rockers Hard-Fi look back at adrenaline, addiction and a life of excessRead moreI was popular at school, and although I wasn’t exactly a jock, being good at football does help you make friends. Socially I did well, but I was pretty naughty in class. I was dyslexic so I’d muck around and wouldn’t pay attention because I didn’t understand what the teachers were on about. They had this mad system at our school where they segregated our classes based on how well you behaved. There were about eight of us naughty kids who did lessons together. I didn’t do any work for four years. I got excluded a few times, too – mainly for being a pain in the arse. My friends who got excluded would just go home and play the PlayStation. Not me: my mum took me to the school she taught at and made me sit in isolation.I had no idea I could singuntil I was 18 and at a party. It was just after our A-levels and I’d got properly drunk for the first time. Someone put Seaside by the Kooks on to the stereo and I started singing along. People were like, “What the hell? Do that again without the music on!” The reactions I got that night gave me this confidence and fire in my belly. After that I went from being the popular boy who played football to the guy who sings in a band. Then there was a turn.Bedford is a lovely small town, with its good sides and its bad sides. Everybody knows everybody. Which can be nice, but not always. Once I started singing, there was this general attitude of, “Who do you think you are?” Friends became jealous and also resentful of what I was doing. Then the attack happened. One night, outside a chicken shop, I was beaten up by a group of strangers. The injuries were so bad, I had to have surgery on my jaw; they put in metal plates that I’ve only just had taken out. It wasn’t only my body that changed – the attack made my brain feel as if I had been rewired. I went from thinking that I was loved by everyone, this golden boy, to being someone hated by the entire world. It felt like even people who didn’t know me hated me.I was close to getting dropped because I was self-destructing. I would go on massive nights out that would end five days laterPretty quickly, I became chronically depressed. It felt as if I was being suffocated by all these dark, negative thoughts. I didn’t know whether I was going to kill myself or go out and do something stupid to the people that had messed me up. Before the attack I was an extrovert, someone who loved going out, finding adventures and never thinking of the consequences. Now I was an introvert who was terrified of leaving the house.Because my character was so differentand I had become a recluse, all the friends that I had at school didn’t want anything to do with me any more, apart from two, who are still my best friends. But in that loneliness and isolation is where I met my pen. I started to write down how I was feeling and I picked up a guitar and taught myself how to play. My mum was always asking me how I was doing, but I found it impossible to articulate it to her unless I put it into a song. Writing songs to process how I was feeling kickstarted the next part of my life. Every time I had an evening spare, I’d go to London and do open-mic nights. I was really naive and had no idea what I was doing or how to get discovered, but I knew that I loved performing my songs and meeting other musicians on the circuit. I looked like a proper indie boy – I had a shit beard, two nose piercings and wore skinny jeans, a hat and charity shop jumpers. It wasn’t until I put a song online, and then did a show in a pub afterwards, that someone from a record label reached out, asking, “Are these your songs?” I told him yes and he said I should come and see him. It all propelled from there.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionBeing in the music industry in London meant that nobody knew me or what I had been through. I realised I could create another persona, one that wasn’t still struggling mentally. I became the guy who’s always smiling but has a lot of problems underneath, and I found myself surrounded by the wrong people. There’s probably more awareness about drugs and alcohol now, but nine years ago that rock’n’roll lifestyle was normal and encouraged around artists. Suddenly I was the person who would get the most fucked up, the guy who was the loudest in the room. Professionally, I had about five years of coasting. I was lucky: I put records out, I did all right, but I was close to getting dropped at one point because I was just self-destructing all the time. I would go on massive nights out that would end five days later. I’d disappear on my own.At the start of 2020,Mum came to my house and stayed with me for a few days. She quickly realised that the way I was living wasn’t good. I was lost; I wasn’t taking care of myself as I had been going out too much. In the end, she told me: “It’s time to come home.” Then lockdown happened. I couldn’t go back to London as it was clear to my mum that I needed to be around people who knew and loved me. So I stayed in Bedford. I got fit, mentally and physically. I spent time with my brother and parents, and I reconnected with old friends on Zoom.Now I only drink alcohol on special occasions and only if I’m around good people. I got married last year – my wife is a pilates instructor, so she understands about keeping healthy, and always keeps me grounded. Writing songs and being in the studio brings out the best in me, too. I sound so boring, but it’s true. For a while I stopped being the kind, emotional kid that I was when I was little. It’s taken me a decade to figure it out, but I’ve done everything I can to get back to him.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFlashbackPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But to some, travelling to Turkey to gain a few inches is a (very high) price worth payingRuth MichaelsonSun 17 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTShareIt was on his honeymoon in Kuala Lumpur, looking out of his hotel window at the silvery points of the world’s tallest twin skyscrapers, that Frank decided it was time to become taller. He had recently confessed to his new wife how much his height had bothered him since he was a teenager. As a man dedicated to self-improvement, Frank wanted to take action. He picked up the phone, called a clinic in Turkey that specialises in leg lengthening surgery – and made a booking.“I had a lot of second thoughts – at the end of the day, someone’s going to break your legs,” he says, propped up on a hotel bed in Istanbul, his legs splayed in front of him, bracketed by a brace on each thigh. His wife, Emilia, tends to him, fetching painkillers and ice packs for the wound sites where the braces puncture his legs. For the first two weeks after surgery, Frank needed her help to get on and off the toilet, but now, six weeks later,it’s largely only to get off the bed.The bleep of an alarm interrupts our conversation: time to insert a key into the metal bracket on the side of Frank’s thigh and turn it, forcing apart the rods that have been inserted into his femurs. New bone grows into the gap in his thigh bones, one agonising millimetre at time. Each turn of the key dictates how much the patient can grow, and Frank is aiming for five turns each day rather than the four recommended by his doctors, to gain a precious extra quarter of a centimetre. It means more suffering, but Frank is all about putting in the work to get what he wants. “Time to grow!” Emilia says, with a little laugh, as the alarm sounds.Be honest, have you had work? 11 people open up about what they do – or don’t do – to their faceRead moreAt 5ft 6in (1.7m) tall, slightly under the average male height worldwide, Frank, 38, feels he has lived life “as a short man”. But speak with any patient at the Wanna Be Taller clinic in Istanbul, where Frank chose to undergo leg lengthening, and it becomes clear that shortness is relative. Men over 6ft have had the procedure. One tells me he needed surgery to “correct” his bow legs and decided to add some height at the same time. A slim blond woman – a rare example of a female patient here – who was 5ft 3in before surgery, looks me square in the eyes as she deadpans that shortness “is the last acceptable prejudice in society” to explain why she underwent the procedure to gain two inches. (The clinic also offers leg shortening surgery, though this is far less common; only nine patients have so far had it done, mainly women.)Frank, meanwhile, is determined to become taller than Emilia – who is 5ft 5in – by gaining 9cm, just above the 8.5cm doctors told him is the maximum his muscles and tendons can safely handle. This would make him 5ft 9in. His dream is simple: being average height.Five turns of the key daily means he stands to gain just over a millimetre a day for 10 weeks. It’s not without its challenges: “Sometimes the nerve pain wrecks me.” Frank prides himself on being a self-starter: he has the words “self made” tattooed across his knuckles and a likeness of his hero, Arnold Schwarzenegger – in his view, the ultimate self-made man – on his thigh. Arnie’s face is slowly being stretched as Frank grows. “I’m making my own height, choosing how tall I want to be,” he says. “I am very ambitious: if I want something, I go for it. Until I do it, it almost torments me.”View image in fullscreenFrank turns the key that forces apart the rods in his femurs …View image in fullscreenstarts learning to walk again …View image in fullscreenand has physiotherapy. Photographs: Bradley Secker/The GuardianTo the casual observer, leg lengthening looks like a form of medieval torture, and earlier that day I watched as a physiotherapist gently lifted each of Frank’s new legs while he groaned with pain – straightening his hamstrings feels impossible, as if they might snap. He is in recovery from the first of two surgeries: this one broke his femurs to insert metal rods and add fixators. The second will remove the fixators after he has completed the key-turning process, in three months’ time. Some patients choose to have their shin bones broken instead, or in addition, in a bid to be even taller.If having your leg bones cut in half sounds painful enough, the true agony comes afterwards. Ensconced on the periphery of Istanbul, in a hotel built from what looks like plasterboard and fake gold leaf, about 20 leg lengthening patients spend their days obsessing over their muscles and tendons, making sure they stretch to accommodate their new bones. This means daily physiotherapy to learn how to walk again, blood thinners, massages and a lot of painkillers. While there are few global statistics on the number of people opting to have this done each year, one Indian market research firm estimated the global limb lengthening industry will balloon by 2030 to be worth $8.6bn (£6.4bn).“I always tell them, 1cm is not more important than your health,” says Serkan Aksoy from Wanna Be Taller, who supervises Frank’s physio. Most of their patients are men, and Aksoy has to dissuade many clients from trying to gain too much height. From the clinic’s perspective, the risks come from patients not adhering to a strict aftercare routine, but problems and even deaths do occur. Blood clots, joint issues, failure to grow new bone tissue, blood vessel injuries, scarring and chronic pain are all potential complications, as well as “ballerina syndrome”, where the achilles tendons fail to stretch adequately, forcing the feet into an exaggerated arch and preventing the patient from walking. Last year, a patient who had flown in from Saudi Arabia died from a blood clot 16 days after undergoing leg lengthening surgery. When I ask Wanna Be Taller about this, they say an investigation by the Saudi authorities found no fault with their surgeon.View image in fullscreenYuto from Japan has surgery to remove his femur stretchers.Photograph: Bradley Secker/The GuardianEven though Frank chose a cheaper option, involving external fixators rather than an electronic internal device, the $32,000 (£24,000) price tag – including months in a hotel and physiotherapy – has put a major dent in the funds the newlyweds had planned to use as downpayment for a mortgage. When I ask about this, Emilia describes how months of travel across Asia gave them a new perspective. The couple began to think they were placing too much importance on material things rather than aiming for true contentment. “Having food, a comfortable bed – that’s real happiness,” Emilia says. “After that, if it’s buying a house, we’ll go for it. And if it’s breaking your legs and being tall, go for it.”The idea that breaking bones can provide a way to shorten or lengthen a limb is widely attributed to the Soviet surgeon Gavriil Abramovich Ilizarov, who developed the “Ilizarov technique” in Russia in 1951. This involved adding external metal rings around a broken bone to stabilise it, held in place by metal pins or wires. If the patient wishes to grow, the frame can be used to draw sections away from one another; Ilizarov found new bone grows between them, adding length. His technique has since been adopted globally.While more sophisticated techniques are now common, the principle remains. Today, leg lengthening is even available on the NHS at a specialised clinic within the Royal National Orthopaedic hospital. Even so, a spokesperson for the RNOH’s limb reconstruction unit tells me the 100 or so patients they treat annually are there to recover from injury or correct deformities – and patients lengthening both legs are rare.The same spokesperson lists their concerns about patients going overseas for “a procedure with significant risks and an arduous physical therapy requirement”. These include clinics downplaying the dangers while overplaying “the cosmetic benefits”, and a lack of proper aftercare. The NHS routinely treats patients with problems after surgery abroad, and a study conducted by the RNOH “revealed a significant cost burden to the NHS” for treating botched cosmetic leg lengthening.View image in fullscreenAfter leg shortening surgery, Althea from the Philippines …View image in fullscreenhas physio …View image in fullscreenand a height check. Photographs: Bradley Secker/The GuardianChina’s health ministry banned cosmetic leg lengthening in 2006, fearing the dangers to patients in a growing and unregulated industry, but the practice has persisted elsewhere. Private treatment in the UK can cost upwards of £50,000, with some surgeons charging £240,000 to lengthen two bones in each leg. What makes a growing number fly to Turkey from as far afield as Australia or Japan is lower prices.Frank can reel off a list of negative experiences stretching back into adolescence that he believes stemmed from his height. There was the pain of his friends suddenly becoming taller than him after he stopped growing around the age of 15. There were the kids at school who taunted him for his height; a longtime online fan of his artwork who remarked, on meeting him, that Frank was “shorter than I expected”; or the guys who randomly shoved him in the street a few years ago, tearing out his headphones. They wouldn’t have done that to a taller man, he reasons. In Frank’s view, tall people don’t realise their privilege. “It’s hard to explain if you’re not a short man yourself, but in modern society it’s almost a curse,” he says, as he carefully keeps watch over his pain medication and blood thinners.Then, of course, there were all the stinging dating experiences before he met Emilia, such as the woman 6in smaller who showed up for coffee and immediately said he was too short for her. Experiences like this, he says, are standard for his short male friends. The dating app Tinder even recently trialled a feature that lets paying users set a height preference. “Even tall men are having problems now,” he says. “The new fashion is 6ft 4in, otherwise you’re a piece of shit.” All of this wore Frank down before he stumbled across a YouTube video a few years ago, showing leg lengthening surgery.View image in fullscreenFrank compares his new height with his wife’s.Photograph: Bradley Secker/The GuardianOur conversation inevitably drifts towards issues of masculinity. A recent study showed that young men in the UK now outspend women on minimally invasive “tweakments” such as Botox injections – which some practitioners now jokingly refer to as “Brotox”. Then there’s the growth of the so-called “manosphere”, which deifies the ripped torso of Joe Rogan or Photoshops Donald Trump on to a picture of a bodybuilder. Surely when we’re talking about male height, we’re really talking about masculinity – and power? Frank bats it away: he doesn’t have any time for those toxic alpha male types. “This surgery isn’t about that – I don’t think it’s about being more masculine, it’s about being average height,” he says.Not long after our conversation, Frank woke up one night in “some of the worst pain I’ve ever felt”. He tried to scream while struggling to breathe, but the four huge ice packs on his legs did little to dull the pain. After clinicians rushed him to a nearby hospital, he was treated for a pulmonary embolism – a blood clot that travelled into the arteries of the lung. A representative from Wanna Be Taller later tells me Frank and the Saudi Arabian patient are the only two of their 700 clients who have experienced a blood clot following surgery. Frank, it turns out, needed a higher dose of blood thinners. But while a blood clot is a rare side-effect, the fate of the Saudi patient shows that it can be fatal.Even from his hospital bed, in agonising pain, Frank had continued to turn the key on his fixators. But after speaking with his doctor, it turned out his nerves and tendons had been stretched to their limit – he was unable to straighten his legs. It was time to remove the fixators early, cutting off his growth. He had grown 7.3cm, putting him just under his 5ft 9in goal.Frank is determined he won’t be treating shorter men any differently now, but one interaction with another patient has stayed with him. “I saw him as a short man for the first time. Not in a bad way, but I saw why people perceived me as a short man – and I felt tall compared with him. Now, every time a woman comes near me, they’re shorter,” he says, with undisguised glee.“It’s worth it at the end, if you see the difference between me and her,” he says, pointing at Emilia.Some names have been changed.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleHealth & wellbeingCosmetic surgeryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He nominated his 36-year-old minister of government, Eduardo del Castillo, who has been polling at about 2%, to run for president.Morales, 65, is thetarget of an arrest warrantfor allegedly fathering a child with a 15-year-old and has beenentrenched in a coca-growing regionof central Bolivia since October in an attempt to run for office again.After registering with another party but being barred by constitutional and electoral court rulings, Bolivia’s first Indigenous president called protests thatescalated into deadly clashes with police.He is urging supporters to cast null votes on Sunday, claiming that if these outnumber the leading candidate’s tally,it would mean he had won.Carlos Toranzo, a political analyst, said: “Before Morales’s call, null votes were about 10%; now they’re 12%. Even if it rises, I doubt it will go much higher – and null votes have many causes, not just him.”As polls have historically been unreliable inBolivia, and many voters remain undecided, Toranzo said there was “a small chance” that a third person could make it to a potential runoff against Doria Medina or Quiroga – the 36-year-old senator Andrónico Rodríguez.The highest-polling figure on the left, placing between third and fifth, Rodríguez was once seen as Morales’s natural heir due to his Indigenous roots and leadership in the coca growers’ union, but was called a traitor for launching his own candidacy.A longtime Mas member, the senator chose to leave the party and run with the leftwing coalition Alianza Popular – another sign of how fragmented the left’s vote has become.Enrique Mamani, the leader of the Aymara Indigenous organisation Ponchos Rojos, said he would back the senator, calling Morales the real traitor.“Those calling for null votes are a handful of traitors to the struggle of our grandparents, who shed their blood and gave their lives so that one day we could have this right to vote,” he said.On Sunday, as Rodríguez cast his vote in Entre Ríos, in the Cochabamba tropics – a Morales stronghold in central Bolivia – he wasbooed by some voters, whothrew stones and glass bottles at the candidate. A clash broke out between the senator’s supporters and opponents, and he left the scene reportedly unharmed.Despite the incident, the president of the electoral court, Óscar Hassenteufel, said the elections are, overall, taking place in anatmosphere of “considerable calm”.View image in fullscreenRodríguez is escorted by a member of the armed forces after people threw stones at him.Photograph: Agustín Marcarian/ReutersAbout 7.9 million Bolivians are eligible to vote, and preliminary results are due at 9pm local time.The central issue of the campaign is the economic crisis, which analysts consider the worst since the hyperinflation of 1985, with shortages of dollars and fuel,long queuesand soaring inflation.“It’s a very difficult moment but I hope that after this vote things can improve,” said Silvia Marca, 42, after casting her ballot in La Paz. She runs a small street business and said trade had dropped sharply in recent months. “I hope the right wins,” she added.If no candidate secures more than 50% of the vote, or at least 40% with a 10-point lead over the runner-up, an unprecedented second round will take place on 19 October.For the analyst Toranzo, one thing is certain: Mas will leave power, although he said it will be “difficult for them to hand it over, because they have held it for 20 years with near-absolute control of parliament, the judiciary and the electoral authority”.Arcetold the Guardianhe would respect the result if the right won. Although acknowledging that his government was unpopular, he placed much of the blame for the crisis and Mas’s decline on his former mentor, Morales, whose parliamentary allies, he said, had “sabotaged and boycotted all our laws”.“As Fidel Castro wrote in his book, history will absolve us, because in the long run the people will understand everything we had to endure,” Arce said. “I’m sure the population will miss us afterwards.”On a cold Sunday morning in Bolivia’s capital, the president was greeted with chants of his nickname “Lucho” by about a dozen supporters as he arrived to cast his ballot. A voter criticised Arce and was then harassed by the group.“I only said to him: ‘What happened to the country, president?’ and those people started to attack me. I bet they are government employees,” said the woman, who asked not to be identified. “I know I’m not the only one in this country who is fed up with this government. We’re all frustrated that our money doesn’t stretch.”In Santa Cruz de la Sierra, the country’s commercial hub, Arce’s candidate was booed. According to the newspaper El Deber, Del Castilloreportedly skipped the queueand was told by a woman: “Get to the back. Line up like we do at the petrol stations.”Explore more on these topicsBoliviaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But as the country goes through itssecond-worst burn on record, the blazes come with a twist: few are coming from the western provinces, the traditional centre of destruction.Instead, the worst of the fires have been concentrated in the prairie provinces and the Atlantic region, with bone-dry conditions upending howCanadaresponds to a threat that is only likely to grow as the climate warms.Experts say the shift serves as a stark reminder that the risk of disaster is present across the thickly forested nation.Canada wildfire season already second worst on record as experts warn of ‘new reality’Read moreIn recent weeks, tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes due to the wildfires. Saskatchewan and Manitoba have been the worst hit, covering more than 60% of the area burned in Canada. But the fires have also seized strained resources in Atlantic Canada, where officials in Newfoundland and Labrador are struggling to battle out-of-control blazes.In response to the crisis, the Newfoundland premier, John Hogan, said on Wednesday morning he would temporarily ban off-road vehicles in forested areas because the province “simply cannot afford any further risks, given the number of out-of-control wildfires we have”.The ban follows a similar move by Nova Scotia, where a 15-hectare (37-acre) out-of-control fire is burning outside the provincial capital, Halifax. In addition to barring vehicles in wooded areas, Nova Scotia officials so shut down hiking, camping and fishing in forests, a decision reflecting the troubling fact that nearly all fires in the province are started by humans.“Conditions are really dry, there’s no rain in sight, the risk is extremely high in Nova Scotia,” the province’s premier, Tim Houston, told reporters. “I’m happy to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to protect people, to protect property and try to just get through this fire season and really just pray for rain.”Fires have even erupted in Ontario’s Kawartha Lakes region, a collection of rural communities less than 100 miles (160km) north of Toronto that are a popular summer destination for residents of Canada’s largest city.For a country of sprawling landmass, fires have long been a common feature of the hot spring, summer and autumn. But for the last century, a mix of geography, climate and industry meant that the biggest and hottest fires – and the vast majority of destruction – have been concentrated in Canada’s western provinces.That changed in 2023 when Canada had its worst fire season on record and thethick haze of smoke blanketed the US.View image in fullscreenNew York blanketed with smoke from Canadian wildfires in 2023.Photograph: David Dee Delgado/Getty Images“We had fire everywhere. We had evacuations everywhere. We had smoke at a scale that was remarkable,” said Paul Kovacs, the executive director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction at Western University. “And so for the first time, we had a different thought about wildfires as a country. With all of the smoke, it became a global conversation. This year is repeating all of that. This is a national issue. This can show up anywhere.”Kovacs, whose organisation focuses largely on preventing structural loss, said more buildings had been destroyed this year compared with 2023, and he warned that a majority of the residents of the most fire-prone parts of the country, such as British Columbia and Alberta, had not yet taken steps to protect or “harden” their homes from fire risk.He hopes that a broader national recognition of fire risk spurs people in other parts of the country to reassess how vulnerable their home or business might be to a fast-moving blaze.“That’s the behavioural change we’re hoping to see next, because there will be many years of fires to come,” he said. “The size of the burned area will not go back to where things were 25 years ago. This is just our new reality and we need to be prepared. We need a change in mindset and a recognition that this can, and probably will, happen in so many parts of our country.”Already, nearly 7.5m hectares (18.5m acres) have burned across Canada in 2025, far above the 10-year average.Despite the national threat, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to reducing risk, said Jen Baron, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia’s Centre for Wildfire Coexistence.“British Columbia and Alberta have long been the poster children for this wildfire problem for a long time, but other regions are beginning to experience some of those same challenges,” she said. “This speaks to the pervasiveness of climate change: even if a location was relatively low fire risk in the past, with the extended droughts that we’re seeing, that’s no longer the case now and into the future.“Even though some parts of the country are having a wet year on average, things across the board are still warmer and drier than they were in the past.”Canada: generations old and new scramble to contain fires burning at record paceRead moreThat uncertainty has prompted amultimillion-dollar funding effortfrom the federal government to study risk and adaptation, because “there are very few parts of Canada that would be totally protected from wildfire”, Baron said.With aninternational focus on wildfires, experts like Baron hope the recent years of immense blazes and choking smoke can spur a response that acknowledges thelegacy of forestry industry practices, urban encroachment into the wilderness and theIndigenous stewardship of forests.“We’re just starting to catch up to the scale of the problem,” she said. “Wildfire is a natural ecological process, but it’s become increasingly challenging to manage with changing climatic conditions.”The concerns in Canada echo those emerging across the Atlantic as southern Europe grapples with one of its worst wildfire seasons in two decades.In Spain, officials were scrambling on Sunday to contain 20 major wildfires. The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said during a visit to the north-western region of Galicia: “There are still some challenging days ahead and, unfortunately, the weather is not on our side.”After fires killed three people and burnt more than 115,000 hectares, Sánchez said his government would seek to put forward a “national pact” to deal with the climate emergency.“We need to reflect deeply on how we can rethink our capabilities, not only in terms of responses but also in terms of preventing everything related to the climate emergency, whether it be fires, storms, or any other climate-related natural disaster,” he said.In Portugal, the area burned by wildfires this year is 17 times higher than in 2024, at about 139,000 hectares, according to preliminary calculations by the Institute for the Conservation of Nature and Forests. Across Europe, countries such as Greece, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Albania have requested help from the EU’s firefighting force as exhausted officials battle forest fires, fuelled by record-breaking temperatures, dry conditions and strong winds.In Canada, Baron said the mild nature of this year’s western fire season provided a glimpse into the country’s future.“Instead of one big fire year every 15 or 20 years, every year will be big in some part of the country,” she said. “We really don’t know exactly how climate change is going to continue. It doesn’t drive things in linear ways. And we can’t predict where there’s going to be a drought next year. But it will be somewhere.”Additional reporting by Ashifa KassamExplore more on these topicsCanada wildfiresCanadaWildfiresClimate crisisExtreme weatherAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, that timeline was thrown into question after the union told Reuters it would challenge the return-to-work order, which it described as unconstitutional.It was the latest twist in talks that have dragged on since March as the flight attendants seek to address the fact that they are not compensated for work carried out when planes are not in the air such as time spent on the ground between flights or helping passengers to board.On Saturday, Canada’s federal jobs minister, Patty Hajdu, said it was clear the talks had reached an impasse and that the impact was being felt by Canadians and visitors across the country.“The talks broke down,” said Hajdu as she told reporters that she had asked the Canada Industrial Relations Board to order an immediate end to the strike and to impose binding arbitration. “It is clear that the parties are not any closer to resolving some of the key issues that remain and they will need help with the arbitrator.”She appeared to link her actions to the toll thatUS tariff increaseshad taken on the Canadian economy. “In a year in which Canadian families and businesses have already experienced too much disruption and uncertainty, this is not the time to add additional challenges and disruptions to their lives and our economy,” she said in astatement.Hajdu’s power to halt the strike stems from a section of the Canada Labour Code, which gives the ministerunilateral authorityto end work stoppages in order to “maintain or secure industrial peace”. While the section was rarely used by previous governments, the Liberal government has invoked it several times in the past year,quelling strikesby workers at Canadian ports, the post office and railway companies. Analysts havevoiced concernsthat the use of the clause may be undermining workers’ rights.The union representing the flight attendants decried the Liberal government for stepping in within hours, accusing it of violating their right to take job action. Air Canada had reportedly previously requested that the government intervene to impose binding arbitration.Wesley Lesosky, of the Canadian Union of Public Employees,saidthe government was giving “Air Canada exactly what they want – hours and hours of unpaid labour from underpaid flight attendants, while the company pulls in sky-high profits and extraordinary executive compensation”.According to the aviation analytics firm Cirium, the airline had cancelled 671 flights by Saturday afternoon, leaving some travellers stranded overseas and others scrambling to find alternatives during the busy summer travel season. About 130,000 customers a day could be affected by a disruption, according to the airline.The airline said earlier it had offered its flight attendants “an increase of more than 38% on global compensation”, but the union said the figure failed to fully account for inflation. Air Canada also said it was willing to pay flight attendants 50% of their wage for work done before planes take off, leading the union to reply that its members should be fully compensated for their labour.About 70% of the airline’s flight attendants are women, said Natasha Stea, a local union president and flight attendant. She questioned whether they were being treated fairly, given that Air Canada pilots, thevast majorityof whom are men, received asignificant raiselast year.“We are heartbroken for our passengers,”she told the Associated Presslate last week. “Nobody wants to see Canadians stranded or anxious about their travel plans, but we cannot work for free.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAir transportUnionsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It is unclear what Labor will settle on.The commission hasset out proposals for how tech, including AI, could be regulated and treated in Australia, suggesting it could add up to $116bn to Australia’s GDP.However, the commission wasstrongly criticised last week for suggesting big tech companies be allowed to mine Australian copyright content– including music, literature, art and journalism – to train their AI models, an idea advanced by the Tech Council of Australia and its chair, the Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquharson.The Tech Council on Monday released its submission to the roundtable, where it again called for “copyright reform” including “narrowly tailored text‑and‑data‑mining exceptions and increased access to high‑quality Australian datasets” to help train AI models.“Australia’s current copyright frameworks are restricting frontier AI innovation. Training foundation models depends on text and data mining,” the submission read.Wood’s speech notes contain no repeat of the Productivity Commission’s controversial suggestion for a copyright carve-out, but she will again call on the government to not overregulate AI.“While managing the risks is important, we do not think that a new and overarching regulatory framework for AI is the way to go. That’s because the risks posed by AI are mainly existing risks,” she will say.“AI may make it cheaper, easier and faster for bad actors to create harms, but most of these harms – from product safety, to discrimination, to fraud – are already covered by regulatory frameworks.”Explore more on these topicsProductivity CommissionBusinessAustralian politicsProductivityJim ChalmersAustralian economyArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, says she was sent home without being given an ultrasound or undergoing any further investigation.When she presented to the hospital again two days later with worse symptoms, an MRI revealed she had acute appendicitis. During surgery to remove the appendix, it was found to be perforated and had a gangrenous tip, with free pus also found in the woman’s pelvis.Public-private pain: buying back Sydney’s embattled Northern Beaches hospital faces uncertain prognosisRead moreShe was discharged from the hospital after three days without being provided with oral antibiotics, according to her claim. Also, she did not undergoCRP testing, which can detect signs of inflammation or infection, and was not assessed by the obstetrics and gynaecology registrar before her discharge.Less than a week later she presented again at the hospital feeling feverish and experiencing pain in her right flank, and suffering from diarrhoea and nausea.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailShe was transferred to Royal North Shore hospital, where she was diagnosed with sepsis and chorioamnionitis, an infection of the placenta and the amniotic fluid, and underwent an emergency caesarean.An amended statement of claim filed for the child on 20 June this year, with the mother acting in his place, alleged Northern Beaches hospital breached the duty of care it owed the child by failing to take 22 precautions.Those included failing to diagnose the mother with appendicitis on the day she first presented to the hospital and failing to perform the surgery to remove the appendix immediately.After the surgery, the precautions taken should have included performing blood tests, white blood cell count, CRP testing, an assessment by the surgical team, an ultrasound examination and an MRI investigation, the statement of claim alleged.The documents alleged the mother should not have been discharged when she was, as the hospital should have considered her perforated appendix, its gangrenous tip and the free pus and checked her inflammatory markers.She should also have been provided with antibiotics on discharge, the statement of claim alleged.The hospital’s failure to take those precautions caused or materially contributed to the child suffering injuries, including the consequences of being born significantly prematurely, and general bodily trauma and shock, the statement of claim alleged.A statement of particulars filed on 24 May 2024 gave further details of the consequences of the alleged medical negligence on the part of the hospital.The document outlined claims that the child had experienced “continuing disabilities” and “loss of enjoyment of life”, including continuing restriction on the enjoyment of and participation in normal social and recreational activities such as socialising with friends and family, domestic activities and recreational travel.The district court declined to allow access to the hospital’s defence to the statement of claim.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The family requested that the amount not be made public.Northern Beaches is the only hospital inNew South Waleswhere public services are provided by a private company, Healthscope, under a complex contract.After years of mounting debt and a string of complaints about care standards – including the death oftwo-year-old Joe Massaand a woman whosebaby died in childbirthbecause an emergency caesarean was offered too late –the hospital went into receivership in May. The NSW government is trying to buy it.NSWHealthreferred a request for comment on the baby’s case to Healthscope.A Healthscope spokesperson said: “We reached an amicable resolution with the family which was approved by the court. Out of respect for the family, we will not be providing further comment on this matter.“While adverse incidents happen at all hospitals, the team at Northern Beaches hospital (NBH) has been subjected to intense scrutiny and speculation. The fact is the hospital treats over 80,000 patients every year and the vast majority receive outstanding care,” the spokesperson said.“Indeed, the recently published Clinical Excellence Commission (CEC) report on Northern Beaches hospital noted that the hospital is ‘staffed by a committed and professional workforce with a shared focus on delivering safe, high-quality care.’ The CEC also found that the level of serious incidents at the NBH (Harm Score 1) is broadly comparable to its peer hospitals.”Lawyers for the family said they declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsHealthSydneyNew South WalesNew South Wales politicsHospitalsnewsShareReuse this content"

You don’t have the cards right now.”Trump, after his summit on Friday with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, has reportedly endorsed the Kremlin’s one-sided plan to end the war inUkraine. It includes Kyiv giving up territory that Russia has been unable to seize and no ceasefire until a final deal has been agreed.Posting on Truth Social, Trump accused the media of misrepresenting his “great meeting in Alaska” – an encounter widely seen as a victory for Putin and a humiliation for the US president. On Sunday, Trump claimed he had made “big progress” onRussia, without giving details.European leaders on Monday will reaffirm their support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and argue against a land swap plan that rewards Russian aggression. They will also seek further clarity on what security guarantees the US is willing to offer in the event of a settlement.Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s envoy to international organisations in Vienna, said early on Monday that Russia agrees that any future Ukraine peace agreement must provide security guarantees to Kyiv, but added that Russia “has equal right to expect that Moscow will also get efficient security guarantees”.In a conciliatory statement announcing his visit to Washington, Starmer praised Trump for his “efforts to end Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine”. At the same time, Starmer reasserted Europe’s red lines. He said the “path to peace” could not be decided without Zelenskyy and said Russia should be “squeezed” with further sanctions.Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN that Putin had agreed for the first time for the US and Europe to provide protection to Ukraine as part of a deal. This would be outside the auspices of Nato but would be the equivalent of the alliance’s article 5 self-defence pact, Witkoff indicated.Ukraine mapSpeaking in Brussels alongside von der Leyen, Zelenskyy rejected Putin’s latest demand for more land. The Russians want Ukraine to cede the entirety of the Donetsk region, including a number of Ukrainian-controlled cities, as well as Luhansk province, which Moscow mostly occupies.Zelenskyy said Putin had been trying for 12 years to fully capture Donetsk oblast, without success. He said the current frontline should form the basis for negotiations, adding that territory could only be discussed in a three-way format with Kyiv at the table. A powerful Ukrainian army was the best security guarantee, he added.Starmer, Merz and Macron hosted a video call with European allies on Sunday before their Washington trip. “Ukraine must be a steel porcupine, indigestible for potential invaders,” von der Leyen said, stressing there could be no Russian-mandated limits on Ukraine’s armed forces.According to the New York Times, Trump told European leaders he believed a peace deal could be negotiated if Zelenskyy agreed to give up the Donetsk region. They were unconvinced. The EU shares the Ukrainian view that Putin would use any new territory as a springboard for a further attack.Two sources with direct knowledge of the talks in Alaska told the Guardian that Putin had offered to freeze the frontline in southern Ukraine if he got Donbas. The plan would mean thousands of civilians would be forced to abandon their homes in key eastern cities such as Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, which have withstood years of Russian attacks.Before Friday’s Alaska summit, Trump said he wanted an immediate ceasefire. Over the weekend, however, the US president endorsed Russia’s demand for a peace deal first and a truce second. Ceasefires “often times do not hold up”, Trump saidin a social media post.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump greets Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersTrump also appears to have dropped his threat of economic penalties on countries that buy Russian oil if Moscow refuses a deal. He has repeatedly threatened to impose secondary sanctions, setting various deadlines and failing to follow through when they expire.Trump on Sunday expressed his frustration at recent media coverage. “It’s incredible how the Fake News violently distorts the TRUTH when it comes to me,” he posted. “There is NOTHING I can say or do that would lead them to write or report honestly about me. I had a great meeting in Alaska on Biden’s stupid War, a war that should have never happened!!!”He added: “If I got Russia to give up Moscow as part of the Deal, the Fake News, and their PARTNER, the Radical Left Democrats, would say I made a terrible mistake and a very bad deal.”Speaking to the BBC, the former British defence secretary Ben Wallace described Trump’s apparent support for Putin’s demands as 1930s-style “appeasement”. He said the strategy – with pressure piled on Ukraine to agree – may save lives “in the short term” but in the long term “would probably put us at greater risk”.Ajoint statementissued by European leaders on Saturday said they were “ready to work with US President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy towards a trilateral summit with European support” but “it will be up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory. International borders must not be changed by force.”They said they welcomed “President Trump’s efforts to stop the killing in Ukraine, end Russia’s war of aggression, and achieve just and lasting peace”.View image in fullscreenThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, the president of the European Council, António Costa, the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, and the France defence minister, Sébastien Lecornu, attend a video conference with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, last week.Photograph: Philippe Magoni/EPAZelenskyy said ina statementafter his conversations with Trump and the European leaders: “The positions are clear. A real peace must be achieved, one that will be lasting, not just another pause between Russian invasions. Killings must stop as soon as possible, the fire must cease both on the battlefield and in the sky, as well as against our port infrastructure. All Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilians must be released, and the children abducted by Russia must be returned.”Donald Trump reportedly delivered letter from first lady to Vladimir PutinRead moreOlga Tokariuk, a fellow at the Centre for European Policy Analysis, said Zelenskyy had a “difficult task” in Washington. He had to “demonstrate that Ukraine wants peace, but not at any cost, to ensure Ukraine still gets US support,” she said. At the same time he could not make concessions “unacceptable for Ukrainians”.Trump was unlikely to treat Zelenskyy with the “same friendliness as Putin”, she predicted. “The US under Trump is no longer willing to stand by its democratic allies, while instead it is embracing the tyrants,” she added.Additional reporting byPeter WalkerExplore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpKeir StarmerEmmanuel MacronFriedrich MerznewsShareReuse this content"

The Donbas also comprises Luhansk province, which is almost totally occupied by Russia.Prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion the population of Donetsk was 1.9 million, so the number of people with property and other connections to the area wanted by Russia is higher. “So when someone brings up the idea of ‘trading territory’, we must understand that in practice it is trading people,” Yanchenko said.graphicSerhii Kupavykh, who was born and raised in Kramatorsk but now lives in Kharkiv, said he believed that allowing Russia to take his city and the rest of Donetsk would amount to “a defeat in the war, which will lead to a split in society”, though he recognised that gradual Russian advances had made the defence of them difficult.He said Zelenskyy had “no right to resolve such issues unilaterally” and he believed that “renouncing the territory is political suicide for the entire government” – though he acknowledged that Ukraine was in a complex position.Cartoons and memes circulated widely online over the weekend with a particular focus on the sight of US soldiers kneeling to straighten out the red carpet in Alaska for the Russian president. “Dishonored,”wroteSerhii Sternenko, a Ukrainian drone fundraiser, on X, comparing the image to soldiers raising the US flag at Iwo Jima towards the end of the second world war.Maksym Palenko, a cartoonist,drew a pictureof a glum-looking Trump with his trademark red tie spooling out beneath him and turning into a carpet on which a laughing Putin was standing. It reflected shots of Putin smiling as he was sitting in Trump’s limousine while it was setting off.European leaders including Starmer to join Zelenskyy in Washington for meeting with TrumpRead more“We do not deserve to surrender and we are not in a position to surrender,” said Oleksiy Goncharenko, an MP with the opposition European Solidarity party. “This part of Donetsk is a fortress and Putin has tried and failed to take it for 11 years. Now he wants to take it through diplomatic tricks and manoeuvres.”Russia’s military has struggled to capture urban centres during the war, and the Kramatorsk area is one of the most heavily defended in Ukraine. Last week Zelenskyy said it in effect protected the centre of the country and there was no guarantee that handing it over would not prevent a new war.Goncharenko said Putin’s offer to freeze the conflict in the western Kherson and central Zaporizhzhia provinces if Ukraine hands over Donetsk was designed to provoke splits in Ukraine and abroad and the situation needed to be handled with care.Zelenskyy’s response needed to be “well framed, to persuade Trump that Putin has set a trap, because we have seen in the past that the relationship between Trump and Zelenskyy can be quite explosive,” Goncharenko said.View image in fullscreenUkraine’s armed forces fire at Russian invading troops in the Donetsk region, Ukraine.Photograph: Pierre Crom/Getty ImagesOn his previous visit to see Trump at the White House, Zelenskyy was ambushed by Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance, and got into a bitter public argument with both, leading to a pause in intelligence sharing and arms deliveries at a crucial point in the battle.Sevgil Musaieva, the editor of Ukrainian Pravda, saidin a columnpublished on Sunday: “We are being forced to behave as if we have to admit defeat. Not military, but political. Not a surrender of arms, but a surrender of thought.”She said this was “the most dangerous form of defeat. Because if we accept it internally then external defeat will only be a matter of time.” In fact, “for the first time in a century, Ukrainians put up a worthy resistance,” she said.“We have no right to forget Bucha, Izium, Mariupol. We have no right to forget the torture, the mass graves, the children killed and abducted by Russia,” she said, arguing that “without memory we will lose ourselves”.Oleksii Kovzhun, a popular Kyiv-based video blogger, said Putin’s demands were “akin to capitulation” and that “Zelenskyy could not legally hand over Donetsk even if he would want to (and he does not)” because it would have to be subject to a referendum. “Ukrainians will not allow it,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

If not, it’s just called surrender. And neither side is going to surrender. So both sides are going to have to make concessions.”Rubio said the recent talks in Alaska between Russian presidentVladimir Putinand his US counterpartDonald Trumptoward ending the war had “made progress in the sense that we identified potential areas of agreement – but there remains some big areas of disagreement”.“We’re still a long ways off,” Rubio added. “We’re not at the precipice of a peace agreement. We’re not at the edge of one. But I do think progress was made and towards one.”He declined to go into specific areas of agreement or disagreement, or outline what Trump has described as “severe consequences” forRussiaif its aggression towardUkrainecontinued.Trump reportedly to back ceding of Ukrainian territory to Russia as part of peace dealRead more“Ultimately, if there isn’t a peace agreement, if there isn’t an end of this war, the president’s been clear – there are going to be consequences,” Rubio remarked. “But we’re trying to avoid that. And the way we’re trying to avoid those consequences is with an even better consequence, which is peace, the end of hostilities.”US special envoy Steve Witkoff said Putin agreed at the summit to allow the US and Europe to offerUkrainea security guarantee resembling Nato’s collective defense mandate as part of any peace deal.In an interview on CNN, Witkoff said the US had won the concession that “the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO”. He said the concession was “game-changing”.Rubio agreed that no agreement was possible without both sides – including that of Ukrainian presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyy– being at the table. “You’re not going to reach a ceasefire or a peace agreement in a meeting in which only one side is represented,” Rubio told ABC News. “That’s why it’s important to bring both leaders together – and that’s the goal here.”Rubio confirmed that a ceasefire – or, as Trump now reportedly prefers, a straight-to-peace deal – “is going to be difficult”, despite the White House’s openly demanding one.The war, he said, has been “going on for three and a half years”.“You have two very entrenched sides, and we’re going to have to continue to work and chip away at it,” Rubio said.Separately, on NBC’s Meet the Press, Rubio said a ceasefire was “not off the table”, though he added: “It was agreed by all that the best way to end this conflict is through a full peace deal.”He said the US had advocated for a ceasefire, but “unfortunately, the Russians as of now have not agreed to that.“But the ideal here, what we’re aiming for here is not a ceasefire,” he said. “What we ultimately are aiming for is an end to this.”Soon after Rubio told Meet the Press that “no one is pushing” Ukraine to give up territory, Trumpshared a Truth Social postfrom a supporter that said: “Ukraine must be willing to lose some territory to Russia otherwise the longer the war goes on they will keep losing even more land!!”Nonetheless, Rubio said he doubted that a new set of western sanctions on Russia would force Moscow to agree to any deal.“The Russian economy has basically been turned into a full-time wartime economy,” Rubio told CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday – while pointing out that Russia is estimated to have lost 20,000 soldiers in the last month alone.“That just tells you the price they’re willing to pay,” Rubio said. “Not saying any of this is admirable – I’m saying that this is the reality of the war that we’re facing. It’s become attrition, in some ways. It’s a meat grinder, and they just have more meat to grind.”He also denied that Trump, as critics claim, had merely given the aggressor in the conflict, Putin, an unwarranted place on the world stage.“Putin is already on the world stage,” Rubio said on ABC News. “The guy’s conducting a full scale war in Ukraine.“That doesn’t mean he’s right about the war. That doesn’t mean he’s justified about the war. You’re not going to end a war between Russia and Ukraine without dealing with Putin. That’s just common sense. So people can say whatever they want.”On NBC’s Meet the Press, the Democratic US senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut countered on Sunday that the Trump-Putin “meeting was a disaster”.“It was an embarrassment for the United States,” Murphy said. “It was a failure. Putin got everything he wanted.”Murphy said that Trump had given Putin “that photo-op” he wanted and to “be absolved of his war crimes in front of the world.“War criminals are not normally invited to the United States of America,” Murphy remarked.Secondly, he said, Putin had not been forced to give up anything.“President Trump said he wanted a ceasefire – it appears the ceasefire wasn’t even seriously discussed,” Murphy added. “And then, third, there’s no consequences.“Trump said, ‘If I don’t get a cease fire, Putin is going to pay a price.’ And then he walked out of that meeting saying, ‘I didn’t get a ceasefire. I didn’t get a peace deal, and I’m not even considering sanctions.’”European leaders including Starmer to join Zelenskyy in Washington for meeting with TrumpRead moreFiona Hill, a deputy assistant to Trump in his first term, told CBS: “The optics were much more favorable to Putin than they were to the United States. It really looked like Putin set the agenda there, the narrative and in many respects the tone for the whole summit meeting.”The national security adviser during Joe Biden’s presidency, Jake Sullivan, said the prior administration had concluded – based on contacts – that Russia was not in a position to negotiate an end to the war.“We didn’t want to set up a summit where we were literally rolling out the red carpet for Putin in America to have him come and walk away and continue the war without any clear and convincing outcome of the summit,” Sullivan told ABC News.“I think our judgment on that was correct,” he added, saying any summit needs to be “properly prepared to produce an outcome that the American president can articulate in advance and produce in the aftermath”.“The outcome that this American president articulated, a ceasefire or consequences – he did not produce,” Sullivan said. “And that is why I think we find ourselves in a difficult situation today.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaUkraineMarco RubionewsShareReuse this content"

Whatever the reason, when it comes to Ukraine, the UK prime minister is once again hoping to exploit this somewhat curious relationship.As soon as it was announced that a string of European leaders planned to join Volodymyr Zelenskyy to back the Ukrainian president in crucialtalks with Trump at the White Houseon Monday, it was obvious Starmer would be joining them.The idea of Britain beingsome sort of bridgebetween US and European interests is something of a longstanding UK diplomatic cliche, and not one that always necessarily carries much meaning.But in the case ofUkraine, Starmer has very deliberately sought to position himself as a leader who can get along with Trump while consistently stressing to him Europe’s red lines over any peace plan, and trying to sweet-talk the president into offering US security guarantees.Zelenskyy may be asked to cede land to Russia at Trump meeting in WashingtonRead moreRecent months have presented several opportunities for Starmer to make this case in person, including February’s Oval Office meeting between the pair, a bilateralat the G7 in Canadaand talks during Trump’s ostensibly non-workvisit to Scotlandlast month.Starmer has shown his willingness to throw the diplomatic kitchen sink at efforts to keep Trump on side, including in Februaryhanding the presidenta written invitation from the king for an unusual second state visit.Similarly, the No 10 statement announcing Starmer would join the Zelenskyy meeting had more praise for Trump’s “efforts to end Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine”, even if many UK diplomats would most likely privately view Trump’s summit withVladimir Putinin Alaska as at best inconclusive, at worst a Russian trap.Such efforts have yielded results, with Trump repeatedly saying how much he likes Starmer, despite their very obvious political differences.As with anything Trump-related, even the best-worked plans can be upended by events, most spectacularly the way that Starmer’s ultra-careful Oval Office appearance was followed a day later by Zelenskyy beinghumiliated by Trumpand JD Vance.More recently, Starmer’s delicate handling of Trump at the G7 – which in its most visible form saw the PM bend downto collect papersspilled by the president – did not prevent Trump leaving the summit early and then reneging on a plan to call for restraint in tensions between Israel and Iran.Monday’s White House event could go south at similar speed, especially given reports that Trump seems minded totake up Putin’s suggestionon Ukrainian territorial concessions in exchange for peace, something Zelenskyy and other European leaders have consistently ruled out.There is an extent to which this does not matter. Any sort of Trump diplomacy is always in part an exercise in luck. And as Starmer knows, when dealing with Ukraine, even if it does not work, it has to be attempted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But No 10 can point to results, notably theUK’s relatively light treatmentunder the new regime of US tariffs.Pulling Trump out of Putin’s orbit when it comes to peace in Ukraine could be a bigger ask.

Stop the war!” shouted the vast crowd, which had converged on the so-called Hostage Square in Tel Aviv plaza – a focal point for protesters throughout the war.The Hostage and Missing Families Forum, the initiator of the day of protest, estimated that about 500,000 people joined the demonstration in Tel Aviv – a figure not confirmed by the police. “We demand a comprehensive and achievable agreement and an end to the war,” said Einav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan and a leading figure of the protest movement.Israeli media ‘completely ignored’ Gaza starvation – is that finally changing?Read more“We demand what is rightfully ours – our children. The Israeli government has transformed a just war into a pointless war.”National media published a video message by Matan Zangauker on Sunday, in which the hostage, weak and emaciated, addressed his family and told them he missed them. The video was filmed by Hamas and found in Gaza by the army, the family said.“This is probably the last minute we have to save the hostages,” demonstrator Ofir Penso, 50, told AFP.The protests come more than a week after Israel’s security cabinetapproved plans to capture Gaza City, 22 months into a war that has created a dire humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territory.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum campaign group vowed on Sunday that protesters would “shut down the country” with the goal of bringing back the hostages and ending the war.Throughout Israel, demonstrators blocked roads, set tyres on fire and clashed with the police. More than 30 protesters were arrested, law enforcement said.Netanyahu criticised the protesters, saying their actions “not only harden Hamas’s position and draw out the release of our hostages, but also ensure that the horrors of 7 October will reoccur”.View image in fullscreenVast crowds in Tel Aviv demanded the government abandon its decision to fully occupy Gaza City and sign a prisoner exchange agreement.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesEgypt said in recent days mediators were leading a renewed push to secure a 60-day truce deal that includes hostages being released, after the last round of talks in Qatar ended without a breakthrough.Some Israeli government members who oppose any deal with Hamas criticised Sunday’s demonstrations. Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, decried a “perverse and harmful campaign that plays into the hands of Hamas” and calls for “surrender”.However, Benny Gantz, an opposition leader, condemned the government for “attacking the families of the hostages” while “bearing responsibility for the captivity of their children by Hamas for nearly two years”.Israel’s military offensive has killed at least 61,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry, most of them civilians.

Nakba means catastrophe in Arabic.Much of Israel’s leadership and media has usedgenocidal rhetoricabout Palestinians since Hamas’s 7 October attacks, includingdescribingthem as “human animals”,sayingthere are “no innocents” in Gaza and calling for Gaza’stotal destructionand itsethnic cleansing.However, Haliva’s description of a campaign of mass killing including children was an unusually direct description of collective punishment of civilians, which is illegal under international law.Haliva, who stepped down from his position in April 2024, also appeared to endorse the casualty figures compiled by health authorities in Gaza, which Israeli officials regularly attack as propaganda. They have proved reliable in past conflicts.Channel 12 said the undated conversations were recorded “in recent months”. The Gaza health ministry’s toll for those killed by Israeli attacks passed 50,000 in March and has recently climbed above 60,000.Israel’s most recent publisheddataon the war put the number of militants killed at about 20,000, so Haliva would have been aware that even by his country’s own count most of the Palestinians killed were civilians.“The fact that there are already 50,000 dead in Gaza is necessary and required for future generations,” he said in the broadcast comments. “For everything that happened on October 7th, for every person on October 7, 50 Palestinians must die. It doesn’t matter now if they are children.”About 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas-led cross-border attacks, the majority of them civilians, and 250 were taken hostage to Gaza.Channel 12 did not clarify how it had obtained the recordings or who Haliva was speaking with. Israel’s Haaretz newspaper described the recordings as a format that allowed the retired officer to “give an interview … without actually being interviewed”.Haliva’s comments about mass killings of Palestinian civilians did not make headlines in other mainstream Israeli outlets. They focused instead on his criticism of Benjamin Netanyahu and warnings of systemic failures in security and intelligence.That coverage highlighted thevast gulfbetween how the war is perceived and discussed inside Israel’s borders and beyond them.Israeli media ‘completely ignored’ Gaza starvation – is that finally changing?Read moreAmong Israelis, Haliva is widely seen as a centrist critic of the current government and its far-right ministers such as Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, as the general himself noted in the broadcast comments.He quoted an internal critic at the intelligence directorate telling him it was “lucky” that many of those killed and kidnapped on 7 October 2023 were leftwing Israelis linked to peace movements.“He told me: ‘If this had happened to us, the right, you wouldn’t have gone to war like this,’” Haliva said. “That’s what people believe here.”Quique Kierszenbaum contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The channel said the undated conversations were recorded “in recent months”.And in the US the state departmentannouncedthat it would stop issuing visas to children from Gaza in desperate need of medical care after an online pressure campaign fromLaura Loomer, a far-right influencer close to Donald Trump who has described herself as “a proud Islamophobe”.View image in fullscreenA Palestinian woman, displaced by the Israeli offensive, shelters in a tent camp in Gaza City.Photograph: Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersAfter Israel’s announcement, Palestinians in Gaza – displaced repeatedly, forced to live in tent camps or amid the ruins of their homes, stricken by hunger and deprived of medical supplies – are bracing for another humanitarian disaster as a new offensive would force them toward the south of the territory and an uncertain future.“We are already destroyed and exhausted, physically and psychologically, from repeated displacement, from the lack of food and water,” Akram Shlabia, 85, told the Guardian from the Shuja’iyya neighbourhood of Gaza City. “And now they want us to go to the south. Into nothingness, into the unknown, into a place without shelter or the basic means of life, even safety.”“We will face many problems in displacement,” said Mazen Hasaneh, 40, from al-Tuffah neighbourhood, who has been displaced six times during the war. “First, securing a way to transport the necessary items like a tent and other basics, and of course many drivers will exploit people’s desperation and raise prices, while people have no money to pay.“The second problem is finding a place to set up the tent and settle, along with the difficulty of finding and providing water and food. Everything about displacement is suffering, especially in our current conditions.”Some families have already begun moving south to secure shelter in anticipation of possible evacuation, while others are contacting relatives to ask about available space should the relocation plan proceed. Yet many say they will remain in Gaza City, declaring they would rather stay than face the hardships of displacement.“If the plan is carried out, I will look for a safe place for myself and my children within Gaza, and I will not consider moving to the south of the Strip,” said Asma Al-Barawi, 34, from al-Tuffah, the mother of seven children. “I didn’t leave the first time, and I won’t leave this time. The experiences and suffering I heard from the displaced who went south were harsh and unbearable.”“I lost everything because of this war,” she added. “I lost two of my brothers, two of my maternal aunts with their families, my cousin, and my father-in-law. And, I lost my new home, which I only left with some clothes.”In recent days, heavy explosions have echoed from areas east of Gaza, where Israeli forces have intensified operations, including artillery barrages and the start of an incursion on the outskirts of the Sabra neighbourhood.On Saturday a baby girl and her parents were killed when an Israeli airstrike hit a tent in al-Muwasi,previously designated a humanitarian zone by Israel, in southern Gaza, Nasser hospital officials and witnesses said.“Two and a half months old, what has she done?” a neighbour, Fathi Shubeir, asked. “They are civilians in an area designated safe.”Israel’s military said it could not comment on the strike without more details.View image in fullscreenDisplaced Palestinians make their way towards the site of a humanitarian aid airdrop at the Bureij camp in Gaza on Sunday.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty ImagesAl-Muwasi is now one of the most heavily populated areas in Gaza after Israel pushed people into the desolate area. But the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said last week that Israel planned to widen its coming military offensive to include the area, along with Gaza City and “central camps” – an apparent reference to the built-up Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps in central Gaza.According to the civil defence agency, at least 13 of the Palestinians killed on Saturday were shot by troops as they were waiting to collect food aid near distribution sites in the north and the south.There were also another 11 malnutrition-related deaths in Gaza over the past 24 hours, the health ministry said on Saturday, including at least one child. That brought malnutrition-related deaths due to the Israeli blockade on aid to 251.Meanwhile in Israel police blasted crowds with water cannons and made dozens of arrests on Sunday as thousands of protesters in Jerusalem demanded a deal to free hostages in Gaza. The demonstrators aimed to shut down the country with a one-day strike that blocked roads and closed businesses.Groups representing families of hostages organised the demonstrations as frustration grows in Israel over plans for the new military offensive, which many fear could further endanger the remaining hostages, about 20 of whom are believed to still be alive.“We don’t win a war over the bodies of hostages,” protesters chanted in one of the largest and fiercest protests in 22 months of war.Protesters gathered at dozens of places including outside politicians’ homes, military headquarters and on major highways. They blocked lanes and lit bonfires. Police said they arrested 38 people.Israel’s military offensive has killed at least 61,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry, most of them civilians.

Inside Israel, however, the reaction has been markedly different.In a poll conducted in late Julyby the Israel Democracy Institute(IDI), more than three-quarters of Jewish Israelis – 79% – said they were either “not very troubled” or “not troubled at all” by reports of famine and suffering among Gaza’s Palestinian population.View image in fullscreenFourteen-month-old Hazar Arfa, receiving treatment at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, was in critical condition due to severe malnutrition.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesAccording to Anat Saragusti, an expert on the media, the reason is simple: most people in Israel are unaware of those reports because for months they have never seen them.“Until a couple of weeks ago, you could count only a handful of reports from Gaza not filtered by the IDF,” said Saragusti, the head of freedom of the press at the Union of Journalists in Israel. Except for a few newspapers such as the leftwing Haaretz, she said, “all the other mainstream media completely ignored what’s going on on the Palestinian side – the human casualties there, the numbers of children killed in this war. The Israeli audience simply did not see that at all.”In the past few weeks, the growing focus on the issue in the international media has led to some Israeli newspapers and TV channels reporting on hunger in Gaza for the first time, albeit as a debatable issue.Since the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023, public debate in Israel has largely centred on national security, the plight of the Israeli hostages captured by Hamas, and the country’s military goals in Gaza. In that climate, the humanitarian disaster caused by the Israeli assault on Gaza has tended to occupy a marginal place in the minds of many Jewish Israelis, who largely view the conflict as a legitimate act of self-defence in response to Hamas’s attacks – althoughpolls also showa clear majority want a deal with Hamas to end the war in exchange for the freedom of the remaining Israeli hostages.View image in fullscreenAn anti-government protest calling for action to secure the release of Israeli hostages held captive since the 7 October attacks.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianMedia analysts say Israel’s main broadcasters have largely embraced the narrative of a government described as the most far-right in the country’s history.For months, the Israeli media have responded to international outrage by focusing on Israeli claims that the widespread hunger documented by numerous aid agencies is “a Hamas-orchestrated starvation campaign” – summed up by Benjamin Netanyahu’sclaim last month: “There is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza.”According to UN World Food Programme, one-third of the Palestinian population in Gaza isgoing for days without eating, and half a million are on the brink of starvation.“The worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,” the UN-backed group the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)said last month, calling for an urgent ceasefire to alleviate “widespread starvation”.View image in fullscreenFive-month-old Ammar Muhammad Ammara has suffered from a persistent high fever and severe malnutrition since birth.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesAccording to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), another five people died last week due to malnutrition and starvation, bringing the total number of malnutrition-related deaths to 227, including 103 children, since October 2023.Even Donald Trump, Netanyahu’s key international ally, when asked if he agreed with the Israeli PM on the issue, said: “I don’t know … those children look very hungry … that’s real starvation stuff.”In a rare press conference with foreign journalists in Jerusalem last Sunday, Netanyahu displayed photographs of skeletal children in Gaza anddismissed them as fake, claiming they were part of a Hamas plot to attack Israel.He compared these images with aphotograph of the Israeli hostage Evyatar Davidreleased by the Palestinian militant group early in August, pointing out that while the man held in Gaza appeared to be starving to death, the arm of a Hamas fighter visible in the frame looked strong and muscular. The implication was clear, according to the prime minister: the fighters of Hamas were eating well and keeping food from the Israeli hostages and from the public of Gaza.View image in fullscreenAmira Muteir holds the hand of her five-month-old baby Ammar, who she says is wasting away from malnutrition.Photograph: Mahmoud Issa/ReutersSaragusti said: “Despite images of emaciated children published by major newspapers around the world, Israel pushed back. And Israeli media outlets adopted the narrative set out by the Israeli leadership, insisting that there is no starvation in Gaza.”Although Israel appears to exist within its own bubble, shielded by a narrative that leaves no room for the suffering of people in Gaza, thousands of demonstrators who recentlyfilled the streets of Tel Avivare now urging the government to halt the atrocities against the Palestinians.“I think it is horrendous what is happening in Gaza,” said Lenny Kadmon, 19. “I think that the main reason not everyone here is against it is because most people find it too difficult or too scary to look at themselves and at what we do in Gaza.”Gal Alkalay, 28, said: “I come here to protest in Tel Aviv every weekend. We ask our PM to end the war. Only in this way we can end the starvation in Gaza and the return of our hostages.”And yet, despite a growing number of Israeli intellectuals using the word “genocide” to describe their government’s actions in Gaza – as the award-winning author David Grossmandid just a fortnight ago– analysts say they remain a small minority.In Jerusalem, where tensions between Arabs and Israelis are sharper, the majority of Jewish residents continue to align themselves with the narrative of Israel’s political leadership.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Asked what she thought of the suffering of Palestinian children in Gaza, Myriam Israel, 34, said: “I think people should also see the suffering of our children terrorised by Hamas. But the world thinks only about children of Gaza. I think Hamas needs to think about their own children. And we need to think about the security of our country.”Zalman Coleman, 21, said: “All you have to do is use your brain five seconds and you can see that Hamas’s ultimate aim is to get that number [of deaths] as high as possible. And then from that, turn the whole world’s face against Israel. [In this conflict] the media had so much potential to do so much good in the world. But they chose fake news.”View image in fullscreen‘Hamas’s ultimate aim is to get that number [of deaths] as high as possible,’ said Zalman Coleman (left) a 21-year-old Israeli living in Jerusalem.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianSince the Hamas-led attacks of 2023, Israel has almost completely barred foreign journalists from entering Gaza – an unprecedented move in the history of modern conflict, marking one of the rare moments that reporters have been denied access to an active war zone.Reporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists have formallycalled for Gaza to be opened to foreign media, warning that current measures severely undermine press freedom.Many argue that the Israeli ban is a deliberate tactic to restrict independent scrutiny, limit international visibility of the conflict, and thus control the narrative.View image in fullscreenUltra orthodox Jewish at the men's section of the Western Wall.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian“The only way to enter Gaza and cover the war is to embed in Israeli army units,” said Saragusti – and even that is rarely allowed. “There is no independent press in Gaza. There are only the Palestinian journalists, who many of them have been killed. Israel claims that there is no starvation but doesn’t let the foreign press in to check by itself whether there is starvation or not.”Up to now, she added, “the press blockade has succeeded very well in its goal”.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPress freedomMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

We only add words where we think they’ll have staying power.”Older generations and those not on TikTok will have just to get used to words such as skibidi. Children often use it to add emphasis to statements. It became popular thanks to Skibidi Toilet – a viral animated video that began on YouTube featuring human heads protruding from lavatories.The Cambridge Dictionary defines skibidi as “a word that can have different meanings such as ‘cool’ or ‘bad’, or can be used with no real meaning as a joke’, an example of its use is: ‘What the skibidi are you doing?’”People older than generation Alpha tend to greet the use of the word with despair . The US writer and artistLee Escobedo wrote in the Guardianearlier this year: “Skibidi brainrot encapsulates a generation fluent in irony but starved for meaning. This kind of hyper-chaotic media serves as both entertainment and an ambient worldview for young men raised online. Their minds normalise prank-as-expression.”The tradwife phenomenon, which dates to a least 2020, has also beenwidely criticised. It refers to socially conservative influencers who celebrate looking after their husbands, children and homes and post about it onTikTok, Instagram and YouTube. The dictionary definition says a tradwife is “especially one who posts on social media”.Delulu, an abbreviation of delusional, is less controversial, but has become associated with a post-truth world where personal beliefs are more important than reality. Its dictionary entry defines it as “believing things that are not real or true, usually because you choose to”.Delulu emerged more than 10 years ago as an insult directed at obsessive K-pop followers fans to question their belief that they would date their idols. The term“delulu is the solulu”for manifesting your wishes has been viewed billions of times on TikTok. The phrase“delulu with no solulu”was used earlier this year by Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to attack his opponents in parliament.“Broligarchy”, a term for the tech industry leaders on whose platforms many of these new words are spreading, also makes it into the dictionary.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Patients can access them through a referral from their GP or clinical teams at hospitals.The government has revealed that 100 CDCs are open 12 hours a day, seven days a week – an increase of 37 CDCs with such opening hours compared with July 2024 – with the hope that the service will allow patients greater and speedier access to diagnosis.The move to provide more convenient care is part of the government’splan for changewhich, it says, aims to transform healthcare and make the NHS fit for the future, with an expansion of community-based services a key part of the approach.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said: “This government is determined to offer healthcare that fits around working people’s lives and not the other way around.“From early morning MRI scans to late evening blood tests, we’re meeting patients where they need it most by extending the operating hours for community diagnostic centres and putting patients first.”View image in fullscreenWes Streeting said the government wanted healthcare to fit around working people’s lives.Photograph: Ben Montgomery/Getty Images for ActivateThe government has also committed to building up to five more CDCs in 2025-26 and is planning to extend opening hours for all CDCs at evenings and on weekends.It saidlatest datashowed the NHS delivered more than 1.6 million more tests and scans from July 2024 to June 2025 compared with the same time the previous year.Sarah Sleet, the chief executive at Asthma + Lung UK, welcomed the expansion of opening hours for CDCs.“Making it easier for people to access tests close to home is crucial to improve diagnosis rates for lung conditions,” she said.Extra cancer scans for women with dense breasts could save 700 lives a year – UK studyRead more“Receiving an early and accurate diagnosis is essential for treating and managing someone’s lung condition, it can lead to a reduction in hospital admissions and even lengthen their life. We hope this focus on neighbourhood diagnostics will lead to quicker diagnosis of lung conditions, the UK’s third biggest killer, at a time when a historic lack of access to tests is leaving tens of thousands of people breathless and anxious.”Laura Challinor, the senior policy manager at Blood Cancer UK, also welcomed the expansion of out-of-hours appointments but said further action was needed given blood cancer was the UK’s third biggest cancer killer and survival rates were lagging behind those of similar countries.“For CDCs to be of most benefit to people with blood cancer, we also want to see a commitment to end regional variation in diagnostic testing practice, including full blood count (FBC) tests available for those presenting with non-specific symptoms, and timed diagnostic pathways developed for blood cancers,” she said.Charlotte Beardmore, the executive director of professional policy at the Society of Radiographers, said CDCs offered patients improved access to routine imaging investigations, while timely diagnostics through CDCs were essential to ensure patients could access treatments sooner.But while Beardmore said the location, and extended opening hours of CDCs, could make it easier for patients to attend, she stressed a growing demand for imaging meant the government must invest in the radiography workforce.“This means investment in newNHSposts for radiographers to ensure all CDCs offer the capability, flexibility and the range of services for patients in their local community,” she said. “Without radiographers CDCs cannot function.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthHealth policyEnglandWes StreetingnewsShareReuse this content"

Workers would routinely “hit pigs with boards, paddles and their fists, deliberately targeting areas such as their snout and eyes”.One piglet, which “showed clear signs of extreme pain”, was reportedly left dying for 33 hours as other piglets cannibalised an open wound. “He had no escape from being eaten alive,” said the narrator of the film published on the AJP website, claiming that workers ignored the pig’s squeals of distress.“During our filming, Somerby Top [Farm] was audited by Red Tractor,” the narrator said. “Yet just two weeks later, when we returned, we were met with the same squalid conditions.”Red Tractor said it could not verify this, but responded to the “deeply distressing” footage by suspending Somerby Top Farm’s certification with “immediate effect” and referring the farm to the government animal welfare regulator, the Animal and Plant Health Agency.“Red Tractor is conducting a thorough review of both current and historical footage, compliance and staffing on the farm,” the organisation said in a statement. “The farm will remain unassured if Red Tractor is not satisfied our standards are met.”They said footage had only been presented to Red Tractor this month. “This delay is concerning and suggests that these activists have prioritised ideology over protecting animal welfare. Red Tractor provides a free anonymous whistleblowing service and we actively encourage anyone with concerns to raise these so that we can investigate immediately.”In a statement, Cranswick said the health and welfare of its pigs was the company’s “highest priority”: “We are horrified to see the unacceptable treatment of pigs at Somerby Top Farm, [which was] historically recorded and brought to our attention this week.”The company added that since May, when covert footage filmed by AJP showed apparent abuse at another of its farms,North Moor Farm, it has installed CCTV at all its indoor pig farms, recruited five new welfare officers, retrained all its farm workers and commissioned an independent veterinarian-led review across all its farms.It said it had launched an investigation as soon as the AJP shared the footage: “The staff involved are no longer with the business.”Morrisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Its executives were paid a total of £212m, according to the analysis.The High Pay Centre, which campaigns for fairer pay, found that the highest paid chief executives were the current and former boss of Melrose, Peter Dilnot and Simon Peckham respectively, who between them took home nearly £59m for the last financial year, mostly thanks to long-term incentive payments.Melrose sparked outragelast Juneby handing out a reward pot worth more than £175m to 21 current and former executives in shares under a bonus scheme set up in 2020.The lion’s share was received by Peckham, one of the business’s co-founders, along with the company’s former chair Christopher Miller and the former finance director Geoffrey Martin.The use of long-term incentive payments (LTIPs) by large listed companies rose in the last financial year, with 84 out of 100 chief executives paid an LTIP in the last financial year, compared with 81% a year earlier.Pascal Soriot, the chief executive ofpharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, who spent the last two years as the FTSE 100’s highest paid boss, was pushed into third place in the last financial year after earning £14.7m.Soriot is now ranked behind theMelroseexecutives as well as the current and former bosses of the education publisher Pearson on the High Pay Centre’s league table. Andy Bird, Pearson’s current chief executive, and his predecessor Omar Abbosh, together earned almost £19m in the last financial year.The number of FTSE 100 companies paying their leaders £10m or more increased in the past year, rising from 10 to 13, at a time when Britain’s cash-strapped households continue tofeel the squeeze of the cost of living crisis, and the Bank of England has warned that rising food prices could fuel further inflation.The figures also revealed a gender pay gap at the top of corporate Britain, as female leaders of the largest listed companies still tend to earn less than their male counterparts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fierce and beautiful in his youth, his screen presence evolved into something more elegant and enduring as the swinging 60s faded from viewTerence Stamp: a life in picturesTerence Stamp remembered by Priscilla director Stephan Elliott: ‘Those eyes turned everybody to jelly’Xan BrooksSun 17 Aug 2025 13.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 17 Aug 2025 22.04 EDTShare“Astranger arrives, makes love to everyone and then leaves,” said Pier Paolo Pasolini toTerence Stamp, outlining the plot of his 1968 classic Theorem. “That’s your part.” Stamp exclaimed: “I can play that.” It was the role that the man was born to play and would play, with subtle variations, throughout his career.From his first appearance as the eerily beautiful sailor in 1962’s Billy Budd through to his last manifestation as “the silver-haired gentleman” in Edgar Wright’sLast Night in Soho, Stamp remained a brilliantly, mesmerisingly unknowable presence. He was the seductive dark prince of British cinema, an actor who carried an air of elegant mystery. “As a boy I always believed I could make myself invisible,” he once said. He showed up and made magic, but he never stuck around for as long as we wanted.Terence Stamp, face of 60s British cinema and star of The Limey and Superman, dies at 87Read moreStamp’s talent was timeless but he was a creature of the 60s, forged in the crucible of postwar social mobility and as much a poster boy for the era as his one-time flatmate Michael Caine. “Terry meets Julie, Waterloo station, every Friday night,” Ray Davies sang on the Kinks’s Waterloo Sunset and while he wasn’t necessarily singing about Stamp and Julie Christie – at least not consciously – the actors and the song have now become intertwined, part of a collective cultural fabric, to the point where that mental image of the two of them by the Thames is almost as much a part of Stamp’s showreel as his actual 60s pictures.He was born in London’s East End, the son of a tugboat coalman who regarded acting with horror, and his rough-hewn swagger lent a crucial grit and danger to his refined matinee idol aesthetic. He gave a superb performance – full of seething chippy rage – in 1965’s The Collector, a role that won him the best actor prize at Cannes, made an excellent dastardly lover in Far from the Madding Crowd and whipped up a storm in Federico Fellini’s uproarious Toby Dammit. But he was always a more febrile movie actor than his compatriots – Caine, Sean Connery, Richard Harris, Peter O’Toole – and so his career proved more fragile and never truly bedded down.View image in fullscreenStamp (right) in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.Photograph: Polygram/Allstar“When the 60s ended, I almost did too,” he once said, ruefully acknowledging a decade-long slump that only came to an end when he was cast as General Zod in 1978’s Superman. In the subsequent years he played too many off-the-peg Brits – thuggish gangsters, evil businessmen – in subpar productions, although this only made his occasional great role feel all the more precious. Stamp was at his full-blooded best in Stephen Frears’s 80s crime drama The Hit, sparked briefly as the devil in The Company of Wolves and was fabulous as Bernadette in 1994’s Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.View image in fullscreenStamp in The Limey.Photograph: Artisan Entertainment/AllstarBut his great later role – and arguably the ultimate Stamp performance – was in The Limey, Steven Soderbergh’s 1999 revenge tale. Soderbergh cast him as Wilson, an ageing career criminal who haunts LA like a ghost. It’s a film that is implicitly about Stamp’s youth and age, beautifully folding the present-day drama in with scenes in Ken Loach’s Poor Cow to show what happened to the golden generation of swinging 60s London – and by implication, what happens to all of us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were ages 19, 27 and 35, police said.Attributing the information to friends, the New York Daily News identified one of those slain as 35-year-old Jamel Andre Childs. Childs was killed while trying to stop a fight that preceded the shooting, the Daily Newsreported.Of 11 victims, Tisch added, eight were men and three were women. Their known ages ranged from 27 to 61.The eight wounded victims – five men and three women – were taken to local hospitals with what police said were non-life threatening injuries.Tisch said there were at least four different shooters who fired dozens of rounds in the lounge, striking numerous bystanders. She also said officers had collected at least 42 shell casings inside the lounge that came from 9mm and .45-caliber guns.Officers had recovered one gun near the scene of the shooting, and they were trying to determine whether it was connected to the case, Tisch said. Investigators did not immediately name any suspects or announce arrests.Tisch made it a point to sayNew YorkCity had registered “the lowest number of shooting incidents and shooting victims seven months in the year … on record”.Nonetheless, “it’s a terrible thing that’s happened”, she said.“It’s a terrible shooting,” Tisch added. “There’s no other way to describe it.”“I can easily stand here and tell you that we have driven down crime, that we have removed over 2,000 illegal guns off our streets,” New York’s mayor, Eric Adams, saidat a briefing. “I can give you those numbers and those stats. But that does not comfort those who are victims of gun violence.”Taste of the City Lounge, located less than a half mile from the historicBrooklynMuseum serves American and Caribbean plates with a full bar, hookah and DJs.The business opened three years earlier and was the scene of another shooting in November 2024. That earlier case was non-fatal.The typically Jewish and West Indian area where the shooting occurred has been undergoing rapid gentrification in recent years.In 2017,a bar advertising its “bullet-ridden” wall caused outrage, with residents accusing the owner of insensitive stereotyping that overlooked the realities and toll of gang violence.As of Sunday, there had been more than 270 mass shootings in the US this year – or 1.18 a day, according to the nonpartisanGun Violence Archive. The online resource defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more victims are wounded or killed.The US’s perennially high rates of such shootings have prompted calls from some in the country for more substantialgun control. But Congress has largely been unable or unwilling to heed those calls.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkUS crimeBrooklynnewsShareReuse this content"

But by doubling or tripling in size, it could bring rip currents all along the south-east coast. Gusty winds and flooding tides could wash out parts of the highway that connects the North Carolina Outer Banks by midweek, the US’s National Weather Service (NWS) said.Bermuda could have similar conditions as Erin is forecast to turn to the north and then north-east, forecasters said.Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, reached category 5 status before weakening, with maximum sustained winds of 125mph (205kph) late on Sunday morning, according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami.The winds decreased as the storm went through internal changes. Erin is expected to remain powerful for the next several days, forecasters said.The storm’s center was about 170 miles (270km) north of San Juan,Puerto Rico, and nearly 270 miles (435km) east of the Grand Turk Island, moving west-northwest at 14mph (22 km/h).The rain and winds from Erin’s outer bands leftmore than 147,000 customers without power Sunday morning inPuerto Rico, a US territory, according to Luma Energy, a private company that oversees the transmission and distribution of power on the island. The weather canceled more than 20 flights, officials said.Swells were also expected to affect portions of theVirgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and the Turks and Caicos Islands during the next couple of days, the NHC reported.A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, and in this case, within 24 hours, the NHC said. Heavy rain is still expected across the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, with rainfall of 3-6in (about 7.6-15cm), with 8in in some isolated areas.The government of the Bahamas also issued a tropical storm watch for the south-east Bahamas.Scientists have linked the rapid intensification of hurricanes in the Atlantic to theclimate crisis, which is driven by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Global warming is causing the atmosphere to hold more water vapor and is spiking ocean temperatures, and warmer waters give hurricanes fuel to unleash more rain and strengthen more quickly.Explore more on these topicsHurricanesPuerto RicoVirgin IslandsCaribbeanUS weathernewsShareReuse this content"

But the “extreme hydraulics” of the waterfalls pushed Wardwell off his rappelling lines and trapped him behind a cascade of the Kern river, according to the sheriff’s office.His failure to return to his car that night prompted local law enforcement to spend 11 August searching for him with infrared technology and aircraft. Difficult terrain and fading daylight thwarted their efforts that day. But rescuers found Wardwell the next day after flying a drone behind the cascade in question.Wardwell was alive and conscious when rescuers spotted him, and he told them how he had become stranded there, the Tulare county sheriff’s office said. ACaliforniahighway patrol helicopter crew then managed to hoist him to safety to cap off what the sheriff’s office declared a “stunning survival story”.One dead and two missing after six people swept down waterfall in OregonRead moreWardwell received treatment for dehydration and “only minor injuries”, and he was reunited with family who had gone to the scene, the sheriff’s office said.The agency published video of Wardwell’s rescue on Facebook, where it captured attention from news media outlets that reported on the situation. The clip showed the helicopter whipping around foliage and water around the cascade before the crew lifted Wardwell onboard.An attraction for hiking and outdoors adventure enthusiasts, the Seven Teacups are in a secluded area about two hours south of the Sequoia national park, which itself is east of Visalia, California.Wardwell had rappelled the falls several times before,the San Francisco Chroniclereported. On his 10 August trip there, friends had accompanied him, though they opted to stop going further after seeing the rushing water’s power, Mike Crane, a California highway patrol flight officer paramedic, told the Chronicle.According to the outlet, Wardwell’s friends left a note on his car telling passersby to report him missing if the vehicle was still there the next day, which it was.Wardwell ended up nestling himself in a dark cave beneath the waterfall – completely soaked – after being thrusted off his rappel lines, the Chronicle added.Tulare county sheriff’s office captain, Kevin Kemmerling, told the Chronicle that Wardwell fought to escape for two days, “but there was nothing he could do to break through”.“There was no way for him to warm up or dry out in there, so it had to have been miserable,” Kemmerling said to the newspaper.Crane, speaking to the Chronicle, added: “I got the impression that maybe he didn’t know if he was ever going to get out of there.”The Tulare sheriff’s office said in its statement that it reminded members of the public “to always be aware of their environment and capabilities, especially when navigating white water rivers” like the one at the Seven Teacups.“Stay safe, stay smart and stay alive,” the statement from the sheriff’s office said.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

That day, Trump said Apple would be among the companies that would be exempt from a new US tariff on imported computer chips.The Art of the Deal looms large in the White House, where Trump is brokering agreements with powerful tech companies – in the midst of his trade war – that are reminiscent of the real estate transactions that launched him into fame.But in recent days, this dealmaking has entered uncharted waters.Two days after Cook and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang had a closed-door meeting with Trump at the White House. The president laterannouncedNvidia, along with its rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), will be allowed to sell certain artificial intelligence chips to Chinese companies – so long as they share 15% of their revenue with the US government.It was a dramatic about-face from Trump, who initially blocked the chips’ exports in April. And itswiftly prompted suggestionsthat Nvidia was buying its way out of simmering tensions between Washington and Beijing.Trade experts say such a deal, where a company essentially pays the US government to export a good, could destabilize trading relations. Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that it creates “the perception that export controls are up for sale”.“If you create the perception that licenses, which are supposed to be determined on pure national security grounds, are up for sale, you potentially open up room for there to be this wave of lobbying for all sorts of really, dangerous, sensitive technologies,” Chorzempa said. “I think that’s a very dangerous precedent to set.”Though the White House announced the deal, it technically hasn’t been rolled out yet, likely because of legal complications. The White House is calling the deal a “revenue-sharing” agreement, but critics point out that it could also be considered a tax on exports, which may not be legal under US laws or the constitution.The “legality” of the deal was “still being ironed out by the Department of Commerce”, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters this week.Nvidia and AMD’s AI chips are at the heart of the technological arms race between the US and China. Nvidia, which became the first publicly traded company to reach a $4tnvaluationlast month, creates the essential processing chips that are used to run and develop AI.The US government has played a role in this arms race over the last several years, setting regulations on what AI chips and manufacturing equipment can be sent to China. If China has less computing power, the country will be slower to develop AI, giving a clear advantage to the US.But despite the restrictions, China has been catching up, raising questions on how US policy should move forward.“They haven’t held them back as far as the advocates had hoped. The US has an enormous computing advantage over China, but their best models are only a few months behind our best models,” Chorzempa said. For US policymakers, “the question they’ve had to grapple with is: Where do you draw the line?”The AI chips Nvidia and AMD can now sell to China aren’t considered high-end. While they can be used for inference on trained models, they aren’t powerful enough to train new AI models. When announcing the deal with Nvidia and AMD, Trumpsaidthe chip is “an old chip that China already possesses … under a different label”.This is where a major debate on AI policy comes in. Those who take a hardline stance on the US’s relationship with China say that allowing Chinese companies to purchase even an “old chip” could still help the country get an advantage over the US. Others would say a restriction on such chips wouldn’t be meaningful, and could even be counterproductive.To balance these two sides, theTrump administrationis asking companies to pay up in order to export to China – a solution that people on both sides of the AI debate say is a precarious one.“Export controls are a frontline defense in protecting our national security, and we should not set a precedent that incentivizes the government to grant licenses to sell China technology that will enhance AI capabilities,” said John Moolenaar, a Republican US representative from Michigan, in astatement.But Trump’s gut-reaction to dealmaking seems focused on the wallet. On Wednesday, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent praised the arrangement and suggested it could be extended to other industries over time. “I think that right now this is unique, but now that we have the model and the beta test, why not expand it?” he told Bloomberg.Julia Powles, executive director of the Institute for Technology, Law and Policy at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the deal opens up questions of whether similar pressure can be applied to other tech companies.“What other quid pro quo might be asked in the future? The quid pro quo that would be of great concern to the [tech] sector is anything that reduces their reputation for privacy and security,” Powles said. “That’s thinking of government like a transactional operator, not like an institution with rules about when, how and for what it can extract taxes, levies and subsidies.”But that seems to be how the White House runs now. When explaining to the press how he made the deal, Trump said he told Huang: “I want 20% if I’m going to approve this for you”.“For the country, for our country. I don’t want it myself,” the president added. “And he said, ‘Would you make it 15?’ So we negotiated a little deal.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationTrump tariffsArtificial intelligence (AI)TariffsTim CookNvidiaAppleanalysisShareReuse this content"

On Thursday, local officialscleared awayone of the roadside encampments Trump had complained about, arguing that they could do so in a more humane fashion than untrained federal forces.A justice department order to replace the Washington police chief, Pamela Smith, with DEA head Terry Cole as the city’s “emergency police commissioner” ran into problems after a challenge in federal court by the DC attorney general, Brian Schwalb.Without issuing a direct ruling on the challenge, US district judge Ana Reyes indicated that Smith has to remain in charge.But efforts to increase federal control of the district resumed on Saturday with the order to deploy West Virginia’s national guard.Drew Galang, a spokesperson for Morrisey, said the state’s national guard received the order to send equipment and personnel to DC late on Friday and was working to organize the deployment.A White House official told Reuters on Saturday that more national guard troops were being called in to Washington to “protect federal assets, create a safe environment for law enforcement officials to carry out their duties when required, and provide a visible presence to deter crime”.View image in fullscreenProtester holds a piece of bread as he walks past national guard, in reference to an incident where a man threw a sandwich at a federal agent on Saturday in Washington, DC.Photograph: Alex Kent/Getty ImagesA protest against Trump’s intervention drew scores to Dupont Circle on Saturday before a march to the White House, about 1.5 miles away. Demonstrators assembled behind a banner that said, “No fascist takeover of DC”, and some in the crowd held signs saying, “No military occupation”.Fueling the protests were concerns about Trump overreach and that he had used crime as a pretext to impose his will on Washington.The Chamberlain Network, a veteran’s group that describes itself as “dedicated to protecting democracy”,commented on Xthat the order for West Virginia’s national guard to police DC was “pulling them away from their core mission of protecting our communities”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

On Wednesday, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent praised the arrangement and suggested it could be extended to other industries over time. “I think that right now this is unique, but now that we have the model and the beta test, why not expand it?” he told Bloomberg.Julia Powles, executive director of the Institute for Technology, Law and Policy at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the deal opens up questions of whether similar pressure can be applied to other tech companies.“What other quid pro quo might be asked in the future? The quid pro quo that would be of great concern to the [tech] sector is anything that reduces their reputation for privacy and security,” Powles said. “That’s thinking of government like a transactional operator, not like an institution with rules about when, how and for what it can extract taxes, levies and subsidies.”But that seems to be how the White House runs now. When explaining to the press how he made the deal, Trump said he told Huang: “I want 20% if I’m going to approve this for you”.“For the country, for our country. I don’t want it myself,” the president added. “And he said, ‘Would you make it 15?’ So we negotiated a little deal.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationTrump tariffsArtificial intelligence (AI)TariffsTim CookNvidiaAppleanalysisShareReuse this content"

The sun may have been shining and the temperature in the mid‑20s. There may have been new kits on the pitch and new flags in the stands. There may have been an obsessive focus on the new signings. There may, among home fans, perhaps especially those refreshed in the new marquee behind the Stretford End, have been a giddy expectation that this season couldn’t be as bad as last for Manchester United. But the roots of a game run deep, stretching back into the mulch of the past. This was a game shaped by events last December.Calafiori strikes after goalkeeper’s error as Arsenal grind to win at Manchester UnitedRead moreArsenal are good at set pieces; United are vulnerable to inswinging deliveries. In December last yearArsenalbeat United 2-0 at the Emirates Stadium, both goals the result of corners. United had André Onana in goal for that one, but Tottenham had taken notice of the susceptibility to balls arced into the goalmouth, the way United struggled to protect their keeper.Two weeks later,Spurs played Unitedin the Carabao Cup. Altay Bayindir was in goal for that one and endured the indignity of being beaten direct from a corner by Son Heung-min.United don’t like inswingers and Bayindir really doesn’t like inswingers. Declan Rice is good at taking inswingers. And so there was a certain inevitability to what happened after 13 minutes. United had looked vaguely threatening. Arsenal had been rattled enough to commit four fouls in that period. Then Arsenal won a corner from their left.Rice whipped it in, Bayindir flapped and would have scored an own-goal had Riccardo Calafiori not nodded the ball over the line from the goal-line.View image in fullscreenAltay Bayindir makes a vain attempt to punch Declan Rice’s corner clear.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty ImagesUnited, perhaps, could point to the way William Saliba, having grappled with Mason Mount, bumped into him just as the ball arrived, and perhaps, given thenew directives to refereesto crack down on holding, a foul could have been given. But then there were half a dozen incidents that could have been penalised one way or the other in the box from that one corner; any refereeing decision in such circumstances could not but feel arbitrary.Fundamentally, with more decisive goalkeeping there wouldn’t have been an issue. David Raya’s assertive punch to clear an inswinging free-kick from Bruno Fernandes early in the second half, cuffing Matthijs de Ligt out of the way, showed the way to do it.Maybe the analogy was never entirely apt. Maybe building from the foundations up doesn’t necessarily mean getting the defence right.Maybe as football increasingly becomes about content production there is some sort of commercial logic in prioritising the goalscorers and the creators, the players who will look good clipped up or, to continue the metaphor, the spire, the ornamentation on the roof. But on the other hand, it doesn’t much matter if you’ve spent £200m on forwards if you’re going to concede goals like that. Particularly if you don’t then actually score yourself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

United, perhaps, would consider themselves unfortunate. Patrick Dorgu hit the post and Raya had to make seven saves, more than any other goalkeeper on the opening weekend. But only his reflex stop down to his left to keep out a Cunha effort from a narrow angle was a save that he would not necessarily be expected to make.To point out that Uniteddrew this fixturelast season and that they’re therefore doing worse this season is on one level meaningless.But equally this is a manager whose win percentage is 37.2%, the worst in half a century – and if United fail to win at Fulham next week, he will drop below both Frank O’Farrell and Wilf McGuinness to have the worst win percentage of any United manager since Herbert Bamlett, who was sacked in 1931. Context matters.There was plenty of mitigation on Sunday afternoon. The closer you zoom in the more excuses can be found: a goalkeeping error, new players settling in, a couple of close-run things. But it won’t take many more bad results for faith in Amorim to wane. When form has been so bad, it’s only natural to catastrophise: if they don’t win at Craven Cottage, the next home match, against newly-promoted Burnley, takes on a ghastly aspect: not merely a game they should win, but a game they have to win.This season is not discrete from the last. New signings, a resetting of the table, new hope, cannot erase the footfalls that echo in the memory. Poor results are a problem not only in themselves but for the impact they have on games to come: time present and time past are both perhaps present in time future.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedArsenalanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Pole had her hands full in the early stages of the 98-minute match but took advantage of a sudden dip in Rybakina’s form to win four consecutive games and wrap up the first set before easing through the second.‘I am tough’ – Emma Raducanu on legacy of US Open win, stalking ordeal and why therapy won’t help herRead more“That was a tough match,” Swiatek said. “At the beginning the level was pretty crazy. We played so fast that sometimes we couldn’t even run to the second ball. But I was there to play with intensity and good quality and I am super happy with the performance. I served much better, so for sure it helped and I wouldn’t change anything.”In the final, Swiatek will play the Italian seventh seed, Jasmine Paolini, who beat Russia’s Veronika Kudermetova 6-3, 6-7 (2), 6-3. Paolini served for the match in the second set only to see her advantage slip away, but she eventually completed the job, with Kudermetova’s tally of 75 unforced errors costing her.In the first semi-final, Rybakina, the ninth seed, used a cross-court forehand that caught the line for a break and then held for a 5-3 lead in the first set but a focused Swiatek came back from the precipice and attacked the Kazakh’s serve to draw level at 5-5. From there, the Wimbledon champion held serve before wrapping up the opening set when she broke for a second time after a Rybakina backhand attempt came up well short.Rybakina, who enjoyed a swift victory against the world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka, in the previous round, was broken for a third time early in the second set after a backhand error put Swiatek ahead 3-1. Swiatek faced some resistance from Rybakina three games later but dug deep to recover from 15-40 down to protect her serve and reach 5-2 before wrapping it up on serve when Rybakina sent a forehand return long.View image in fullscreenJasmine Paolini overcame the disappointment of losing the second set on a tie-break to beat Veronika Kudermetova in her semi-final.Photograph: Daniel Kopatsch/Getty ImagesSwiatek, who has not lost a set in Cincinnati, will be seeking her second title in her past three tournaments.She won Wimbledon when she swept aside Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0in the final and then lost against Clara Tauson of Denmark in the fourth round in Toronto.Swiatek will be a heavy favourite in the final on Monday as she looks to go to the US Open with another title under her belt. She is 5-0 in matches against Paolini, including in last year’s French Open final.“Anyone who is going to be in the final will be super tough,” Swiatek said. “I will just focus on myself and try to continue the work that I’m been doing.

Real Madrid are understood to have raised the issue of moving to a two-year cycle during talks with Fifa in Miami in June, a proposal that has gained support from other clubs who failed to qualify for this year’s tournament, including Barcelona, Manchester United, Liverpool and Napoli.Could latest seismic legal challenge leave Fifa wobbling on its perch?Read moreChelsea received £85m in prize money forwinning the competitionand other big European clubs want the opportunity to take advantage of Fifa’s huge revenue streams, which are being funded largely by Saudi Arabia’s Surj Sports Investments.Liverpool in particular were unfortunate not to take part this year, as they met one of the qualifying criteria by being among the top eight ranked clubs in Europe, but missed out asFifaopted to admit a maximum of two sides from a country. Chelsea and Manchester City took the English slots as recent Champions League winners. There is an exception to the limit if more than two clubs from a country win their continental competition during the qualifying period, as was the case with Brazil this year.Fifa sources said that while there is no serious consideration being given to staging the Club World Cup in 2027, the situation is likely to change after 2029, with the prospect of another tournament being held in 2031 to be explored.Fifa’s hands are tied in the short-term as the international match calendar is fixed until 2030, with only the 2029 Club World Cup in the schedule, as part of a memorandum of understanding signed between Fifa and the European Clubs Association two years ago.With Fifa already facing legal action from World Leagues, an international lobby group that includes the Premier League, there is no appetite to inflame it further by ripping up the current schedule. World Leagues has filed a legal complaint to the European Commission with support from the global players’ union Fifpro, accusing Fifa of “abuse of dominance” for allegedly failing to consult them over the scheduling of the Club World Cup.Staging the new competition every two years would increase tensions still further, but there is an acknowledgement on both sides that the entire global calendar after 2030 is open for negotiation.View image in fullscreenAleksander Ceferin (right), the president of Uefa, would likely take issue with Fifa’s Gianni Infantino making the Club World Cup biennial.Photograph: Gualter Fatia/UEFA/Getty ImagesAs part of a quid pro quo for moving into the club game, sources have indicated that Fifa may be willing to remove the June international break to ease player workloads and create space for events such as the Club World Cup, although that would be opposed byUefa, which uses summer dates to stage the finals of its Nations League competition.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIn a pre-season address last week the Premier League chief executive, Richard Masters, outlined his concerns with expanding the Club World Cup, although the biggest top-flight clubs appear to disagree. “Fifa was put on earth really to regulate the global game and to run international football, and the Club World Cup is a move into club football,” Masters said. “The leagues and the players have not been consulted at all on the timing and scheduling of the competition, and I think whatever iteration of it may come next, we do need to be consulted on that.“Obviously, it does have an impact on the scheduling of the Premier League season, that much is clear. We’re asking for a seat at the table, a proper discussion for the leagues.”Fifa is the process of reviewing the qualifying criteria for the 2029 Club World Cup and may lift the cap of two clubs per country, and as previously reported by the Guardian it is consulting on whether to increase the number of teams involved from 32 to 48. The men’s World Cup next year and the 2031 Women’s World Cup will involve 48 teams for the first time, so expanding the Club World Cup would be consistent with Fifa’s tournament model.Having awarded hosting rights to this year’s competition to the US without inviting tenders, Fifa is planning to run formal bidding process for future tournaments. Qatar, Spain and Morocco have all expressed interest in staging the 2029 Club World Cup, with details of the tender process expected later this year.Explore more on these topicsClub World CupFifaUefaPremier LeagueFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This is my response to him |  Austin KillipsRead moreShe was removed from the team on 6 February, the day the NCAA, US college sports’ largest governing body,issued its new policy on transgender athletes.Swarthmore men’s and women’s track coach Peter Carroll, athletic director Brad Koch and athletics officials Christina Epps-Chiazor and Valerie Gomez also were named in the lawsuit. According to the complaint, they sent Parts into “such a depressive state that she engaged in self-harm and in one moment told a friend that she wanted to kill herself.”Susie Cirilli, an attorney who represents Parts, added: “We stand by the allegations in the complaint. As stated in the complaint, the NCAA is a private organization that issued a bigoted policy. Swarthmore College chose to follow that policy and disregard federal and state law.”Swarthmore issued a statement that it “deeply values our transgender community members.”“We recognize that this is an especially difficult and painful time for members of the transgender community, including student-athletes,” the school said. “We worked to support Evie Parts in a time of rapidly evolving guidance, while balancing the ability for other members of the women’s track team to compete in NCAA events. Given the pending litigation, we will not comment any further.”The NCAA chose not to comment.The NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes to limit competition in women’s sports to athletes assigned female at birth. That change came a day after Donald Trump signed an executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s sports.Pennsylvania’s state Senate approved a bill by a 32-18 margin on 6 May to ban transgender athletes from competing in women’s and girls’ sports at the collegiate and K-12 levels. The state’s Democratic-controlled House of Representatives isn’t expected to vote on the bill.Parts joined the Swarthmore track team in fall 2020 before then taking off the following four winter and spring seasons. She went back to the team in 2023 to compete in the indoor and outdoor track seasons and in cross country.When the NCAA issued its ban, the lawsuit states, Parts was told by Epps-Chiazor and Gomez that she could compete with the men’s team or as an unattached athlete. She would only receive medical treatment, the complaint says, if she competed on the men’s team.According to the lawsuit, Carroll and his staff were not allowed to coach Parts, she could not travel with the team, was not allowed to receive per diem or food and had to pay her way into meets. Parts also couldn’t wear a Swarthmore uniform.Swarthmore “fully reinstated” Parts on 11 April, the lawsuit says, and she competed on the women’s team until graduating in May.In July, a transgender woman sued Princeton University claiming she was illegally removed shortly before her race in a school-hosted track meet in May due to her gender identity. Sadie Schreiner, who had transitioned during high school, had previously run for Division III Rochester Institute of Technology but was set to compete as an athlete unattached to any school or club in the Larry Ellis Invitational. That complaint seeks unspecified damages for a “humiliating, dehumanizing and dignity-stripping ordeal” in front of family and friends.Explore more on these topicsNCAACollege sportsTransgenderUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

United complained that Bayindir had been impeded – William Saliba appeared to block him – to which Amorim pointed after the defeat.“If you watch the ball, [the opponent] is allowed to do a lot of things at the corners,” Amorim said. “We need to do the same. But when you touch that way [block], the goalkeeper needs to [be able to] use his hands to catch the ball, not push players [out of the way]. He chooses to push players and let the ball pass. But again, it’s the rules. If it’s allowed, we need to do the same thing.”Amorim was defiant when asked if he considered starting Tom Heaton ahead of Bayindir after the latter’s similar error allowed a Son Heung‑min corner to go straight in during the4-3 Carabao Cup defeat at Tottenhamlast season. Amorim referred to Bayindir’s next display, in the FA Cup third-round5-3 penalty shootout winagainst Arsenal in January.“Why? Without VAR [in the competition],” the 40-year-old head coach said. “With VAR, it’s a foul. And then what happened in the next game?Arsenal. Who saved the penalty?

Amorim said: “No, I didn’t drop Onana from the squad. I didn’t drop one of the other two from the squad [Bayindir, Heaton]. So it’s not the case of dropping Onana. It’s not putting André Onana in just one week without seeing the game, without time, with training.”Amorim was asked if he is content with Onana, Bayindir and Heaton. “We proved today that we can win any game in the Premier League, especially against a great team like Arsenal, and we were the better team. I’m happy with the three goalkeepers.”After United signed the No 9 Benjamin Sesko for £73.7m, Amorim excluded Rasmus Højlund, another centre-forward, from the matchday squad.

We need to work on the things we need to improve. We need to defend set pieces.“We did a lot of things right. There are a lot of things without seeing the video that we need to work on. I am really proud of my players. We stuck to the plan even when the stadium was nervous, we continued to play the way we played and that will help us in the future.”Mikel Arteta was delighted with the victory. “Big, big result,” the Arsenal manager said. “When you feel that they [United] are building something special [and] want to [start] the season in a good way and you are able to come away with a win, I think I’m very happy for our team.”Arteta was asked about the debut of his new No 9, Viktor Gyökeres. “He did a lot of things very well. Coming away from Manchester United, you win your first game with Arsenal, it’s a good start,” the Spaniard said.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedArsenalRuben AmorimMikel ArtetanewsShareReuse this content"

It was an eye-opening lesson for the new head coach, as Nuno Espírito Santo and his players showed they are ready to build on last season’s success story.Chris Wood scored twice and Dan Ndoye netted on his debut to finish the match as a contest before 45 minutes had elapsed.Brentfordcould not cope with the hosts, who dictated the game from the start, while the visitors offered little indication of what style they plan to play under Andrews, who could take no enjoyment from Igor Thiago’s late penalty.Match of the Day’s new era: reassuring dad jokes and a lot of Wayne Rooney | Paul MacInnesRead more“We will learn a lot from that 45 minutes, especially me,” Andrews said. “[It was] very disappointing in terms of your preparation, how you envisage it, looking from a tactical perspective, not too different really. I felt, I’ve kind of stressed this most of the week, I felt it would be a game of structure that was needed to be very respectful of what Forest have, how they play the game. Basics is a word in football and sport that is seen sometimes as a dirty word. I’m big on it – unless you do the basics, you don’t give yourself an opportunity to play the game that you want to play.”Nuno complained in the buildup about the lack of summer transfer activity. He has since been appeased by the arrivals of Omari Hutchinson and James McAtee, who were paraded in front of the supporters before kick-off.Forest scored once in seven pre‑season matches, producing five goalless draws. Those statistics were rendered irrelevant within five minutes when Wood reacted quickest to a bouncing ball in the box from a corner, after Brentford failed to clear, to direct it home. Nuno looks poised to get a new striker in the coming days in the form of, Arnaud Kalimuendo from Rennes but the New Zealander Wood offered a reminder that his 20Premier Leaguegoals last season were not a fluke.View image in fullscreenThe Swiss winger Dan Ndoye scores on debut to put Nottingham Forest 2-0 up.Photograph: Darren Staples/AFP/Getty ImagesWhat Andrews would have done for the talismanic forwards of 2024-25 but Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo were not available. The latter is at Manchester United and the former has at leastone foot out of the door. It was a less than ideal situation for his first game in senior management and his team sat too deep, ceding control to Forest. Considering Andrews’ previous role as set-piece coach, the manner in which the goal was conceded will have greatly irritated him.Nuno wants his team to dominate possession more often and Brentford were willing to allow Forest to settle into this new style. Morgan Gibbs‑White was given space in which to receive the ball, further emphasising why Forest did everything in their power to stop him departing for Tottenham. Gibbs-White drifted into the areas he felt he could do most damage, picking up the ball and finding a forward pass to keep Brentford on the back foot.Andrews was constantly tested by Nuno, to see how quickly he could adapt his team. Forest’s wingers swapped positions, Gibbs‑White moved out wide and Ndoye spent time playing as a second central striker. If Andrews was under pressure before the start, Nuno was putting his tactical acumen in a vice.Forest had their own new era with Ndoye giving their fans more than a glimpse of what to expect after a summer move from Bologna. The Swiss attacker showed trickery on the wing but provided more than anticipated with a smart run to meet a Gibbs‑White cross into the box and head beyond Caoimhín Kelleher.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The striker was not tracked and calmly rounded the goalkeeper before tapping into the empty net and wheeling away in front of an ecstatic home crowd.“I just want to go home and celebrate, because it’s a beautiful start,” said Nuno, who wants the club to be busy in the market this week. “I’m delighted. I think the way we started the game was amazing. We dominated, controlled, [and had] good combinations.”Knowing the game was done, despite Thiago’s calm penalty after Ibrahim Sangaré handballed, the tempo in the second half dropped, giving Andrews some time to ponder what he will need to change.Jordan Henderson was given a debut off the bench and his experience will be vital because it is apparent that Andrews is learning on the job, while Nuno’s methods once again look assured. Life will become more difficult once the Europa League starts but Forest do not give the impression of being worried.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNottingham ForestBrentfordmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Six minutes from time, Milla scored a spectacular winner, meeting a cross with a diving header that arched over Oblak and nestled inside the far post to complete the turnaround.Athletic Bilbao’s Robert Navarro snatched a 3-2 victory overSevillaafter his side had squandered a two-goal lead.

Nantes then began to concede more space and PSG thought they had doubled their lead minutes later through Gonçalo Ramos but the striker’s effort was ruled out for offside.Paris FC’s first top-flight game in 46 years ended in a 1-0 defeat atAngers, who took an early lead through Esteban Lepaul and held on despite being reduced to 10 men.

An announcement on the stadium PA was made condemning racist abuse. After the match resumed, the winger was booed repeatedly by the home fans.Speaking after the match, Antwi-Adjei said: “I don’t want to name the words that were spoken. I’m not the type of person who goes home and cries, but I find it disappointing you still hear this on the pitch these days. I signalled to the linesman that something had happened. It’s the least I could do. I’m a normal person. This is not appropriate.”Antwi-Adjei was born in Germany but has represented Ghana three times at international level.

This was a flat start to a possible title challenge from thenew world champions, who were unable to lift themselves after being dragged back down to earth during this feisty London derby, and it could have been worse given that Crystal Palace’s diminishing faith in authority was not exactly helped by Eberechi Eze having the only goal of the game ruled out by a pedantic VAR intervention.It would have been some way for Eze to sign off for Palace, assuming that hiswidely anticipated move to Tottenhamgoes through this week. The playmaker appeared to have given Oliver Glasner’s excellent side the lead when he blasted an early free-kick past Robert Sánchez, although Palace’s mistake was forgetting that nothing is ever truly certain in modern football. They have already had one prize snatched away this summer – Uefa demoting them to the Conference League over a failure to comply with multi-club ownership rules – and endured more frustration when Darren England, the on-pitch referee, was sent to the pitchside monitor and penalised Marc Guéhi for straying within a metre of the Chelsea wall as he grappled with Moisés Caicedo.Chris Wood allays attacking concerns as Nottingham Forest overwhelm BrentfordRead moreA correct application of the law? Probably, but it still felt like too much interference. Glasner was right to point out that such offences rarely draw censure. “Everyone in the stadium thought it was a goal,” the Palace defender Chris Richards said. “But you live and die by VAR and today we died from it.”Yet Palace keep battling. They still risk losing Guéhi and Eze, whose participation in this game had been in doubt when talks over a move to Spurs progressed on Saturday, but nobody will relish playing them at the moment. There is some serious talent at Glasner’s disposal – Adam Wharton offered elegance in midfield, while Daniel Muñoz and Tyrick Mitchell negated Chelsea’s wingers – and after following up theirvictory against Manchester Cityin the FA Cup final last season bybeating Liverpoolin the Community Shield, this was further proof of their discipline, skill and tactical excellence.It gave context to Chelsea’s stumble. They might be playing catchup already but it is too early to talk of dropped points. Palace will probably threaten to inconvenience Chelsea’s rivals further down the line.Enzo Maresca was relaxed afterwards, saying he saw no signs of lethargy. Equally, though, concerns over whether Chelsea will pay a price in terms of physicality after earning all that prize money during their triumphant, extended summer have not disappeared .They had a crunched pre-season after going all the way in the Club World Cup and, for all the celebrations before kick‑off, it was fair to wonder if Chelsea would be ready to go only 35 days after taking Paris Saint-Germain apart in New Jersey.Those misgivings about Chelsea’s rustiness became evident during an opening in which their passes went astray and their attackers struggled to find space. There was an early booking for Reece James, Caicedo was guilty of some uncharacteristic loose touches and Maresca will not take much pleasure from seeing his argument for his superiors to react to Levi Colwill’s long-term knee injury by signing a new centre-back grow stronger.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze applauds the Crystal Palace fans at the final whistle in what could be his last game for the club.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersColwill, so crucial to the team’s buildup play from the back, was missed. Tosin Adarabioyo’s absence with a minor issue was another complication, although Maresca was pleased with how Josh Acheampong performed as the central centre‑back in possession. There was one errant pass from the 19‑year‑old, sparking the sequence that led to Eze’s disallowed free‑kick, but he grew more assured as the game progressed.Chelsea improved in the second half. Estêvão Willian offered excitement after replacing Jamie Gittens, who had a disappointing debut on the left flank, and almost snatched the winning goal. Andrey Santos, who replaced a tiring Enzo Fernández during the closing stages, was wasteful with a decent opportunity. Yet Cole Palmer was quiet and João Pedro was crowded out by Palace’s imposing back three before making away for Liam Delap.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Palace’s manager looked to the future, insisting that Eze will start in his side’s Conference League playoff against Fredrikstad on Thursday.Chelsea will continue to evolve. They created little and remain likely to strengthen their attack with Alejandro Garnacho and Xavi Simons.

The 29-year-old started only seven league games for City last season and was left out of their 27-man squad for the Club World Cup this summer. He was also omitted from the England squad last summer for the European Championship after losing his place following City’s 2023 treble-winning campaign.Premier League 2025-26 preview No 9: EvertonRead moreMoyes “tried to get as much information as I could” on Grealish’s problems at City, although he has not spoken to Guardiola about what occurred, but says the player’s hunger to recapture the form that made himBritain’s first £100m footballerbanished any doubts over the loan.“The knowledge that he thinks he’s got a little bit to prove and to stand up,” the Everton manager said on what convinced him to sign the England player. “I’ve had to do that myself. I’ve had to come back from being knocked down. Sometimes you have to have that resilience to bounce back, to fight back and to show everybody. I just sense Jack is carrying that with him now. I hope it shows through this season because, if it does, then we’ll get a lot of good things from Jack.”Grealish was Everton’s sixth summer signing – a seventh soon followed in the goalkeeper Tom King – but the squad remains light in several departments with various transfer targets missed. Moyes believes the legacy of recent relegation scraps and no European football has deterred some players but, with Grealish on board, Everton have stated their ambitions clearly.“It is a big thing for me,” Moyes said. “The club have done brilliantly to build a new stadium. I think now there has to be a building of a football club back inside it, to get it back to where it was and more importantly to get the team back to where it was. We are a long way off at the moment. I don’t think we can do that in this window and make the team what we want it to be, but we are going to need people along the journey to make it more exciting and make people want to come and play.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Moments later Palmer rushed out of his goal towards the halfway line and the ball was almost intercepted by Armstrong but O’Shea closed down the striker’s attempt at goal.The hosts almost took the lead in the 47th minute when Hirst released Szmodics towards the Southampton goal but his shot struck the right-hand post and rebounded into Bazunu’s arms. At the other end, Robinson had a shot charged down and Jaden Philogene went close with a scissor kick.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

McBurnie, who joined the club as a free agent two weeks ago, stabbed home Ryan Giles' cross three minutes into added time to put the seal on a chaotic  game.Jakirovic, who replaced Rubén Sellés in the summer, might have been forgiven for thinking the league was a cakewalk when Joe Gelhardt opened the scoring after two minutes. But Oxford, as has become standard under Gary Rowett, rarely buckle under pressure and equalised seven minutes later through the Spurs loan signing Will Lankshear.Matt Crooks restored Hull's advantage after 20 minutes before Cameron Brannagan equalised six minutes later during a relentless contest that was capped by McBurnie's late intervention.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In a frantic start to the second period Szmodics’s blistering run upfield nearly resulted in a strike at goal but he failed to outrun Welington, whose solid tackle sent the ball back to his keeper. Shortly afterwards, Palmer had to get down to deflect a shot from Robinson and Szmodics collided with Bazunu in the Southampton penalty area, with the referee awarding a free-kick to the visitors.Conor Chaplin, on as a substitute, shot narrowly wide in the final minutes and his header went just over the crossbar but neither side was able to find a winnerExplore more on these topicsChampionshipIpswich TownSouthamptonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It’s my dream. When I’m playing with the kind of players that I’m playing with, it brings out the best of me. So I’m so happy.”Manchester City squad too big and ‘not healthy’, warns Pep GuardiolaRead moreLewis made 44 appearances in all competitions last season but fell behind Matheus Nunes – typically a midfielder – in the pecking order at right‑back. Lewis has since spoken to Guardiola about his future.“Everyone wants that assurance and security, but at the end of day it’s on me,” Lewis said. “It’s on me to perform.Last season I played more than the season before. So it’s always the same goal – to become an established player.”Guardiola signalled to Lewis that he remains a key part of his plans by preferring him to Nunes in the win at Molineux, in which Erling Haaland scored twice and Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki scored on their league debuts.Discussing the pain of last season and City’s ambition to win a fifth title in six years, Lewis said: “As much as we want to forget about last season, obviously it’s in the back of our minds and maybe we could say it’s fuelled the fire in us, but we’re so focused on this season. We feel so much stronger together as a team. There’s always hunger but I think there could be additional hunger now that it’s not our crown to defend.”Forest targeted Lewis as part of a double swoop of City academy talents with plans to sign the versatile defender and James McAtee but have only sealed a deal for the latter, for £30m. “I feel ready for a new challenge and the club had a great season last year, so I want to help build on that and show what I can do,” McAtee said after being unveiled.View image in fullscreenJames McAtee was unveiled as a Forest player after joining from Manchester City for £22m.Photograph: xForest are on a recruitment drive after their head coach, Nuno Espírito Santo, suggested that he was short of options before hosting Brentford on Sunday.

There could not have been a tighter finish, with China missing a go-ahead shot as time expired.It was a supreme team effort but leading the way for the Boomers was the unstoppable Xavier Cooks, who paved the way with 30 points on an efficient 13-of-17 shooting. He also collected nine rebounds and constantly broke down China’s defence with his drives. He was named the game’s most valuable player.Boomers power into Asia Cup final with dominant win over IranRead moreJaylin Galloway, playing in his first Asia Cup final, also rose to the occasion, drilling six triples on his way to 23 points and five rebounds. He was later named the tournament’s MVP and nominated in the All Star Five along with fellow Boomer Jack McVeigh.William Hickey delivered when it mattered most, finishing with 15 points, seven rebounds, four assists and two blocks, including clutch plays down the stretch.For China, Hu Mingxuan carried the offensive load with 26 points and five three-pointers, while veteran big man Hu Jinqiu supplied a 20-point, 10-rebound double-double that kept his team in contention until the final seconds.China struck first with a strong opening frame behind Jinqiu’s inside scoring and Mingxuan’s timely shooting, building a 25-17 lead. That cushion stretched to 36-21 in the second quarter, before Cooks powered a furious Australian fightback trimming the deficit to just four at halftime.The third quarter saw momentum swing wildly. Galloway’s fastbreak slam capped a 9-0 surge that briefly put the Boomers ahead, only for China to hit back with big triples from Cheng Shuaipeng and Lei Meng.Galloway’s buzzer-beating corner three left Australia trailing by just three entering the final frame, setting the stage for a tense finish. Cooks and Galloway combined for clutch baskets, while Mingxuan answered with big shots of his own. Hickey’s backdoor finish, a key putback and Will Magnay’s huge block kept Australia in front by the slimmest of margins.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

MacIntyre’s big overnight advantage was whittled to a single stroke after he started Sunday with two bogeys and, despite a gallant effort, he could do nothing to quell the American’s momentum.Back within touching distance with two to play, MacIntyre watched as Scheffler nailed a remarkable chip from the rough to in effect confirm his victory on the penultimate hole. It was hard to take for MacIntyre, who had produced his own memorable moment on the final hole on Saturday when he sunk a 41ft putt to retain his significant advantage.Europe’s Ryder Cup class of 2025 shapes up with familiar feel for US showdown | Ewan MurrayRead moreSeeking the win that would have sealed his place in Europe’s Ryder Cup team, MacIntyre made a nightmare start on Sunday but Scheffler was also far from perfect, a missed putt restoring the Scot’s two-stroke lead after three holes. The American hauled level on the 5th after MacIntyre found a bunker on his approach shot, and Scheffler looked to be in irresistible form as he moved two clear on the 13th.A Scheffler bogey five on the 14th reduced his lead again but the 15th proved pivotal as the Oban man failed to capitalise on Scheffler finding a bunker with his approach shot. He missed a birdie putt, while the American nailed his.But MacIntyre hadn’t given up, and cut the lead to one shot again with two to play, with a birdie four at the 16th after finding the green in two with a 265-yard second shot. However, after Scheffler’s uproarious response on the 17th, MacIntyre failed to respond with more final hole magic and putted out for a three-over-par final round of 73, two shots off Scheffler’s 15-under-par total of 265.View image in fullscreenBob MacIntyre would have secured his Ryder Cup place if he had managed to hold on to his lead after starting the fourth round with a four-shot advantage.Photograph: Andy Lyons/Getty ImagesThe title was Scheffler’s 18th on the PGA Tour, and the fifth this year, the second season in a row he has managed that total, something done before only by Tiger Woods.A final round of 67 shunted Tommy Fleetwood up to a tie for fourth place behind American Maverick McNealy, but England’s Harry Hall, who started Sunday tied for fourth, fell back with a disappointing 70 to finish in sixth place.Rory McIlroy was hampered by back-to-back double bogeys on the 5th and 6th holes as he failed to make inroads on the chasing pack, matching Hall’s final round of 70 to finish down in a tie for 12th.Explore more on these topicsGolfScottie SchefflernewsShareReuse this content"

Scrapping safeguards and having no viable alternative plan in place to halt the floodgates of abuse that could open is an appalling dereliction of duty.“It’s time for Farage to tell women and girls across Britain how he would keep them safe online.”Labour is launching a linked series of online adverts against Farage, including onepublished on Sunday morningconnected to Rayner’s comments. “Nigel Farage wants to make it easier to share revenge porn online,” it says, alongside an image of Farage grinning.Accordingto the Sunday Times, another advert will highlight Farage’s comments about Tate, the influencer who, along with his brother, Tristan,faces chargesin the UK including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking. The two British Americans are also under investigation in Romania, facing a number of charges. They deny all charges in both countries.The Labour advert shows Farage with Andrew Tate and the headline: “Nigel Farage says Andrew Tate is an ‘important voice’ for men.” The comments come from aninterview Farage didon the Strike It Big podcast last year.Laila Cunningham, a former magistrate who has joined Reform,wrote a Telegraph articleon Saturday in which she called the Online Safety Act “censorship laws”, saying laws already existed to combat “revenge porn”.“It’s a cover for censorship, and an excuse to hand unelected regulators sweeping powers to silence views they don’t like, while doing nothing about the real crimes happening on our streets,” she wrote.Cunningham said ministers should instead focus on detaining asylum seekers rather than putting them in hotels, saying that for now women “are being put in harm’s way” as the asylum seekers could pose a risk to them.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageOnline abuseAngela RaynerReform UKLabourPornographyInternet safetynewsShareReuse this content"

Sheknows,they realised! This is because Eilish’s Oscar-winning track What Was I Made For? – a lachrymose Barbie cut lamenting adulthood’s entailing ennui – has become the default soundtrack for a new breed of cat video.You may recognise it: the song often plays over the top of these AI-generated fantasias featuring a cartoonishly fat cat or an equally buff feline with a suspiciously veiny human body. The cat cheats on her lover, falls pregnant or seeks revenge in a weirdly condensed soap opera. And like all soap operas, these videos are extremely addictive.Here’s one, for example. While working an honest job, Mr Whiskers – wearing a red flannelette shirt – accidentally cuts his paw off while endeavouring to saw some wood into shape. He is fired (in fact, the signs around his warehouse explicitly state that all workers “must have two arms to work”), his wife divorces him and he attempts to pick up the pieces of his hard-knock life in 30 neat seconds. It’s all going swimmingly until his scorned ex-wife tries to kill him with an axe a little while later, but all is well … she falls into a puddle and humiliates herself.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

They’re kind of people, too. Moggies with rugged, athletic human physiques who occasionally live in mansions, drive convertibles and work corporate jobs. And yet, some – despite their seemingly exquisite set of circumstances and comically immaculate bodies – find themselves routinely grief-stricken, sick or in danger, as uncanny pop covers accompany their downfall.They find themselves pushed off ships, snared in house fires, drug-addled, arrested and bullied. This begs the question: are these videos 30-second cautionary tales? About affluence, betrayal, scandal and forgiveness? Are they Shakespeare by way of Neighbours meets Euripides? Are they biblical parables for our time?What if Jesus was a vlogger? The AI Bible stories flooding social mediaRead moreEachvideois signposted by a lurid domestic catastrophe: a useless father accidentally propelling his kitten into a ceiling fan (a particularly gruesome one, I must add), a cheating wife paying no heed to her husband’s calls, a gaunt kitten who – after years of being teased – becomes suspiciously jacked. It’s the hero’s journey, only furrier.And they get dark … quickly. Inone disturbing video, a cat-lady is stuck in the antebellum South picking cotton before being lashed by a white cat in overalls. Each video is sickeningly gaudy, sometimes violent and always melodramatic. And even when other AI-generated animals feature, such as crazed eagles or depraved sharks, the cats maintain their human six-packs and two-legged swagger.Inanother, “Luigi Meowgione” watches in pain as his cat-grandmother collapses in the grocery store. Her health insurance is denied at the hospital, so he faces up to the “evil Corp Insurance” company, scales it from the outside and fills the building with Catnip gas. Now that the security guards are incapacitated with a terrible case of the munchies, Luigi Meowgione is able to hack the system – and, by the end of the video – he discretely enters the CEO’s office … presumably to seek revenge. We aren’t to know, as part two hasn’t yet been released.After all, the internet has always loved cats with human attributes. “I can haz cheezburger?” is a phrase probably nobody wants to hear again.Grumpy catwas funny because it was a cat who was grumpy.

It was a grimly apt postscript to a “peace summit” that allowed a pariah leader to posture on the world stage, but signally failed to achieve the outcome that its host claimed to desire.Mr Trump hadsuggestedthat he would be “unhappy” if a ceasefire were not agreed during discussions with Mr Putin. There would, hewarned, be “severe consequences” if his guest proved unwilling to end the war. Predictably, no ceasefire announcement was forthcoming, and the sanctions Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened, but never imposed, have been kicked into the long grass. Instead, the US president offered a crucial concession to Mr Putin, concurring that a cessation of hostilities should come only after a “comprehensive” peace agreement.This was a betrayal of hollow assurances given to Kyiv and European allies by Mr Trump before the summit, and a gift to the Kremlin. As Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,preparesto meet the US president in Washington on Monday, he consequently finds himself in a deeply invidious position.According toreports, Mr Putin’s core demand is that Ukraine surrenders all unoccupied territory in the Donbas region, in exchange for a supposedly permanent ceasefire. There are, of course, no good grounds to take the Russian president at his word. Hisreferencesin Alaska to the “root causes” of the war indicate that he remains determined to force Ukraine back into Moscow’s orbit, and restrict its capacity to act as an independent state.A “deal” on anything like those terms would amount to precisely the carve-up feared by Kyiv. Mr Zelenskyycannot, should not and will not acquiesce. But having retreated from his threats to make life tougher for Mr Putin, the US president is returning to his default bullying stance towards Mr Zelenskyy. Asked what advice he would offer the Ukrainian leader, Mr Trumpresponded: “Make a deal. Gotta make a deal.”The peremptory tone is worryingly reminiscent of February’s notorious Oval Office meeting, when Mr Zelenskyy wastold: “You don’t have the cards.” In vague terms, Mr Trump has alluded to a future US role in security guarantees following a deal. But as Ukraine fights for a viable future, he appears impatient to move on to doing lucrative future business with Moscow, andanglingfor a Nobel peace prize.Given that ominous backdrop, the presence of Sir Keir Starmer and other European leaders in Washington on Monday will represent a crucial counterweight. Mr Putin will attempt to force Ukraine’s negotiating hand by taking more territory in the east, where Russian forces have beenadvancingat the fastest rate for months. Europe must ensure that, as Kyiv battles for a just peace, Mr Zelenskyy does have enough cards to play. As well as displaying solidarity in the White House, that means upping the economic pressure and military support, and urging Mr Trump to do the same.Ukraine must remain in control of the future of its own territory, and the use of force must not be rewarded by the summary redrawing of borders. With enormous bravery and skill, and at immense cost,Ukrainehas resisted an illegal invasion for more than three years. There must be no sellout.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Yet in the run-up to Friday’s summit with Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, hisclaim that the Russian leaderheld him in high regard and was therefore serious about ending the war in Ukraine sounded naive. Putin doesn’t let sentimentality shape his political and military decisions. Nor has he disavowed his longstanding claim to four Ukrainian provinces: Donetsk and Luhansk, which together comprise Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, and Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in the south. Despite Russia’s overwhelming numerical advantage in troops and weaponry, Putin occupies only one province, Luhansk, almost entirely. Yet he persists.In the days before his meeting with Putin, Trump said the Russian economy “stinks” and that falling oil prices would cause Russia’s war to run aground. The war has certainly placed severe strains on Russia’s economy, includinghigh inflationandinterest rates,labour shortagesanda lack of investmentby private businesses. Earnings from oil sales, a key source of state income, have alsoshrunk by 18%this year due tofalling prices. There has even beentalk of a recession. But these pressures have not prompted Putin to reassess his war plans. He ignored Trump’s proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, which Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accepted right away. Likewise, he was unfazed by Trump’s threats to impose additional sanctions – with “severe consequences”, as he put it just before the summit – if Russia did not relent.Trump returned from Anchorage empty-handed for other reasons. Successful summits require painstaking advance work by leaders’ subordinates; this one was arranged in haste. Given the rush, it was unsurprising that the Anchorage talksended hours ahead of time. (The working lunch the two delegations were to have was cancelled.) During his post-summit press conference, Trump gamely praised Putin’s goodwill and said that they had agreed on “many points” during discussions that he described as “productive”. Yet he failed to identify a single point of agreement and, atypically, didn’t stay to answer reporters’ questions.Putin came out ahead in Anchorage. He didn’t agree to Trump’s pet proposal for a ceasefire. It was Trump who ended upaccepting Putin’s positionthat a ceasefire must be preceded by a comprehensive peace agreement that addresses the “root causes” of the war. Putin did show some flexibility byagreeing to freezethe frontline if Ukraine were to withdraw from Donetsk and Luhansk, and thus the entire Donbas, enabling Russia to acquire lands it has failed to conquer despite more than 40 months of fighting. Yet this offer could prove to be a trap. If Zelenskyy, who arrives in Washington for talks with Trump on Monday, refuses to do this, Putin may be able to look on as Trump tries to coerce the Ukrainian leader, forcing Europe to take sides. If Trump fails, Putin can paint Zelenskyy as the real obstacle to peace.1:55'There’s no deal until there’s a deal,' says Trump on Ukraine war after talks with Putin – videoTrump had declared that there would be no future talks if the summit failed – which it did, as he couldn’t obtain a ceasefire, his main objective – yet in Anchorage, he spoke of follow-up meetings. Putin concurred, mischievously suggesting Moscow as the venue, but without indicating that he was open to including Zelenskyy and European leaders. By agreeing to further negotiations and keeping Trump’s hopes for a peace deal alive, Putin may have ensured that the efficacy of additional US sanctions on Russia remains untested.By simply showing up in Anchorage, Putin demonstrated that the western policy of isolating him won’t work. Zelenskyy and European leaders are undoubtedly relieved that the duo didn’t unveil a deal to end the war by partitioning Ukraine. Still, Trump’s readiness to accept Putin’s insistence on this bilateral meeting after USefforts to include Zelenskyy failedhad already sown more mistrust between Washington and Europe. NowTrump has embraced Putin’s viewthat there can be no ceasefire without an overall agreement that addresses all aspects of the conflict. He has also in effectendorsed Putin’s callfor Ukraine to cede Donbas in exchange for a freeze of the frontline. These shifts will increase Ukraine and Europe’s distrust of Trump – to Putin’s advantage.Russia jubilant after Trump summit as Putin reportedly demands Donetsk and LuhanskRead morePutin’s confidence in Russia’s eventual victory has been bolstered by Trump’s decision, taken well before the summit, to cease direct weapons deliveries to Ukraine – assistancethat totalled $65.9bnwhile Joe Biden was the US president. Russia will continue bombing Ukraine’s cities, and its ground troops will keep pushing to grab even more land. In this respect, the summit has changed nothing. What has changed since Trump’s return to the White House, though, is the US’s role in the war. Ultimately, Trump believes that Russia’s invasion does not threaten the US so it’s up to the Europeans to support Ukraine’s defence, a pointJD Vance reiteratedshortly before the summit. European countries have been increasing itsdefence spendingandmilitary supportto Ukraine. But it had better be prepared to do even more and summon the unity to stay the course.Meanwhile, the lure of additional talks with Putin will keep alive Trump’s illusion that continued diplomatic engagement with Russia and his self-proclaimed deal-making skills will eventually end the war – clearing the path to theNobel peace prize he covets.Rajan Menon is a professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York and a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace StudiesExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinRussiaDonald TrumpEuropean UnionEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Especially a male one. They’re always so confident. Never rattled, completely immune to others’ opinions.”Julie’s* intelligence and quick wit seemed to belie the very reason for attending therapy – despite reams of qualifications and years of professional experience, she felt dissatisfied with her work achievements. Having never put herself forth for a promotion, Julie had spent the better part of two decades being surpassed in position and remuneration by younger, less qualified (and mostly male) colleagues. Deflated and discouraged, Julie’s avoidance of career advancement only sought to reinforce negative self-beliefs about her intelligence and competence.“I know I could do a higher role. Sometimes, I think I could do it with my eyes closed. But what if I can’t, and then I’m found out to be a fake?”Our internal narratives can hold us back. Changing them is tough but rewarding work | Modern mindRead moreJulie was exhibiting hallmark characteristics of impostor syndrome. This phenomenon is defined by consistent doubt of one’s own accomplishments, feeling undeserving of success or achievement, and fear of being exposed as a fraud, despite evidence to the contrary. While not a clinical diagnosis, this “therapy speak” term is now very much entrenched in everyday language.I empathised with Julie’s position. As a psychology student and trainee therapist, I also experienced feelings of imposition. Competitive selection criteria and demanding training requirements make psychology studies an ideal breeding ground for impostor syndrome. Convinced that my admission to postgraduate training had been a clerical error, I’d spent a long summer fretting that I would be found to be a “phoney” on the first day of semester.First identified and investigated in the 1970s,research into impostor syndromefocused on the self-doubt commonly experienced by high-achieving professional women. Men were observed to experience less impostor syndrome than women, even in instances where they had less professional experience or objectively inferior qualifications.Like many pseudo-diagnostic terms,concept creepmeans that “impostor syndrome” is now used beyond its original definition. Psychological discomfort in a work or social setting is not necessarily impostor syndrome; most people feel nervous in situations such as starting a new job, going on a first date, speaking in public, or attending a social event where they are expecting to know few other guests.Rather, impostor syndrome is defined by thoughts and feelings about one’s intellectual parity and deservedness of success or achievement. The comparison to an individual or group of people must also be unfair or unrealistic. An amateur footballer is not expected to play at the same level as a professional; feelings of inferiority or envy that arise from this comparison are a reflection of reality, rather than indicative of impostor syndrome.Overcoming impostor syndromeUnderstandably, we often seek to push away or suppress psychological discomfort or distress associated with impostor syndrome. Many people convinced they are impostors seek consolation from others about their skills or the unfairness of a situation (such as a colleague being promoted). This provides temporary reassurance but does little to ameliorate the underlying causes of impostor syndrome.As impostor syndrome is not a clinical diagnosis, no recognised or standardised treatment exists. Instead, therapeutic work can focus on specific aspects of impostor syndrome, such as self-esteem, identity and anxiety. Assertiveness training can also be helpful. Exploring these underpinning characteristics can be effective in shifting mindset and behaviour around deservedness.Using Generative AI for therapy might feel like a lifeline – but there’s danger in seeking certainty in a chatbotRead moreFor Julie, valuable insight was gained by viewing impostor syndrome as a defence mechanism: in never seeking a promotion, Julie never risked rejection, thus defending herself against disappointment or failure.Understanding the origins of Julie’s impostor syndrome was an important step, but a practical element was also needed. Together, we devised a whimsical approach. Rather than “fake it until you make it”, we termed the approach “making it, not faking it”.In moments of self-doubt, Julie adopted the internal voice of a well-known male politician. How would he answer questions about qualifications and work experience? What would he say in a job interview or meeting with colleagues? What would be the tone of his voice, the cadence of his speech? This challenged Julie’s thinking and temporarily quelled thoughts of being an impostor.Julie’s personality and temperament would never transform into that of the politician being channelled, nor would we wish her to become someone or something she is not. But gaining a glimpse into that alternate persona allowed Julie to stop apologising for her success – and move towards celebrating it.* Julie is a fictitious amalgam to exemplify similar casesDr Bianca Denny is a clinical psychologist based in Melbourne.

Dakota Johnson plays Lucy, a matchmaker with a talent for pairing her exacting clients with someone who ticks most of their boxes and is also likely to accept them. She is less cupid, more market analyst – capable of seeing through her singletons’ self-serving bluster and spin to appraise their actual worth – then matching it with someone of equivalent value.A thirtysomething woman of only average good looks, for instance, can’t hope to land a “unicorn” – a 6ft-tall high earner with his original hairline. Unicorns want to date twentysomethings – and they can get them, too.Lucy herself is jaded as a result of her job, and pragmatic, having grown up poor. Her last serious relationship – with John (Chris Evans), an aspiring theatre actor/cater waiter – ended after he admitted, just before their anniversary dinner, that he didn’t have $25 to pay for parking.Now Lucy is resolved to stay single or marry rich – preferably eye-poppingly rich. When she is wooed by Harry (Pedro Pascal) – one of those unicorns her clients seek – and returns home with him to his multimillion-dollar apartment, her head swivels round mid-embrace, totting up its approximate worth.Obviously one matinee screening in Norwich doesn’t count for much in terms of market research, but I got the impression – from the audible and repeated tuts, tsks and groans around me – that the (mostly older) audience was dismayed by these explicit conflations of romance with finance.I kept quiet in my seat, uncomfortably conscious that I was finally watching a romcom that showed a version of dating and romance I recognised.That it’s Tough Out There for single people is a truth pretty much universally acknowledged, and widely blamed on dating apps. The technology – mainstream now for more than a decade – has become inextricable from the experience of dating; even if you don’t use dating apps yourself, you can feel their influence in the normalisation of ghosting, for instance, or “situationships” of convenience.Materialists, written and directed by Song, was inspired by her own brief experience working as a matchmaker in New York. But Lucy’s clients, with their checklists, seem to be an embodiment of the apps’ consumerist logic. Your profile is essentially a billboard on which you display your most marketable self and specify the traits you seek (and won’t accept) in others. Swiping is an instant, binary value judgment, appraising someone as being worthy (or not) of your attention. Your choices seem infinite. Meanwhile, access to the most in-demand – and therefore the most desirable, per the algorithm – matches is increasingly reservedfor paying members.It is at best a crude way of creating connection, and at worst explicitly capitalistic in a way that is at odds with attraction, commitment and intimacy. Now, as described by the sociologist Eva Illouz (notably inThe End of Love), that hyper-rational, self-serving approach has escaped online dating to infiltrate all of modern love.US man arrested for allegedly using dating apps to scam matches out of $2mRead moreYears of swiping have primed people to expect to feel the same instant feedback that someone is right for them, before they commit to finding out. A relationship, meanwhile – a costly endeavour in a culture that prizes individualism, freedom and choice – must offer a return on investment.You might not express this as baldly as Lucy or her clients, but it is in the air, the unspoken calculation behind many of our romantic decisions (and even our platonic ones:consider the brittle discussionof “friendship breakups” and “toxic friends”). Illouz terms it “emotional capitalism”, whereby “emotional life – especially that of the middle classes – follows the logic of economic relations and exchange”.What has really given teeth to this clinical number-crunching is wealth inequality, foregrounding the financial support of a partner – and incentivising some to find the richest one possible. Thecomparisonswith the marriage market of Jane Austen’s time aren’t just qualitative, butbacked by data. Stagnating salaries and rising costs mean that if you don’t come from wealth yourself, the only way to improve your material circumstances – or just achieve financial security – is through a relationship.A recent survey by the financial services provider OneFamilyfound thatone in five young adults aged between 18 and 40 are choosing to live with a partner primarily to make living costs more affordable, “because the bills are too high to contemplate managing on their own”, as the OneFamily CEO put it. Even if you are in a happy, reciprocal relationship, you can’t block out this influence altogether: do you love your partner, or do you love paying 50% less rent?Though I am largely contentedly single, I’m uncomfortably conscious that as a self-employed person in a struggling industry, my best shot at improving my circumstances, or even changing my life, is finding a partner. This doesn’t influence my decisions in dating – but I can’t say that I don’t fleetingly think, when I meet a nice doctor who owns a three-bedroom house in south London, that it would be especially nice if it worked out. (It didn’t!)It is naive to believe that we can separate romance and even relationships from financial reality. Against such a brutal backdrop, financial stability is arguably a sound reason to prioritise the search for love. If that strikes us as unsavoury or regressive, we should push for affordable housing and more financial and society safety nets, so that we can enter into relationships freely and set love apart, as best we can, from finances.For now, the challenge faced by modern singles – as Materialists acknowledges – is striking a balance between pragmatism and idealism, and holding on to hope against, often brutal reality checks. “Some people just want more” is the film’s tagline. I can’t begrudge anyone for dating for money more than for love, when the two are so entangled. But we might ultimately be better off pushing for more from society, rather than our partners.Elle Hunt is a freelance journalistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Then life happened to me – and I saw its powerRhiannon Lucy CosslettThere’s a reason these works have influenced great contemporary artists such as Jenny Saville. It just took me a while to truly see itSun 17 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 17 Aug 2025 10.18 EDTShareThere is a painting that I think about often. TheMadonna del Parto, a masterpiece painted by Piero della Francesca in about 1460, is housed in a dedicated museum in the Tuscan town of Monterchi. It depicts a heavily pregnant Virgin Mary flanked by two angels. To local women, this painting is considered a protector of fertility and the lives of pregnant women during birth. During the second world war, local women surrounded two men whom they had mistaken for Nazis intent on stealing it. In 1954, they led a protest against its proposed movement to Florence for an exhibition. I remember reading as a student that the women had lain down in the street to block its departure.I thought about those women again yesterday, as I walked around the Jenny Saville exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, tracing the influence of the Renaissance on her work. Saville’s dialogue with great painters began when she was young and an art historian uncle took her to Venice. It has continued throughout her career, most notably in hermotherhood pictures, which show her wrangling a baby, or both her babies, heavily influenced by Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. The ghosts of their Madonnas seem to linger in the sketch lines that swirl around Saville’s mother figure. One of her most famous works, the stunning, sculptural, charcoal and pastelPietà I, is a result of her study of Michelangelo’s The Deposition.I’m worried I’ll lose you in my nerdiness, so back to the protesting women of Monterchi. In my early 20s, I marvelled that anybody could care so much about a Renaissance painting as to lie down in the street as these women had. Such art left me cold, and no doubt my personal lack of religion was a factor. I dismissed it as all geriatric-looking baby Jesuses, and people pointing and kneeling. I understood, academically, its importance – the dawn of perspective! I studied and analysed the Titians and the Michelangelos as required, even passed a Socratic oral examination in Italian about the works of Leonardo. Yet where I had the choice, I always veered towards the abstract and the contemporary. None of it spoke to me the way a Rothko or a Joan Mitchell did.I knew the problem was me: I just wasn’t getting it. That strange alchemy wherein some works of art fizz with resonance eluded me. Standing more than a decade later in Saville’s room of mother paintings, it seemed clear that my inability to “understand” certain paintings had been less about my irreligious upbringing and more about my lack of life experience. When I was 23, a man tried to kill me and the trauma of that seemed to partly manifest in a taste for the baroque (pretentious, yes, but we all work through our traumas using art, most commonly music. Consider this my death metal). I dragged my then boyfriend around Rome’s churches to look at Caravaggios; stood in front of Artemisia Gentileschi’sJudith Slaying Holofernesat the Uffizi and felt her rage.View image in fullscreen‘I didn’t cry at the Saville show, but I came close in front of Aleppo, her Pietà for the children of Syria.’ Jenny Saville’s Aleppo.Photograph: Lucy Dawkins/© Jenny Saville. Courtesy GagosianWhen I was younger, nothing felt more exposing than earnestness, so like many people in their 20s I hid my greenness behind an affected world-weary cynicism. But things happen in life. Significant, sometimes awful, things, and I think there’s also something about growing older that makes caring deeply and being open about it simply feel less embarrassing. As a young person, there was a closed-offness to the emotional complexity of certain experiences – not only death, but anything to do with pregnancy or motherhood. I didn’t want to go there.Then, around the time I started thinking about having a baby, I began looking at paintings of the Annunciation. The depiction of that moment when the young Virgin Mary is told by the angel Gabriel that she will have a child – lack of belief in virgin birth aside, the artistic distillation of that feeling, of how much life is about to change – became interesting to me almost overnight. Only more so once I found out I was pregnant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a woman standing in front of it in Florence, all I could focus on was the expression on her face. Seeing things in person helps, but so, I suspect, do hormones.This summer, a good friend discovered she was pregnant – it had happened so quickly that she was as shocked as I had been. I sent her an image of that painting, writing poetically that “she looks like she’s going to vom”. Perhaps I still have some way to go in my resistance to earnestness, but I wouldn’t return to my young, cynical self for anything. I’d rather be the person who, newly postpartum, wept at a Raphael Madonna, mortifying though it is.I didn’t cry at the Saville show, but I came close in front of Aleppo, her Pietà for the children of Syria, which seemed also to contain all the grief and the agony of the mothers of the Gazan children murdered by Israel. I understood that the women of Monterchi weren’t only acting to protect a masterpiece, but to protect, as they saw it, one another, and their babies. Being willing to be moved by art also means being willing to be moved by the pain of other people, even to put yourself at risk for them. To lie down, in other words, in the street.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist.

He was the seductive dark prince of British cinema, an actor who carried an air of elegant mystery. “As a boy I always believed I could make myself invisible,” he once said. He showed up and made magic, but he never stuck around for as long as we wanted.Terence Stamp, face of 60s British cinema and star of The Limey and Superman, dies at 87Read moreStamp’s talent was timeless but he was a creature of the 60s, forged in the crucible of postwar social mobility and as much a poster boy for the era as his one-time flatmate Michael Caine. “Terry meets Julie, Waterloo station, every Friday night,” Ray Davies sang on the Kinks’s Waterloo Sunset and while he wasn’t necessarily singing about Stamp and Julie Christie – at least not consciously – the actors and the song have now become intertwined, part of a collective cultural fabric, to the point where that mental image of the two of them by the Thames is almost as much a part of Stamp’s showreel as his actual 60s pictures.He was born in London’s East End, the son of a tugboat coalman who regarded acting with horror, and his rough-hewn swagger lent a crucial grit and danger to his refined matinee idol aesthetic. He gave a superb performance – full of seething chippy rage – in 1965’s The Collector, a role that won him the best actor prize at Cannes, made an excellent dastardly lover in Far from the Madding Crowd and whipped up a storm in Federico Fellini’s uproarious Toby Dammit. But he was always a more febrile movie actor than his compatriots – Caine, Sean Connery, Richard Harris, Peter O’Toole – and so his career proved more fragile and never truly bedded down.View image in fullscreenStamp (right) in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.Photograph: Polygram/Allstar“When the 60s ended, I almost did too,” he once said, ruefully acknowledging a decade-long slump that only came to an end when he was cast as General Zod in 1978’s Superman. In the subsequent years he played too many off-the-peg Brits – thuggish gangsters, evil businessmen – in subpar productions, although this only made his occasional great role feel all the more precious. Stamp was at his full-blooded best in Stephen Frears’s 80s crime drama The Hit, sparked briefly as the devil in The Company of Wolves and was fabulous as Bernadette in 1994’s Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.View image in fullscreenStamp in The Limey.Photograph: Artisan Entertainment/AllstarBut his great later role – and arguably the ultimate Stamp performance – was in The Limey, Steven Soderbergh’s 1999 revenge tale. Soderbergh cast him as Wilson, an ageing career criminal who haunts LA like a ghost. It’s a film that is implicitly about Stamp’s youth and age, beautifully folding the present-day drama in with scenes in Ken Loach’s Poor Cow to show what happened to the golden generation of swinging 60s London – and by implication, what happens to all of us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now, the Booker prize-winning author of Shuggie Bain sits down with the record-breaking artist to talk early success, bad reviews, and the joys of making artDouglas Stuart & Jenny SavilleSun 17 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTShareIn the summer of 1992, I was a 16-year-old who was watching his mother drink herself to death. I had a desperate need to find work and somewhere to stay, and so remaining in education didn’t seem like a possibility. I had two teachers who saw how I was struggling. They dreamed a future for me that I could never have imagined for myself. One evening they took me up to the degree show at the Glasgow School of Art, and there I came face to face with the paintings ofJenny Saville.The power of that encounter has never left me. Those images were fierce and confrontational. A few months after the degree show, I lost my mother to her addiction. With the support of my teachers, I eventually finished school and went on to art school and built a career in design. Meanwhile, the GSA degree show formed a body of work that would lead to Jenny’s ascension into the Young British Artist movement – with her works appearing on the covers of Manic Street Preachers’ albums The Holy Bible and Journal for Plague Lovers – and help cement her reputation as one of the greatest British painters of any generation.View image in fullscreenJenny Saville’s Compass, 2013.Photograph: Mike Bruce/© Jenny Saville. Courtesy GagosianI have often returned to Jenny’s paintings as inspiration for my writing, especially when thinking about the body, the clarity of a child’s gaze, a mother’s vulnerability. Writing is my way of painting. I try to conjure pictures in the minds of my readers and surround them with a world that feels as vivid as any visual work. Jenny’s paintings contain many narratives; that of the image, loaded with emotion, tenderness, brutality, movement. But they also contain the narrative of their own making. You can read the journey a painter takes, following her decisions through every brushstroke. It is not unlike the sketching and building and drafting of a novel.On the occasion of Jenny’s crowning retrospective at the National Portrait Gallery in London, I wanted to revisit what her paintings have meant to me. So, 33 years after that fateful summer in Glasgow, we spent the afternoon together in her studio in Oxford and finally had the chance to talk.Douglas StuartLooking back now, what do you think your 22-year-old self would think about this show at the National Portrait Gallery?Jenny SavilleWell, it’s exciting. My 20s were an incredible time. Before that, I had waitressing jobs alongside being at art school. But during the summer between my third and fourth year, I worked to put enough money in the bank so that I wouldn’t have to. And I learned a lesson about time: that it was the most precious aspect of life. It was wonderful to be able to paint every day: everything came together, and my degree show had my first mature pictures.DSDid you always know that you wanted to work in paint?JSI always painted or made things from a young age. The permission for creativity was strong in my upbringing. My parents were teachers and would encourage creativity.View image in fullscreenJenny Saville’s Propped, 1992.Photograph: © Jenny Saville. Courtesy GagosianDSIn a lot of ways, you were the one who gave me my first creative awakening. Growing up in Glasgow, I’d never been to a museum or a gallery. A couple of art teachers at school could see I was struggling. One night after school, they said: “Look, just come with us,” and took me up to the Glasgow School of Art to the 1992 degree show. A lot of it was lost on me, because I was only a kid. But then I turned the corner and there was Propped, and although I didn’t understand all the layers of it, I was blown away. In that one moment, your work changed the course of my entire life.JSWas that the first time you went to the building?DSFirst time. I grew up less than a mile away from it and hardly knew it existed. Even if I had, I would have been intimidated; working-class kids don’t always feel that they’re invited into those circles.When I was writing [Douglas’s 2020 debut novel]Shuggie Bain, I looked at Trace (1993–94) a lot. It was an image that I had of Shuggie when he takes off his mother’s bra to care for her because she can’t care for herself, and he’s looking at her back, at the lines left in the flesh, and rubbing them and hoping they would lift. As if he could erase them, he could take away some of her pain.JSHilary Robinson, my theory tutor for my dissertation, had written an essay where she said: “A body is not a neutral ground of meaning but a copper plate to be etched.”DSThose paintings were helpful in slowing me down. They ask us to observe closely. They challenged me to write about bodies in a similar way, and it’s essential because the body is a very political thing. It’s often the only thing that my characters have: their bodies are shaped by what they do, and their lives are shaped by how they use their bodies to survive.JSThere’s a lot of attention concentrated on our bodies. You see that shift in the high street, the way the shops change over the years: you used to have a post office, a stationer’s, a butcher; now many have transitioned to nail bars, tanning salons, tattoo parlours.View image in fullscreenThe art of us … Jenny Saville and Douglas Stuart.Photograph: Courtesy of GagosianDSI was at a university a couple of weeks ago to do a reading of Shuggie Bain. It’s only five years old but I can’t yet look back on him with fondness. All I wanted to do was rewrite the book. I wished I had a red pen. Do you look back with kindness? With fondness?JSFondness sometimes, or I find my fearless naivety a bit amusing. Often I hear the music that was playing at the time, look at passages of paint and remember making that mark, the size of brush I used, the feeling inside. When I see my paintings I often think: “Oh, that part worked, but maybe I should have put another bridging tone there.” People say: “Oh, that’s a great painting,” and you think: “It’s not as good as it was in my head.”DSIt’s similar with writing: your audience encounters the finished artefact and they don’t see the journey and the loneliness.JSI wouldn’t call it loneliness. I enjoy making paintings.DSI find writing very lonely because I worked for 20 years in fashion. Now, writing in contrast to fashion feels incredibly lonely because I sit around and talk to imaginary people all day.JSDo you have a routine?DSI find that imaginary people are chattiest in the mornings, so I try to get up at six o’clock and I work till two or three in the afternoon. How about you?JSI’ve had different working rhythms and routines in my life. Recently I’ve been getting up about 6.30 in the morning and then I’ll paint until I feel that lull, which tends to be around four, and then I might do another session. I like painting eyes first thing in the morning.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Courtesy GagosianDSWhy is that?JSBecause my concentration’s at its highest, so I tend to paint details like teeth and eyes first thing in the morning, when I’m sharp.DSOne of the things that speaks to me the most about your work is your journey with colour. It has evolved so much. In the early work I can actually feel Glasgow in the paintings.Portraits so powerful they override reality – Jenny Saville: The Anatomy of Painting reviewRead moreJSGlasgow can have beautiful light. My first home there was on Hill Street, and you’d look over toward the flats and mountains and see this silvery light. I’ve never seen it anywhere else quite the same way. Over the last few years I’ve thought much more about nature and light. I’d travel, look at other approaches to painting. I went to Paris and New York and saw how [Willem] de Kooning painted flesh and thought: “What great colours and fluidity.” Then after 11 September and the Iraq war, we were flooded with images that had a lot of intense colour and emotion and I responded to the atmosphere of that time. My work evolved and I started using ranges of red and blue pigments, for example, like in my Stare heads. If you’re curious you experiment, and on that journey you discover possibilities.DSThe same in writing. You’ve got to write through it, to free yourself of it, and then get to the thing that you’ve got no idea that you were heading toward. You’re feeling a character and you’re not quite sure what they’re going to do, so you build this world for them and then you see how they react.View image in fullscreenJenny Saville’s Chasah, 2020.Photograph: Prudence Cuming Associates Ltd/© Jenny Saville. Courtesy GagosianJSIt’s been said before, but it’s probably impossible to make the perfect work. I often think: “That’s almost what I meant, that’s got something.” And this moves you forward to the next painting.DSTruth is essential in writing. And there’s power in writing truths that people would rather leave unsaid – maybe like depicting a body that some might rather not see? I must admit, I was horrified looking back at the journalism around some of your earlier work, and the fact that reviewers would use the word “grotesque” to describe it. Obviously those works haven’t changed, but the world around us keeps shifting, so hopefully reactions have changed as well. Has that journey been interesting to you, or do you not pay attention to it?JSI just get on with my work. You can’t predict how work will be perceived. And you evolve as well. In the early 90s there were fewer spaces to show, and only a small minority of artists got major platforms. Now art is exhibited from all over the world and different voices are being heard. And then once you’ve been accepted, it’s like, you’ve won the Booker prize, you can’t stay annoyed about that.DSI felt really overwhelmed by the feeling of being on the outside and nobody knowing me. And then suddenly everybody looked at me like: “Where the hell did youjustcome from?” There was 15 years of work behind my novels so I hadn’tjustarrived, I’d just been quietly over there where no one was paying attention to me. I miss that.JSIt’s important to have time to develop, be playful, use your imagination. I’m often judged on those early degree show works and I’ve developed my painting a lot since then. You have to make the work the way it should be. You can’t make work to appease people who have written a bad review. And if you’re mature about it, the bad review of a new body of work is OK.View image in fullscreenJenny Saville’s Aleppo, 2017-18.Photograph: Lucy Dawkins/© Jenny Saville. Courtesy GagosianDSThat’s very big of you. I’m not sure I’m quite there yet. That’s why the world is so nostalgic for the 90s: a time before the internet, for that sense of being by ourselves inside our own lives, without constant commentary and feedback.I’m fascinated by what Cy Twombly told you once about working: about trying to be ignored for as long as you can in your career, which is so smart.Douglas Stuart on Shuggie Bain and his tough start: ‘Living with an alcoholic, there wasn’t much I didn’t see’Read moreJSBy the time he’d told me that, everybody wanted to know Cy, to show his work and talk to him. And your impulse is to look at that with admiration, but I could see there was a kind of suffering in his words, because you need to concentrate, you need time to play, and that’s probably why he worked in isolated places, so he could focus. You can’t have judgment when you play. You want to be like that child sitting on the floor making a painting when nobody cares: that’s the most precious thing because it’s a space without judgment, and you need to feel that.DSYou’ve got to retreat from the world. But was your early success overwhelming at 22, or did it just feel like permission?JSMany opportunities happened in a short space of time. I was fortunate to sell my degree show, which was the first time I had enough money to work for a prolonged period. I had this run of wonderful things happen. And as I moved forward I just said to myself: “Get this work right, make this work the best you can.” I stayed quiet and concentrated. And that’s the lesson I learned: that the prize is the journey. Working and enjoying life’s opportunities with family and friends is the prize.Jenny Saville: The Anatomy of Paintingis at the National Portrait Gallery, London, to 7 September, then tours the Modern Art Museum Fort Worth Texas, from 12 October - 18 January 2026.Douglas Stuart’s next novel,John of John, will be published byPicadoron 26 May 2026.Explore more on these topicsJenny SavilleArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He has not, however, done the same in the UK.The developer has said that he has launched the trademark action because he is concerned about the commercial future of the spy franchise, arguing that Bond“will not die” on his watch.Daniel Craig’s last outing as 007,in No Time to Die, was released in 2021. With no announcement yet of his replacement or timeline for production of the next film, the franchise is on track to beat the previous longest gap between instalments of six years and four months.Danjaq also co-owns the copyright to the existing Bond films, along with MGM Studios, which wasacquired by Amazon for $8.5bn in 2021. Days after the report of Kleindienst’s legal challenges, it emerged that Amazon hadpaid more than $1bn to gain full “creative control”of the franchise from Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, the longtime stewards of the Bond films.With creative control, Amazon now has the power to move forward with new films and potentially TV spin-offs, without approval from the two British-American heirs to the film producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli, who had overseen the integrity of the character originally created in 1953 by the author Ian Fleming.Denis Villeneuve, the man behind the Dune franchise, is directing the next Bond film. And Steven Knight, who is the co-creator of the gameshow Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and penned Peaky Blinders, has reportedly beenbrought on board to write the next 007 outing.In March, Amazon confirmed thatAmy Pascal and David Heymanwould produce the film, although no release date or lead actor has yet been named. Pascal has experience with the Bond series in her previous position as Sony’s chair of film, overseeing Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall. She also had producer credits on the latest Spider-Man series.Heyman is best known as the producer of the Harry Potter films as well as the Fantastic Beasts franchise and is now in pre-production onthe HBO TV series adaptation of the stories. He is the second most commercially successful film producer of all time, with credits including Gravity, Paddington, Barbie, Wonka and Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood.“We have the utmost respect for the legacy of James Bond,” said Kleindienst in response to the latest developments in the trademark case. “Yet we must acknowledge a simple truth: there are clear trademark and copyright laws, which exist to prevent prolonged inactivity and ensure that cultural properties continue to serve the audiences that value them. Our goal is straightforward – to respect the legacy while ensuring that Bond remains relevant and accessible to all fans.”This article was amended on 17 August 2025 to correct the spelling of the brand Bogner and of Willy Bogner Jr.Explore more on these topicsJames BondIntellectual propertyManufacturing sectorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The irrepressibly energetic ensemble has been transfixing audiences with collective tightrope walks ever since. This year – 50 years since the composer’s death –Shostakovich’s Fifth Symphony came in for the look-mum-no-music treatment.To be clear, the memorisation element is a red herring, not in itself guaranteeing a satisfying performance. That depends on interpretation and rehearsal technique. What memorising a piece on the scale of Shostakovich’s monumental Fifth does mean, however, is that every musician knows the work inside out, in all its 3D complexity – and every musician (whether a rank-and-file violin or a woodwind principal) is equally exposed.The result was a high-intensity, high-impact performance. The volume dropped from blistering climaxes to pianissimo whispers as if the musicians had hurtled off a cliff. The tone ranged from the rudely rustic (all biting strings and gritty dollops of brass) in the Scherzo to a single silken thread spun slowly into a finely shimmering fabric in the Largo. ConductorNicholas Collonwhipped tutti passages into a frenzy but left this orchestra of soloists to craft their own moments in the spotlight. The coordination was military-grade, the finale’s close a searing, passionate catharsis. The standing ovation felt inevitable.View image in fullscreenEvery musician is equally exposed… the Aurora orchestra perform Shostakovich’s Fifth by Heart conducted by Nicholas Collon.Photograph: Andy Paradise/BBC/Paradise PhotoBut it was also inflected by the preceding “musical and dramatical exploration”, a collaboration withFrantic Assembly. Actor/dancer Max Revell was a silent, knock-kneed Shostakovich, prone to physical collapse as his Soviet credentials were scrutinised by a three-person committee. Collon introduced the Fifth Symphony (cue live musical extracts) as Shostakovich’s response to recent condemnation from Stalin himself: first arguing for the composer’s political rehabilitation, then suggesting a counter-reading.Demonstrating in real time how musical meaning is flexible, always subjective, was virtuosic indeed and a final loosening of gravity’s grasp on the musicians themselves (upended by dancers as they played) was spectacular. But repressive regimes and artistic censorship are not historical curiosities – and sudden changes of state policy towards the arts are all too familiar. Poking fun at the committee’s arbitrary preferences and presenting Shostakovich as devoid of agency told its own disappointingly cosy story.At Usher Hall, Edinburgh, on 18 August.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

Ayoade Bamgboye does so in a matter of moments in her debut show,Swings and Roundabouts, which makes instantly clear that, wow, here’s a voice you can’t help but listen to. It’s a slippery one, mind you: the show is delivered now in a Nigerian accent, now in BBC Radio 4 RP, with no guide to the shifting register. It’s ticklishly destabilising, and wholly justified by a show tracing the Londoner’s journey (cultural, geographical, even metaphysical) from Africa to the UK.That makes it sound like a conventional fringe debut, but it’s not, or at least, not to begin with. Thrillingly, Bamgboye pitches us straight into Swings and Roundabouts – no context, no handrails – with a giddy story about eavesdropping on a quarrel in a Co-op. Her command, the confidence in her delivery and how she makes the whole room her own, is quite something. There’s no point denying that the set then reverts more to fringe-rookie type, flashing back to the story of where Bamgboye has come from and who she now is. In our host’s case, that’s an oldest (or in Yoruba culture, youngest) twin, unusually interested in the circumstances of audience members’ births, with a name meaning “crown of joy” and a superiority complex to match.Mr Chonkers review – you never know what’s going to happen nextRead moreA move to the UK in her twenties knocked that joy out of Bamgboye, though; one routine here workshops English terms for misery. Her outsider eye for native British idiom surfaces throughout the show, helping pep things up as its lost-soul protagonist turns to God (“I gave my life to Christ. He gave it right back”), loses her father (cue a lovely supermarket metaphor for parental bereavement), and turns to the Samaritans. None of this is downbeat – it’s a show characterised by bright thinking, vocal variety and the kind of dizzying hairpin turns (into song, into sudden dramatic monologue) that explain why her therapist compared her to Jim Carrey. The impression is of a live-wire artist making up her own rules, and as striking a debut as I’ve seen at this year’s fringe.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Actor-musicians interweaving folk songs, murder ballads, blues and bluegrass is one idea. Framing the story as a sort of true crime podcast is another. So is making it a macabre comedy. How about the cast stepping in and out of performance as if in rehearsal? What about getting the audience involved?Out of the Forest Theatre’s production adopts all these approaches, muddying the water for an already complicated story. Writer Sasha Wilson stars alongside Lawrence Boothman and David Leopold in Vicky Moran’s production, which rattles along at such a pace that even if you know the bare bones of the case it can be hard to keep up.The cast spend little time in character as the principal figures of Borden, her sister, the family’s maid and the couple, Abby and Andrew, respectively given 40 and 41 whacks of the axe according to the grisly rhyme. The result is curiously emotionless, the script overloaded with footnotes to a story that feels stifled.How scary can theatre really be? My horror marathon in search of stage frightsRead moreEvidently well researched, there is some captivating detail – not least about “America’s most haunted house”, where the killings took place, now operating as a hotel – but a leaner account would be far more haunting. The show never chills and has a jarring combination of occasional earnestness and throwaway comedy (complete with talking corpse) akin to the Borden rock operaLizzie. It does, however, raise evergreen questions about sensationalism and sexism, and captures the historical era, including the limited scientific knowledge hindering the investigation.In one of several inspired touches, a violin is delivered in lieu of a baby for a birthing scene. While the story is frustratingly stop-start, the music is richly delivered, from the opener Feeling Good to The Wayfaring Stranger, Down in the Willow Garden and Little Sadie, its lyrics now name-checking Borden who will be for ever cast as both killer and victim.AtPleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

Then they were stopped at a bogus checkpoint in County Down – and three were shot dead. Fifty years on, survivor Des Lee looks back on that terrible nightSun 17 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 17 Aug 2025 08.14 EDTShare‘It was absolutely despicable,” says Des Lee, his voice trembling with emotion, “to think that those people who were supposed to be protecting us had planned our murder …” I’ve never heard a story as astonishing as Lee’s. His memoir, My Saxophone Saved My Life, recounts the events of half a century ago, in which his much-loved pop group, the Miami Showband, were ambushed by loyalist paramilitaries operating a fake army checkpoint, with half his bandmates murdered as he lay still, playing dead to stay alive.Though the attack carries strangely little traction in Britain, the Miami Showband massacre of 1975 is deeply etched into Irish cultural memory. Even amid the context of the Troubles, whose bleak statistics – more than 3,600 dead, more than 47,500 injured – made slaughter almost normalised, the killing of three members of the Miami Showband leftIrelandin shock. Fifty years after the atrocity, Lee, 79, tells me about a tangled plot with its roots in the uniquely Irish phenomenon of showbands.In their heyday in the 1950s to 70s, showbands – besuited troupes, closer to cabaret than rock’n’roll, performing contemporary hits with slick routines choreographed down to the last synchronised leg kick – fulfilled a need for glamour and escapism at a time when overseas stars seldom visited Ireland. Showbands, who typically took the stage around midnight, provided a crucial context in which young people from the Catholic and Protestant communities could forget their troubles (and the Troubles), and let their hair down.View image in fullscreenThe lineup of the Miami Showband in 1967.Photograph: Courtesy of Des Lee“As far as we were concerned,” Lee recalls, “a punter was a punter, no matter what religion, creed or colour. They would mingle, and you could have a Protestant meeting a Catholic and getting married. It was incredible.”Born John Desmond McAlea on 29 July 1946, Lee grew up in the Catholic suburb of Andersonstown, West Belfast, in a relatively comfortable working-class family. He would supplement his pocket money in audacious ways. On 12 July, AKA The Twelfth or Orangemen’s Day, the Protestant community would hold rallies at which the likes of Reverend Ian Paisley would vehemently denounce Republicans and Catholics. Lee would go along and blend with the crowd, collecting bottles discarded by the Loyalist throng and claiming the penny deposits.Lee found a job at a plumbing supplier but his head was soon turned by rock’n’roll, and he quit to follow in the footsteps of his nightclub musician father. He served his apprenticeship on a thriving Belfast scene centred around Cymbals instrument shop, where he rubbed shoulders with a teenage Van Morrison (“A strange guy,” says Lee, “but an exceptional talent”) and future members of Thin Lizzy.The main road was the most horrific scene I’ve ever seen in my lifeIn 1967, the circuit’s leading act, the Miami Showband, underwent one of its periodic reshuffles and drafted in Lee on sax, along with a handsome, charismatic singer-pianist called Fran O’Toole. Fronted by Dickie Rock, who had represented Ireland at Eurovision, the Miami were as big as it got. When Des calls them “The Irish Beatles” with a twinkle, it’s only slight hyperbole: they topped the Irish singles chart seven times. “When I got the deal to join,” says Lee, “I thought, ‘My God, all my birthdays are coming together.’ I jumped at it.”View image in fullscreenDes Lee on the right, with Fran O’Toole.Photograph: Courtesy of Des Lee“Girls were screaming,” he says. “We would have 2,500 people inside watching us, and 2,500 outside trying to get in. I couldn’t go to the shop without people wanting my autograph. It was stardom with a capital S.”Lee developed a close friendship and songwriting partnership with O’Toole, who later replaced Rock as frontman. Lee became the bandleader. His responsibilities included repertoire and finances, and ensuring everyone looked immaculate (70s footage shows them in dazzling-white suits with glittering lapels). He also instilled discipline. “My job was to make sure everybody was squeaky clean,” he says. “No going on the piss before a gig. We weren’t saints or angels, make no mistake. What goes on afterwards, behind closed doors, nobody knows. But we had to put on a professional show.”The Miami Showband entered the summer of 1975 in an optimistic mood. The band had scored major hits with Charlie Rich’s country standard There Won’t Be Anymore and Bonnie St Claire’s bubblegum-glam nugget Clap Your Hands and Stamp Your Feet. O’Toole was being groomed for solo stardom, and had been booked to play Las Vegas to launch his Lee-penned single Love Is, with the intention of positioning him as the next David Cassidy.View image in fullscreen‘Girls were screaming … It was stardom with a capital S.’Photograph: Courtesy of Des LeeBut that show never took place. On Wednesday 30 July 1975, the Miami played the Castle Ballroom in Banbridge, County Down, about 10 miles north of the border. “It was just a normal night, nothing untoward. We came off stage and did the usual thing: signed autographs, chatted to the fans, then we had a cup of tea and a sandwich, and got ready to do the journey back to Dublin.”Road manager Brian Maguire went ahead in the equipment van. Drummer Ray Millar drove separately to visit family in Antrim. The rest of the band – O’Toole, Lee, Brian McCoy, bassist Stephen Travers and guitarist Tony Geraghty – climbed into the Volkswagen minibus and headed south.Eight miles into the journey, at 2.30am on Thursday 31 July, they were flagged down by the red torch of an army checkpoint, a commonplace occurrence in the North. “You would be asked the same questions: ‘Where are you going, where are you coming from?’” says Lee. “We would be sitting in the van with a bottle of brandy or whiskey, and we’d occasionally offer a drop to the soldier who stopped us.”They were asked to step out of the van – again, not entirely unusual – and made to line up facing the roadside ditch. At first, the soldiers chatted casually, but their demeanour changed when someone with an English accent joined them and began giving orders. McCoy found this reassuring, telling Travers that they were dealing with the British army rather than the less predictable, locally recruited Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR).Before the search, Lee asked permission to fetch his saxophone to show it wasn’t a weapon, laying it on the road a few feet away. Suddenly, an almighty explosion tore through the van, throwing all five musicians across the ditch into the undergrowth.View image in fullscreenThe scene of the Miami Showband killings, at Buskhill in County Down, Northern Ireland.Photograph: Independent News and Media/Getty ImagesThe soldiers had not been soldiers at all – at least, not on duty. The fake army patrol were members of the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), although at least four of them were also serving with the UDR. Their intention was to plant a briefcase bomb under the driver’s seat, timed to explode further down the road. The timer malfunctioned, instantly killing two members of the UVF’s Mid-Ulster Brigade, Harris Boyle and Wesley Somerville. In the chaos, an order was given to shoot the fleeing musicians to eliminate witnesses. Lee lay still with his face in the grass, slowing his breathing and pretending to be dead – a trick he had learned from watching Vietnam movies – as he heard the murder of his friends taking place around him.First to die was McCoy, 32, shot in the back with a Luger pistol. Travers, 24, hit by a dumdum bullet, was seriously wounded. As Geraghty, 24, and O’Toole, 28, attempted to drag him to safety, they were caught by gunmen, pleading for their lives before being executed with Sterling submachine guns. O’Toole was shot 22 times, his long-haired head so badly mutilated that a doctor would later ask Lee if there was a girl in the band.View image in fullscreenThe Miami Showband at Dublin Airport.Photograph: Courtesy of Des LeeTravers lay next to the body of McCoy and, like Lee, played dead. Once the attackers had apparently left the scene, Lee cautiously went to fetch help. “The main road was the most horrific scene I’ve ever seen in my life,” he remembers. “There were bits of bodies lying all over the place. It was horrendous.”The first passing vehicle, a truck, refused to give Lee a lift. Eventually, a young couple agreed to drive him to nearby Newry, where he alerted police. “My hand was on the door handle just in case, ready to jump out, because I didn’t trust anybody at that stage.”The killings stunned Ireland, and thousands lined the streets for the funerals of the murdered musicians. The Miami Showband had represented hope. Not only did their shows unite communities, but their membership was mixed: McCoy and Millar were Protestants, the rest were Catholics. Is it fanciful to suggest that they were targeted because someone, somewhere, resented this pan-sectarian fraternisation?View image in fullscreenRemembering the Miami Showband massacre, as families demand a proper investigation into the truth behind The Troubles.Photograph: Paul Davey/AlamyLee doesn’t think that was the motive. “We were the No 1 band, and this gang wanted maximum publicity. If that bomb had exploded when they intended, the Miami Showband would have been accused of carrying weapons for the IRA.” (Indeed, within 12 hours, the UVF accused the band of being bomb-traffickers, describing their killing as “justifiable homicide”.)Lee agreed to testify at the trial in Belfast on condition he was helicoptered to and from the Irish border, with 24-hour protection. His life was threatened by relatives of the accused; he has, he says, been looking over his shoulder ever since.Lance corporal Thomas Crozier and Sgt James McDowell, both of the UDR, were sentenced to life in the Maze prison, as was John Somerville, brother of the deceased Wesley and a former soldier. (They were released under the Good Friday agreement.) Everything pointed towards collusion: covert collaboration between paramilitaries and the organs of the British state.Travers, Lee and Millar relaunched the Miami Showband with new members before the year was out, to familiar scenes of hysteria – but their hearts weren’t in it. Travers felt they had become a circus, and that audiences had come to stare rather than dance; he left the band the following year. For Lee, now lead singer, it could never be the same without his lost band members. “I looked around and there was no Fran, no Brian and no Tony, and I didn’t enjoy that.”In 1982, tired of feeling that he and his family were in danger, Lee started a new life in South Africa, performing as a saxophonist and band leader on the Holiday Inn circuit. He remained there for two decades, only returning after his wife, Brenda, died.Travers, meanwhile, went on a tenacious, meticulous search for the truth, engaging with numerous investigations and initiatives. A 2019 Netflix documentary, Remastered: The Miami Showband Massacre, is centred around his dogged efforts.View image in fullscreenGrenadier Guards Capt Robert Nairac talking to children. He was named as a leading conspirator, and was executed by Republicans.Photograph: PAThrough the years, the finger of suspicion has repeatedly pointed at two men: Capt Robert Nairac of the Grenadier guards (later executed by Republicans), and Robin “The Jackal” Jackson, a former soldier from County Down and a key figure in the notorious Glenanne Gang, were believed to have planned the ambush. Both were named by British intelligence whistleblowers, and Ken Livingstone named Nairac as a conspirator in his maiden speech as an MP.In December 2017, 80 documents were released including a 1987 letter from the UVF to the then-taoiseach Charles Haugheyon headed notepaper, which openly admitted collusion with MI5 in the attack. The evidence was now overwhelming. The historic activities of the Glenanne Gang, including the Miami Showband Massacre, fall under the purview of Operation Denton, due to report this year.The massacre hasn’t faded from Irish memory. A sculpture commemorating the dead musicians, unveiled in 2007 by former taoiseach Bertie Ahern, stands on Parnell Square in Dublin. One person who apparently didn’t remember, however, was Bono, who described the 2015 shootings at the Eagles of Death Metal show in Paris as “the first direct attack on music”. He later apologised, and U2 incorporated a slide of the Miami Showband into their show.View image in fullscreenSurviving showband members (left to right) Ray Miller, Des Lee, Stephen Travers, and former road manager Brian Maguire at the memorial on the 50th anniversary of the attack.Photograph: Rebecca Black/PAThe survivors don’t have the luxury of forgetting. The trauma has left an indelible mark. Travers was diagnosed, in later life, with enduring personality change. Lee has, he tells me, experienced profound survivor’s guilt.Miami Showband massacre: UK government accused of ‘lies’ after £1.5m payoutRead moreIn 2021, Lee was awarded £325,000 compensation, in a package he says was presented to survivors and families as a take-it-or-leave-it deal. He considers the sum to be “peanuts, for 50 years of anger and pain”. More than financial recompense, he says what he hopes for, with up to five perpetrators still officially unaccounted for, is closure: “Just tell the world the truth.”My Saxophone Saved My Lifeby Des Lee with Ken Murray is out now (Red Stripe Press)Explore more on these topicsMusicIrelandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My parents were living in a poorly heated flat in Kilburn, north-west London. My mother was working at the Ministry of Food. She was deeply involved in BBC Radio’s Kitchen Front which tried to help people conjure nutritious meals from their rations. My father became literary editor of Tribune magazine in November 1943. He was only required in the office three days a week, which gave him the time to write Animal Farm.Every evening, my father would read what he’d written to my mother under heavy blankets in bed. It was the only warm place in the flat. They would discuss the developing story and where it might go next. Lettice Cooper, the novelist and my mother’s Ministry of Food colleague, remembered my mother updating them every morning with the animals’ latest adventures. That my father and mother worked together so closely is no surprise. My father respected my mother’s talents greatly and later told a friend she had helped plan Animal Farm.Indeed, for some years, my mother had been typing and copy-editing my father’s writing and offering him detailed corrections and revisions. She was probably more deeply engaged with Animal Farm than with his previous work, perhaps even suggesting it should be a “beast fable” rather than the originally planned political polemic. The result of my parents’ teamwork, by the time Animal Farm was finished in February 1944, was one of the most beautifully written books of the century.On one level, Animal Farm is an ever-relevant satire of the Russian revolution and its betrayal into Stalinist autocracy. That was an evil my father and mother knew first hand. During the Spanish civil war they had witnessed the Stalinists slander, imprison, torture and murder dozens of their friends and comrades who did not slavishly follow the Soviet party line. They even had to flee Spain themselves under threat of Stalinist arrest and execution. Nothing dispels political illusions quicker than being pursued by fanatical murderers. These experiences, and the endless darkness of Stalin’s famines, gulags and purges, convinced my father that Soviet Russia was the very opposite of true socialism. He believed fervently that if democratic socialism was to flourish in the west, then the “myth” that Russia was a socialist state had to be debunked.But there were profound challenges that had to be overcome before Animal Farm could be published. There was a deep-rooted institutional reluctance to allow any criticism of Soviet Russia while it was a British ally leading the destruction of Nazi Germany. This attitude was compounded by relentless Soviet government lobbying and the comprehensive infiltration of British institutions by Soviet agents. Peter Smollett (AKA Smolka, Soviet agent codename ABO) was head of Soviet relations at the Ministry of Information and the now notorious Cambridge spy Guy Burgess was a BBC producer.TS Eliot doubted ‘that this is the right point of view from which to criticise the political situation at the present time’Everywhere, negative stories about Russia were quietly downplayed or suppressed and positive ones megaphoned. In this climate, five major publishing houses (at least one of them advised by Smollett) turned down Animal Farm as an inappropriate attack on a vital wartime ally. Even Faber, followingits director TS Eliot’s advice, doubted “that this is the right point of view from which to criticise the political situation at the present time”.Finally, in July 1944, Fredric Warburg of Secker & Warburg, known for courageously publishing controversial leftwing books, agreed to take it on. Even then, paper shortages and possibly ongoing reluctance to offend Britain’s ally, meant Animal Farm was not published until 17 August 1945. When it finally appeared, my father was surprised at how little fuss there was about his bold satire of Stalinism and dictatorship. But relations with Russia were by then rapidly cooling and, as my father said, people were “fed up with all [this] Russian nonsense”. Animal Farm’s time had come. Since its first publication 80 years ago, it has sold more than 11m copies and never been out of print.But Animal Farm is more than just a satire of the Russian Revolution. This “fairy story” (as my father called it) is an eternal warning against political leaders who hijack potentially noble movements for their own selfish purposes. My father thought all politicians should be watched hawkishly, confronted truthfully (whatever the price) and kicked out when they put their interests before those of their country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Queueing for her latest show, In the Bushes, we’re given a handout of an interview where the French choreographer cites her influences, from Guy Debord’s The Society of the Spectacle to Henry Gee’s The Accidental Species. It’s the idea of human exceptionalism that’s at the heart of her thinking: we’re just animals, she says. What makes us think we’re above the rest of our kingdom? And if you take away society’s manners and constraints, who are we then? What goes on in the bushes when nobody’s looking?In truth, the appearance of the six dancers is less animal, more like a bunch of toddlers who’ve been let loose in the dressing up box, tottering about on tippy toes, squawking and cooing and twittering. They come across like Teletubbies (you might find this irritating, or hilarious). She paints us as simplistic beasts, sensory-seekers, rolling on the floor, rubbing against each other, doing what feels good. There’s naivety and lack of embarrassment about bodies – it brings to mind Emma Stone in the filmPoor Things, especially later when things get a bit less naive with biting hands, slapping bottoms and giggly kisses.The Unstoppable Rise of Ben Manager review – tales of the unexpected at the officeRead moreBut then there’s the intrusion of shame, fear, and innocence lost. Nakedness and the dawning of self-consciousness. These parts are cleverly, amusingly done, along with the creeping in of rituals, for the dead, for example – something that’s been observed in animals, too. The climax is a huge outpouring of fake emotion. The dancers play at being distraught, tears dripped from a water bottle, revelling in the big feels, even when they’re completely fabricated. This surely is a true marker of human behaviour – what else do we use art for, if not to fabricate emotions?The emotions produced here seem fairly surface level. It’s a funny and silly piece of dance, even though it’s also deeply concerned with the very nature of who we are. They are a truly impressive clan of performers, to keep up this level of jittery, full-body energy and intense character for a constantly moving hour. Humans are often enthralled to watch animal behaviour that we don’t necessarily understand, and this is not dissimilar.AtSummerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreDanceComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

One of the many clever touches in this distinctive comedy by Dan Bishop is that his characters do exactly the same when they are introduced. Yaz, Mitch, Duggan and Bathsheba are to each be paid £2,000 for volunteering in a clinical drug trial; they’ve swallowed their pills and are now scrutinising every possible side-effect. It builds a hyper-awareness that accentuates the awkward exchanges that Bishop writes so well.The setup leads you to expect a broadside on gen Z’s financial precarity – it was amalaria drugs trial that fundedsuperb standup John Tothill’s first fringe run – but there are other interesting ideas at play. One of the group has got her place through a relative (nepotism is rife even in volunteering); one is an activist extolling freeganism and the “anti-work movement”; one doesn’t need the money but is simply lost and lonely. From the bead-worrying Bathsheba’s dreamworld to Duggan’s excitable bursts of “broski!”, the characters are neatly juxtaposed while each, in their own way, wants to change the world they live in. By the fifth and final Saturday of their weekly appointments, they part ways refreshingly unchanged and without any Breakfast Club-esque transformation.View image in fullscreenGreat ear for words … playwright Dan Bishop, centre, in Brainsluts.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianBishop has a great ear for words: the doctor’s mock bombast that falls flat in a workplace, the deadening legalese she adopts when her guard is up, the decisive delivery of a breakup. Blurted confessions, mangled phrases, forced small talk, bullshit banter and occasional standup-style lines hang in the air as Bishop stresses the stasis in these lives through the characters’ passive income streams and anti-go-getter ideals. The play nails their malaise when, through a shared meditation exercise, they feel uncomfortable imagining the peace of a beach or forest and substitute them with a big Tesco.Threaded together by quirky musical beats, this TV-friendly script is tightly directed by Noah Geelan and deftly performed by Bishop (Mitch), Bethan Pugh (Yaz), Martha West (Bathsheba), Robert Preston (Duggan) and, in a standout performance, Emmeline Downie as the doctor. These volunteers are told side effects could include nausea and dancing; audiences may experience considerable changes in brain activity and severe laughter.AtPleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

If that were the thinking behind this fringe debut by NYC four-pieceSimple Town– well, it might just be smart, fresh and funny enough to revitalise the form. It’s sketch with something of the energy of improv, a hint of an easygoing get together with your coolest friends (OK,farcooler than my friends) – and the kind of freewheeling, elusive-logic comedy with whichSheepshave in recent years sustained sketch’s flagging pulse.Identified as “four teens in their 30s”, Simple Town introduce themselves as they mean to go on: super-casual, faux-naive, coming at one another, and at our expectations, from odd angles. Their first sketch takes us back vaguely in time, to three Nasa bros aghast that a woman has been recruited to their space programme – because “she can do multiplication in her head!”. Like later scenes, this one contains several movements, the borders porous between them, the comic point forever evolving and slipping beyond your grasp.Jena Friedman: Motherf*cker review – political zingers and all-too-raw griefRead moreIf you like that sensation, of laughing without ever fully pinning down why, Simple Town are your new best friends. What’s going on in the skit that pairs two cagoule-clad spare thumbs left alone together at their respective partners’ reunion? This dotty choreography of social awkwardness extrapolated ad absurdum is as beguiling as it is barely explicable. You could read their firing squad sketch as a brilliant riff on the polarised US, where fierceness of conviction is matched only by woolliness of argument. It’s also just a nugget of Pythonesque nonsense about dopey executioners.Some routines are simpler, like the solipsistic inner monologue of the audience member whose suggestion is accepted for an improv scene. Or like the show’s closer, burlesquing middle-class American reverence for old Europe – although even that one morphs halfway into a four Yorkshiremen-style race to the bottom of US education. It’s all accomplished with artless slacker panache by Will Niedmann, Caroline Yost, Felipe Di Poi Tamargo and Sam Lanier, posting a welcome reminder of how exciting team comedy can still be.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

The rest is a result of selling “lots and lots of books” as, he says, younger adults are being inspired to pick up a paperback by social media, such as the trend for TikTok recommendations known asBookTok, and book clubs in real life.“They want to do something not staring at a screen and relatively inexpensive, and once people start collecting books they just buy more,” Daunt says. “BookTok is an easy label to put on it, but this is about people wanting to read and talk about books.”He says that while some trends in reading can be quite local, there have been waves of interest in subjects from romance toromantasyto fantasy that have caught the public’s imagination.View image in fullscreenWaterstones in Bradford, in the old Wool Exchange building.

Its revival would help “shape the future of British drama”, he added, providing an “opportunity to support emerging talent behind the scenes – from writers and directors to production teams – especially those from lower-income backgrounds who haven’t always had clear pathways into the industry”.Play for Today was a BBC One anthology drama series that ran from 1970 until 1984, designed “to rattle the cages of the establishment” and famed for bringingAbigail’s PartyandRumpole of the Baileyto the small screen.It featured more than 300 productions, the most controversial of which wasScum– a prison drama starring Winstone that was considered so harrowing it was banned from broadcast and later remade as a film.The drama in which Dobson stars, Never Too Late, is about ageing, rebellion and independence. She told the Guardian it would resonate because “[we] live in a society now where older people are living much longer, so it’s really important, I think, that their voices are heard as much as young people’s voices”.“I hope it makes lots of people feel positive and hopeful that life is never over until the last bell rings.”She praised Channel 5, for “teaching people new skills”, and the young crew she worked with on the show, some of whom were on their first production. “The joy they brought to work was just fantastic. They were willing; they were eager. Nothing was too much trouble.”Dobson said Play for Today was “a wonderful institution” and lauded Channel 5 “for actually getting this kind of stuff on the screen”.“More of that in TV would be wonderful, where you’ve got something really great to say about society and life, which is important.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For some, air conditioning is a given; for others it is an unaffordable luxury.10 new AC units will be sold every second for the next 30 years, bringing the number worldwide to 5.6bn by 2050The photographer Gaia Squarci and researcher Jacopo Crimi visited Brazil, India,Indonesiaand Italy to photograph the stories of people in extreme heat and how they are learning to adapt to it.ChartTheir project, The Cooling Solution, visualises how people are adapting to rising temperatures and humidity among different socioeconomic groups, and investigates how accessible air conditioning is for these people.View image in fullscreen31C (87.8F)|65% humidity| An office worker at the Ministry of Public Works, a green building in Jakarta, Indonesia, 2022Crimi said a lot of modern architecture was made up of isolated, air-conditioned units that crammed people in together. But after realising these flaws, some architects began using new technologies to designed buildings that do not rely on AC.“We wanted to show positive examples,” said Crimi. “Architects were implementing both modern ways of tackling heat, such as the building in the photo, but as well reviving ancient architecture. A solution exists for alternatives to air conditioning, but it requires affluence.”View image in fullscreen28C|71%|A family on a scooter in the Kemayoran neighbourhood of Jakarta, with high-rise buildings in the background, 2022Squarci said the streets of this subdistrict in Jakarta were crammed with scooters with multiple riders on them. The temperature of the motorbikes and the weather made it an uncomfortable commute for riders and “even if there is family in the photo, it speaks to the mass and plurality of people’s experience”, she said.With large buildings in the background, the photo illustrates a division of wealth between those in technologically developed areas and others exposed to the extreme heat on the streets.View image in fullscreen29C|72%| Children dive in the Cachoeira Piscininha do Silvestre, a waterfall in the neighbourhood of Cosme Velho in Rio de Janiero,Brazil, 2022In this photo, young children swim in a pond to cool down.

Those with AC and those without,” said Squarci.View image in fullscreen32C|50%| Anna Gabriela Patrocinio Gregório (centre) and her daughters Lara, eight, and Sãnella, five, pose for a portrait at their home in a favela in the Santa Teresa neighbourhood in Rio de JaneiroCrimi said: “We found that the photos that were the most interesting and told the deepest story were the ones closely related to the intimate dimensions of a person.”Gregório said that while she was pregnant with her two children, she often felt sick and fainted because of the heat. With no windows in her house, she had to rely on a small fan on the floor to stay cool.View image in fullscreen26C|77%| Residents of Rio’s Bangu district chat outside a shopping centre, a desirable destination because it has AC, 2022This modern shopping centre in Bangu was built with air conditioning and attracts locals trying to escape the heat.Access to these air-conditioned spaces is especially important for the demographics that struggle most with heat, such as elderly people and children.

The cinema room at this planetarium had AC installed, but for Squarci and Crimi, the room felt extremely cold and was in stark contrast to the heat experienced by lower socioeconomic groups in India.Squarci said the photo symbolised “the abuse of AC, and I did not want to perpetrate visual stereotypes in these developing countries. It is important to include examples of the higher middle class and their experience in India and Brazil.”View image in fullscreen31C|60%| Tourists take over Piazza San Marco during the Festa del Redentore in Venice,Italy, 2015.

The photo captures a child being thrown into the air, which Squarci described as “a need to make the image interesting. Even when we are talking about something sensitive, I welcome anything that can catch people’s attention.

Would letting them bring plus-ones make it work?Nick DuerdenSun 17 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTShareThey’ve packed too much, surely? The cabin crew do not look thrilled as I try to help squeeze each bag into the overhead lockers or the footwells under the seats in front. My 19-year-old has brought five and a half bikinis – we are away for a week – and her sister, four. (For comparison, I’ve taken my one and only pair of trunks.) The 19-year-old’s boyfriend has mercifully adopted a more minimal approach – just one wheelie for him – while the 17-year-old’s best friend has a different outfit for every day.If there is an unusual sense of excitement among us right now, then it’s because of the extrahumanbaggage in tow. The fact that each daughter has been permitted a plus-one on our family summer holiday this year means that we can still be together, but mostly apart.It’s how they like it these days.View image in fullscreenIt happened slowly at first, and then all at once. We had previously been a tight family of four who enjoyed each other’s company and loved going abroad. But then the girls grew fully into their Kevin and Perry years, and abruptly our holidays became protracted affairs, pierced by arguments, sulking and occasional stormings off, my wife’s attempts at diplomacy mostly failing. One daughter wanted the beach, the other the swimming pool, and then both decided they would much rather just stay in bed all day. Their phones made everything so much worse.View image in fullscreenStrolling in Cádiz’s old town.Photograph: Stefano Politi Markovina/AlamyI was ready to give up on such holidays altogether, but my wife persisted. Our last attempt was two years ago. I recall one particular evening in Skiathos, when the then 17-year-old announced she was craving cocktails, so we went to a bar filled with young people and bought three full-powered ones and a non-alcoholic equivalent for the 15-year-old. The gesture failed. We sat in silence as my daughter fumed at our very presence (me in sandals), and I reeled at the €50 bar bill.The 19-year-old wants only to tan, the 17-year-old to swim in the pool. The boyfriend wants a football to kick, while the friend wants to have ‘fun’Each of us by now wanted different things from our time away. There was bickering over breakfast options and wifi reliability, while my wife maintained the conviction that any loose collection of bricks upon the island – which she quaintly termed “historical ruins” – was worth a 30-minute trek in 32C heat to go visit. All I wanted to do was sit in a cafe with a sea view and read my book.Which is why this summer we said yes to them bringing guests. Add to the soup to dilute the soup. We’re in southern Spain. Here, the 19-year-old wants only to tan, the 17-year-old to swim in the pool. The boyfriend wants a football to kick, while the friend wants to have “fun”.“Relax,” my wife tells me. “It’ll be fine.”We arrive in Seville to thick heat and cicadas, and an immediate atmosphere of crop tops and flip-flops. Our hire car is enormous, a seven-seater, which the teens fill with pale, sprawled limbs. They are asleep within seconds of us hitting the motorway. It’s two hours to Cádiz, and I keep turning to look at them, to make sure they’re OK, these people we’re required to keep alive for the next seven days. When our daughters were younger, we would routinely meet their friends’ mothers and fathers, but all this stopped the moment they reached secondary school, when it became paramount to keep parents hidden over fears of public embarrassment.And so these are the children of strangers, essentially. The weight of responsibility hangs heavy. Whenever we go away, the dog-sitter sends us photographs of the dog, presumably to show us that she is safe and well. Should we be doing the same here for the kids’ parents, and have them holding up today’s newspaper to confirm the date?View image in fullscreenThe writer’s daughters when family holidays were simpler affairs.Photograph: Nick Duerden“I’ll deal with it,” my wife says, a woman with more numbers in her phone book than I have in mine.We are staying in the small coastal town of Zahara de los Atunes, famed locally for its tuna, and where Spanish tourists appear to outnumber Brits by 99 to one. It is close to midnight when we arrive. The air-con is complicated, and the bedroom fans appear stricken with seizures. I’m exhausted, but the children experience a second wind. They want to go into town, which is a 20-minute walk or five minutes in the car. One of us will have to take them. We toss for it. My wife loses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

There are leftovers from their post-midnight snacks on the kitchen table, alongside the dregs of sticky alcoholic drinks, which the ants have found and are now busy informing all their friends about. My wife and I enjoy a quiet breakfast on the balcony, then pad early to the beach before the winds pick up. (By afternoon, the wind here, known as thelevante, is strong enough to lift you from your towel and carry you across the Strait of Gibraltar before depositing you in Morocco.) We check our phones repeatedly for signs that the young ones have woken. When they do rouse, gone midday, they send us a list of requirements from the supermarket: chips and Haribo and Bacardi. We buy them fresh ingredients for summer salads instead.The weight of responsibility hangs heavy. Whenever we go away, the dog-sitter sends us photographs of the dog. Should we be doing the same here for the kids’ parents?All of us revert helplessly to type. We nag them about sunscreen and riptides, and make sure they know where the calamine lotion is. They sigh and mutter “yes, yes” and then ignore everything. We encourage them to drink plenty of water, and we navigate the minor squabbles that arise with nothing like aplomb. (It is too hot for aplomb.)My wife suggests excursions, the usual tourist preoccupations: souvenir shops, a museum, one of those churches with the nice stained windows. But none of them seem much fussed. They want rum. I, meanwhile, have the latest Sally Rooney and 800 pages ofHelen Garner’s diariesto get through.View image in fullscreenThe sisters outside a bakery in Cadiz.Photograph: Nick DuerdenWe do occasionally come together as a group, like normal people. One day, we drive an hour to Cádiz, its picturesque old town full of narrow streets and a vibrant food market. We eat tapas and drink wine, and the plus-ones listen patiently while we tell silly family stories in the way that all families do – and, as with all families, probably reveal ourselves as eccentric at best, or else certifiably mad. But they tolerate us, the plus-ones, and that’s the main thing. It’s a lovely evening.There’s a curious anticipation in the air when the time comes to go home. My wife and I are staying on for a few more days to explore the region in a smaller hire car, while the kids are returning for August jobs to help fund college and university.At the departure gate, I surprise myself by crying. All four of them look so beautiful and tanned, glowing with youth and vitality, their wrists full of friendship bracelets. I watch them stride away, specifically towards customs but also on into adulthood, without us, and I am overcome with emotion and love. I want them to come back, to extend the family holiday, because I’m not ready to consign it to the past, not just yet. But I know, too, that this is life; that it’s wise to let them go, be free.“Safe flight,” I cry out to them, a little too loudly. “Please remember to text when you land. Call me!”Explore more on these topicsAndalucia holidaysSpain holidaysEurope holidaysFamily holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As a law-abiding citizen, I prefer to use an oven, but I have to concede that those naughty bandits knew a thing or two about flavour.Prep20 minMarinate8hr+Cook4½ hrRest30 min+Serves61 bone-in lamb shoulder(about 2kg)1½ heads garlicOlive oil1 tsp cinnamon1 tsp dried oregano1 tsp salt2 lemons1kg waxy potatoes(see step 3)1 large red onion1 red pepper12 cherry tomatoes2 bay leavesView image in fullscreen1 A note on the meatKleftiko is traditionally made with lamb shoulder, which is ideally suited to slow cooking. You could use a shoulder from an older sheep or goat instead, but neither will be as tender as lamb; they will be stronger in flavour, though. If you prefer leg, treat it in the same way, but bear in mind that it will probably require a little less time in the oven.2 Marinate the meatView image in fullscreenPeel and crush the half head of garlic, and rub the meat all over with olive oil. Sprinkle the cinnamon, oregano and salt all over the lamb, then top with the crushed garlic and the juice of one lemon, and rub in using your hands (wash and rub your hands with the cut lemon to help get rid of the smell of garlic afterwards). Cover and chill for eight to 12 hours.3 A note on the potatoesShortly before cooking, heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas 3. While it’s heating up, prepare the vegetables. Waxy potatoes (such as charlottes, maris peers, anyas or anything described as a salad variety) are the best bet here, because they will keep their shape during the long cooking time. There’s no need to peel them unless they’re very dirty.View image in fullscreen4 Prep the vegetablesCut the potatoes into wedges (if they’re small, just cut them in half; leave them whole if they’re real babies). Peel the onion (a yellow onion would also be fine here, as would shallots, peeled and cut in half), then cut it into chunky wedges. Halve the pepper, remove and discard the stalk, pith and seeds, then cut the flesh into thick strips.5 Other flavouringsView image in fullscreenWash the tomatoes – if you prefer, use larger ones, in which case cut them in half or, for really large fruit, into wedges. You could also add big chunks of feta (don’t crumble it, otherwise it will dissolve into the gravy) orkefalotyri, a few sprigs of fresh oregano, fennel, or even chunks of courgette or aubergine, though those aren’t strictly traditional.6 A note on the cooking vesselTake a large lidded casserole dish that’s big enough to hold the lamb with the lid on tightly, or use a roasting tin lined with enough baking paper to fold over the top of the joint on both sides (you’ll probably need at least two sheets of paper set at right angles to each other).View image in fullscreenPut the potatoes, onions, pepper and tomatoes in the casserole or tray.7 Add lemon, garlic and bayView image in fullscreenLay the marinated lamb on top of the vegetables, then pour any remaining marinade over the top. Cut the remaining head of garlic and lemon in half across their thickest points, squeeze the lemon briefly on top of the lamb (no need to wring it absolutely dry), then tuck the lemon shells, the half garlic heads and the bay leaves in and around the joint.View image in fullscreen8 Cover and bakePour 200ml water into the dish. If using a casserole dish, tuck a damp piece of greaseproof paper on top of the meat, then cover with the lid; if using a roasting tray, sprinkle the overhanging paper with water, then fold it up and over the meat and tuck in to form a sealed package. Bake for four to five hours, until the meat is very tender.9 Finishing touchesView image in fullscreenWhen the lamb is soft, turn up the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 6 and remove the lid and/or greaseproof paper. Roast for a further 10-15 minutes, then lift out the meat and set aside to rest for about 30 minutes. Put the pan of vegetables back in the oven for 15 minutes, until they’re starting to brown, keep warm until the meat has finished resting, then carve and serve up.Explore more on these topicsStewFelicity Cloake's masterclassGreek food and drinkFoodLambMeatPotatoesTomatoesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No, the stoves in this part of town have been bubbling away for decades – once upon a time,Keith Floyd, the original firestarter of the kitchen bad boys, held court on this very road. If you’re a young thing and blissfully unaware of our man Floyd, please avail yourself of thehundreds of YouTube clipsout there and count the many moments when his wit, snark and, in many cases, boggle-eyed drunkenness would not be deemed fit in these modern-day puritan times.Floyd may be long gone, but the 21st-century Chandos Road is home to, among others, the well-lovedLittle Hollows Pasta Coand the much-lauded farm-to-forkWilsons, and last autumn they were joined byKorean restuarant Dongnae, from husband-and-wife team Duncan Robertson and Kyu Jeong Jeon. The pair met atL’Atelier de Joël Robuchonin Paris, moved on to run the now defunct L’Envie in Brive-La-Gaillarde, south-west France, before spending the best part of a decade in Jeon’s native Korea. In 2019, they settled in Bristol to open the very popularBokman, where dumplings, kimchi fried rice and cherry-flavoured soft-serve Jersey ice-cream are the order of the day.View image in fullscreen‘Cute’: Dongnae’s charcoal-grilled dayboat mackerel comes with generousssamand sauces on the side.Their latest venture is a little more earnest, authentic and pared back, though. It’s billed as a traditional neighbourhood Korean barbecue restaurant, but it’s actually a little stranger and more homespun than that. While London restaurant investors might splurge tens of thousands of pounds on imported chandeliers, Dongnae uses Ikea-alike student bedsit paper lanterns in its two-store shopfront space, and has spent very little indeed on furniture, wallpaper and counters. Rather fittingly, in fact, it feels a bit as if you areina student bedsit, only with Robertson doing the communal cooking every night.In keeping with this general aura, the menu itself is delicate, bespoke and thoughtful, too. Expect octopus and lamb fatkkochi(skewers), assorted punchy kimchis, hand-dived scallops, cockle and mussel bibimbap, and Korean beef tartare. Expect cold, bracing Korean soups and peculiar but unforgettable pond-green puddings – but more of that later. At lunch, there is an à la carte and a £24 set menu and, at dinner, the option of ahanjeongsik,an omakase-style seven-course menu that changes daily, and offers a handpicked flurry of Korean loveliness.View image in fullscreen‘Like beef tartare, but not’: Dongnae’s yukhoe.Dongnae is odd, unique and absolutely a roaring hit with Bristol’s diners. It may not be to everyone’s taste, especially if your only knowledge of Korean cooking is generous portions of Brit-pleasing scallion pancakes, bulgogi and, of course, bubbling sweetcorn in cheese sauce, all washed down with peach soju. Instead, here there are ginger old fashioneds, a low-intervention wine list, delicate servings of grilled monkfish with octopus alongside tiny bowls of seasoned seaweed or mustard leaf kimchi, and a very good raw sea bassmulhwesoup made with fresh sugar tomatoes. And if you get a bit lost trying to make head or tail of the menu, Dongnae’s staff will expertly guide you through it and explain the difference between yournaengchaeand yournaengguk. Yes,yukhoeis like beef tartare, and here it comes with a mound of leaves, cucumber and radish, all designed to be rolled up in sheets of nori. Bowls of soft, glossy yellow tofu come festooned with whiffy grated bottarga, though the front of house couldn’t, of course, help me transfer it to my mouth when it evaded my attempts to capture it with the dainty chopsticks. We ate a hunk of hot grilled mackerel and cubes of wagyu that arrived on a cute little grill with generousssamand sauces on the side.View image in fullscreen‘One of the greatest things I’veevertasted’: Dongnae’s mugwort and black sesame cake.Dongnae is an ornate feast of sweet, sour, sharp, puzzling and powerful. It is little wonder that Bristol’s food scene is fighting for a table and feeling slightly irked that those tables now come with a limited time span. I didn’t really expect much from dessert, because on the face of it these people seem so very serious, but how foolish I was, because Jeon’s mugwort cake is one of the greatest things I’veevertasted. Yes, it looks like it ought to be dished up at a Harry Potter-themed tea party, and yes, it’s blue in places and algae-green in others, but the novelty ends the moment you bite into its complex, soft, creamy, buttery richness. Mugwort cake, it turns out, is the sponge cake it has taken me until my vintage years to discover, and now I pine for it daily. This higgledy-piggledy restaurant is causing a stir on Chandos Road, just as Floyd once did, but for very different reasons. Grab a seat if you can. Buckle up.
