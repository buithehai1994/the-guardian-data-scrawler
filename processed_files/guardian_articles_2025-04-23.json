Starmer is due to meet the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in London on Thursday as momentum builds towards a UK-EU summit in May.Cabinet differences remain on the shape a youth visa deal could take. Reeves is said to be in favour of a deal that includes time-limited youth visas – the highest priority for Brussels – but the home secretary,Yvette Cooper, has insisted on a cap on numbers, with a time limit of one year.One source with knowledge of the talks said the cap would probably be about 70,000 people. “Yvette is pursuing the task she has been set by the PM – to reduce net migration,” a source close to the home secretary said.Asked in Washington on Wednesday about the possibility of a youth mobility scheme, Reeves said: “We want to see net migration fall as a government and we’ve set out plans to achieve that. We also want to have control of who comes into this country. That is really important for us.“But we’re not going to be returning to free movement. We will bring down net migration, and the talks are ongoing with the EU around reducing trade barriers.”One EU source said: “Everyone is being cautious but there is a desire to find a way that removes any suggestion that this is going to increase migration. It could come in many forms and quotas is just one.”View image in fullscreenAndrew Lewin, the Labour MP for Welwyn Hatfield, led the call for ‘a new and bespoke youth visa scheme’.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverIn their letter to the minister, 62 MPs led by the Welwyn Hatfield MP, Andrew Lewin, said the government should work with the EU to create new opportunities for British young people to work and travel in the EU, similar to agreements with more than a dozen countries including Australia and Canada.“We want to see a new and bespoke youth visa scheme for UK and EU citizens aged under 30. As with all of the UK’s existing schemes, we believe this should be time-limited and subject to a cap on numbers,” the MPs said.It is understood the UK is on the verge of agreeing to enter into negotiations on three key topics including the youth mobility scheme, a sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) deal to eliminate checks on food and drink being exported to the EU and entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, and a deal on carbon emissions.It is thought the SPS deal would be based on a deal the EU struck with Switzerland in 2023, but with substantial changes. “The EU hates the Swiss mode. It is full of complexity and inefficiency but that is not to say it could not be a conceptual model to build on,” an EU source said.A defence pact is almost certain after the EU’s white paper on defence in March paved the way for British defence companies such as Babcock and BAE Systems to bid for money from the new €150bn (£129bn)EU defence fund.UK and European sources also expect an announcement on trafficking and intelligence sharing as a way of signalling a tough approach to irregular migration.Full negotiations are expected to be given the go-ahead to start by the autumn, once the European Commission has a mandate from member states.The MPs’ intervention has been privately welcomed by some ministers as a tacit signal of the outline of what the government is seeking to achieve. In their letter to Thomas-Symonds, the MPs say the UK should seek to allow products to be tested in the UK to reduce cost and complexity for UK and EU firms.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But negotiations may be possible for specific sectors, such as pharmaceuticals.View image in fullscreenStella Creasy, the chair of the Labour Movement for Europe, said the government’s ambitions should go even further than the letter suggested.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianMPs also said the government should seek to join the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean (PEM) convention, a customs union alternative that would lift barriers particularly for the automotive, chemicals and pharmaceutical sectors.“As certainties about globalisation, trade and tariffs break down at a remarkable speed, we are reminded how our stability, prosperity and security depend on having deep and resilient partnerships with like-minded nations, based on free and frictionless trade, shared values and political trust,” the letter says.Lewin told the Guardian that Starmer should be confident he had support and a mandate for a more ambitious settlement.“This is a moment of opportunity for all who want to see a closer relationship between the UK and the EU, and that includes millions of voters who put their confidence in Labour last year,” said Lewin, who won his seat from the former defence secretary Grant Shapps.The letter has been signed by dozens from the new intake of MPs, including those with constituencies that voted to leave the EU. They include Amanda Hack, who won Andrew Bridgen’s former seat in North West Leicestershire, Mike Tapp, the Dover and Deal MP, and the prominent new backbenchers Yuan Yang, Emily Darlington, Joe Powell, Josh Dean, Simon Opher and Tom Rutland.Phil Brickell, who also signed the letter, said: “This isn’t about relitigating the Brexit years. Rather, it’s about ensuring businesses such as those in my Bolton West constituency can access the European markets fenced off from them by the Tory-botched Brexit deal.”Experts said even the push from Labour MPs would be unlikely to address the hit to UK economic growth caused by Brexit. “I think they are in a race against time to tie down whatever they want to do with the US before they do a deal with the EU. It is a two-headed monster,” said Mij Rahman, the head for Europe at the Eurasia Group consultancy.David Henig, a trade expert, said the deal was unlikely to deliver the economic growth Labour is seeking. “Perhaps it can best be seen as a reasonable first step that should be accompanied by a plan to go further within respective red lines,” he said.Stella Creasy, the chair of the Labour Movement for Europe, said the government’s ambitions should go even further than the letter suggested. “We have to be ruthless about reducing the barriers to trade with Europe that the Tory Brexit deal created, whether they are the paperwork created by VAT, emissions trading schemes that affect energy costs or the extra headaches caused by new regulations,” the MP for Walthamstow said.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionBrexitTrade policyMigrationEuropeLabourRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

We want to get the right deal that’s in our national interest, and those talks are ongoing,” she said.Asked about her discussions with Bessent – the first time the pair will meet face to face – Reeves said: “We’re not going to be, I don’t think, discussing the intricacies of autos and food standards.”Instead, she said, they would be talking about “how we can build on the trade relationship that we have”.Trump’s an unstable bully – but it’s hard to defend the economic orthodoxies he is attacking | Larry ElliottRead moreThe UK has already offered concessions to the US in the hopes of getting tariffs cut, including reducing the digital services tax on US tech companies. Reeves travelled to Washington for the spring meetings of the IMF with hopes of securing a carve-out from the 25% levies on cars, aluminium and steel.Car industry bosses have warnedjob losses are weeks awayin Britain’s premium automotive sector unless the UK can secure a deal to shield the likes of Jaguar Land Rover, Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Aston Martin and McLaren from tariffs.It is unclear whether an exemption from the 10% base tariff Donald Trump has levied on all imports is on the table.Hopes of an early agreement were undermined on Wednesday by a leaked document setting out new US demands.The text, which first appeared in the Wall Street Journal, dismayed UK officials by including calls for concessions in a series of new areas, including a demand for the government to drop its standards on agricultural products including beef.Allowing US hormone-treated beef into the UK has long been a demand from Washington, which successive British governments of all stripes have rejected. Reducing agricultural standards is a particular red line for Labour because it would kill hopes of a veterinary agreement with the EU.Reeves flatly rejected the idea that food or other product standards would be up for grabs. “We’re not going to be relaxing our food standards. We are clear with the US about that and they respect that and understand that,” she said.She added: “These are all discussions around tariffs and trade barriers but we are not going to be changing our standards based on asks from foreign governments. Decisions around food standards, around digital services, around auto standards, are decisions for the UK government to make and we will continue to do that.”She did not rule out discussing another request in the leaked US negotiating document, that the UK should reduce import tariffs on US cars from 10% to 2.5% to secure a deal.“I’m not going to give a commentary on the numbers but I have always been clear that I believe in free trade,” Reeves said.Later on Wednesday, appearing at a live event for global investors, Reeves appeared to hint that the UK was indeed prepared to cut import taxes on some US goods to placate Washington.“There are still tariffs, both ways, even before ‘liberation day’, between our two economies. I would like to see those tariffs – and non-tariff barriers – reduce,” she said.Reeves’s cautious tone contrasted withrecent mood musicfrom the government suggesting much of the deal had all but been agreed.Asked about the urgent plight of UK carmakers, Reeves said: “We’re under no illusions about the scale of the challenges that tariffs pose to UK car manufacturers and beyond, which is why we are working to secure a deal.“But I think everybody agrees that the most important thing is that we get the right deal for Britain in our national interest, rather than rush into a poor deal.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionOne British official said the leak of Washington’s demands showed how difficult finalising a deal was likely to be, despite positive remarks from Trump’s vice-president, JD Vance, who said last week there was a “good chance” of agreement.“The recent JD Vance comments got a lot of hares running but things like this show why this deal will be much more complex to agree than lots of people think,” the official said.British ministers presented a draft text of a deal to their US counterparts even before Trump had announced his tariffs. However, the Guardian revealed this week that the agreement does not cover pharmaceutical products. Officials say it will therefore need to be renegotiated, should the president follow through on his promise to target that industry as well.“Our assumptions have had to be reset a few times during this process,” said one Whitehall source, “and they probably will be again.”The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, speaking in Washington, said he and his colleagues were concerned about the risks to economic growth in the UK from the chaos in the global trading system.“We do have to take very seriously the risk to growth,” he said. “Because the UK is such an open economy, so when we do our modelling … we also have to take into consideration the effect on growth in the rest of the world.”Earlier on Wednesday, official figures underlined the perilous fiscal position the government faces. The Office for National Statistics said borrowing in the financial year ending in March was £151.9bn,more than £20bn higherthan in the previous financial year.Asked about the downbeat figures, which prompted some analysts to reiterate warnings that she may have to raise taxes in her autumn budget, Reeves stressed that her fiscal rules were non-negotiable.“The numbers today just reinforce to me the importance that this government is placing on controlling the public finances,” she said.The chancellor announced welfare cuts and reductions to future Whitehall budgets in herspring statement last monthin order to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules.As Reeves prepared to meet her counterparts from a string of other large economies in Washington, shares on global stock markets were soaring after Trump appeared to indicate a softening of his stance on Chinese tariffs.The US presidentsaid he expectedthat tariffs on China would “come down substantially, but it won’t be zero”. Beijing has been facing 145% tariffs and has hit back with 125% levies of its own.The IMF’s spring meetings in Washington opened on Tuesday with astark warningabout the economic impact of the trade war, which the fund said would prompt a “major negative shock”.Later on Wednesday, Trump said that tariffs on Canadian-made cars “could go up” past 25%, adding: “I really don’t want cars from Canada.”Explore more on these topicsTrade policyEconomic policyRachel ReevesTrump tariffsTariffsEconomicsInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Zelenskyy countered by proposing a simple ceasefire without conditions on both sides, though this did not immediately gain any traction from the US.But after a day of speculation and partial disclosure of the terms of the peace proposal, Trump attacked his Ukrainian counterpart for complaining that Kyiv was unwilling to cede Crimea toRussia– the most contentious aspect of the tentative agreement that has leaked so far.US peace plan emerges as freezing of Ukraine frontlines with concessions to PutinRead moreThe US president wrote on social media that “Crimea was lost years ago” in 2014, when Barack Obama was president, and its control “is not even a point of discussion”, an apparent reference to the fact that Ukraine has been unable to recapture it in the three-year war sparked by Russia’s full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.Reports that Washington would be willing to recognise Crimea under Russian control have been circulating for a couple of days. That prompted Zelenskyy to say on Tuesday that “Ukraine will not recognise the occupation of Crimea”, arguing that doing so it would be incompatible with the country’s constitution.Responding to a report of his comments, Trump wrote on Wednesday that “this statement is very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia” and accused the Ukrainian leader of making “inflammatory statements” that “makes it so difficult to settle this War”.“Nobody is asking Zelenskyy to recognize Crimea as Russian Territory,” Trump wrote, implying that US was willing to do so, before accusing Ukraine of failing to defend Crimea. “If he wants Crimea, why didn’t they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?”Later, Trump said he thought Russia had agreed to a deal to end the conflict in Ukraine, with Zelenskyy now the holdout.“I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelenskyy,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskyy. So far it’s been harder.”Russia unilaterally annexed Crimea in March 2014 during a political crisis in Ukraine after the ousting of the country’s pro-Russia president, Viktor Yanukovych. Gunmen seized the regional parliament and airports, and in a subsequent referendum 97% voted to join Russia. The poll was not recognised as legal by the US, UK or EU.Matthew Savill, the director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said that US recognition of Russia’s control of Crimea would be a “de jure recognition of territory taken by force” and amount to “actively endorsing the Russian position in opposition to the European position and Ukrainian politics”.A Ukraine peace summit in London was hastily downgraded on Wednesday morning after Washington said the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, would not be travelling the evening before. Hosted by the UK foreign secretary,David Lammy, the meeting was said to be taking place at the level of officials instead.Downing Street said it had consisted of substantive technical meetings on how to stop the fighting, with Washington’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg; Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, and national security advisers from France and Germany among those present.Vance had earlier called on Ukraine and Russia to accept a US-led peace proposal and threatened that Washington would abandon its effort to end the war – a Trump campaign promise – if it was not accepted.“We’ve issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and the Ukrainians, and it’s time for them to either say yes or for the United States to walk away from this process,” Vance said.1:28JD Vance says Russia and Ukraine must 'both give up territory' for peace – videoThe US proposal would mean “we’re going to freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today”, Vance said, though he added there should be some adjustments. “Now, of course, that means the Ukrainians and the Russians are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own.”A ceasefire on the current frontlines has already been accepted in principle by Ukraine and Zelenskyy called again for an immediate halt to the three-year war. “In Ukraine, we insist on an immediate, full and unconditional ceasefire,” he said, adding that “stopping the killings is the number one task”.Early on Thursday, a missile attack in Kyiv killed at least two people and wounded 54, the capital’s mayor said. Thirty-eight of the injured – including six children – were hospitalised, Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram.Nine people were reportedly killedearly on Wednesday when a Russian drone hit a bus carrying workers in the Ukrainian city of Marhanets – one of 134 large drones that Ukrainian authorities reported had attacked the country overnight.Though Ukraine has indicated it is willing to accept de facto Russian occupation of about a fifth of its territory, arguing that it will reunite the country by diplomatic means eventually, it has refused to accept what would be a domestically unpopular partition by accepting Russia’s formal control of Crimea, even if the recognition came from the US.1:16Russia launches attacks across Ukraine before postponed London peace talks – videoOther anticipated elements of the deal are that Ukraine would be prevented by a US veto from joining Nato, a point largely accepted by a reluctant Kyiv. Another, that future security guarantees would be provided by a UK and French-led “coalition of the willing” made up of 30 countries, has not been accepted by Russia.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia continued to oppose the presence ofEuropean peacekeeping forces, which Ukraine sees as the only viable alternative to Nato membership for ensuring its security.Peskov said there were “many nuances” surrounding negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine and that the positions of the various parties involved had yet to be brought closer – suggesting, from a Russian perspective, that the deal was not yet agreed.Initial reports on Tuesday had suggested Russia was willing to trade territory it does not control in Ukraine – in effect, fresh air – for a US recognition of its seizure of Crimea, in what would be a formal acknowledgment that it is possible to change borders by force, creating an extraordinary post-second world war precedent.Russia may be banking on the idea that Ukraine is weary after more than three years of war and that its proposal is a reasonable counter to western suggestions, backed by the US, Ukraine and Europe, that there should be an immediate and full ceasefire to allow other wider negotiations to take place.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpJD VanceMarco RubionewsShareReuse this content"

He had been recovering from double pneumonia, which had kept him in hospital for five weeks.In keeping withhis requests for simple funeral rites, Francis was dressed in his vestments, holding a rosary, with his open casket lined with red cloth.1:29Thousands pay respects as Pope Francis moved to St Peter's to lie in state – videoUnlike those of most of his predecessors, his coffin, which is being watched over by two Swiss Guards, has not been raised on a platform. That was one of the rituals Francis shunned when he simplified rules for papal funerals last year.His funeral mass will take place at St Peter’s Square on Saturday morning, an event that will be attended by a host of world leaders and royals, including the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, the US president, Donald Trump, and Prince William. He will then be buried at the Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica in Rome’s Esquilino neighbourhood, breaking with longstandingVaticantradition.View image in fullscreenThe Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, paying her respects to Pope Francis inside St Peter’s Basilica.Photograph: Vatican Media Handout/EPAOn Wednesday morning, mourners erupted into a prolonged but sombre applause as Francis’s coffin was carried through the square by pallbearers in a solemn procession involving dozens of cardinals and bishops, and watched over by Swiss Guards.The bells of the basilica gently tolled as a choir chanted psalms and prayers in Latin, repeating the call to “pray for us”.Barriers at the basilica: the logistical challenges of Pope Francis’s funeralRead more“It was the most profound moment,” said Cardinal Thomas Christopher Collins, the former archbishop of Toronto, who was among the procession. “But from the simple prayers to the incense, it was no different to a [funeral] ritual that any baptised person would have.”As of Wednesday night, a Vatican official said almost 20,000 people, from all parts of the world, had joined the queue, which stretched along the road leading to Vatican City, to pay their respects to Francis, many holding umbrellas to shield themselves from the sun.Braced for a long wait, Abigail and her family, from California, brought food. “We’re happy to wait as long as it takes,” she said. “It’s a privilege to be here.”View image in fullscreenThe queue of people outside the basilica waiting to pay respects to the pope.Photograph: Cecilia Fabiano/LaPresse/Rex/ShutterstockIt was only a few days ago that Francis had made his way through St Peter’s Square aboard the popemobile before appearing on the basilica’s central balconyto give a blessing to the crowds gathered for Easter Sunday mass. It was his final public appearance.Even though people were aware that Francis was seriously ill, some of those waiting in the queue to pay tribute were still struggling to digest the fact of his death.“It feels strange that he is no longer with us,” said Piotr Grzeszyk, from Poland.Their shoulders wrapped with the flag of Francis’s native Argentina, Vicky Cabral and her family arrived in Rome from Buenos Aires on Saturday and saw Francis on the balcony the next day.They had been hoping to get another glimpse of him during the now suspended canonisation of Carlo Acutis, which had been due to take place on 27 April.“We came toItalyfor the Catholic jubilee year and for Carlo Acutis,” said Cabral. “But it now feels like a real blessing to be here for this special moment. Francis was a great pope and I think he should be made a saint too.”Once through the huge bronze doors and inside the cavernous basilica, pilgrims fell silent as they shuffled slowly towards the altar.View image in fullscreenThe body of Pope Francis is taken into St Peter’s Basilica.Photograph: Stefano Spaziani/UPI/Rex/ShutterstockFrancesco Catini, who travelled to Rome from Venice, had waited for four hours to see Francis’s body. “It was a beautiful experience,” he said. “To me, Francis was a living example of peace, of love, and especially of humility and solidarity.”Chiara Frassine, from Brescia in northern Italy, had waited a similar amount of time. “I’m very happy to be here,” she said as she left the basilica. “Pope Francis had a pure soul. He was a humble point of reference for many people, not just Catholics.”Not everyone waiting to pay their respects was Catholic. Standing at the end of the queue was Gunnar Prieß, from Germany, who arrived in the Italian capital on Wednesday morning.“I booked a flight only to be here to see this,” he said. “I am not Catholic, but this is so majestic. What we’re seeing here today is the expression of a holy ritual that goes back 2,000 years. There’s an aura in the Vatican and I wanted to experience it.”View image in fullscreenCrowds in St Peter’s Square as the pope’s coffin was taken into the basilica.Photograph: Cecilia Fabiano/LaPresse/Rex/ShutterstockAs the funeral rituals continue, speculation is rife about who will succeed Francis. Some 103 cardinals met on Wednesday evening and approved nine days of mourning from the date of the funeral, with a conclave –the secret election process to choose a new pope– therefore not expected to begin before 5 May.There is no clear frontrunner, although Luis Antonio Tagle, a reformer from the Philippines, and Pietro Parolin, from Italy, who were among the procession, are early favourites.Collins will be involved in the conclave too and, at 78, will be among the 135 cardinals eligible to vote. But he declined to give any hint of who he thought might succeed Francis.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismChristianityReligionThe papacyVaticanItalynewsShareReuse this content"

Change is good, but patient safety must come first | Jeremy HuntRead moreStaff end up fatigued because of long shifts, heavy workloads and a lack of breaks and rest facilities at work, the HSSIB added. But personal issues such as caring responsibilities, menopause, pregnancy and religious practices can also contribute.“Being a doctor typically involves high intensity, time-pressured working patterns. This can lead to sleep deprivation and fatigue, affecting doctors’ health, wellbeing and performance, their safety and that of their patients,” said Dr Latifa Patel, the chair of the British Medical Association’s representative body and workforce lead.“The findings of this report are concerning, but will come as no surprise to the doctors who have faced 13-hour back-to-back shifts with no respite.”NHS trusts and health boards need to do more to improve rest facilities, doctors’ rotas and common room areas, to stop medics getting so exhausted, she added.“This report lays bare the daily reality for nursing staff. They are overstretched, understaffed and regularly work beyond their hours caring for too many patients,” said Patricia Marquis, the Royal College of Nursing’s executive director for England.“This drives dangerous levels of fatigue which not only harms patients but also follows staff home, with sometimes devastating consequences.“Nursing fatigue is deadly and in health and care services should be treated as a public safety emergency.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This government inherited a broken NHS with an overworked, demoralised workforce and this report highlights the profound consequences this can have for patients and staff alike.”They highlighted the pay rises the government gave NHS staff in England and a recent support package intended to improve their working lives, including easier access to flexible working.Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthRoyal College of NursingnewsShareReuse this content"

That leaves some investors reconsidering their US plans for fear of losing money.Last week the Trump administrationordered a haltto work on a new windfarm off the coast near New York owned by the Norwegian company Equinor. “That kind of thing really worries investors,” said one insider. “Nobody knows what will happen next.”On Thursday afternoon, Keir Starmer will address theenergy security summit, which is being held in partnership with the International Energy Agency, He will vow to double down on the UK’s commitments to a low-carbon economy despite attacks on net zero from the Conservatives and Reform UK.Starmer said before the summit’s start: “Let my message to the world go out: come and build the clean energy future in Britain.”Ajai Ahluwalia, the head of supply chain at RenewableUK, a trade association, said: “US companies are already interested in investing in the UK’s rapidly expanding clean energy sector, for example in helping to develop ports for the offshore wind industry.“The global uncertainty currently being caused by President Trump’s ever-changing policies on tariffs, and his opposition to clean energy, mean that the UK has an even greater opportunity than before to provide a stable, attractive market for international investors in renewables.”Labour has pledged £8.3bn to Great British Energy, a nationally owned company that willco-invest in clean energy projectswith the private sector, over this parliament, though this has been called into question as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, takes an axe to spending.The US will send a senior official to the summit, which will take place at Lancaster House in London on Thursday and Friday, but China will skip the event.China’s president, Xi Jinping,attended a small UN online climate meetingon Wednesday with heads of state and the UN secretary general, at which he vowed to press ahead with clean energy despite “some major country’s pursuit of unilateralism and protectionism”.While the renewable energy industry welcomed the government’s measures, wildlife campaigners raised concerns over changes to the planning system designed to streamline new energy and other developments.The government tabled an amendment to its planning and infrastructure bill on Wednesday that would mean less consultation at the pre-application stage for “nationally significant infrastructure projects”.Matt Browne, the head of public affairs at the Wildlife Trusts, said the move was a “misstep” and called for reconsideration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Mike Childs, the head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, said much more effort was needed to insulate draughty homes, as well as to build renewables.“Our country has been held hostage by the yo-yo-ing price of dirty fossil fuels for far too long,” he said.Ed Miliband bows to pressure with ban on solar panels linked to Chinese slaveryRead moreLabour will face opposition to its clean energy plans, and its commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, in the local elections next week.Reform and the Conservatives arelikely to blame net zero for high pricesand the crisis in the steel industry, though experts have said these arethe result of an overreliance on fossil fuels.Rob Gross, a director at the UK energy research centre, said the UK’s electricity costs would begin to fall once it had severed its reliance on gas power plants, which generate the most expensive electricity on the grid and set the overall market price.“If you look across Europe, and you look at the electricity wholesale price, those with the lowest wholesale market prices are those which are least reliant on gas for generation. Those that have the highest prices are those most exposed to gas generation,” he said.“Our reliance on gas for electricity generation has been decreasing steadily as the share of renewables increases, but it will take several more years before we have severed the link to price formation.”Explore more on these topicsRenewable energyEnergy industryGreen politicsEd MilibandLabourEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

GMFRS are likely to remain in attendance overnight while this work takes place.”A spokesperson for Greater Manchester police said officers were supporting colleagues in the fire service as they carried out work after the incident.“The public are asked to avoid the area, and keep their doors and windows closed if nearby,” the spokesperson added.A firefighter at the scene told the Manchester Evening News the vapour cloud was due to a chemical reaction, adding: “There was a strong acid poured into a truck from a site that deals with cleaning metals.“It’s reacted with the truck and created a vapour cloud which has now dissipated.

Or defenders of the “quiet majority”? Either way, the Liberal Democrats are redefining “political battlebus” by proposing a ban onpeople playing music and videos out loudon their phones on public transport.Under the plan, those who blast out songs and TV shows from their phone on public transport, or while at stations or bus stops, could face a maximum fine of £1,000.The party is proposing an amendment to the bus services bill, which is now going through parliament, that would make this an offence. As transport policy is devolved, this would apply toEnglandonly.If the law was changed, the ban would be promoted through a national publicity campaign. Some other countries have already imposed such bans. Earlier this year a manwas fined€200 (£170) by rail staff after making a phone call on loudspeaker in a quiet area of Nantes station in France. He is challenging the penalty.To back up the idea, the Lib Dems commissioned polling that showed 38% of people said they had experienced people playing loud music from their phones often or sometimes, with 28% saying this had happened rarely.The polling, by Savanta, found that 54% of people said they would not feel comfortable asking someone to turn down their music on public transport, rising to 63% among women.Lisa Smart, the party’s home affairs spokesperson, said: “Far too many people dread their daily commute because of the blight of antisocial behaviour – and headphone dodgers playing loud music on buses and trains are some of the worst offenders.“Whether you’re heading to work, taking your kids to school or simply trying to enjoy a moment of peace, everyone deserves to feel safe and respected on public transport.“Time and time again, I hear from people who say they feel too intimidated to speak up when someone is blasting music or other content from a phone or speaker. It’s time to take a stand for the quiet majority who just want to get from A to B in peace.”The Conservatives said they would back the idea, as long as any ban was properly enforced. Gareth Bacon, the shadow transport secretary, said: “Everyone deserves to travel in peace. Playing loud music on public transport may seem like a small thing, but it speaks towards a growing tolerance of antisocial behaviour that chips away at public civility.”Railway bylaws already prohibit antisocial behaviour such as littering and the amendment would set out that music or other loud noise from a phone would also be categorised in the same vein.Explore more on these topicsTransport policyEnglandLiberal DemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

I was frightened to death’Simon BurntonWed 23 Apr 2025 19.01 EDTShareAndrew Flintoff has described his return to cricket as a coach over the past 18 months as “the one thing that saved me” as he struggled to come to terms with the mental and physical scars caused in acar accident during filmingfor the BBC’s Top Gear in December 2022.Flintoff talks for the first time about the accident and its aftermath in a Disney+ documentary to be released on Friday. “After the accident I didn’t think I had it in me to get through,” he says.Andrew Flintoff reveals anxiety after Top Gear accident: ‘I couldn’t get out of the room’Read more“This sounds awful: part of me thinks I should have been killed. Part of me thinks I wish I had died. I didn’t want to kill myself, I won’t mistake the two things. I wasn’t wishing, I was thinking: that would have been so much easier. Now I try to take the attitude, you know what, the sun will come up tomorrow, and my kids will still give me a hug. I feel in a better place now.”For several months after the accident Flintoffrefused to leave his houseexcept for medical appointments. He had taken little involvement in cricket since his retirement in 2010 and move into TV presenting, but it was his sport which eventually coaxed him from seclusion, initially to run a few sessions for the England men’s team in 2023 and then with formal appointments in 2024as coach of England Lions, a B-team largely composed of emerging players, and of theHundred side Northern Superchargers.“If one thing’s come out of it which is positive it’s being back in cricket,” Flintoff said. “It’s probably the one thing that saved me. I’ve been welcomed back into that fold. It’s such a good place. I feel it’s safe. I have moments when I’m sat in a dressing room and I’m watching a game of cricket surrounded by cricketers and friends, and I’m able to forget.”The 47-year-old sustained serious facial injuries when a three-wheeled, open-topped car overturned while he was driving it on a runway at Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey, Top Gear’s regular filming location. “I remember everything about it,” Flintoff says in the documentary.“When I think about it now I’m back in that car. They were showing me how to get the car going sideways. And the wheel came off at the front. It’s a funny thing, rolling a car, because there’s a point of no return, and everything slows down. It’s so weird.“I used to play cricket, and if you bat you get point four of a second to make your mind up where the ball’s going, what shot are you going to play, how are you going to move your feet. And as it started going over, I looked at the ground and I knew if I get hit on the side [of his head], I’m going to break my neck. If I get hit on the temple I’m dead. My best chance is go face down … My biggest fear [afterwards] was I didn’t think I had a face. I thought my face had come off. I was frightened to death.”I still live it every day. Still in the car every night when I go to bed. It’s so vivid. I’ve not slept the same sinceAndrew FlintoffEarlier in the film he says of the accident: “I’m still arranging it in my mind. Still coming to terms with it. I still live it every day. Still in the car every night when I go to bed. And it’s so vivid. I’ve not slept the same since. It’s a movie in my head.”After the accident Flintoff was airlifted to St George’s hospital in Tooting. The film features graphic images of injuries that Jahrad Haq, the surgeon who operated on him, describes as “very complex … In the past 20 years of seeing maxillofacial trauma, probably in the top five”.In 2023 Flintoffreached a settlement with BBC Studios, the commercial subsidiary of the BBC that produced Top Gear, reportedly worth £9m. That November the corporation announced the programme had been cancelled. Flintoff had been co-presenting since 2019, alongside Paddy McGuinness and Chris Harris, with great success: its last series had an average audience of 4.5 million viewers. However, Flintoff feels the presenters’ safety had been put at risk in the desperate attempt to improve ratings.“Everyone wants more. Everybody wants that that thing that nobody’s seen before,” he said. “Everybody wants to dig that a little bit deeper. Everybody wants an exclusive. Everybody wants the biggest stunt. Like: ‘Let’s have that near-miss because that’ll get viewers.’ Everything’s about viewers.

There’s so much music featured in the series that we wanted to take some of that and say to people, ‘Welcome to the world of classical music, you’re already listening to it and loving it without realising it!’” Winkleman will be joined by the BBC Scottish Symphony and the BBC Singers, with other guests and the full programme to be announced. Will season three fan favourite Linda Rands, a retired opera singer, be taking part? Potentially, said Klein.View image in fullscreenCloak and drama … Claudia Winkleman in BBC’s The Traitors.Photograph: Cody Burridge/PASuccessfulBBCbrands will also be giving shape to the children’s concerts: a CBeebies bedtime story prom and the return of the Wildlife Jamboree Prom in Gateshead’s Glasshouse Centre for Music. The Ulster Orchestra will perform a concert celebrating the centenary of the Shipping Forecast with music inspired by the sea and a new work composed and performed by poet laureate Simon Armitage.The Proms 2025 season offers plenty both to cherish and challengeRead moreAnd, although not quite a Proms first (1983’s seasonfeatured an all-night prom of Indian classical music), the first overnight prom of the 21st century will run from 11pm to 7am and, curated and conducted by organist Anna Lapwood, will also feature Japanese pianist and YouTube sensation Hayato Sumino alongside the much loved Norwegian ensemble Barokksolistene. “We want it to be very engaging, there will be a real breadth of repertoire,” said Sam Jackson, the controller of BBC Radio 3 and the Proms. “There’s something very special about classical music at night time. The intimacy of certain repertoire really lends itself to that kind of immersive listening,” he continued. “But the intention is not simply to put people to sleep for eight hours, although audiences can of course come and respond to the music in whatever way you want!” Blankets and pillows will however not be allowed into the Royal Albert Hall, the venue confirmed, nor will the seating be reconfigured.View image in fullscreenNight owl … organist Anna Lapwood at the Royal Albert Hall.Photograph: Sisi Burn/ BBC“The only time Lapwood gets to practice the RAH organ is usually between midnight and four in the morning, because it’s the only time when somebody isn’t getting in or getting out for another gig. She absolutely knows how to unleash energy at that time of the day!” added Klein.Among some notable anniversaries honoured this year, there will be a focus on the music of Shostakovich, who died in 1975, and a complete performance – only the second ever at the Proms – of his opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, with the chorus of the English National Opera. Proms regulars Aurora Orchestra will perform his fifth symphony by heart following a dramatic exploration of its troubled origins and meaning, andChineke!will celebrate their 10th birthday with guest conductor Simon Rattle leading the Black and ethnically diverse orchestra through a programme that includes Shostakovich’s 10th symphony.View image in fullscreenBirthday bows … Chineke! will return to the Proms.Photograph: Mark AllanRavel – born 150 years ago – features on the opening weekend: his Piano Concerto for the Left Hand will be played by Nicholas McCarthy, which will be the first time the concerto has been played at the Proms by a one-handed pianist since it was performed by the man it was composed for, Paul Wittgenstein, in 1932.Boulez, whose centenary is celebrated this year, features in three proms including a late-night one performed by the Ensemble intercontemporain (the group he founded), which places his modernist music alongside Luciano Berio’s, whose centenary it also is.Other international orchestras include the Royal Concertgebouw with their chief conductor designate Klaus Mäkelä, the Vienna Philharmonic, and the Budapest Festival Orchestra. Twenty-five proms will be televised – more than ever before, said Klein. “We had record breaking numbers last year, over 5m streams on BBC Sounds, and across TV and iPlayer we reached nearly 13 million people.”Proms star Elim Chan: ‘Being who you are is powerful. Not all orchestras can take it’Read moreTheRoyal Albert Hallwas full to 96% capacity for evening Proms in 2024, said Jackson. He confirmed that the Last Night will end in its now traditional style, with Rule, Britannia among the closing pieces. “The Last Night always evokes strong opinions and discussion. There are some people for whom it’s a really important tradition, and there are some who say it’s now part of how they would like to celebrate in the summer,” he said. “Our job is to cater for as broad an audience as possible, but also to ask, how can we continue to develop this festival? What can we do differently? How can we introduce new music? And how can we over the course of 86 concerts make sure that there’s a real breadth of repertoire of artists? And then there’s something for everybody.”The Promswill run from 18 July to 13 September.

We have two nuclear-armed neighbours staring at each other,” said the US foreign policy author and South Asia expert Michael Kugelman. “All bets could be off.”Among its first retaliatory moves, India announced the expulsion of the Pakistan high commission’s defence, navy and air advisers; the closure of a critical border trading point; and – for the first time – the suspension of the crucial Indus waters treaty.The treaty governs the shared waters of one of the world’s biggest river systems that affects millions of lives in both countries, and India has never previously put the deal “in abeyance” – even in times of open conflict between the two neighbours.But if the terrorists hoped the assault would win support from Kashmiris or revive separatist sentiment, they miscalculated: more than a dozen Kashmiri groups staged a complete shutdown of stores and businesses to mourn the victims, while local people held protest marches chanting: “Tourists are our lives.”“Kashmiris are genuinely appalled,” said Siddiq Wahid, a professor in the department of international relations at Shiv Nadar University.Militant violence has plagued Kashmir, claimed by both Hindu-majority India and Islamic Pakistan, since an anti-Indian insurgency began in 1989.Thousands have been killed, although violence has tapered off in recent years.In a controversial move in 2019, Narendra Modi’s government revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s semi-autonomous constitutional status, splitting the state into two federally governed territories. The government, known for its embrace of a Hindu-first political agenda, also allowed non-local land ownership to further integrate Kashmir with the rest of India.The security clampdown reduced militant activity and tourism surged – a record 3.5 million people visited the Kashmir valley in 2024. Modi has framed Kashmir’s “normalisation” as a political triumph, saying firm action resolved the separatist issue and made the snow-capped, lush region “open for business”, although there is some local resentment at the heavy militarisation.“Unfortunately, this attack punctures the government’s narrative that things are ‘normal’,” said another Indian security analyst who also requested anonymity.Modi’s swift return from an official visit to Saudi Arabia signals the government’s determination to respond. Pressure is mounting for a strong response to the daylight attack in a heavily militarised zone.Delhi may opt for cross-border strikes, as it did after the 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing that killed 40 Indian paramilitary troops, analysts said.But this time, the victims were not soldiers or security personnel, making the situation even more politically charged.“India cannot twiddle its thumbs. Once the escalatory ladder is revved up, it can go out of hand,” said the security analyst. “You cannot read Modi, you can’t predict the man. He is very muscular,” he added.What heightens the political dynamics of the Kashmir attack is the timing – during a high-level US visit. The US vice- president, JD Vance, on his first official trip to India, emphasised strengthening defence ties and praised India as a strategic partner.In 2002, India and Pakistan came very close to full-scale war aftera terrorist attack on the Indian parliamentin December 2001 that New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based militant groups. The US played a key diplomatic role in de-escalating the crisis.“The messaging we are seeing from senior officials points to the US being fully behind India – and that it would not stand in the way of how India will respond,” Kugelman said.Explore more on these topicsKashmirIndiaSouth and central AsiaPakistananalysisShareReuse this content"

An online community of ‘clusterheads’ are self-experimenting with psilocybin – with promising resultsSammie SeamonWed 23 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTShareView image in fullscreenIllustration: Grace J Kim/The GuardianPeter was working late, watching two roulette tables in play at a London casino, when he felt something stir behind his right eye. It was just a shadow of sensation, a horribly familiar tickle. But on that summer night in 2018, as chips hit the tables and gamblers’ conversation swelled, panic set in. He knew he only had a few minutes.Peter found his boss, muttered that he had to leave, now, and ran outside. By then, the tickle had escalated; it felt like a red-hot poker was being shoved through his right pupil. Tears flowed from that eye, which was nearly swollen shut, and mucus from his right nostril. Half-blinded, gripping at his face, he stumbled along the street, eventually escaping into a company car that whisked him home, where he blacked out.Every day that followed, Peter, then in his early 40s, would experience the same attack at 10am, 2pm and 6pm, like perfect clockwork. “Oh God, here it comes,” he’d think to himself, before fireworks exploded in his temple and the poker stabbed into the very roots of his teeth, making him scream and sometimes vomit.“It just grows, and it thumps, and it thumps, and it thumps with my heartbeat,” said Peter, recalling the pain.Peter had experienced these inexplicableepisodes since he was a kid, always in the summer. An attack left him shaking and exhausted, and waiting on the next bout was a kind of psychological torture – within the short respites, he dreaded the next.Once, when Peter felt one starting, he threw on his shoes and sprinted through the streets of south London. He didn’t care which turns he took. Maybe if he ran fast enough, his lungs full of air, he could outrun the thing. His heart pumped in his chest, more from fear than the exercise itself. When the pain escalated to an unbearable pitch, he slowed to a stop, dry heaving, and sat down to press on his eye. He was three miles away from home.The end-of-life patients finding solace in magic mushrooms: ‘What life after life could be like’Read moreIn 2016, while experiencing attacks that made the wordheadacheseem bitterly inadequate, Peter saw his National Health Service general practitioners three to four times a week. He tried to describe his clockwork cycles, the agony – and they seemed to think that he was making it up. Multiple doctors diagnosed him withchronic migraine, but the migraine medications they prescribed did nothing.“I was getting desperate,” Peter said when we first spoke in November 2023. “I actually told the doctors, after my fourth week of coming back, like, ‘I’m ready to fucking kill myself here. I need someone to take some ownership here, because none of you, none of what you’re doing is helping.’”Finally, Peter paid for a private neurologist who diagnosed him with episodic cluster headache (CH), or what experts have nicknamed “suicide headaches”.Pain is … worse than childbirth or tooth pain … it’s like my head has exploded into an electric stormCH is a rare headache disorder that affects up to 0.1% of the global population. More men are diagnosed with CH than women, though women might bemore likely to be misdiagnosedwith migraine due to their reports of severe pain not being taken seriously. People with CHhave ratedthe pain at 9.7 out of 10 – worse than childbirth at 7.2, a gunshot wound at 6 and a migraine at 5.4. Right now, much of the limited research on CH is happening in the US. Cluster headache patients are20 times more likelyto take their own lives than the US average. More than half of American cluster headache patientshave consideredkilling themselves, andalmost 20%have lost a job due to their debilitating condition.Still, episodes are often dismissed as “just headaches” by family, employers and doctors. Patients see neurologists who aren’t aware that CH exists, and even headache disorder experts still don’t understand how CH operates in the brain – or how to make it stop.Instead of trying to tolerate a level of chronic agony that doesn’t feel survivable, patients with CH have taken to experimenting with their own pain, their own bodies andpsychedelic drugs.Red Bull, masturbation and other desperate measuresOn aRedditforum called r/clusterheads, people with CH from around the world have built a subculture around unconventional home remedies to stop or lessen their pain. Some chug multiple Red Bulls or 5-Hour Energy when they feel one coming on. Others swear by large doses of vitamin D, or dunking their head in a bucket of ice water. Some start masturbating – anything to physically shock their body out of an attack. Many report self-injurious acts in desperate attempts to relieve the pain, like banging the side of their head against a wall. “My wife has to stop me from gouging out my eye with a spoon,” one patient told me.The “clusterheads”, as many people with CH call themselves, post the results of their self-experimentation on the subreddit and compare notes. They commiserate, too.“Mid-30s female. Pain is … worse than childbirth or tooth pain … it’s like my head has exploded into an electric storm,” reads one such post.Caregivers, many of whom are traumatized by having to watch their loved ones in distress, log in seeking advice. Multiple clusterheads write that they have developed a phobia of going to sleep, as attacks often occur at least once at night, thought to be triggered by the REM cycle. When someone writes that they can no longer deal with the pain, others encourage them not to give up. That kind of support can be life-saving – one moderator of the subreddit, who identified himself as Sean L, believes it so crucial that he said he dedicates two to three hours every day to responding and offering advice to suffering clusterheads.View image in fullscreenSophia Lorenzo: ‘Knowing that other people are going through it too, it makes me feel less alone.’Photograph: Resident Psychic/Courtesy of Sophia LorenzoSophia Lorenzo, a DJ in Austin, Texas, found r/clusterheads six years ago and relies on the online community as she lives with episodic CH. “Knowing that other people are going through it too, it makes me feel less alone. Like I’m not crazy. That this will pass. The community has really saved me in more ways than one,” Lorenzo, 36, said.Like Peter, Lorenzo was misdiagnosed with migraine for years by her doctors in Texas, and was prescribed seizure medication that didn’t work. In the midst of unmedicated cluster attacks that made her scream, vomit and black out, she sometimes hit herself on the painful side of her head. “I was violent with myself at first,” she said.On the subreddit, clusterheads discuss treatments for CH: how to obtain a prescription for them, and their shortcomings. High-flow medical oxygen is the only known, reliable method of aborting an attack that works for74% of CH patients. However, many neurologists in the US don’t know how to prescribe oxygen for CH, because it’s not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. When oxygen is prescribed, the tanks are often an out-of-pocket expense that many patients cannot afford. When Lorenzo was at last correctly diagnosed with CH in 2015, the insurance provided by her local musician health alliance did not cover her oxygen.Triptan drugs, a class of migraine medication, can abort CH attacks but are not advisable to take more than10 days a monthfor risk oforgan damage. Lorenzo took triptans regularly for five years until a doctor told her they were damaging her kidney health. Clusterheads also believe that taking triptans for too long can make an episodic patient “go chronic”, eliminating periods of remission between cluster cycles, which is their worst nightmare.In 2019, Emgality became the first-ever drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of both migraine and cluster headache, and it works for many patients. However, some clusterheads say the once-monthly injection can take months to take effect, at which point their CH cycle might already be over.Clusterheads want something that can flip a switch in the brain and turn the clusters off. Presented with less than ideal pharmaceutical options, most are now urging each other to try magic mushrooms.‘Busting’ the cycle with shroomsIn the summer of 2021, Peter’s cycle didn’t stop as it usually did at the six-week mark. The neurologist had prescribed Peter triptan tablets, and he was popping up to three a day to stay semi-functional while holding down his casino job. He had the pills stashed in every jacket, in the pockets of his jeans, in his car’s glove compartment, terrified of an attack starting without having one on hand. Six long months passed.In early 2022, the casino was forced to close its doors, its finances suffering from the pandemic. Peter suddenly had no income, and his marriage felt strained. His wife didn’t understand how he could be so affected by something as mundane as headaches. Peter no longer felt like the same person she had married. She asked him for a divorce, and he moved into a flat outside of London to be closer to his elderly father, whose health was rapidly declining. That summer, he entered the 11th month of his cycle. Over-taking triptans for a six-week episode is one thing – taking them for nearly a year is another, and Peter’s tally was over 1,000 tablets. He felt constantly sick.“For that period of time, the only comfort I had was the thought that, if this gets too bad, I can just end it. And it wasn’t a threat, it was just … a promise of release. I won’t have to go through this anymore,” he said.Alone in his flat, Peter turned to the internet. He soon came across r/clusterheads, and with some shock, realized that these people were experiencing the same thing as him. What’s more, there was a sense of optimism there: multiple clusterheads were happily reporting that they had “busted” their cluster cycles usingmagic mushrooms.Peter hadn’t taken a psychedelic drug since a bad LSD trip at a party when he was 17, but he was prepared to try anything. He found a seller in London and bought 12 grams of dried psilocybe mushrooms. (The possession of magic mushrooms, fresh or not, is illegal in the UK and carries a penalty of up to seven years in prison. For this reason, Peter is using a pseudonym.)Peter planned to follow the busting regimen used by others on Reddit: three low doses, taken five days apart. He took his first two grams of magic mushrooms on a Sunday morning in July 2022. He felt a little odd about using the drug, and promised himself not to enjoy it. He turned on a cricket tournament on the television. The shrooms kicked in, and five or six hours flew by.It affects a small percentage of the population, it is also, as we now know, the single most painful condition on the planetChristopher GottschalkPeter realized that he hadn’t had an attack all day. Pleasantly surprised, he went to bed. To his shock, the next five days passed uneventfully.“Then, I hit it again. This time, I just laid down, listened to music, didn’t give myself such a hard time as before, and it was a bit more enjoyable,” he said. “Not a peep in my head since.”The cycle busted just before its first anniversary.“And with any luck,” Peter said, “I may have conquered this thing.”A scientist takes noteIn 1998, a guy from Scotland with the username “Flash” posted on the early internet forum CH.com that he had taken LSD at a party and then subsequently skipped his next CH cycle. As the sociologist Joanna Kempner chronicles in her2024 bookPsychedelic Outlaws, Flash then tried drinking magic mushroom tea at the beginning of an attack. The pain, to his delight, dissipated within minutes. He posted these findings to CH.com. Others on the forum, skeptical but willing to try it out, began to report similar experiences when they drank magic mushroom tea.Bob Wold, a coach for his kids’ Little League team in Illinois, was living through the depths of a CH cycle when someone from the forum shipped him a box of dried mushrooms. According to Kempner, he steeped them into a tea, watched a mesmerizing Fourth of July firework show, and successfully busted his cycle.In 2002, Wold created Clusterbusters.org – the grandfather forum to the r/clusterheads subreddit – to compile the findings of the community’s self-experimentation with psychedelics. At the time, institutional psychedelic research had been largely abandoned in the US in the wake of the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, which criminalized hallucinogenic drugs likepsilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, MDMA and LSD as schedule 1 controlled substances. Though the group also experimented with LSD and MDMA, they focused most of their energies on magic mushrooms, which carried less societal stigma.View image in fullscreenScientists cannot say for certain why psilocybin might be an effective treatment for cluster headache.Photograph: Moriah Ratner/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesWithin a few years, the community landed on a cycle-busting regimen that seemed to work for most people, most of the time: three doses ranging from just a microdose to three grams of shrooms, taken five days apart, preferably at the outset of an expected CH cycle. Some successfully used the regimen to stay in remission for years.Emmanuelle Schindler, assistant professor of neurology at the Yale School of Medicine and medical director of the Headache Center of Excellence at the nearby Veterans Affairs hospital, was a graduate student studying the pharmacology of psychedelics when she first came across Clusterbusters.org. No one was conducting this level of research within American medical institutions: hundreds of patients using themselves as subjects to test the dosing and timing of psilocybin for best efficacy in aborting CH attacks and cycles, while trying to fix certain variables, like triptan usage. More than stopping attacks as they came, these citizen scientists wanted to “cure” CH itself with psychoactive drugs.Cluster pain attacks the large trigeminal nerve, which snakes from the eye socket down into the jaw, but little else is known about how CH actually works. Schindler found the disorder’s strange patterns fascinating. Why the clockwork episodes? Why do attacks have such a violent onset, only to dissipate completely within 15 to 180 minutes? Why do some people have chronic CH that forgoes episodes altogether?Using Wold’s data, directly sourced from 493 adults with cluster headache on Clusterbusters.org, Schindler co-authored a survey study that found 35.5% of subjects used “illicit substances” to treat themselves. The 2021 study was titledYou Will Eat Shoe Polish If You Think It Would Help.Next, Schindler directed the first-ever randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trial in the US on psilocybin for the treatment of cluster headache patients. The significance of this, for the clusterhead community, cannot be overstated – there were very few studies on CH to begin with and no controlled trials in the US that set out to prove what clusterheads have theorized for decades: that psilocybin is an effective treatment for CH. (Psilocybin is approved for research by the FDA in the US, but not for medical use. Researchers in the UK must apply for a license to use the drug in studies at additional expense and delay.)For thefirst trial, published in November 2022, Schindler gave patients in the midst of a cluster cycle either psilocybin or a placebo, and then tracked their attacks for the next eight weeks. In anextension trial, she repeated the experiment, giving all 10 returning patients psilocybin.Theresultswere highly suggestive: three doses of 10mg of psilocybin taken five days apart – the exact regimen developed by Clusterbusters in the early 2000s – cut patients’ average of 18.4 weekly cluster attacks in half. A small Danishstudypublished in January 2024, using a similar psilocybin dosing regimen, further confirmed Schindler’s results.“Clusterbusters … is how things started, because it certainly didn’t start with me. I’ve had people ask me how I thought of the idea to use psilocybin, but it’s been out there for decades already,” Schindler said.Scientists cannot say for certain why psilocybin might be an effective treatment for CH. But they aren’t exactly surprised that it works for some patients, said Christopher Gottschalk, the chief of neurology at the Yale School of Medicine. Psilocybin activates serotonin receptors in the brain in the same way that triptans and other migraine medications do. Scientists suspect this chemical reaction rewires one’scircadian rhythmin a way that no existing medication can, preventing cycles long-term. Whatever mind-bending trip a patient takes while on the drug seems to be merely a side effect – a fun time, one hopes, but ultimately unnecessary to the treatment. Even amicrodosehas worked for patients. “It’ll probably take the rest of my career to find out how it’s working,” Schindler said.While presenting her research at a New Englandsymposiumfor headache research in March, Schindler told her peers that it was difficult to recruit patients with a rare disorder who were willing to participate in hallucinogenic studies, and discussed the ethical issue in giving patients a placebo rather than treatment as they suffered torturous cluster attacks. She also emphasized the need for continued funding.Since the Trump administration froze funding to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in January, hundreds of studies reportedly have been terminated and the NIH hasannounceda plan to cutbillionsof dollars from labs and universities across the country – including Schindler’s. Gottschalk and others take note when Robert F Kennedy Jr, who now oversees the FDA, expressesenthusiasmfor psychedelic research, though that is hardly a promise of money in the next four years.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators rally during a ‘Kill the Cuts’ protest against the Trump administration’s funding cuts on research, health and higher education at the University of California Los Angeles in April.Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty ImagesSchindler is still applying for NIH funding. But even before the cuts, she relied on grants from private foundations with interest in psychedelics to support her work because funding for headache disorder research is simply hard to obtain.If NIH funding should be doled out proportionately to make the biggest impact for the most Americans, then research on migraine – the leading cause of disability for young women – is currently funded 10 times less in the US than it should be, according to Gottschalk. That makes CH all the more underfunded.“In the last 25 years, the NIH has contributed something like less than $20m to anything even remotely related to cluster headache, which is crazy considering that, although, yes, it affects a small percentage of the population, it is also, as we now know, the single most painful condition on the planet,” Gottschalk said.On 18 March, 250 cluster headache and other headache disorder patients gathered on the Capitol steps in Washington DC for Headache on the Hill, an annual event put together by the Alliance for Headache Disorders Advocacy (AHDA) and Clusterbusters. One mother flew in from Texas with her young daughter, who has suffered multiple headache disorders since she was a toddler. In a Texas congressman’s office that afternoon, the group asked a staffer for the representative that $30m in NIH funding be given to Headache Centers of Excellence across the US, like Schindler’s, for research. The staffer told the group that he would pass their ask along, and said that the Trump administration might have “made a mistake” in cutting NIH funding so severely from US labs.Later, in a small discussion group of about 30 non-migraine headache disorder sufferers, someone asked who had been diagnosed with PTSD due to the pain they lived through. Almost everyone raised their hand.‘We need professionals’Several hours after Schindler presented her research at the symposium, Wold took the stage in a baseball cap to receive a lifetime achievement award for his contributions to headache disorder research. He recounted a story about a frustrated doctor who, having exhausted his list of medications, prescribed a .357 revolver to his friend with cluster headache. He implored the audience of New England scientists to study psychedelics for CH.Some attendees at the symposium think the FDA might be more receptive to considering a non-hallucinogenic drug, such as BOL-148. Essentially LSD engineered to be non-hallucinogenic, the compoundwas firsttestedin Germany in 2010 to treat CH. When administered the drug three times, five days apart, four out of the five participating CH patients went into remission.As nice as the citizen science part of it is, we need professionals to give us definitive advice. And that, as drastic as it sounds, would save livesPeterDMT vape pens, an increasingly popular psychedelic, were also of interest. Reports have circulated r/clusterheads and Clusterbusters, especially in the past year, claiming that one or two puffs can abort a cluster attack in less than one minute. Four different people with CH who tried vaping DMT told me the same (in confidence, as DMT is an illegal drug in the US and UK). CH patients say they are increasingly using DMT as their abortive and psilocybin as their preventative. Once again, Schindler will collaborate with citizen scientists to conduct a survey study, this time on DMT use.Wold isn’t any more optimistic that magic mushrooms will be approved by the FDA to treat CH than he was 25 years ago. Even if they were, how helpful would the FDA’s approval be for CH patients? The FDA’sdrafted guidancefor the clinical use of psilocybin, which suggests how it might be regulated for public use in the future, recommends that two trained professionals are present to administer the drug. Wold emphasizes that CH patients would need it on demand and at home to be effective.However, many argue that until psilocybin is approved for medical use, it will never be an equitably accessible solution. Many US patients fear a misdemeanor charge for possession of psilocybin, or a felony charge for cultivation – a fear echoed in other countries including the UK. Kempner and people within the community point out that those publicly discussing their at-home psychedelic use are disproportionately white, and therefore less likely to be targeted by law enforcement than Black and brown CH patients.Wold estimates that about half of the CH community still refuses to try psychedelics or any other drug that is not approved by the FDA and prescribed by a doctor. This stance is understandable, and one Peter shares. When he’s holding a bunch of dried mushrooms in his hand, guessing at the amount of pure psilocybin they contain, he would prefer that a doctor, not a person on Reddit, tell him how much to take.“As nice as the citizen science part of it is, we need professionals to give us definitive advice. And that, as drastic as it sounds, would save lives,” Peter said.A walk in the woodsEvery six months, in the summer and winter, Peter takes shrooms. He hasn’t had a single CH cycle since he busted his 11-month episode three years ago. Nevertheless, years of unmedicated cluster attacks took a toll, and Peter is currently in treatment for complex PTSD.“I didn’t know why I couldn’t enjoy things anymore,” he said. “I find myself either in fight or flight, either angry or scared all the time. I don’t find a middle ground where I’m content or happy.”Peter believes he has lost mental function due to overmedicating for almost a year with triptans. He often breaks off mid-sentence in conversation, and tries to scribble down the thought with pencil and paper before it dissipates into air. “I can’t hold a thread of thought for longer than 10 or 15 seconds anymore,” he said.Apart from the clusters, Peter hopes the magic mushrooms will also do something to ease the symptoms of his PTSD and anxiety that he feels.For his next dose, in June, Peter plans to take two grams of golden teachers and walk over to the woods by his place. He’ll put in headphones and play a song he enjoys. When the shrooms kick in, light will trace itself across his line of vision, as if through the slow exposure of a camera shutter. As his eyes follow the path, something behind them will soften. The color of the leaves will flicker, and nothing will hurt.Sammie Seamon is a writer and MFA candidate at New York University.

Warning: there will be tears and travel disastersHannah J DaviesWed 23 Apr 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 17.22 EDTShareIt’s hard to believe that Race Across the World has only been on TV since 2019, so integral is it to the BBC’s springtime schedules. In six short years, the reality competition has become a flagship format, skipping over from BBC Two to BBC One and scooping up Baftas for both its civilian and celebrity series, which airs in the autumn. And so to a fifth adventure for Britain’s bravest normies, who are dumped at a far-flung location and told to make it to another, via a series of hard-to-reach checkpoints. As always, they’re given the price of an air fare between the start and finish lines, which has to cover bed, board and transport for two whole months, with the possibility of earning some extra dosh by working strenuous jobs such as cleaning or working in kitchens. And, as ever, the cracks begin to show slowly – then all at once – for the pairs.There are some firsts this time around. If you thought 20-year-olds Owen and Alfie fromthe last serieswere young, get ready for teenage couple Fin and Sioned, who at 18 and 19 are the show’s youngest ever contestants. Yin and Gaz are also the show’s first separated couple, and the story of their against-the-odds relationship and subsequent split unfurls in shocking fashion over the first episode. While this revelation shattered any remaining belief I had in the power of love, next week’s second episode does well to provide more context to their split – and hopefully to stop random people across the country (and by that, I mean me) petitioning to get them back together.View image in fullscreenOn your marks … Race Across the World.Photograph: BBC/Studio LambertSome things, of course, remain the same. We’ve got Elizabeth and Letitia, who are siblings on a quest to get to know one another better; Caroline and Tom, a mother and son duo also on a quest to get to know one another better; and sexagenarians Brian and Melvyn, who are there to remind us that life experience can be a major attribute in this game. They’re also – would you believe it – siblings on a quest to get to know one another better, and haven’t holidayed together since the 70s.We’re in Asia for this new race, with the teams heading across China and Nepal to the tip of India, covering a total distance of 14,000km. It quickly becomes clear that Letitia has an advantage, having previously lived in China for six months and speaking a basic level of Mandarin. I can already feel the tabloid heat this is likely to attract (a young, well-educated black girl who speaks Chinese? Travelling to a destination pre-chosen by a TV production company, which happens to be China? Outrageous!) but I am quietly hopeful that they’ll be too dazzled by Letitia’s instant grit and smarts to do a hatchet job on her. Meanwhile, Brian and Melvyn are straight out of the gate and ready to go … before they stop for cake, clearly ready to Graze Across the World.View image in fullscreenOn a quest to get to know each other better (of course!) … Elizabeth and Letitia in Race Across the World.Photograph: BBC/Studio LambertAll the teams have teething issues, but Caroline and Tom are the first to crack, tearful and overwhelmed before they’ve even reached the first checkpoint. Like Alexander Dragonetti – the plummy people’s champ from the most recent series of The Traitors – you get the sense that Caroline and Tom know their way around a Fortnum & Mason hamper. But they’re also quite genuine, and their honesty might be their secret weapon, with Caroline, a housewife, keenly admitting that people have long underestimated her at home.Brian is quite honest, too, but in a way that has the potential to grate. He’s used to living in the lap of luxury, thanks to his success as a businessman (which he mentions a lot). His wife, he says, has warned him not to come across as too pompous; hopefully, as he continues to bond with the more down-to-earth Melvyn, this will subside. Or maybe there will be some horrifying sob story in a later episode that will make us regret ever having rolled our eyes as he harped on about his love of Michelin-starred restaurants.Race Across the World isn’t exactlyThe X Factorin that regard, but we do get potted histories peppered throughout the series. For Fin and Sioned that mostly means soundbites about how huuuuuuuge China is compared to Wales. Hopefully they will get to discuss something else that isn’t Wales-related as the series continues.Of course, nothing goes to plan – but, as always, the joy comes from watching the pairs come way out of their comfort zones and bask in new experiences. Or, as Letitia puts it while working on a farm: “If I wasn’t being stabbed every three seconds by the thorns, it would actually be quite relaxing.”Race Across the World airs on BBC One and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewReality TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

Since that day in 1954, when Bannister achieved a feat many had thought was impossible, just over 2,000 others have followed in his footsteps – all of them men.However, the pages of history could soon be freshly rewritten after the Olympic 1500m champion, Faith Kipyegon, and her sponsorsNike, announced plans “to make the impossible possible” again by becoming the first woman to run a sub-four-minute mile this summer.The Kenyan, who is widely regarded as the greatest female ­middle-distance runner of all time, holds the mile record of 4min 07.64sec. And while cutting nearly eight seconds off that mark would appear to be ­extraordinarily difficult, she will be armed with the next generation of super shoes and the assistance of male pacers to help her achieve her goal.“I’m a three-time Olympic ­champion. I’ve achieved world ­championship titles,” said Kipyegon. “I thought: ‘What else? Why not dream outside the box?’ And I told myself: ‘If you believe in yourself, and your team believes in you, you can do it.’”“I want this attempt to say to women: ‘You can dream and make your dreams valid,’” added the 31-year-old, who will make her attempt at the milestone on 26 June at the Stade Charléty in Paris. “This is the way to go as women, to push boundaries and dream big.”View image in fullscreenFaith Kipyegon will make her attempt at the milestone on 26 June at the Stade Charléty in Paris.Photograph: NikeNike is calling her attempt “Faith Kipyegon vs the 4-Minute Mile” and while most experts believe she is up against it, the US sportswear brand does have form when it comes to what it calls “moonshots”.In 2017 there was also considerable scepticism when Nike announced that another Kenyan, Eliud Kipchoge, would attempt “breaking two” – to run a marathon in under two hours at the Monza Formula One race track.And while hefell just shorton that occasion, two years later he went on torun 1:59.40 in Vienna– albeit in an event that did not count under World Athletics rules as he used 41 ­pacemakers, who subbed in and out of the run to help him draft and reduce wind resistance.Kipyegon will adopt similar ­tactics for her attempt, with a recent ­scientific paper suggesting that she “could run 3:59.37 with drafting ­provided by one pacer in front and one in back who change out with two other pacers at 800m”.Further help will come in the form of the next generation of super shoes, which are currently being tested by Nike athletes. As Trevor Painter, coach of the Olympic 800m gold medallist Keely Hodgkinson, told the Guardian: “Nike’s tech team came out to South Africa earlier this year to show us samples of what’s to come. Next year there’s a new shoe coming out which is like: ‘Wow, this is a bit of space age.’ It will shave tenths off track times, no doubt.”View image in fullscreenFaith Kipyegon celebrates winning the gold medal and setting a Olympic record in the women’s 1500m at the 2024 Paris Olympics.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianStill, the challenges Kipyegon faces are considerable. Typically an ­athlete has to be capable of ­running an 800m in 1.52 or 1.53 to run under four minutes for a mile, while the ­Kenyan’s personal best is 1.57. Even with better shoes and better ­drafting, she needs to cut a ­substantial amount of time. It makes it look less like a moonshot and more like trying to make it to Mars.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You start by calling your moonshot,” it added. “And as ­moonshots go, Faith Kipyegon’s is as audacious as they come.”Meanwhile, Seema Simmons, Nike’s vice-president of global ­women’s running, told the Guardian that she saw parallels with Kipchoge’s sub-two-hour marathon attempt and what Kipyegon is hoping to achieve.“I was here in 2017 and you have that same daring spirit,” she said. “We have an athlete that is ­determined and has an audacious goal to break barriers. And then from our side, we’re committed to making sure that we provide that advanced ­innovation, holistic support, and the ideal conditions to push the potential of human limits.”Whatever happens, Kipyegon is likely to capture plenty of hearts and headlines. And while her attempt is being conducted outside World ­Athletics’ rules, if such an ­insurmountable barrier does come crashing down, that fact will be a mere footnote amid the noise.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsNikeKenyanewsShareReuse this content"

Three teachers reveal allAmelia TaitWed 23 Apr 2025 10.48 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 12.21 EDTShareWhen English teacher Joe Scott used to sign homework planners, it was because students were in trouble. But things changed in January, when the Southampton-based secondary schoolteacher appeared in the latest series of the BBC reality showThe Traitors. Pupils started voluntarily pressing their planners into his hands – for autographs. “It felt funny,” says the 38-year-old. “It was such a juxtaposition.”Teachers have always gone on reality TV – but they haven’t always come off well. In 2001, a contestant on the second series of Big Brother wasfiredfrom her job at an east London girls’ school after her towel slipped on air. Six years later in 2007,parents complainedafter an American elementary school teacher missed 22 days of work to appear on The Bachelor. Just last year, a Canadian educator waslet goafter taking unauthorised leave to compete on Survivor.A pupil wrote a message on the whiteboard: ‘Seriously congratulations, we are all so proud of you, you D-list celebrity’Expulsions like these make for explosive headlines, but like Scott, many teachers do in fact return to the classroom after appearing on reality TV. What is it like to try to discipline teenagers after they’ve watched you lose a gameshow or snog a stranger?“I was mindful that I needed to act in a certain way because I knew my pupils would be watching,” says Scott, who was in teacher training and working at a placement school when he applied for The Traitors. Handily, the show’s shooting schedule coincided with the school holidays, but he says BBC rules dictated that police officers, medical professionals, prison workers and teachers had to inform their employers they were going on the show. He told the headteacher his plans.View image in fullscreen‘I only swore once’ … Joe Scott on The Traitors.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio Lambert“They were so supportive, they said it would be good to show the pupils that as teachers we do have a life outside the classroom,” Scott says. Nonetheless, the school wrote him a letter of dos and don’ts: don’t name the school, and definitely don’t name any pupils. Scott told himself not to swear during the show’s heated “round table” arguments – but naturally the one time a curse slipped out, it was aired. “I thought, ‘Oh, I’ve been so good! And that’s the bit that gets shown!’”Today, Scott is permanently employed at his placement school. Students only found out he was going to be on the show when the general public did – the school then sent an email to parents so they wouldn’t be shocked to see their child’s English teacher pop up on the telly. Almost immediately, Scott’s pupils went into “game mode”, dissecting the episodes after they aired. “As opposed to being like, ‘Oh my God sir, you’re on TV!’ it was more like, ‘Oh my God sir, do you not know Linda’s a traitor?’”Scott survived for 10 of the 12 episodes, but – perhaps overestimating how life-changing theprize moneywould be – students surmised that he couldn’t have won, or he wouldn’t still have been standing in front of them. Scott implemented a routine where he would take the register and allow pupils to ask questions about the show for a couple of minutes before he began teaching. He says this “outlet” was better than the “constant disruption” of questions popping up during class. “And then as it went on, they stopped asking. It was quite humbling. One of my classes, I said, ‘Right, any questions?’ and someone put their hand up and said, ‘Sir, is there a new seating plan?’”Unfortunately for Scott, the general public were a lot more vocal than his pupils. Tweets with thousands of likes branded him “one of the worst people to ever be on The Traitors”, while posters on Reddit objected to his “sneering, aggressive tone”. Some even claimed he couldn’t possibly be a good teacher.“It did affect my confidence at one point,” Scott says. “I know I’m not like that, but then you almost start believing what you’re reading.” Scott spoke with his headteacher as well as the BBC’s welfare team. He reminded himself that no students had ever complained about his conduct – and in fact, some became protective when they saw the online hate. “Because they all know me and my character, they know what people were saying wasn’t an accurate representation.”View image in fullscreen‘If anything, I felt like they were even more invested’ … Scott takes on a challenge.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertScott says the show hasn’t affected his ability to discipline his pupils. It’s easy to imagine an impish whippersnapper sneering, “Whatever, you lost The Traitors!” when being told off, but Scott says nothing like this has happened to him. In fact, he feels better able to command respect. “If anything, I felt like they were even more invested than usual, I held their attention even more. It seemed to go to my advantage.”Kai Fagan, a 26-year-old PE teacher in Milton Keynes, won the ninth season ofLove Islandin 2023. Although he quit his secondary school job to appear on the dating show, he resumed teaching at a different college in 2024. “I woke up really early because I was nervous, I was so anxious,” he says of his first day. “My students were shocked, but I just addressed it straight away.” Like Scott, Fagan offered the opportunity to ask questions. “But then I also made it clear exactly what I expected from running the lessons, to not be disrespectful.”During his time on Love Island, Fagan “coupled up” with five women and took part in so-called “raunchy” challenges; naturally, he was also frequently filmed with his top off. “None of the [students] have ever asked me about any of the challenges,” he says. “They just don’t care.” Fagan thinks this is partly because his students are all over 16 and are learning in a college environment where they are treated like adults. He also believes it’s because he is the same person, whether on TV, online or in the classroom. “If you show people exactly who you are and what you stand for, they can’t really laugh at you. They can only laugh if you’re completely different and you’re putting on a different persona.”Like Scott, Fagan reports no issues with discipline and even thinks his time on the show (and his work as an influencer) has engendered respect. Now, he can teach students about more than just PE. “I’m a massive advocate for social media. So if they have a passion, how can they differentiate themselves? If you want to be a football analyst, why don’t you do some football analysis on TikTok? If you want to become a football journalist, why don’t you do some match reviews?”View image in fullscreen‘Draining’ … Grace Elliott, right, and her sister on Hunted.Photograph: Channel 4/ShineWhile it’s hard to imagine reality TV experience benefiting, say, geography lessons, it’s easy to see how it might be useful in drama class. Scott teaches drama once a week and has been able to introduce games inspired by the show. Grace Elliott, a 27-year-old drama teacher based in Berkshire who appeared on the Channel 4 show Hunted in 2022, found benefits, too. “All the time in drama, we’re pushing students out of their comfort zones. That’s how we grow as performers,” she says. Whenever pupils seem reluctant to get up on stage, she has a ready retort. “I’m like, ‘Well, I went on telly for 16 days. I wasn’t in my comfort zone for any part of that at all!’”Contestants on Huntedhave to go on the run and evade being captured: “You don’t know when you’re next going to get a meal or water, or where you’re going to sleep, and it is mentally draining,” says Elliott. When the show came out, she was honest with her students about how challenging she found it as well as her previous experiences with ill mental health. She initially worried that pupils might think, “Oh, my teacher is not as strong as I thought she was,” but she now believes it was beneficial for them to see her overcoming low moments. And as a result, “Now I’m locked into Duke of Edinburgh for life!”When Elliott ultimately lost the show, a pupil wrote a sweet message on her whiteboard: “Seriously congratulations, we are all so proud of you, you D-list celebrity.” Her students even monitored social media so she didn’t have to, saying: “Don’t worry, we’ll keep an eye on all the comments for you and shut down any trolls.’” Mums and dads were positive too, congratulating her at parents’ evening.Elliott says it was a valuable experience for her pupils to see that she was a real person with her own life. “They can talk to you about things, they’ll open up to you about things, and that’s how they’ll learn from you,” she says. Although, as time goes by, younger cohorts don’t necessarily recognise her. Scott only appeared on TV two months ago, and already the students’ requests to autograph homework planners have stopped. “They don’t really mention it now,” he says. “It’s yesterday’s news. Back to normality.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionReality TVThe TraitorsLove IslandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Cue a slanging matchWed 23 Apr 2025 13.12 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 21.30 EDTShareYou could see this one coming from a long way off. On the day after the International Monetary Fund lowered its growth forecast for the UK by 0.5%. On the day when it was announced that UK government borrowing was £15bn more than expected. On the day when the US wandered out of the latest efforts to end the war in Ukraine.Yup, you’ve guessed it.Kemi Badenochwasn’t interested in any of this. Yawn. Boring. Who really cares if the economy is in trouble or that the world is in crisis? Instead the leader of the opposition devoted all six of her questions to stoking a culture war. On social media and in the Telegraph, Kemi is a culture-war hero. Her specialist subject? Who should, and who should not, be in possession of a penis in a public toilet.Kemi had been so desperate to have her say on Tuesday that she had insisted on personally answering Bridget Phillipson’s statement on last week’s supreme court’s ruling on the definition of a woman. You’d have thought Kemi would then have had a chance to say everything she wanted to say. Would have purged her soul and attempted to move on.But her worldview is shaped by this culture war. Everything is refracted through the prism of biological sex. It’s not enough for her that the supreme court has decided in her favour. She will not rest until her opponents have had their noses ground in the dirt. Winning is not enough. The victory too fleeting. There has to have been some suffering to make the fight worthwhile.From the off, KemiKaze wasafter an apology from Keir Starmer. She had been right all along and he had been wrong on his previous pronouncements on cervixes and penises. He couldn’t expect to get off the hook that easily. He didn’t get to dig himself out of a hole that easily. There was no Year Zero here. No easy transition to saying the supreme court was right. He had to prostrate himself. Publicly chastise himself for his past wrong thinking.To be fair, the leader of the opposition wasn’t entirely wrong. Starmer has been on quite the journey on trans rights and his current position is totally at odds with what he was saying a few years ago. From trans rights to gender critical. Though you get the feeling his previous statements in favour of trans rights were more to keep the Labour party sweet.It would obviously have been a lot easier if Keir had made an apology. Given an interview in which he explained how he had come to change his mind. Politicians love a journey and the public quite like a politician who can admit he got something wrong. And it’s not in the same league as tanking the economy. But Starmer’s psyche won’t allow this. He’d rather look a bit stupid than open to shifting his opinion.So the exchanges between Keir and Kemi quickly turned into a slanging match. Kemi continuing to pointlessly demand a public retraction and show trial. Starmer just brazening it out with the help of some mild insults. At one point, it felt as if Badenoch might self-combust.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Tory leader takes a far greater interest in independent MPs than she does in her own backbenchers. Rosie scowled theatrically.This was another apology Starmer was unwilling to make. Instead he turned his attention on Badenoch’s record in government as equalities minister. What had women got to show for her two years in the hot seat? How come she had never bothered to get a supreme court ruling on sex and gender? Keir seemed to think the judgment – grateful as he was for it because it had saved him an awkward row with his own party – was all his own work, rather than one initiated in the Scottish courts.Starmer went on to list other Tory failures. At the same time as calling forthe heat to be taken out of the situationand for trans rights not to be used as a political football. He had a dig at Robert Jenrick, who had been overheard calling for a coalition between the Tories and Reform. Kemi was already yesterday’s woman. Her party was dying on its feet and she would be lucky to last the year as its leader. It was hard to dismiss this as wishful thinking. Though maybe better left unsaid. Hubris is not a good look.This was the point when Kemi lost it. “You should be more worried about your own backbenchers than you are about my frontbench,” she declared. Not exactly a vote of confidence in her shadow cabinet. Chris Philp looked taken aback. Not even his party leader took him seriously. Still, at least people knew who he was. More than could be said for some other frontbenchers. Much like the rest of us, some have no idea who they are.For much of the rest of the session, Duffield bobbed up and down, hoping to catch the Speaker’s attention. Starmer’s answers became longer and more detailed as he tried to delay a public confrontation with one of his fiercest critics. It worked. Lindsay Hoyle bestowed a kindness on the prime minister, having effectively silenced Duffield.PMQs was over.

Without a doubt, mine would be mascara. It’s the most transformative beauty staple. Defining your lashes has literally eye-opening results, making them appear bigger and brighter.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If the questions I’ve been asked as a beauty editor are anything to go by, even those who consider themselves low-maintenance usually own a mascara:requests for mascara recommendations are by far the most common. It seems no one is immune to how effortlessly eye-framing a few coats can be.Recommending the best mascara, however, isn’t straightforward. A one-type-suits-all mascara doesn’t exist, so the performance of mascaras often divides people. The key is to work out what your lashes’ needs are: are you looking for volume, length, lift, curl or something else? Whatever your requirement, you’ll find a recommendation here that suits you.At a glanceBest overall:Giorgio Armani Vertigo Lift mascara£29 at John LewisBest budget mascara:L’Oréal Paradise Big Deal mascara£8.39 at AmazonBest for length:Lancôme Lash Idôle Flutter Extension mascara£28 at John LewisBest for volume:Too Faced Better Than Sex mascara£25.36 at SephoraBest brown mascara:Maybelline Lash Sensational Sky High mascara£12.99 at Look FantasticWhy you should trust meI’m an experienced beauty editor, but I still get as excited about the launch of a mascara as I did whenever I got away with wearing my mum’s to school. It was the 90sMaybelline Great Lashin the pink tube, if you’re wondering.My naturally short, straight and blond lashes do nothing to highlight my eyes, so I was obsessed with trying different mascaras far before it became my job 16 years ago. I can honestly say there are few mascaras sold in the UK that I haven’t put to the test. It would definitely be my desert-island beauty item: yes, even ahead ofSPF. Don’t judge!How I testedView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sabine WieselThere are hundreds of mascaras sold in the UK, and throughout my time as a beauty journalist I’ve tried the majority. For the purpose of this piece I retested my 25 favourite high-street and high-end buys, plus five of the latest launches, of which a few made the cut below.Whittling these down to the 10 best was tough, though, especially since brands such as Lancôme, L’Oréal and Maybelline make more than one outstanding mascara each. It took a long time – not just to test the mascaras, but also to make up my mind – to get to this elite edit of the best mascaras around.The best mascara in 2025View image in fullscreenGiorgio Armani Vertigo Lift mascara.Photograph: Sabine WieselBest overall:Giorgio Armani Beauty Vertigo Lift mascaraView image in fullscreen£29 at John Lewis£23.20 at Look FantasticArmani Beauty’s launches keep on impressing me, especially this new lifting and lengthening mascara. After a quick read of its promises, I expected it to elongate my lashes for a feathery lash result, but it delivered so much more.Why we love itThis mascara is as close to a suits-all multipurpose wand as you’re going to find. The curved silicone brush allows you to really get into the lash line, and a few quick wriggles will coat each hair thoroughly from root to tip. The closer you can get to the root, the longer your lashes will look, as well as being lifted and thicker in a clump-free natural-looking way. It’s an eye-awakening result, which perks up the look of my tired eyes every time I use it.Its formula is easy to build up, too. Wear just a layer or two for a day of meetings, then turn up the intensity for the evening with a few more layers – without any chance of lashes clumping together. Once the formula sets, it doesn’t budge or smudge, so there’s no chance of panda eyes.It’s a shame that …you have to work the formula quickly before it dries.Lash effect:lifting, lengthening and natural volumisingVegan:noShades:black onlyBest budget mascara:L’Oréal Paradise Big Deal mascaraView image in fullscreen£12.99 at Boots£8.39 at AmazonMaking some of the best mascaras on the high street, L’Oréal could easily have featured a few times in this roundup – including with its originalTelescopic mascara, for lengthening short lashes, andLash Paradise, for volumising. However, this new wand is my favourite, offering long-lasting length and volume.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sabine WieselWhy we love itI fell for this mascara at first swipe. It’s faff-free: I didn’t have to figure out how to use it. The silicone brush is curved to fit neatly into the lash line, making it easy to get right down to the base, while the varying sizes of comb teeth grab and separate each lash.A few seamless strokes later, I was wowed to see how much longer and naturally fuller my lashes looked in a quick mirror inspection. However, what really makes this a standout mascara is how buildable it is without any dreaded clumping. Three strokes are ideal for daywear, but you can carry on layering to get a little more intensity.It’s a shame that …it’s available only in black, but hopefully a brown shade won’t be far behind.Lash effect:lengthening and volumisingVegan:noShades:black onlyBest for length:Lancôme Lash Idôle Flutter Extension mascaraView image in fullscreen£21 at Lancôme£26 at Look FantasticFrom the cult classic volume-buildingHypnôse mascarato the more eye-opening drama ofLash Idôle, I’m not exaggerating when I say the French beauty brand Lancôme has mastered mascara. My goodness, the lash experts have outdone themselves once again – this time with a wand made for lengthening.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sabine WieselWhy we love itI’ve repeatedly returned to Lancôme’s impressive collection of mascaras because they never let me down for easy, clump-free application and all-day staying power without smudging or flaking. This new formula is no exception.Like the classic Lash Idôle, it separates each lash effortlessly, creating a fanned-out flutter. I presume this is why it comes under the same branding. Where it differs, though, is how well it stretches the lashes naturally.It’s the skinny brush that adds to its success: if you have short lashes as I do, it makes it easy to precisely get into each and every lash-root and coat the entire hair out to the end. It has more than 480 micro bristles, too, so it’s impossible to leave even the tiniest of hairs behind.It’s a shame that …Lancôme didn’t stick to the chic, glossy packaging of its classic mascaras. The rose gold colourway looks a little cheap – which I know is a superficial point.Lash Effect:lengtheningVegan:noShades:black onlySunscreen and snail slime: what skincare experts do – and don’t do – to their skinRead moreBest for volume:Too Faced Better Than Sex mascaraView image in fullscreen£28 at Cult Beauty£28 at Look FantasticIf you prefer a dramatic look, you need a volumising mascara, and this cheekily named wand from Too Faced is still unmatched for building that false-lash effect without noticeable clumps.Why we love itThe problem with volumising mascaras is they are prone to clumping, making lashes stick together or creating a fake spidery effect – but this does none of that. The key is to stick to a maximum of three coatings – even one (as pictured) will be enough to thicken and curl beautifully.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sabine WieselIt builds fuller lashes in seconds, and they last all day. That’s because of its workable formula, but also its gamechanging wand. The hourglass bristle brush wasinspired by the curves of Marilyn Monroe– which may sound gimmicky, but it is so effective at covering and sculpting lashes that other brands have gone on to imitate it.It’s a shame that …the oversize brush makes it impossible not to smudge on to hooded eyes when applying, so I do always need a cotton bud on standby.Lash effect:dramatic volume and curlVegan:yesShades:black and brownBest brown mascara:Maybelline Lash Sensational Sky High mascaraView image in fullscreen£12.99 at Look Fantastic£6.63 at AmazonMaybelline is renowned for its impressive back catalogue of mascaras to suit every type of lash, but this one manages to stand head and shoulders above the rest – and not just because of its name. It’s an almost do-it-all mascara, delivering length, volume and a separated, fanned-out effect. It’s available in an impressive shade range, too, including the natural-looking true brown, which is my go-to.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sabine WieselWhy we love itThis formula has gone viral several times on social media – from its first launch to itseye-popping burgundy shade– and for good reason. I’m just here to add to the hype. Every time I come back to this mascara, I’m reminded how effortlessly the flexible, tapered silicone brush coats from root to tip, giving my short lashes length and wow factor, and adding volume thanks to tiny fibres in the formulation.A variety of shades have been launched, including pink (if you’re brave enough). I find its true brown to be the best for everyday wear or for softer, no-makeup makeup looks.It’s a shame that …it tends to drop and flake by the end of the day.Lash effect:lengthening and volumisingVegan:noShades:black, blue, brown, burgundy, green, pink, plum and space diamondThe best of the restMac MacStack waterproof mascaraView image in fullscreen£26 at John Lewis£27 at MacBest for:a waterproof mascaraskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Mac says it’s “endlessly buildable” and I think that’s right: I once got up to 40 coats before lashes started to clump and stick together. However, three coats will be enough to give you a well-defined, fuller and thicker lash line.Its waterproof formula allows you to dial up the drama with the silicone, tapered brush, safe in the knowledge that it won’t budge. I’ve tested it on a beach holiday, and found that water, sweat and even tears are no match for this mascara.It didn’t make the final cut because …prolonged waterproof mascara can dry out your lashes, so use it only for special occasions, holidays, workouts and heatwaves.Lash effect:volumising, lengthening and lifting;vegan:no;shades:black onlyDior Diorshow Iconic Overcurl mascaraView image in fullscreen£35 at John Lewis£35 at DiorBest for:curlingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sabine WieselSkip the eyelash curlers with this luxurious mascara, which lifts, curls and boosts natural volume with only a few lashings. It always makes my eyes look bigger and brighter in an instant, and that’s why I’ve bought this wand on repeat.The oversize, curved bristle brush can look intimidating, but you soon get the hang of it. The trick is to set the curl by pressing the wand against the lashes as you comb through. I often have to tidy up a little after applying because of my hooded eyes but, once it’s set, the curl and formula will stay in place all day.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s expensive. However, you can buy cheaper refills.Lash effect:Lifting, curling and volumising;vegan:no;shades:black, brown and blueIlia Beauty Limitless Lash mascaraView image in fullscreen£28 at Ilia£28 at Space NKBest for:sensitive eyesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sabine WieselIlia has a skin-centric philosophy that I’m so behind: all its makeup products are infused with active skincare ingredients, including this multi-award-winning mascara. The gentle formulation is enriched with nourishing and conditioning ingredients to look after lashes and is ophthalmologist-tested, so it’s suitable for contact lens wearers and those with sensitive eyes.It’s another ambitious formula that separates and lifts my lashes well, while boosting length and volume, but still on the natural side. It does so with a dual-sided wand: a longer comb side creates the lengthening effect, and a shorter side curls and lifts. I also love that you need only warm water to remove it.It didn’t make the final cut because …the two-sided brush takes a little getting used to.Lash effect:lengthening and lifting;vegan:no;shades:black and brownCharlotte Tilbury Exagger-Eyes Volume mascaraView image in fullscreen£28 at Charlotte Tilbury£34 at AmazonBest for:tubing mascaraView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sabine WieselCharlotte Tilbury’s best mascara to date (for me anyway!) is all about speedy volume-building and curl, so it’s ideal for busy morning makeup. It’s a tubing mascara, meaning that it wraps 360-degree polymers around each eyelash to form a tube (hence the name), creating that instant va-va-voom volume I wish I’d been born with.In the picture, I’ve applied only one coat with the large, curved bristles, so you can see how much it volumises with a quick flick. However, I prefer two layers when the occasion calls for more glam. It doesn’t smudge or flake throughout the day, but still comes off easily without harsh rubbing.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sabine WieselIt didn’t make the final cut because …itcontains conditioning waxes that can transfer to the upper lid when applying.Lash effect:volumising and curling;vegan:no;shades:black onlyRefy Lash Sculpt mascaraView image in fullscreen£20 at Refy£20 at SephoraBest for:short lashesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sabine WieselFull disclosure: I hated this mascara when I first tried it, but I heard others rave about how good it is for naturally lengthening and lifting lashes, so I persevered with testing. I’m so glad I did, as I was getting the technique wrong. Now that I’ve mastered it it’s become one of my favourite mascaras for natural daywear.The curved applicator is like no other, so you have to use it differently. The comb is designed to fit the upper lash line, so if you align it correctly the shorter bristles will catch the inner corner, while the longer ones will comb through the outer lashes. By simply wiggling the comb through a few times, you quickly define each lash, leaving you with a softer, elongated lash look.It didn’t make the final cut because …because it sometimes flakes at the end of the day.Lash effect:Lengthening and lifting;vegan:yes;shades:black onlyWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenAlways remove the brush smoothly, and never pump your mascara – this just traps air in the tube.Photograph: Alena Spasskaya/Getty Images/iStockphotoHow to choose the perfect mascaraThe problem with finding the best mascara is there’s not a one-size-fits-all tube. Thick or thin, curly or straight, short or long – lashes come in all shapes, sizes and colours. We all crave something different from a wand, so the only way to find your perfect match is to work out what you need from your mascara.Generally, the brush type is a giveaway to the result a mascara will give you. Large or oversize wands are built for thickening and volumising, while skinny brushes are great at lengthening and adding definition.However, there are many weird and wonderful-looking wands in between: curved brushes for lifting and curling lashes; cone or tapered shapes to get into corners for a more fanned-out effect; and comb wands to separate and define lashes for a beautifully natural look.It’s a little harder to investigate the formulations. Most mascaras are oil-based, but if you have sensitive eyes you may want to seek out water-based formulas, such as theIlia Limitless Lash mascara.Tubing mascaras are gaining in popularity, as they work a little differently: by wrapping little polymer tubes around each eyelash, rather than coating in waxes, dyes or oils. Those who tend to rub their eyes a lot love them, as they’re smudge-proof and easy to remove with warm water. Their effect is on the natural side, though, which isn’t what everyone is after.How to apply mascara for maximum impactAlways remove the brush smoothly, and never pump your mascara to get more product on to the wand. I know it’s tempting, but this just traps air into the tube, which makes the formula dry out quicker.Apply by aligning your brush horizontally with your lash line. Then look up, so you can get into the roots and coat each lash thoroughly to the tip. Wriggling the brush from side to side will help separate the hairs. If you’ve missed any tiny lashes in the corners, tilt your brush vertically to get to them, or to get to your bottom lashes should you want to define them.How long should mascara last?A good mascara will last up to six months before drying out, but it’s good practice to replace it every three months to keep the risk of eye infections at bay.How to remove waterproof mascaraWaterproof mascara is the most stubborn makeup product to remove, but upgrading your makeup remover to a cleansing oil will make it easier (this affordable Bioderma micellar oilis my personal favourite). The oil attracts the oil in the formula, so it quickly breaks down waterproof mascara.Can I apply mascara on top of a lash lift or extensions?Yes, but steer clear of waterproof and oil-based mascaras. Stick to water-based mascaras, such asIlia’s Limitless Lash, as these are gentler and won’t weigh down lash lifts or separate the glue used to hold your extensions in place.Sabine Wiesel is a freelance beauty editor.She has reviewed beauty products formore than 16 years for some of thebiggest names in UK publishing, and she loves to stay on top of the latest in skin, hair and makeup.Shetests products on a daily basis,and her postman has got used to seeinga random selection of beauty products on her face when he deliversa new batch of products to tryExplore more on these topicsMascaraThe FilterMakeupBeautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You can also remotely erase your phone from here too.Contact your network provider and block your sim to stop thieves running up bills. Also ask it to check for any new “charge to bill” activity and to disable the feature.Contact your credit card company for any cards you have stored on your phone and disable Apple or Google Pay.Report the theft to the police and give them your phone’s IMEI number, which may be on the box, in your Apple or Google account or their Find My services.Contact your insurance company if you have phone cover.Change your passwords for important accounts.

Do they prefer heart disease?They’d rather lift weights. Muscle building is in; cardio is out.Really? These are the choices?The evidence is unmistakable. Google searches for cardio workouts have declined steadily since 2021, while those for strength training have increased.Searching ain’t exercising– take it from someone who knows.Gyms are converting yoga studios into lifting stations to meet demand. Big US fitness chains have reduced their cardio equipment by as much as 40% to make room for more weights.Who is responsible for this major cultural shift?As usual, it’s influencers, mostly on TikTok.Persuading disaffected young men they need to beswoleto be whole?Actually, it’s women and older people who are driving the switch.How come?Being muscular is now associated with being healthy, and regular weightlifting is meant to help prevent obesity and increase longevity.And cardio doesn’t?Not so much. Cardio is good for heart and lung health and reduces high blood pressure, whereas strength training improves your metabolism and maintains bone density.So which is actually better for you?To maintain optimum overall health, you really need to be doing both.Somehow Iknew you were going to say that.A 2022 study found evidence thatcombining muscle-strengthening exercise with aerobic activityled to additional mortality risk reduction, with a maximum benefit coming from doing the latter three times a week and the former up to seven times.Ten times a week? I don’t even do things I like 10 times a week.There is, of course, a fair bit of overlap: you can raise your heart rate while lifting weights, and build muscle while running uphill.Is there any upside to cardio being suddenly unfashionable?There’s no queue for the treadmills any more.Great. The queueing was my favourite part of going to the gym.Don’t worry – now you can queue for the squat rack instead.Do say:“You know what keeps me fit? Struggling under the weight of society’s expectations.”Don’t say:“If you cleared out all these rowing machines, you’d have room for a cheese counter.”Explore more on these topicsFitnessPass notesHealth & wellbeingMedical researchfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But cocky journeyman midfielder Benedick – jibed as “Signor Own-Goal”, replacing Shakespeare’s sexualised insult “Mountanto” – refuses to be interviewed by TV sportscaster Beatrice, due to some past bad match.While Hamlet takes place surrounded by sea, this re-sported Messina is more of a stretch, requiring “war” to become “game”, Leonato “owner” rather than “governor” and nobleman Don Pedro a “manager”, although football’s nickname culture permits him to be addressed as “Sweet Prince”, which is relatively modest in comparison with José Mourinho’s “Special One”.View image in fullscreenMasked balls … Freema Agyeman as Beatrice and Nick Blood as Benedick.Photograph: Marc BrennerAnd for football aficionados, it is shaming how well the game fits the plot of the brutal misogynistic slandering of a young woman, Hero. Indeed, a play revolving around falsehoods and pranking gains new power when everyone has a mobile phone. And masked balls (on which many misunderstandings depend) also feel plausible partying for Champions League millionaires.Less happily, the footballing cliche about a game of two halves also applies to the production. After halftime, as football kit gives way to wedding gear, the metaphor visually vanishes. Also, a common football-managerial complaint about the pace of play – moving the ball faster here, tactically slowing things down there – is something director Michael Longhurst might look at before a second elsewhere.View image in fullscreenFootballers’ wives … Megan Keaveny (Ensemble), Eleanor Worthington-Cox (Hero), Gina Bramhill (Margaret) and Lydia Fraser (Ursula).Photograph: Marc BrennerOne of the most remarkable lines in Shakespeare, Beatrice’s demand that Benedick “Kill Claudio”, is gabbled without a preceding pause, while other scenes need much quicker passing, especially as the comic coppers (cut completely fromJamie Lloyd’s recent London Much Ado) get a full game. Dogberry and the other members of his watch as hi-vis private security is a good sight gag but their lines frequently die.Freema Agyeman’s winning Beatrice looks – although the conceit can’t encompass women’s football – as if she might be a better player than Nick Blood’s Benedick, who has the poignancy of a late-career athlete, while Peter Forbes’ sleazy Leonato would easily fail the Premier League’s “fit and proper owners” test. Eleanor Worthington-Cox’s hopeful Hero could have walked on from Amazon Prime’s Married to the Game. Jon Bausor’s set makes amusing use of a folding massage table, and the clothes, from tracksuits to designer suits and frocks, should win him a costume trophy. The overall show, though, is a little bit, as they spell it in football, Messi.Atthe Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 24 MayExplore more on these topicsRoyal Shakespeare CompanyTheatreWilliam ShakespeareMuch Ado About NothingreviewsShareReuse this content"

ThoughSam Jackson took over as controller of BBC Radio 3 and director of the Promstwo years ago, the 2023 and 2024 programmes were essentially planned under the aegis of his predecessor as Proms supremo David Pickard. So the coming season is the first for which Jackson has been responsible, though he is keen to emphasise that organising a festival on the scale of the Proms is a team effort, and that though his name is the one that appears on the introduction to the printed guide, he is just one among several who have put the season together – a season of 72 concerts in the Royal Albert Hall, together with weekend residencies and concerts in Belfast, Bradford, Bristol, Gateshead and Sunderland.BBC announces 2025 Proms lineup – including first female-fronted Last NightRead moreCertainly the alterations that have been made to the eight weeks of concerts so far seem more matters of subtle degree than radical shifts in emphasis. There have been fears that the changes that have already been inflicted onRadio 3during Jackson’s tenure might be mirrored in his first Proms. These include the tendency to play single movements rather than complete works, while avoiding any details such as opus and catalogue numbers that might be construed as off-puttingly musicological, as well as the launch of Radio 3 Unwind, devoted to music to “restore calm”. Such worries are quickly allayed though by a glance at the programmes, which contain as much serious, challenging music, both old and new, as ever. And whether deliberate or not, the choice of repertoire and the artists performing it this year suggest that attempts to ensure that every politically correct box has been ticked seem far less strenuous and contrived than they sometimes have in previous years.View image in fullscreenWelcome guest … Klaus Mäkelä will conduct the Royal Concertgebouw in two Proms.Photograph: Mark AllanThough there is no over-arching theme to the season, significant musical anniversaries are appropriately marked, with the exception perhaps of the 500th anniversary of Palestrina’s birth. There’s Arvo Pärt’s 90th birthday, the 150th anniversaries of the births of Ravel and Samuel Coleridge Taylor, and the 50ths of the deaths of Bernard Herrmann and Shostakovich, while this year’s two great centenarians, Pierre Boulez and Luciano Berio, are celebrated in a late-night visit by Ensemble intercontemporain, as well as in orchestral concerts. Though performances of Berio’s famous Sinfonia, his Schubert-based Rendering, and the music-theatre piece Recital I (For Cathy) are welcome inclusions, it’s a shame that a concert performance of one of his operas that has yet to be heard in Britain could not have been organised, and that one of Boulez’s rarely heard early choral works could not be revived, especially in the wake ofthe BBC Symphony Orchestra’s outstanding performance of Pli Selon Pliin the Barbican’s Boulez day last month.As usual too the new works, the world or British premieres, vary from the genuinely intriguing to the seemingly dutiful. Tom Coult’s Monologues for the Curious, inspired by the ghost stories of MR James and composed for tenor Allan Clayton, and Mark Simpson’s ZEBRA, a guitar concerto for Sean Shibe, after the sci-fi of Philip K Dick, belong in the first category, as does Anna Thorvaldsdottir’s cello concerto, Before We Fall, and Gabriella Smith’s organ concerto, Breathing Forests.And while there aren’t any standout special events – performances of works that only an organisation such as theBBCwould have the financial and musical muscle to put on – it will good to hear Birtwistle’s Earth Dances and Steve Reich’s The Desert Music played live again, while British music aficionados won’t want to miss three choral rarities, Vaughan Williams’s Sancta Civitas, Arthur Bliss’s Morning Heroes and Delius’s Mass of Life.View image in fullscreenThe Royal Albert Hall Proms season.Photograph: Sisi Burn/Sisi Burn/ BBCTransatlantic orchestras, however, are still conspicuous by their absence. The regular stream of visiting ensembles in previous years that represented the cream of the orchestral world in the final weeks of the season now seems very much a thing of the past. There are two concerts each from the Royal Concertgebouw under Klaus Mäkelä and the Vienna Philharmonic with Franz Welser-Möst, who is rarely seen in London these days, as well as a one-off appearance from the Leipzig Gewandhaus with Andris Nelsons. Other visitors include the Danish National Symphony, the Melbourne Symphony and the Budapest Festival orchestras, but as usual the majority of the concerts are sourced from the BBC’s “house” orchestras, and the independent home-based ones, some with their regular conductors and some with guests.As ever, tickets to stand, either in the arena or in the gallery under the dome of the RAH and which are only made available on the day of each concert remain a bargain, priced at £8 throughout the season. But elsewhere in the hall prices vary widely from evening to evening, though for most concerts the most expensive seats are around £60. Sometimes they’re considerably more than that, though the logic behind some of the pricing is hard to follow. There’s a top price of £110 for the second of the Vienna Philharmonic’s concerts, for instance, a programme of Mozart and Tchaikovsky, while the previous evening, with the same orchestra and conductor performing Berg and Bruckner, the most you will pay is £86. No doubt the BBC and the Albert Hall have their reasons for these and other disparities, and meanwhile throughout the two months of concerts, you can always a get to hear lot of good music for a lot less.The Promswill run from 18 July to 13 September.

The economy is weak. Government borrowing has just come inhigher than expected. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) hasdowngraded its forecasts for UK growth. And to cap it all, she is trying to get the arch-protectionist Donald Trump tolower tariffs on British exportsas part of a UK-US trade deal. Being chancellor of the exchequer is a tough gig, but nobody told her it would be this tough.Reeves is in Washington this week for the half-yearly meetings of the IMF and the World Bank and there is no shortage of problems that the two venerable institutions could be getting their teeth into. There is a need forspeedier and deeper debt reliefto allow poor countries to spend more on tackling climate change. There is a need to redouble international efforts to hit the2030 development goalsset by the United Nations. There is a need to change the way the fund and the bank are managed to reflect the fact that the global economy has moved on since they were created in 1944.Inevitably, though, the meetings have been overshadowed by the increasingly unhinged antics of Trump. This week began with the president taking aim at Jerome Powell after the man in charge of America’s central bank said tariffs would push up US inflation and make it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Trump called Powell a “major loser” and triggered panic in the markets by suggesting his reluctance to reduce borrowing costsmeant he was for the chop.This was more than a run-of-the mill wobble in the stock market. Instead, there was the unusual combination of US share prices, US bonds and the US dollarall falling at the same time. Normally when share prices tumble bond prices go up, while nervous investors pile into the dollar. Faced with the prospect that the US currency might no longer be considered a safe haven, Trump was forced to backtrack, saying he never had any intention of sacking Powell. But nobody can be sure. Trump is vindictive and will need a scapegoat when his policies backfire. According to the IMF, the US will take the biggest hit from tariffs of any major economy, but was perhaps also being a little generous in predicting growth this year of close to 2%. It could be a lot worse than that.Let’s be clear. Some of Trump’s criticisms of the way the global economy has been managed – or rather mismanaged – are warranted. There is an argument for the use of protectionism as part of an industrial strategy. There is an argument for reform of the way the IMF and World Bank operate. And there is certainly a case for taking a long, hard look at whether central bank independence should be taken as given.Powell and the Fed deserve criticism for some of the decisions they have taken in recent years, particularly in the period after the pandemic when policy was initially too lax and then too tight. The same applies to the Bank of England. The golden period of central bank independence came in the 1990s when the arrival of cheap goods from China kept inflation low. Central banks took the credit but they just got lucky.What’s more, the idea that independent central banks are truly independent is questionable. Voters have been sold the idea that control of interest rates should be handed to supposedly apolitical technocrats who will not be tempted to tweak policy for short-term electoral gain and can therefore be better trusted than elected representatives to make policy in a rational manner.But more often than not these “rational” decisions reflect the prejudices of central bankers, not least that keeping inflation low is the only thing that really matters. One of Powell’s predecessors – Paul Volcker – crushed inflation in the early 1980s by pushing US interest rates to punitive levels. The result was a deep recession and thedemise of whole communitiesin the American midwest. Alan Greenspan, who took over from Volcker at the Fed, would cut interest rates if there was a risk that a slump on Wall Street would become too pronounced. These were deeply political decisions taken with full knowledge of the consequences, one of which is strong support for Trump in the rust belt.But Trump’s personal attacks on Powell have the paradoxical effect of making the Fed’s independence more secure. As was the case with tariffs, the president has found it is impossible to buck the markets. Yet the notion that things will be calmer now is for the birds. Trump is an unstable bully who just happens to be in charge of the world’s most important economy. He is likely to lash out as things get worse – as they will.All of which brings us back to Reeves. What Britain wants out of a trade deal is clear. It would like to be exempt from Trump’s across-the-board 10% tariff imposed on all countries, and to see a cut – preferably to zero – in the 25% levy on car exports to the US. The US wants easier access for its food exports, including chlorine-washed chicken, something the UK considers a red line.This would be a tricky negotiation at the best of times but the brutal truth is that nobody can predict what Trump will do or say from one moment to the next. There will be other casualties of his wrecking-ball approach. The UK could be one of them.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFederal ReserveOpinionDonald TrumpGlobal economyInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)Rachel ReevesWorld BankEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

It turns out that theoverwhelming majorityof people in the world – between 80% and 89%, according to a growing number ofpeer-reviewedscientific studies– want their governments to take stronger climate action.As co-founders of a non-profit that studies news coverage of climate change, those findings surprised even us. And they are a sharp rebuttal to the Trump administration’s efforts to attack anyone who does care about theclimate crisis.For years – and especially at this fraught political moment – most coverage of theclimate crisishas been defensive. People who support climate action are implicitly told – by their elected officials, by the fossil fuel industry, by news coverage and social media discourse – that theirs is a minority, even a fringe, view.That is not what the new research finds.The most recent study, People’s Climate Vote 2024, was conducted by Oxford University as part of a program the UN launched after the 2015 Paris agreement. Among poorer countries, where roughly four out of five of the world’s inhabitants live, 89% of the public wanted stronger climate action. In richer, industrialized countries, roughly two out of three people wanted stronger action. Combining rich and poor populations, “80% [of people globally] want more climate action from their governments.”The Yale Program on Climate Change Communication – which, along with its partner, the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication, is arguably the global gold standard in climate opinion research – has published numerous studies documenting the same point: most people, in most countries, want stronger action on the climate crisis.A fascinating additional 89% angle was documented in a study published by Nature Climate Change, which noted that the overwhelming global majority does notknowit is the majority: “[I]ndividuals around the globe systematically underestimate the willingness of their fellow citizens to act,” the report states.We believe the current mismatch between public will and government action amounts to a deficit in democracyIn other words, an overwhelming majority of people want stronger action against climate change. But at least for now, this global climate majority is a silent majority.Taken together, the new research turns the conventional wisdom about climate opinion on its ear. At a time when many governments and companies are stalling or retreating from rapidly phasing out the fossil fuels that are driving deadly heat, fires and floods, the fact that more than eight out of 10 human beings on the planet want their political representatives to preserve a livable future offers a much-needed ray of hope. The question is whether and how that mass sentiment might be translated into effective action.What would it mean if this silent climate majority woke up – if its members came to understand just how many people, both in distant lands and in their own communities, think and feel like they do? How might this majority’s actions – as citizens, as consumers, as voters – change? If the current narrative in news and social media shifted from one of retreat and despair to one of self-confidence and common purpose, would people shift from being passive observers to active shapers of their shared future? If so, what kinds of climate action would they demand from their leaders?These are the animating questions behind the 89% Project, a yearlong media initiative that launched this week. The journalistic non-profit we run,Covering Climate Now, has invited newsrooms from around the world to report, independently or together, on the climate majorities found in their communities.Who are the people who comprise the 89%? Given that support for climate action varies by country – the figure is 74% in the US, 80% in India, 90% in Burkina Faso – does support also vary by age, gender, political affiliation and economic status? What do members of the climate majority want from their political and community leaders?

If most of the climate majority have no idea they are the majority, do they also not realize that defusing the climate crisis is by no means impossible?Scientists have long saidthat humanity possesses the tools and knowhow necessary to limit temperature rise to the Paris agreement’s aspirational target of the 1.5C above preindustrial levels. What has been lacking is the political will to implement those tools and leave fossil fuels behind. The 89% Project will culminate in a second joint week of coverage before the Cop30 United Nations climate meeting in Brazil in November.While it’s impossible to know how many newsrooms will participate in this week’s 89% coverage, early signs are heartening. The Guardian newspaper and the Agence France-Presse news agency have joined as lead partners of the project. Other newsrooms offering coverage include the Nation, Rolling Stone, Scientific American and Time magazines in the US; the National Observer newspaper in Canada; the Deutsche Welle global broadcaster in Germany; the Corriere della Sera newspaper in Italy; the Asahi Shimbun newspaper in Japan; and the multinational collaborative Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism based in Jordan.We believe the current mismatch between public will and government action amounts to a deficit in democracy. Can that deficit be addressed if the climate majority awakens to its existence? Would people elect different leaders? Buy (or not buy) different products? Would they talk differently to family, friends and co-workers about what can be done to build a cleaner, safer future?The first step to answering such questions is to give the silent climate majority a voice. That will happen, finally, this week in news coverage around the world.Mark Hertsgaard and Kyle Pope are the co-founders of the global journalism collaboration Covering Climate NowThis story is part ofthe 89%Project, an initiative of the global journalism collaborationCovering Climate NowExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisThe 89% projectcommentShareReuse this content"

Starmer can prove him wrongRafael BehrLabour must deliver the green transition voters want, leaving Reform and the Tories on the side of economic decline and dictatorsWed 23 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 06.35 EDTShareWhich former British prime minister described the climate emergency as “a clock ticking to the furious rhythm of hundreds of billions of pistons and turbines and furnaces and engines … quilting the Earth in an invisible and suffocating blanket of CO2”?The florid style gives it away. You’d guess Boris Johnson even if you’d forgotten that the master of Brexit bombast also had a sideline in net zero evangelism. It wasn’t the most memorable part of his repertoire and it didn’t catch on as a Conservative catechism.Subsequent Tory leaders abandoned Johnson’s rhetorical urgency over carbon emissions and repudiated Theresa May’s targets for cutting them. Kemi Badenoch acknowledges that the science of global heating is real but only as an afterthought, once she has finishedcomplaining about the costsof a green transition and the improbable timetable set to achieve it.As in most matters, the Tories are flattering Nigel Farage with pale policy imitation. The Reform UK leadercalls net zero“lunacy” that destroys jobs and drives up household bills. Reform’s policy is to scrap carbon targets entirely and tax renewables.Farage needs a vehicle for economic and cultural grievance to replace his old anti-European bandwagon. It served him so well but was immobilised in multiple collisions with reality. He wants climate-scepticism to be his second crusade, rallying demoralised, alienated voters against arrogant metropolitan elites. “This could be the next Brexit, where parliament is so hopelessly out of touch with the country,” the Reform leadersaid over the weekend. (He seems to have dropped an earlier demand for a referendum on net zero.)The Tories are too beaten, too drained of intellectual autonomy, to do anything but tag along behind Reform.Labouris not immune to the same paralysing anxiety – the fear that Farage, despite his public school pedigree and City trader swagger, has an uncanny way with working-class voters.It doesn’t help that the rightwing press amplify Reform’s campaigns and caricature Ed Miliband, energy secretary, as a zealous crank. In the ever-seething stew of Labour factionalism it isn’t hard to find MPs who use Miliband’s name as a byword for electoral liability. That resentment bubbles to the surface as media speculation that he might be removed at the next cabinet reshuffle, or that he should be.That isn’t the signal coming out of Downing Street. No one actually involved in writing or presenting government climate policy is preparing a U-turn in flight from Faragism. On the contrary, later this week, Keir Starmer will reaffirm his commitment to the renewable energy transition in a speech at an international summit in London, co-chaired by Miliband.It won’t be a green rhapsody in the key of Johnson. That isn’t the current prime minister’s style. Starmer’s case will be grounded in economic pragmatism and the national interest – investment in high-skilled, high-wage industries; ending the vulnerability of supply that pegs household bills to the coercive whim of Vladimir Putin; safe British jobs in secure British energy.If delivered well, it is a message with enough potential public resonance to box Reform on to the side of economic decline and dependence on dictators. Theevidence from opinion polls(supported by accounts from focus groups that test these issues) suggests that climate scepticism is not the Brexit sequel craved by Farage.Opposition to the government’s net zero target is a minority position across every segment of the electorate. Even Reform and Conservative voters are more likely to say that green investment will have a positive impact – growing the economy and reducing the cost of living – than the opposite.Anxiety about climate change is not confined to places that voted to remain in the EU. In one survey by research organisation More in Common, 68% of Farage’s constituents in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, declared themselves “somewhat” or “very” worried about the issue.There are places where net zero is universally despised, but they are online. In those radical rightwing digital arenas, climate consciousness is the stuff of woke activism, a badge of culture-war villainy worn alongside gender-neutral pronouns. Those digital silos, skewed by their fanatical American conservative audience (and, in the case of Elon Musk’s X, a maniacal American proprietor) seethe with conspiracy theories and denial of climate science. Party leaders and prominent commentators of the British right who play to that crowd are pulling away from the mainstream position in their domestic political market.There are still plenty of hazards for the government navigating a complex energy transition. There is a way to sell the long-term goal as a happy alignment of future prosperity and cleaner living, but there are still upfront costs and tricky trade-offs.One cautionary tale is a notoriously botched German scheme to phase out gas boilers. Households were spooked by the cost of heat pumps and, despite promised subsidies, the backlash helped bring down Olaf Scholz’s ruling coalition. The main beneficiary was the far-right Alternative für Deutschland.Another instructive episode is the July 2023 Uxbridge byelection,which the Tories wonin defiance of national polling trends. The result was credited to a Conservative campaign targeting London mayor Sadiq Khan’s plans to extend congestion charging to the capital’s outer suburbs.But two years on, the lessons from that tale are not so clear-cut. Rishi Sunak thought he had found a template for attacking Labour as a party of anti-motorist ecowarriors. But when he tried to scale the message up into a new policy direction he was pilloried for reneging on Britain’s international climate commitments. Uxbridge wasover-interpreted in Westminster, held up as a distorting lens that continues to warp conversations about environmental regulation. The seat flipped to Labour in the general election a year later.That is worth remembering if, as seems likely,Reform does wellin council elections and theRuncorn byelectionnext month. Farage will want the results to prove that his fossil-fuelled bandwagon is on the roll. Tory climate-sceptics will eagerly jump aboard even if the true motivations of voters are messy and hard to untangle. They usually are.There will be calls for Starmer to fend off the radical right with concessions to Reform’s agenda. Yielding to that temptation is a mistake. The tributes go unappreciated by their target audience. They land instead like a slap in the faces of long-suffering Labour supporters who had hoped the era of coddling Farage would end once the Tories were evicted from power.It doesn’t take too many demoralised liberal-left voters in marginal seats switching to the Liberal Democrats, Greens or Scottish National party to put new obstacles on the road to a second Starmer term. Allegiances that have been frayed by cuts to benefits, overseas aid and other sundry disappointments would be irretrievably severed in a retreat from climate commitments.Leaning into the green transition slows that decay in morale. It draws a clarifying line between the Starmer project and an axis of Tory-Reform climate defeatism. Deftly argued, it is a way to position the prime minister on the side of optimism, mainstream British opinion, resilience in an uncertain world and clean air. His opponents can have Putin, Donald Trump and pollution on their team. It is the smart move in terms of electoral strategy. It happens also to be the right thing to do.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionLabourReform UKConservativesClimate crisisGreen politicscommentShareReuse this content"

You wouldn’t believe what they do to my downpipeAdrian ChilesThese noisy, filthy, feral creatures make my life a misery. Is there really no way to get rid of them?Wed 23 Apr 2025 10.22 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 21.31 EDTSharePigeons. Appalling things. I looked them up on the bird charity RSPB’s website and snorted when I came across the Where to See section. The answer is, just so you know, everywhere. Perhaps not so much outside towns and cities but in urban areas you’re never far from the sight and sound of the bloody things. If, unaccountably, you’re not familiar with this species, do feel free to get in touch and come round to my place and observe them at your leisure.Truly they are the soundtrack of my life. For years they’ve been getting into a drainage channel on the roof. Morning, noon and night they scratch and coo and jump about. The racket is infernal. I lie in bed reflecting on the filth in that gully just above my head. I know it’s filthy, because when there’s heavy rain their revolting detritus washes down and blocks the downpipe. I have to pull their unspeakable waste out of the pipe before something bursts and floods. There are no words to describe the tangle of excrement, nesting materials, eggs, feathers and bones. Oh Lord, the bones. I’d be less repulsed rummaging through the bin outside a chicken shop on a Sunday morning.The How to Identify section of the RSPB’s webpage is almost as superfluous as the Where to See bit. I may not know a buzzard from a kite, or one tit from another, but I can identify a bloody pigeon. That said, I have learned that feral pigeons’ Latin name isColumba livia, and you might also refer to them as rock doves, their wild ancestors. Not in my presence you won’t. Doves, my arse.There is a photo of me somewhere as a kid, on a trip to London, standing in Trafalgar Square holding a cup of bird seed that my dad had bought from a street vendor. I’m covered in pigeons, and apparently quite enjoying it. What was wrong with me? What was wrong with my parents? What was wrong with society? Is this what passed for entertainment in the 70s? Who says kids staring at smartphones is unhealthy? Not compared with this it isn’t.I saw the light, or rather the shite, when I was 19. I had just put up some scaffolding for someone to clean the front of a building on Corporation Street in Birmingham. This was above Laskys, the hi-fi shop, if you know the area. Nodding at the pigeon carnage on a ledge above a window, the bloke I was working with said: “You’ve got to be careful of this stuff; it gets on your chest.” After breathing it in, I was retching for days. I used to like Laskys too. I don’t think I ever went in there again.Where have all the headphones gone on public transport? The noise is eating into my soul | Adrian ChilesRead moreI scroll down the RSPB website, searching in vain for the How to Get Rid of the Bastards section. You can’t, apparently. Rightly, if disappointingly, poisoning them is verboten. A bloke used to come to the flats where I live with a bird of prey to scare them off. This worked a treat for as long as the man and his bird were there. But as soon as they returned to their van and left, back came the pigeons. Screwing down the grille over the drainage channel on the roof doesn’t work, either. They get past it. Their beaks must have evolved into the shape of Phillips screwdrivers.I read that there are 465,000 breeding pairs of rock doves and feral pigeons in the UK. I’m not sure what that means for total numbers. It doesn’t say how many babies they’re having but it’s got to be more than two per pair. Either way, it doesn’t help that every parish in the country seems to have at least one person intent on feeding them. I’ve begged my local pigeon-feeder to stop, and been told to eff off. I’ve yelled at them to stop, and been told to eff off. The police have paid a visit and they too, presumably, have been told to eff off.The battle is lost. The pigeons have won.Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBirdsOpinionUrban wildlifeHomesAnimalsWildlifecommentShareReuse this content"

His view was more than clearJan-Werner MüllerFrancis was as outspoken as could be without naming names, when he criticized Vance in his February letter to US bishopsWed 23 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 06.01 EDTShareWe might never quite know what Pope Francis said to the US vice-president during their verybrief meetingon Sunday. In the widely shared video clip, it was hardly audible. The morning after, Francis died, and Vance jetted to visit India, finding time totweetthat his heart went out to the millions of Christians who loved Francis (implying, I suppose, that not all Catholics loved him) and patronizing the dead pontiff by calling one of his homilies “really quite beautiful”).Francis had been as outspoken as could be without naming names, when he criticized Vance in his February letter to US bishops; but he was not just registeringhis rebukeof Trump and Vance’s cruel treatment of refugees and migrants; he was reacting to a broader trend of instrumentalizing religion for nationalist and authoritarian populism.In February, Vance had an online “close-quarters street fight” with Rory Stewart, the former UK Conservative minister, diplomat and nowprofessor in the practice of grand strategyat the very university from which Vance obtained his law degree. At issue was what to most of us wouldn’t seem an obvious source of social media outrage: the correct reading of St Augustine’s notion ofordo amoris, the right ordering of love.Look to his stand on Gaza: Pope Francis gave us moral leadership in amoral times | Owen JonesRead moreIn January, Vance had alluded to the concept in aninterview with the Trump courtier Sean Hannity; according to the Catholic convert, it was a “Christian concept” that love and compassion start with family, then extend to neighbors, then nation, and, last and least, reach fellow human beings as such.Stewart had registered skepticism,observingthat Vance’s stance was “a bizarre take on John 15:12-13 – less Christian and more pagan tribal. We should start worrying when politicians become theologians, assume to speak for Jesus, and tell us in which order to love.” The infamously very online Vance hit back with: “Just google ‘ordo amoris’.” In typically snarky fashion, Vance thenquestioned Stewart’s IQand added that “false arrogance” of the Stewart type “drives so much elite failure over the last 40 years” (never mind what would constitute appropriate or correct arrogance).As plenty of learned observers remarked at the time, complex theological questions will not have bumper-sticker-size answers. But eventually a figure not entirely irrelevant for Catholics weighed in with a view that perhaps carries indeed more weight than those of others. Francis, in aletter to US bishops, instructed the flock that “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups. In other words: the human person is not a mere individual, relatively expansive, with some philanthropic feelings!”Vance is not the only far-right populist who has smuggled nationalism into what he touts as the correct notion of ChristianityHe added, driving home the rebuke without naming names, that “the trueordo amoristhat must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the ‘Good Samaritan’ … that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.” Apparently,Cardinal Pietro Parolin was dispatchedon Saturday to explain all this to Vance again.Vance is not the only far-right populist who has smuggled nationalism into what he touts as the correct notion of Christianity. Viktor Orbán, a great model for Vance and other self-declared US “post-liberals” (meaning: anti-liberals), has been declaring for years that a proper understanding of “Christian Democracy” is not only “illiberal”, but nationalist.That would have been news to the many Catholics who experienced nation-building projects in Germany and Italy during the 19th century as outright oppressive. After all, Catholics were suspected of putting loyalty to Rome ahead of civic duties (a suspicion still very much alive in the US when JFK ran for office). Bismarck started theKulturkampf(the original meaning of culture war) against Catholics in the 1870s; the Vatican forbade the faithful to participate in the political life of unified Italy.Far-right populists claim that only they represent what they call “the real people”. Of course, they have to explain who “the real people” are (and, who by contrast, does not truly belong). Many have instrumentalized Christianity for that purpose. Giorgia Meloni, in herautobiography, states: “The Christian identity can be secular rather than religious.” What matters is not believing (let alone actual Christian conduct), but onlybelonging. It’s what the social scientist Rogers Brubaker has called “Christianism”, in contrast with actual Christianity.Some far-right populists have tried to square their Catholicism with their populism by criticizing the hierarchy as a somehow illegitimate, or at least hypocritical, elite. Italy’sMatteo Salvini, who likes to flaunt the Bible and a rosary when riling up the masses of “real” Italians, pioneered this move; Vance copied it when he insinuated that there was something corrupt about church leadership; concretely he had accused US bishops of resettling “illegal immigrants” in order to obtain federal funds (an accusation deemed “very nasty” by Cardinal Timothy Dolan).The point is not that the correct understanding of Catholicism (orChristian Democratic political parties, as they have existed in Europe and Chile) has always been liberal; that’s hardly plausible. The point is that Francis reaffirmed that Catholicism is not compatible with the “America first” (and humanity last) view of the Trumpists.Jan-Werner Müller is a Guardian US columnist and a professor of politics at Princeton UniversityExplore more on these topicsPope FrancisOpinionUS politicsJD VanceCatholicismChristianityRory StewartThe papacycommentShareReuse this content"

If that wasn’t a bad enough omen, the Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, Donald Trump’s acolyte and self-styled “Christian nationalist”, appeared to welcome the pope’s death as a sign of“evil” being “defeated”.In fact, despite a series of clashes with the Trump White House, Francis was no liberal. While refraining from judging homosexuality, he explicitly disapproved of the liberalising synodal path embarked on by theCatholic church in Germany, which ruled in 2023 that church employees could not be sacked for entering same-sex relationships or remarrying after divorce. On abortion, euthanasia, women and LGBTQ+ rights, Francis betrayed the high hopes that liberals and progressives had bestowed upon him.Liberals also had reason to be critical of the pope’s stance on Ukraine, where Francis appeared to sympathise with Russia’s narrative of the war, suggesting it was caused by, in his words, “Nato barking at the gates of Russia”. This didn’t make Francis unsympathetic to Ukrainian suffering. The pontiff, especially through the efforts of Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, tirelessly sought to mediate over the war’s humanitarian issues, starting with Russia’s allegedabduction of Ukrainian children, for which the international criminal court has issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin. But the pope’s political reading of the war – blaming Nato’s expansion, lambasting Europe’s rearmament, suggesting thatUkraine should surrenderand downplaying Russia’s imperial ambitions – were problematic.In this respect, the Argentina-born pope was unambiguously one of the global south’s most powerful voices, if not the most powerful. Francis was not only the first pope from Latin America, but the first non-European to lead the church since the Syrian-born Pope Gregory III in the eighth century. Francis’s scepticism of US foreign policy, sympathy towards Russia and criticism of consumerism and globalisation should be read in this light.But Francis was not just a powerful voice from the global south. He was a uniquely principled one as well. On the Middle East, and in particular Gaza, he was steadfast in his support for human rights and international law. What was so striking was not just his moral stance, but his unwavering solidarity with Palestinian suffering. Every evening, including as he became increasingly frail and ill, hecalled the only Catholic parishin the devastated Gaza Strip.More broadly, Francis stood for inter-faith dialogue, resetting Christian-Muslim relations after the strains caused by his predecessor, Benedict XVI. Francis engaged with Sunni leaders, with the first visit of a pontiff to the Gulf and the signing of adocument on human fraternityin 2019. His outreach extended to Shias, with hishistoric meetingin Najaf, Iraq with Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani in 2021.View image in fullscreenFilipino Catholics at a requiem mass at Manila Cathedral, 22 April 2025.Photograph: Lisa Marie David/ReutersFrancis made himself a pope of the global south also by speaking out forcefully on health, poverty, climate and migration. In his 2015 encyclical,LaudatoSi’, Francis elevated climate and environmental protection to the same level as social justice in the Vatican’s doctrine. During the Covid-19 pandemic, his address in a creepily empty St Peter’s Square will remain ingrained in the hearts and minds of hundreds of millions of followers. As the son of migrants and a spokesperson of the left behind, Francis was scathing in his criticism of Fortress Europe. His very first trip as pontiff was to the island of Lampedusa, in the Italian Mediterranean, wheretens of thousandsof people attempting to migrate to Europe have lost their lives.More recently, Francislambasted the inhumanityof Trump’s mass deportations, taking issue with Vance’s distortion of the Catholic principleordo amoris. Vance had suggested that compassion should be shown to one’s own family and compatriots before the rest of the world, and citedordo amorisas theological justification for what is a morally unjustifiable migration policy.Pope Francis brought an outsider’s eye to the papacy – even if healing the church’s divisions was beyond him | Catherine PepinsterRead moreFrancis spoke about issues close to the left behind. He did so by upholding a level of principle rarely, if ever, demonstrated, by leaders of the global north or, in fact, of the global south. Last week I was in Bandung, Indonesia, at a conference on the lessons of the very first Afro-Asian conference in 1955, at which 10 principles were agreed. Covering human rights, sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-aggression and the equality of races and peoples, the 10 Bandung principles inspired a new spirit of solidarity among formerly colonised countries.Today, that spirit seems lost. Countries in the global south rightly accuse the global north of hypocrisy and double standards. But they are often driven as much by transactionalism, populism, opportunism and self-interest as countries in the north. They are adamant about denouncing their adversaries’ violations of rights and the rule of law, but far more reluctant to do so when these are committed by friends. And they are extremely reluctant to take concrete action in defence of international law when it might harm their own interests.Francis was different. He was close to the causes of the global south but took an unquestionably principled stance towards them. He embodied the spirit of solidarity enshrined in the Bandung agreement – a spirit that is now in alarmingly short supply.When the 135 cardinals in the conclave meet in a few weeks to choose the next pontiff, there is good reason to believe that the apocalyptic direction of travel desired by the far-right Maga world will not come about.The Catholic church under Francis has changed significantly and several of the cardinals consideredpapabili(literally, “papable”) either come from the southern hemisphere or are close to the views that Francis embodied. Living up to Francis’s legacy as a principled voice of the global south will not be easy. But the world needs it more than ever.Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnistExplore more on these topicsPope FrancisOpinionCatholicismReligionThe papacyEuropeChristianitycommentShareReuse this content"

In doing so, the bench overruled the Scottishcourtsand curbed devolvedlawmaking. Crucially, the court said that a gender recognition certificate (GRC) doesn’t change someone’s sex under equality legislation. Thejudgmentoffers what many policymakers – includingSir Keir Starmer– crave: clarity. Amid the fog of culture wars, it was a moment of legal lucidity.Many women’s rights advocatessawthe ruling as a firm defence of sex-based rights, especially where privacy from those perceived as male feels essential. A great number of trans people felt devastated by a judgment they fear will be weaponised. Its impact depends onnorms, discretion and politics: trans women can still compete with women in football, but not athletics. The domestic violence charity Refuge says its support for trans women won’t change. The legal view may be clear, but how it plays out inpracticeis anything but.The judgment directly affects less than 9% of Britain’s 100,000 trans people – those with a GRC. For most, whether their gender is certified or not, their sex is private and irrelevant to how they live. Yet they risk slipping through legal cracks. That’s whyLord Sumption’s intervention mattered. A former supreme court justice, he argued that while the ruling gives service providers the legal power to exclude trans women from single-sex spaces, it doesn’t mandate it – a reminder that clear laws shouldn’t license quiet exclusions.ButKishwer Falkner, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, framed the ruling as a green light for institutional change – including the exclusion of trans people fromtoilets, NHS wards and sports. Her tone, at times implying compulsion, followed a course set by the then Tory equalities minister,Kemi Badenoch, in 2023 when she asked the EHRC to revisit the definition of sex in equality law. When watchdogsshiftstanceat a minister’s request, their neutrality comes into question. Still, the bigger story is a broader shift: from an era that leaned towards trans inclusion, via self-declared gender, to one rooted in biology and competing rights – seen by some as regression, others as reset.Equality law now defines sex biologically, but in public life, notions of sex can be plural, lived and contested. The question is whether the UK canadaptto shifting norms without retreating into division. Clearly, lawful exclusion, even in the name of balance, can lead to lives lived apart. The pub landlord adding a gender-neutral toilet may offer compromise, but it risks creating a “separate but equal” trans existence. Formal equality doesn’t guarantee felt belonging. The danger is a third, liminal identity – neither fitting nor integrating, inviting silent self-exclusion. The challenge now is not only legal but moral. Can society protect sex-based rights while integrating trans people into public life – or does it expect them to assimilate on its own terms?The supreme court’s decision might, forsome, revive a Victorian idea: to protect women legally, we must define them biologically. Efforts to ringfence women’s spaces could end up excluding trans people entirely. The worry is that a narrow legal clarification becomes a cultural victory lap. The bigger danger? That liberal societies struggle with those who don’t fit neat categories, leaving trans people in a third sphere: neither male nor female, nor completely welcome.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kyiv and other European governments are rightly alarmedWed 23 Apr 2025 13.39 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 15.47 EDTShareThere could hardly be clearer evidence than Donald Trump’s latest attack on Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the US administration’slast-minute snubof London peace talks, that what matters to him is not Ukrainian sovereignty and safety, nor the transatlantic alliance, but a deal with Vladimir Putin. The US president saysan agreement is close, withleaks suggestingthat Washington would recognise annexed Crimea as Russian with Moscow giving little if anything in return. For Mr Trump, it is Ukraine’s president who is harming negotiations by saying he will not recognise Russia’s control.Mr Putin is passionate about maximising Russian interests, attentive to every detail, skilled in negotiations, and believes that time is on his side. Mr Trump does not care about the outcome as long as he can claim he has ended the war, has little interest in the detail and has a habit of handing over the prize at the start of the process.He described Russian aggression towards Ukraine as “genius” days before the 2022 full-scale invasion and his administration isabandoning effortsto hold Moscow accountable for war crimes. He holds a grudge against Mr Zelenskyy, and believes Mr Putin would“keep his word”on a peace deal. Above all, he is in a hurry. Having pledged that he could end the war “in 24 hours”, he wants something to brag about as he nears the end of his first 100 days in office.No one wants peace more than Ukrainians, after so many deaths and so much devastation. Kyiv understands that there will be no magical restoration of territorial integrity. But in the words of Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, it is ready to negotiate, not to surrender.JD Vance, the US vice-president,has a simple answer: it is time for the two sides to “either say yes or for the US to walk away from this process”. That might not suit Mr Putin quite as well as a carve-up. But US military aid to Ukraine is already reaching its end, intelligence could soon follow, and Washington could also restrict arms purchases even if Europe was willing and able to fund them to the extent needed.Mr Putin has played an expert hand so far, throwing a bone to Mr Trump whenever it seemed expedient – as with the offer of an“Easter truce”, which did not halt attacks. His latest gambit isreportedlyto offer to cede claims on Ukrainian land that Russia does not actually control: the kind of Potemkin concession that Mr Trump might laud. He does not want a European “reassurance force” in Ukraine, said to be part of the US proposal, but may also conclude that its significance would be limited without a US security guarantee.The timing of the leaks on the US plans, as well as the slight to Europe’s diplomatic efforts – with the abrupt withdrawal of the secretary of state,Marco Rubio, and Mr Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, meaning that London’s discussions were downgraded – reinforces the European understanding that a US-brokered deal may be a beginning, not the end, for Russian ambitions. A grotesquely one-sided, imposed agreement would encourage territorial aggression elsewhere too. It isn’t surprising that Mr Putin sees Europe as an obstruction and prefers bilateral talks. It should continue to alarm and appal us that the US, too, now sees its old allies as the problem, not the solution.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Tony Blair once observed that politicians face a tension between wooing and leading the electorate. This is an issue on which to lead.If voters see the two-child limit as “a matter of fairness”, as claimed, we have a responsibility to explain why it is so unfair on children and on their parents, both in and out of work. While lifting the two-child limit is not a sufficient condition for eradicating child poverty, it is a necessary condition.The onus is on politicians, especially the leadership, to explain why it has to be part of the welcome promised ambitious child poverty strategy. The last Labour government led the way in improving benefits for children and reducing child poverty, but too often it did good by stealth, which made it easier for the Conservatives to undo the good it did. We now need to have the courage of our convictions, if we are to achieve a serious lasting reduction in child poverty.Ruth ListerLabour, House of LordsGovernment sources are reported to have invited those of us calling for an end to the two-child limit to “read the tea leaves”, and accept that the fiscal context and alleged popularity of the policy makes such a move untenable. This could not be wider off the mark, and we can only hope that reason will prevail, and that Labour will do the right, and indeed the only, thing and get rid of this heinous, poverty-producing policy.Indeed, were we all to take a close look in our tea leaves and imagine a future in which the two-child limit remains, we would see two things. First, a UK that will cement its position as an international outlier on child poverty; a nation that fails to protect the poorest, and continues with a policy that is unique worldwide. And second, a future in which Labour’s whole reason for existing is called into question. If Labour cannot and does not act to drive down child poverty, what is the Labour party even for?Prof Ruth PatrickUniversity of YorkThe most urgent problem facing the UK is the increasing burden on the poorest. The changes to personal independence payments are intended to “save” £5bn by 2030, and the Treasurysavesabout £2.5bn a year by imposing a two-child cap on benefits. The entire cost of these restrictions for the coming year can be covered by the rise in the value of our gold reserves since the election.The Treasury holds over 300 tonnes of gold. Its value has risen by about £750 an ounce, a total increase of over £8.25bn. We could sell (or borrow against) that much gold and still be left with the same value as we had in July last year. The gold is a rainy day fund, and this is clearly a very rainy day. We hear a lot about “difficult decisions” – the choice between taking this unexpected profit and clinging to it while millions are pushed ever deeper into financial desperation does not seem at all difficult. Swift action could even help rescue the government from its grim opinion polling.Alan EreiraProfessor of practice, University of Wales, Trinity St DavidDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

For many of us who left Hong Kong following the imposition of the national security law, the threat from the ruling regime was not abstract – it was immediate, personal and existential.Our migration was not simply a search for better opportunities but a necessary departure from a city whose freedoms were being rapidly dismantled.The UK’s cautious recalibration of its relationship with Beijing raises complex emotions. On one hand, I understand the economic pressures that compel governments to engage withChina. On the other hand, I worry about the signals that renewed cooperation might send to Hongkongers resisting repression and to the authoritarian regime. When British ministers visit Beijing or soften their stance, it sometimes feels like the struggle and suffering of Hongkongers is being quietly sidelined for trade and investment.As part of a growing diaspora, we are rebuilding our lives here – finding community, raising children, contributing to society. But we remain deeply connected toHong Kong. We are not passive observers. We organise, advocate and speak out, because what happens in UK-China relations affects how safe and heard we feel.The UK’s commitment to human rights and democratic values cannot be selective. Hongkongers with BNO passports are a living reminder of what is at stake when authoritarianism goes unchecked. A pragmatic China policy should not ignore the lived experience of people like us. Economic strategy must be balanced with moral clarity or the very values that once drew us to Britain will be compromised. This is not just about geopolitics, it is about people’s lives, voices and futures.Sum KungCambridgeHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

In a match that could have represented a microcosm of their domestic season, Arsenal appeared to be heading towards a narrow victory against a doggedCrystal Palaceside. Eberechi Eze’s brilliant volley had cancelled out Jakub Kiwior’s early opener but Leandro Trossard then restored the Gunners’ lead.However, an uncharacteristic mistake from William Saliba allowed Jean-Philippe Mateta, on as a substitute, to equalise with seven minutes to play and secure a deserved point for Palace, who will now head to Wembley for their FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa on Saturday brimming with confidence.Relegated players who will be targets for Premier League clubs this summerRead moreLiverpool’s players had gathered to watch events unfold in north London knowing that a defeat would seal a record-equalling 20th league title with five games still to play. As it is, they have a 12-point lead and a vastly superior goal difference, with a draw against Tottenham on Sunday all that is required to make it official.At leastArsenal– who look destined to end up as runners-up for a third year in row, having drawn nine games this season from winning positions and 13 in total – still have the consolation of their Champions League semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain next week.“The game wasn’t grabbed like we normally do,” said Mikel Arteta, who revealed that Ben White and Mikel Merino are doubts to face PSG after being left out due to unspecified injuries. “We have to wait and see but they weren’t able to be in the squad tonight.”Arteta insisted beforehand that, as well as delaying Liverpool’s title procession, Arsenal had an incentive to win this game to maintain the momentum of theirvictories against Real Madrid. Reports emerged just before kick-off that Arsenal have opened talks with Thomas Partey over extending his contract which expires in the summer having previously seemed set to depart – surely a reward for some consistently commanding performances in central midfield this season, even if his suspension from the first leg against PSG will give Arteta a headache.Palace have previously played the role of party poopers when they famously came back from 3-0 down against Liverpool in 2014 to virtually assure Manchester City of the title. With one eye on their own big day out at Wembley, there didn’t seem to be much chance of history repeating itself this time – especially when Kiwior rose unmarked to head in Martin Ødegaard’s free-kick in the third minute.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze hits his shot into the ground to beat David Raya and make it 1-1.Photograph: Simon Dael/ShutterstockOliver Glasner, who complained that Palace had been put at a disadvantage after getting 24 hours less than Villa to prepare for their meeting on Saturday, was delighted with how his much-changed team refused to give up. “The response of the players was unbelievable,” the Palace manager said. “I’m very proud of them.”Arsenal’s unbeaten record in all competitions stretches back to the end of February, although four draws in their previous sevenPremier Leaguematches had undermined any chance of catching Liverpool.Declan Rice was inches away from doubling his side’s lead when he flashed a shot just wide but Palace had been more than holding their own when they summoned up a spectacular equaliser. Arsenal’s defenders didn’t seem to have noticed Eze on the edge of the box for a corner and he was picked out perfectly by Adam Wharton to volley the ball in off the post.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Suddenly Arsenal’s supporters were venting their frustrations. Yet after scoring twice at the weekend,Trossard continued his rich vein of formwhen he squeezed a shot past Dean Henderson via a deflection off Jefferson Lerma on the stroke of half-time to restore their lead.The Palace goalkeeper needed treatment at the start of the second half when Nketiah clattered into him as he attempted to head away a free-kick but Henderson was able to continue. The introduction of Bukayo Saka off the bench on the hour drew almost as big a roar as either of the home side’s goals as Arsenal attempted to put the game to bed.Justin Devenny spurned a massive opportunity for Palace to draw level again when he failed to make proper contact with an Ismaïla Sarr cross before David Raya denied Marc Guéhi from the resulting corner. Somehow Sarr could not get enough power behind his header after Daniel Muñoz headed another corner across the face of goal as Palace piled on the pressure.Gabriel Martinelli thought he had settled matters when he touched in Jurriën Timber’s cross but VAR eventually ruled that the ball had already gone out of play. A stunning save from Henderson kept out Saka’s volley from close range and it was to prove vital as Mateta pounced on the ponderous Saliba’s error and chipped the stranded Raya to send the travelling supporters behind his goal home ecstatic.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

But there are some social media channels that are particularly vitriolic and are descending into a gutter. And as a result of that, London Marathon events have actually come off one of those channels.”Faith Kipyegon’s audacious bid to be first woman to run sub four-minute mileRead moreBrasher confirmed he was referring to X, where the London Marathon has an account that has not posted to its 191,000 followers for three months. “It is off the back of just looking at that channel and the vitriol,” he said. “It was ceasing to be a rational conversation. It was ceasing to be a positive place to be.”Brasher also accused X of not being a force for good and contrasted it sharply with the aims of the London Marathon, which was set up in 1981 by his father Chris and John Disley. “The London Marathon is about positivity,” he added.“One of the aims of my father and John was to show that on occasion, the family of humankind could be joyous together and celebrate together. That’s what the London Marathon is about. It is a force for good. And we didn’t feel that channel shared those values, and therefore we have come off.”Brasher also confirmed that the London Marathon would continue its policy of barring trans women from elite and championship female races, while allowing them to participate in the mass participation event, in the wake oflast week’s UK supreme court rulingthat a woman is defined by biological sex under British equalities law.However, he said he was waiting to see a detailed report from the Equalities Human Rights Commission and Sport England over how to implement the court’s ruling before deciding whether that policy might change.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Guro Reiten opened from the spot before Catarina Macario scored a brace. Mia Fishel rounded off the night to restore their six-point lead at the top of the Women’s Super League.Sonia Bompastor praised her side’s performance to gain a “crucial result” but warned that “nothing is done yet” in terms of the league title. “We are in a good position but nine more points need to be played and it’s enough for Arsenal to come back,” the Chelsea manager said. “Everything is possible. I will only relax when it is mathematically done.”Arsenal and Chelsea face uphill battles in Champions League – Women’s Football WeeklyRead moreChelsea were clear favourites coming into this game: the hosts were unbeaten in the league, while Palace were rooted to the bottom.The one doubt surrounding Chelsea was how quickly they could recover fromtheir weekend disappointment against Barcelonawhich all but destroyed their quadruple hopes. Bompastor rotated heavily, making seven changes to bring fresh energy into the side. The experienced Guro Reiten made her first start since returning from a back injury while Macario also returned in a changed attacking line. Naomi Girma made her second start since joining the club in January, replacing Nathalie Björn in defence.Leif Smerud’s Palace side had not played a competitive fixture in three weeks, a quirk of the scheduling which did little to help them gain momentum. They had at least been able to replenish an injury-hit squad over the break with Clarissa Larisey recalled alongside Mille Gejl.Chelsea set the tone early on with the visitors having to put bodies on the line to protect their goal. Macario had an effort blocked before Allyson Swaby’s instinctive reaction deflected a goalbound strike from Aggie Beever-Jones just wide.View image in fullscreenMia Fishel (centre) wheels away after netting Chelsea’s fourth.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAIt was only a matter of time before Chelsea found the breakthrough and two goals in two minutes put them in firm control. The first came when a cross from the influential Reiten struck Molly-Mae Sharpe’s hand in the box. The Norwegian stepped up to take the penalty, coolly dispatching her eighth league goal of the season.Chelsea took advantage of Palace’s naivety to double the lead when Girma and Sandy Baltimore combined to exploit the space left by an advanced Lily Woodham. Baltimore found Macario in the area and she drove a low effort past Shae Yanez. Palace’s evening got worse immediately after the break when they were reduced to 10 players after Swaby saw red for denying a goalscoring opportunity, bringing down Sjoeke Nüsken just outside the box. The punishment became even more severe when Macario stepped up to convert the free-kick, aided by a heavy deflection.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was her first goal since recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury which had kept her out for more than a year. “I’m really happy for her,” Bompastor said. “It is a special moment for her individually and for the team. I saw [her trademark] celebration. It was good to see it back and all the players around her were really pleased.”It was a comfortable win for Chelsea, one that leaves them four points from securing their sixth successive league title. They will now turn their focus back to Barcelona on Sunday with Bompastor insisting “everything is possible” as they look to turn aroundtheir 4-1 first-leg deficit.

Two US presidents – Donald Trump and Barack Obama – plus huge names from worlds outside sport have contacted the Northern Irishman since he completed the career grand slam at Augusta National. Amid moving scenes at Augusta, McIlroy’s outpouring of emotion reverberated way beyond golf. The achievement meant “everything and more” to McIlroy. It struck chords elsewhere.McIlroy, who beat Justin Rose in a playoff to win the Green Jacket, returns to action at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans, which starts on Thursday. The Northern Irishman was in bed with a fever on Monday, and was still slightly jaded when he addressed the media at TPC Louisiana on Wednesday.R&A ‘would love’ the Open to return to Donald Trump’s Turnberry courseRead more“It’s been an amazing few days, to be able to reflect on everything that happened and the magnitude of everything,” McIlroy said. “I think the big thing for me is just how the whole journey sort of resonated with people and the people that have reached out to me. That’s been absolutely amazing. It’s not every day you get to fulfil one of your lifelong goals and dreams. I’ve just really tried to enjoy everything that comes along with that.“I spoke to two presidents the day after, which was pretty cool. Just people reaching out from all walks of life, whether it be sports, entertainment, culture. Just all of it. People you would never even think would watch golf or would know what’s going on; that was very, very humbling.“I think people can see themselves in the struggle at times, and everything that you sort of try to put into getting the best out of yourself in that journey. Watching someone finally get it done, something they’ve been trying to do for a decade plus, I think it resonated.”McIlroy spent time post-Augusta at his house on the outskirts of London, before visiting his parents in Northern Ireland. Noticeably private celebrations were spent with those closest to the now five-time major winner. He is just the sixth golfer in history to win the grand slam. “I honestly could not be in a better place in my life professionally, personally, all of it,” the world No 2 said. “To celebrate with the people that have been a part of this whole thing for my entire career, my entire life was absolutely amazing.”McIlroy and Shane Lowry are the defending champions at the pairs event in New Orleans. Lowry grabbed McIlroy in a euphoric moment as Rose was seen off. The tournament organisers are clearly delighted McIlroy is here. Lowry was unsure his partner would make the trip as a dramatic final Masters round unfolded.“On the 15th hole at Augusta, I was done so I was watching the leaderboard,” Lowry said. “I think he’d just made double on 13. I said to Darren [Reynolds, Lowry’s caddie]: ‘No matter what happens the next few holes, I think we’re going to do well to get him to New Orleans.’ If things didn’t go his way, I don’t think he’d want to be here and I thought if things did go his way, he’d want to be somewhere else. I’m happy he’s here. I’m not saying we’re going to be down on Bourbon Street every night but we’re here to enjoy it.”As Lowry reflected on that 13th hole, where McIlroy found water with his third shot, the Masters champion visibly balked. “I’m eager to get back out there,” McIlroy said. “I think this is the perfect atmosphere to do it in.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I also know that it’s not all on me; he has to do some of the work, too. Maybe a lot of it the next two days.“It’s a perfect tournament to come back to, just good positive vibes from last year. I don’t know if that gives me more confidence, I’ve always been very confident in my abilities as a golfer. The whole day on Sunday at Augusta, I don’t think I’ll have to ever play a harder round of golf in my life. I certainly don’t want to be placed back on that 15th tee box on that Sunday afternoon. So I think to be able to get through that and produce the shots when I needed to, that gives me confidence and I can always draw back on that experience.”McIlroy has cited Europe retaining the Ryder Cup at Bethpage later this year as a remaining goal for 2025. It has been confirmed that José María Olazábal, who captained Europe to victory in Medinah 13 years ago, will join Luke Donald’s backroom team as a vice-captain.Explore more on these topicsRory McIlroyGolfThe MastersEuropean TourPGA TournewsShareReuse this content"

It is a daunting venue to play at anyway, but it’s just about getting on the bike again and playing. I’m really happy that I’ve done it, even if I’d lost it didn’t matter – I’ve made the breakthrough now.”Carter had done well to pull within one by the end of the ­opening session on Tuesday but did not score a point in the first two frames upon the resumption as O’Sullivan dispatched breaks of 59 and 117 to extend his lead to 7-4. Carter blew it again in the 12th frame, running out of position on 28, and, clearly in no mood to hang around, O’Sullivan produced a ­clearance of 74 followed by his ­second century of the day to head into the interval one frame from victory.It was a far cry froma forgettable opening sessionin which O’Sullivan had benefited from a series of errors by Carter to carve out his relatively rusty first-day lead. Confirmation of O’Sullivan’s progress duly arrived in the fifth frame of the day as a 131 total clearance wrapped up an ultimately emphatic victory over his former foe.View image in fullscreenRonnie O’Sullivan in action on his way to victory.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAAfter his win O’Sullivan surged to second-favourite for the title with the bookmakers, but he continued to talk down his chances, insisting: “My expectation levels were to maybe get a few frames and see where I go from there. I feel like I’ve had a ­victory by just winning a match, and it is all part of the ­rebuilding process.”Pang became the sixth and final Chinese player to reach the last 16 after completing a 10-7 win against his compatriot Zhang Anda, the 12th seed. The 25-year-old was beaten 10-7 by O’Sullivan on his Crucible debut two years ago but since then he has improved and reached his second ranking semi-final at the Northern Ireland Open in October.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those hopeful moments were usually fleeting, with a series of tough losses, injuries or a self-sabotaging decision always around the corner.‘I can trust him’: Emma Raducanu to continue coaching partnership with Mark PetcheyRead moreHere she is again, afterreaching the quarter-finals in Miami, her most impressive performance since her US Open triumph, trying to ­maintain her good form and ­properly establish herself at the highest levels of the sport.Although the 22-year-old struggled to find her best level for any sustained period against a quality opponent, this performance was a reflection of her resilience and adaptability as she found a way through her first clay-court match of the ­season. A greater test awaits in round two against Marta Kostyuk, the 24th seed.“It’s for sure different stepping into the competition, especially on clay. I haven’t played many matches on this surface, so it does feel a little foreign to me,” said Raducanu. “I’m happy with how I kind of worked my way into the match. I played an opponent in great form who has won a lot of matches on clay so I knew I had to play really well to win. I don’t think I played my best level but I think I competed really well.”Most players are already knee-deep in their clay-court season, but Raducanu opted for a different path. Following a hectic start that culminated in her run to the last eight of the Miami Open, the former British No 1 decided to take a brief pause. Instead of competing in the Billie Jean King Cup or in Rouen, she embarked on a 10-day training block in Los Angeles.She was joined in California by Mark Petchey, her locum coach in Miami, who again took his seat in her player box on a sunny Wednesday afternoon in the Caja Mágica and shouted encouragement at his charge throughout.View image in fullscreenSuzan Lamens pushed Emma Raducanu hard in Madrid.Photograph: Sergio Pérez/EPARaducanu entered the court as the higher-ranked player – No 49 v No 73 – but Lamens is a good clay-court player who has steadily risen up the rankings over the past year after winning her first title. She followed up her dismantling of Katie Boulter in the BJK Cup by reaching the semi-finals in Rouen last week.A quick, durable athlete armed with a potent topspin forehand she uses to move opponents around, Lamens’ excellent rally tolerance makes her particularly dangerous on clay. She was flawless early on, her forehand particularly on fire as she lasered winners from all parts of the court.Under pressure and not always able to find her best rhythm in rapid conditions due to Madrid’s high altitude, Raducanu was forced to react and find a way through and she did so by drawing on her full arsenal of shots. At times, the Briton was able to counter Lamens’ offence with her own; she faced three break points on her serve at 4-4, to which she responded with a series of searing forehands.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Towards the end of the set, however, as Lamens continued to pulverise her forehand, Raducanu opted to loop balls high and outlast her opponent. Alongside her composure and resolve, the 2021 US Open champion found Lamens’ backhand more often in the tie-break, which deteriorated under pressure.Rather than the tight first set liberating Raducanu, she immediately found herself down a break in set two. Nothing came easily. Although she was able to better find her range, she closed out the match through her mental toughness, standing firm in the final games for a quality win.Later on Wednesday, Sonay Kartal joined Raducanu and Katie Boulter as the third British woman to reach the second round with an efficient 6-2, 7-5 win over Jaqueline Cristian. Kartal, who is on the verge of breaking into the top 50 for the first time, will next face Elina Svitolina, the 17th seed. Despite fighting hard until the end, qualifier Francesca Jones fell 7-6 (5), 4-6, 6-3 to Dayana Yastremska.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

He has been a standout performer forBournemouththis season and is a key target for Chelsea, who are keen to add a ball-playing centre-back to their ranks.‘I’ve always been pretty chilled’: Dean Huijsen on Bournemouth, defending and his celebrationRead moreA potential stumbling block forChelsea, who could also face competition from Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle, is that Madrid have been monitoring the Spain international. Sources have indicated that Huijsen – who has just turned 20 – would favour a move to the Bernabéu if it were on the table.Yet Madrid are understood to be unsure over whether funds are available. The club have not been in the habit of paying big fees for signings in recent years. They have looked to get players on free transfers and are closing in on a deal for the Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold.Chelsea have been working behind the scenes on a deal for Huijsen. They have a good relationship with the player’s representatives and want to wrap up the signing before the Club World Cup, which begins in mid-June.Part of Huijsen’s appeal is that he is two-footed and adept at playing out from the back. Enzo Maresca puts a heavy emphasis on possession and believes his plans have been compromised by Wesley Fofana’s fitness problems. The centre-back is out for the season after another hamstring injury.Chelsea have also looked at Ajax’s Jorrel Hato, Crystal Palace’s Marc Guéhi and Everton’s Jarrad Branthwaite. A striker is also a priority, with Ipswich’s Liam Delap and RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko shortlisted. Chelsea are keen to bring in a winger and have considered Manchester United’s Alejandro Garnacho and Borussia Dortmund’s Jamie Gittens.Explore more on these topicsChelseaBournemouthReal MadridnewsShareReuse this content"

He did not name the US or Trump but made apparent reference to them while noting that China had “built the world’s largest and fastest-growing renewable energy systems as well as the largest and most complete new energy industrial chain”.Xi said: “Although some major country’s persistent pursuit of unilateralism and protectionism has seriously impacted international rules and the international order … as long as we enhance confidence, solidarity and cooperation, we will overcome the headwinds and steadily move forward global climate governance and all progressive endeavours of the world.”After the meeting, Guterres said no government or fossil fuel interest could hold the world back from pursuing a clean energy future.“The world is moving forward, full speed ahead,” Guterres said. “No group or government can stop the clean energy revolution. Science is on our side, and the economics have shifted.”Guterres did not mention Trump directly but theactions of the US presidentclearly overshadowed the meeting. The Guardian understands that the US administration was not invited to the online summit.China’s presence was key.

Yet while that sounds high, it is still lower than most other countries around the world. What explains this disparity?New insights into this question have emerged from recent research that examines attitudes toward the climate crisis across the world and in the US specifically.Areportpublished by Nature Climate Change last year found 89% of the world’s population wanted to see more climate action, and 69% even said they would be willing to contribute 1% of their personal income to the cause.But on all counts, the United States – the world’s largest economy and its second largest carbon polluter – ranked among the lowest in terms of willingness to contribute, demand for action and belief that others would contribute.“The climate debate in the US was always very specific in international comparison,” said Peter Andre, a behavioral economist atSafeand theGoethe University Frankfurtand a coauthor of the Nature report. He pointed to research that has found “it was alwaysmore partisan, the media landscape is structured differently than in many European countries, and many [climate misinformation campaigns] alsooriginated in the US.”Andre and his colleagues reviewed data from 130,000 people in 125 countries and found that respondents’ willingness to contribute part of their income to the fight against climate change was highest in poorer countries. In Myanmar, which has a GDP of $1,233 per capita, 93% of respondents’ said they would contribute; in the United States, where incomes are about 70 times higher, only 48% did.“One very plausible hypothesis is that, of course, the extent that you are exposed to climate risk makes you more willing to act against it. The richer you are, the easier it is for you to adapt,” Andre said. “The other story is resistance to change. Current economies are run on fossil fuels, so the bigger the economy, the more things need to change in order to become climate neutral.”The data, which was pulled from surveys conducted by Gallup in 2021 and 2022, showed respondents in France, Japan and Canada were about as willing as Americans to contribute financially to climate action but were more likely to demand political action. Danes, on the other hand, were about as likely as Americans to demand political action but much more willing to contribute income.“We’re kind of an outlier on the global scene,” said Jennifer Marlon, a research scientist and lecturer at Yale University. “I think it’s driven in large part by strong fossil fuel interests and the close associations they have with elected officials.”The oil and gas industryspent about $220min campaign and political action committee donations in the 2024 US election, according to a recent Yale Climate Connections analysis. About 88% of donations went toward Republican candidates, including nearly $23m toward Donald Trump and groups supporting him.According to Marlon, Americans’ “strongsense that individualscan take care of everything” also hampered support for collective climate action.Marlon’s mostrecent analysisof public attitudes toward climate change, published last month, found 63% of Americans said they were worried about climate change yet fewer than half (45%) thought they would be personally and significantly harmed by it.She said that even though a majority of Americans support climate action, that didn’t necessarily translate into votes. “It has not been the primary motivating factor. People are just prioritizing other issues – education, healthcare or government overreach,” she said.Carey Funk, a senior adviser with the Aspen Institute, pointed to the United States’ deep political divisions over climate policy. “Other places with a more ideological division over climate action tend to be in western Europe and in English-speaking countries, such as Canada, Australia,” she said. “The [US’s] two-party system makes the polarization over issues like this more pronounced.”Funk said distrust in traditional journalism was another important factor. Only about one-third of Americans say theytrust mass media. In 2023, Funk conductedin-depth interviewswith Americans who did not see climate change as a major threat, and she said many respondents expressed skepticism of legacy media. She also said messaging from climate groups does not always have its intended effects. “The more the advocates are hyping up the problem, the more skeptical people feel they need to be,” she said.Peter Fisher, a professor of political sociology at the University of Oxford and an author ofThe Peoples’ Climate Vote, a climate survey of 1.2 million people, said the Nature findings largely tracked with what he found: widespread support “nearly across the board” for a rapid transition away from the burning of fossil fuels. He pointed to a few notable exceptions, including Russia, the US, Canada, Australia and, to a lesser extent, the UK. Like Funk, he attributed these exceptions, in part to “partisan divisions on climate issues”.‘Spiral of silence’: climate action is very popular, so why don’t people realise it?Read moreHowever, he stressed, even in these countries a majority of respondents favored a transition away from fossil fuels. “There is concern about climate change and people want to see action,” he said.One thing respondents across the globe had in common? A tendency to underestimate their fellow citizens. In the United States, nearly half of respondentsin the Nature studywere willing to contribute some of their income to fighting climate change, but respondents believed only 33% of the rest of the country were willing to do so.Fisher and other experts said making people aware that they are in fact in the majority could help them put pressure on elected officials to act against climate change.“Politicians often have much more political space than they think they do on climate change and other issues,” he said. “And so I would say this, along with climate science, provides compelling reasons for actually acting on climate.”This story is part ofthe 89%Project, an initiative of the global journalism collaborationCovering Climate NowExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisThe 89% projectCaliforniaCalifornia wildfiresUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

People who spend a lot of time under the water see it changing before their eyes,” she said.The GCRMN is collating monitoring data for a status report due out next year, but Schaffelke said even that report would not give a full picture of the impact of the event.Loop of heat map of world’s reefsAn animated heatmap showing detected temperatures across coral reefs worldwide from 1 Jan 2023 to 20 April 2025.Scientists in north and central America, including Florida, the Caribbean and Mexico, were among the first to raise the alarm after record ocean temperatures sawextreme bleaching in the northern hemisphere’s summer of 2023.Corals can recover from bleaching if temperatures are not too extreme, but surveys done in the months after the event have begun to paint a picture of widespread coral death.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

On the Pacific side of Mexico,one area lost between 50% and 93% of its corals.

In almost all cases, we ended up with a very depressing feeling when we confirmed that all or nearly all the coral had died.”Dr Valeria Pizarro, a senior coral scientist at the Perry Institute for Marine Science that works on reefs in the Bahamas and Caribbean, witnessed extreme bleaching in the Bahamas in July 2023.She said “in a blink of my eyes” shallow reefs became white landscapes, with widespread death among staghorn corals used in restoration projects. Spectacular sea fans and soft corals died quickly.“It was like they were melting with the heat,” she said.“World leaders need to really commit to reduce fossil fuels and increase investments in clean energies and make it a reality. We need them to stop having it on paper and on the news, we need it to be real.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisCoralQueenslandClimate scienceOceansMarine lifeWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

The analysis raises fears that large quantities of sanctioned wood from Russia andBelarusare still illegallyentering Britain.New research byWorld Forest ID, a consortium of research organisations that includes Kew Gardens and the World Resources Institute, scrutinised the accuracy of dozens of harvesting-origin claims on birch products, which had almost entirely been approved by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) sustainability schemes.The samples of birch – a popular hardwood used in furniture, kitchens panels and musical instruments – were labelled as originating inUkraine, Poland, Estonia and Latvia. But tests using the wood’s “chemical fingerprint” showed that 46% of certified samples did not come from the origin on the label.The birch tree is commercially grown and processed across much of northernEurope, including large parts of Russia and Belarus. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it became illegal to import Russian and Belarusian plywood and timber products into Britain and other European countries due to sanctions.While the tests did not specify the country where the wood was grown, experts saidRussiaand Belarus were the only plausible origins.“Where else could it be from?” said David Hopkins, chief executive of Timber Development UK, the industry’s trade association, reacting to the analysis.View image in fullscreenScientific tests tracing trees back to their location of origin has been used to check whether sanctioned Russian timber is circulating in EU markets.Photograph: World Forest ID“There’s a small number of companies that produce this stuff legally,” he said. “The birch trees that are in Finland are being taken up by a small number of sawmills producing birch plywood.“There’s pockets of it elsewhere in the Baltics and Scandinavia. But the bulk of it is going to be from Russia, putting money through the Russian economy and breaching sanctions while you are doing it,” Hopkins said.Certification questionsThe FSC and the PEFC are the world’s most commonly used timber certification schemes, intended to promote the sustainable management of woodland and prevent deforestation.Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, theFSC suspendedits certification for timber from Russian and Belarus, and blocked all controlled wood from the two countries. PEFC decided to classify timber from both countries as“conflict timber”, meaning they could no longer use its certification.But the new World Forest ID analysis – which was partly funded by the FSC – found that of 52 samples with a FSC or PEFC certification, 24 had an incorrect harvest claim. While tests were conducted on a relatively small number of samples, the report authors said their findings indicated that existing oversight was not sufficient to guarantee accurate claims.To test the wood, researchers used stable isotope ratio analysis, comparing the chemical makeup of the birch samples with a reference database from across northern and eastern Europe. Scientists used markers caused by differences in light, soil and water conditions to estimate the geographic origin.View image in fullscreenA birch forest. The world’s biggest certification schemes treated wood from Russia and Belarus as ‘conflict timber’ after Moscow launched the war with Ukraine.Photograph: V Kalyniuk/AlamyJade Saunders, executive director of World Forest ID, said: “The UK has been a leader in sanctions and trade laws and certification schemes but they are only as good as the tools with which they are implemented.“Chemical traceability is a whole new way of thinking about what is really in our supply chains. We know we can only solve problems if we can see them, and in this study we saw them very clearly, so it is time for the government and guardians of supply-chain integrity to step up and start solving.”The FSC said it took any indication of potential fraud seriously and welcomed the World Forest ID research, adding that it was actively investing in new techniques to ensure reliability in supply chains. It said it had no access to the names of the companies that had provided samples confidentially.The PEFC said the findings needed to be placed in context and that only 14% of the samples were associated with their certification. It said generalisations about the overall effectiveness of their sustainability schemes should not be made from the analysis.The certification schemes are the primary way that companies source sustainable wood, avoiding contributing to the destruction of rainforests and other biodiverse environments. The report raises questions about whether current certification systems are reliable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But in the months that followed,trade data showsthat exports from other countries including Kazakhstan and Turkey rose significantly.In the case of Kazakhstan, exports of plywood leapt from 600 tonnes in 2021, to 25,600 tonnes in 2022, according toUN trade statistics.Bar chart showing rise in EU imports of birch plywood from China, Kazakhstan and Turkey after sanctions were imposedIn January, the environmental organisation Earthsight publishedan investigation into birch-wood laundering, finding that a network of organisations had found a way to avoid European sanctions, with 20 container-loads of woodcontinuing to arrive every day. The Russian military and oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin profit directly from the sale of the timber, according to the report.View image in fullscreenThere is a history of illegal and unsustainable timber from unknown sources entering the supply chain, much of which has ended up on Britain’s building sites.Photograph: LendleaseSam Lawson, founding director of Earthsight and one of the report’s authors, said: “Timber is a big export for Russia; it was a big revenue earner prior to the conflict that is less well known than gas and oil.“The EU and UK have banned all imports of Russian and Belarusian wood, including products made with them. Our investigation found that those sanctions are being flouted on a massive scale.World map showing EU in blue, Russia and Belarus in red, and China, Kazakhstan and Turkey in purple“We concluded that over €1.5bn [£1.3bn] worth of illegal sanctions – blood timber, basically – has entered Europe since the sanctions took effect in 2022. A lot of the birch plywood that people were using in their kitchens, and for trendy furniture and stuff, prior to the conflict was being imported from Russia or Belarus.

At its next fiscal event in the autumn, the government will likely have to raise taxes or bend its fiscal rules if it wishes to increase defence spending further or help some departments that face very challenging budgets.”Britain has faced a rise in debt interest payments since Trump’s November election victory, amid an increase in borrowing costs for countries around the world as investors fret over the impact of the US president’s tariff policies.TheInternational Monetary Fundthis week said Trump had unleashed a “major negative shock” into the world economy since his “liberation day” announcement. Seeking a US-UK trade deal to soften the blow, Reeves is due to speak to her international counterparts at the fund’s annual spring meetings in Washington on Wednesday.The OBR warned last month that the worst-case scenario could reduce UK gross domestic product (GDP) by as much as 1% and erase Reeves’s headroom, amid a rapidly shifting global economic backdrop.Separate figures on Wednesday showed business activity fell in April at the fastest rate since November 2022 as Trump’s trade wars threaten to push the British economy into a renewed downturn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it said the difference was largely explained by lower tax receipts and higher borrowing by local authorities and central government.Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government remained committed to the chancellor’s “non-negotiable” fiscal rules. Saying that he was going through every line of public spending to “tear out waste” before the spending review in June, he added: “We are laser-focused on making sure taxpayer money is delivering our plan for change missions to put more money in people’s pockets, rebuild the NHS and strengthen our borders.”Explore more on these topicsGovernment borrowingRachel ReevesTax and spendingEconomicsOffice for National StatisticsOffice for Budget ResponsibilityTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

We will provide an update in due course.”Separately on Wednesday, it emerged that Miliband plans to ban the UK’s national energy company from investing in projects that use solar panels linked to Chinese slave labour.The energy secretary has dropped his previous opposition to rewriting thebill that would establish Great British Energyand now plans an amendment that forces the company to make sure there is no slavery or human trafficking in its supply chain.The UK government will this week co-host a major UK summit with the International Energy Agency.Explore more on these topicsEnergy billsConsumer affairsHousehold billsnewsShareReuse this content"

Most belonged to well-built young men and bore signs of brutal violence, leading experts to suspect they had uncovered a gladiator graveyard.View image in fullscreenPart of the male skeleton’s hip bone.Photograph: Unique osteological evidence for human-animal gladiatorial combat in Roman BritainOne of the skeletons, belonging to a man aged 26 to 35, was buried in a grave with two others and overlaid with horse bones. The remains showed puncture marks on the pelvis, initially thought to be animal bites. However, it took years of extensive work to confirm the injuries were inflicted by a large carnivore.The researchers scoured clinical and forensic literature for descriptions of bite marks made by various animals, but found little on the big cats Romans might have encountered. So they teamed up with zoos in Britain, which provided them with horse bones that had been chewed by cheetahs, lions, tigers and leopards for comparison.The bite marks on the man’s hip matched those made by lions, but big cats typically kill by biting their prey’s head or neck, Thompson said.“The pelvis is unusual. You can survive that injury, it’s not fatal,” he said. “We think the individual had been incapacitated and that these marks are evidence of the animal dragging the body away.”The man might have been fatally injured in combat before he was seized by the animal, Thompson added.Roman gladiators typically fought each other, but other combatants known as bestiarii would take on dangerous and exotic animals as part of the games.View image in fullscreenA researcher holds the ancient hip bone with the lesion.Photograph: Unique osteological evidence for human-animal gladiatorial combat in Roman BritainDr John Pearce, an archaeologist from King’s College London and co-author of the study published in Plos One, said York doubled as a Roman town and legionary fortress at the time, making it the second largest population centre in Britain after Londinium.He said: “These may be gladiators who trained in a gladiatorial school at York linked to the Roman legion based there, and their comrades from the arena or training ground took responsibility for burying them.”If the researchers are right, their discovery raises questions about where gladiators fought their battles.An arena probably exists beneath the city of York, but uncovering it will not be easy. “One of challenges with York is that so many old buildings are preserved, you can’t do the excavations underneath them,” Thompson said.It is not the only mystery that remains. “This shifts the conversation,” Thompson added. “We now know that these events happened in the provinces of the Roman empire, but it raises other questions. How, for example, do you get a lion from Africa to York?”Explore more on these topicsRoman BritainArchaeologyAnimalsYorknewsShareReuse this content"

He lost his life trying to save others,” the judge said.During an emotional two-day sentencing hearing at Swansea crown court, relatives of the victims claimed Lloydwas arrogantto guide the group despite the stormy conditions and her lack of expertise, and said she had shown no remorse over her failings.Lloyd, who had been at the front of the party, managed to navigate a weir in the river by shooting through a fish ramp.But other participants fell from their boards after plunging 1.3 metres over the weir. The court heard almost 2 tonnes of water was crossing a 1 metre-wide section of the weir crest every second. O’Dwyer scrambled out but died after going back into the water to try to save the others, who were all described as either beginner or intermediate paddleboarders.View image in fullscreen(Left to right) Morgan Rogers, Nicola Wheatley, Paul O’Dwyer and Andrea Powell died in the paddleboarding incident in 2021.Composite: PA/Dyfed-Powys policeThe court heard that Lloyd was suspended from South Wales police at the time of the tragedy after accepting a caution for a fraudulent insurance claim involving a vehicle.She had advertised the River Cleddau trip on Facebook for £149 a person to include overnight accommodation and supervision by two “fully” qualified instructors.But Lloyd did not carry out risk assessments or obtain next-of-kin details for the victims – leading to a delay in contacting some family members, the court heard.The incident led to calls for regulations around paddleboarding to be tightened.Darren Wheatley, the husband of Nicola Wheatley, said: “Losing Nicola has devastated our family and two young children lost their mammy.“Nicola died in circumstances that were completely avoidable and should not have happened. Decisions made by Nerys Lloyd, and only Nerys Lloyd, led to the four lives lost.“Any sentence served by Nerys in prison will never ease the pain of losing Nicola, and our lives will never be the same again.”One woman who was part of the group but survived, Melody Johns, told the court: “Paddleboarding is largely unregulated and boards are still being sold without quick-release leashes that can save lives. Many people are continuing to buy boards without much thought about safety. Something needs to change.”Explore more on these topicsWalesCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

Its submission said: “We are concerned with specific cases in which members might hold paid contracts of employment with media organisations that give rise to conflicts of interest and attention, both in the sense that the house is responsible for the laws governing our media and that such members would be monetising their offices for private gain. Such a practice can harm the reputation of the house, further eroding public confidence in our institutions.”Analysis by the Guardian recently found six MPs had spent on averageone working day a weekon second jobs since the start of the 2024 parliament, with the Reform MPs Nigel Farage and Lee Anderson taking on lucrative jobs as presenters for GB News, as well as other work.The government’s official backing for Greenberg’s suggested principles comes after Lucy Powell, the leader of the House of Commons, asked the standards committee to look at MPs’ outside interests and gave evidence suggesting she would support such a system.Labour’s position on outside interests has significantly changed since Keir Starmer said in 2021 that he wanted to “ban all second jobs for MPs, with very limited exceptions”. In its manifesto, Labour said it wanted to “take forward urgent work on the restrictions that need to be put in place to prevent MPs from taking up roles that stop them serving their constituents and the country”, including closingloopholes on lobbying.At one point, Boris Johnson’s Conservative government considered time limits on outside interests, but this waslater dropped.In its submission, the government said it did not support setting limits on types of jobs or hours or creating a list of banned professions. It said: “Whilst these approaches may be easily understood and enforced, they could create unfairness in the system, and any list could never cover all eventualities. As such, the government does not believe this is the right approach to deal with the nuances of this matter.”The Committee on Standards in Public Life, an advisory body on ethics, told the committee that itbacked the ideaof “reasonable limits”, with indicative limits on earnings and time, such as not taking on work that was the equivalent of more than one day a week.In other evidence, a string of Conservative MPs made arguments in favour of allowing outside interests. The shadow Treasury minister Richard Fullermade the casethat it was “flawed” to suggest being a constituency MP was a full-time job.He wrote: “Around 100 MPs simultaneously serve as ministers, taking on full-time roles while maintaining their constituency responsibilities. Furthermore, much constituency work is effectively handled by staff.”Kevin Hollinrake, the shadow housing and communities secretary, who is a shareholder in a lettings and estate agency firm,wrote to the committee: “It is unrealistic to expect business owners to divest themselves of their interests before even considering entering parliament. A prohibition on outside interests would prove a significant deterrent from other business people entering the world of politics.”However, some of those who provided evidence to the committee suggested the “principles-based” system backed by the government might not go far enough.Transparency International UKsaid: “Allowing MPs to take up second jobs outside the boundaries of simply maintaining their professional qualifications leaves them open to corruption risks such as favouritism and quid pro quo arrangements. As it stands, jobs such as consultancy roles or non-executive director roles are still permitted.”Prof David Hine, a tutor in politics at the University of Oxford, flaggedconcernsthat a principle-based system could create “scope for ambiguity and misunderstanding which could discredit any proposals intended to tighten restrictions”.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsHouse of CommonsLabourConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

She was also asked to step back from her role on the executive until the conclusion of the investigation, according to the Jewish Chronicle.Astatement from the boardsaid the letter was “not representative” of its policy on Israel. A special meeting of its executive committee was convened on Tuesday to “discuss the ramifications and consequences of this act”.The committee voted unanimously to open a complaints procedure, which is expected to take at least four weeks, the board said.The signatories to the letter, which was published by theFinancial Times, said they could no longer “turn a blind eye or remain silent” over the war in Gaza. “Israel’s soul is being ripped out”, they said.They added: “The inclination to avert our eyes is strong, as what is happening is unbearable, but our Jewish values compel us to stand up and to speak out.”Since the start of the war, after the attacks by Hamas against Israelis on 7 October 2023, statements by the Board of Deputies have been broadly supportive of the Israeli government.After the executive committee meeting this week, Phil Rosenberg, the board’s president, said: “We take alleged breaches of the code of conduct very seriously … The Board of Deputies is clear: only our democratically elected honorary officers and authorised staff speak on behalf of the organisation.”Last week, Michael Wegier, the board’s chief executive, said a group of deputies had “aired their views in a national publication, specifically in their capacity as deputies, leading them to an incorrect assumption by a significant number of people in our community and beyond that this group is putting forward the board’s official position, which it is not.”In an article in theJewish Chronicle, he added: “Taking the legitimate and often painful debate within our community to the letters pages of national newspapers, and sowing confusion about the position of the community as a whole, is a shortsighted and dangerous precedent.”Most of the letter’s signatories belong to Reform, Liberal or Masorti communities. Many of the complaints reportedly came from members of the United Synagogue, the largest communal denomination in the UK.Goldenberg has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsUK newsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelJudaismnewsShareReuse this content"

The court heard she would be scarred for life.Mulvanny said a search of the defendant’s home found a number of knives, several hidden. Analysis of his mobile phone revealed 69 files of YouTube videos, news articles and podcasts focused on murders and child killings.This included the “Valentine’s Day massacre” at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in 2018 in which 17 people were killed. He had also looked up the rioting in the aftermath of themurder of three girls at a dance class in Southport in July 2024, and a day after the killings he had clicked on a link for a local dance class, the court heard.At 1.25am on 20 August 2024, the day of his attack on the girl, Wilkes looked up the case of 14-year-old Aiden Fucci, who stabbed to death a 13-year-old, Tristyn Bailey, in Florida in May 2021.In April 2016 Wilkes had been given a 14-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, for a ‘‘brutal” assault causing actual bodily harm on an eight-year-old boy. In October 2020 he was suspected of setting a pram on fire.Sentencing Wilkes for attempted murder and possession of a knife, Judge Mousley told him: “You are a dangerous offender. You had an interest in child-killing and you decided to try it out for yourself.”Wilkes was convicted by a jury. During the trial, the girl said: “I saw him reach into his pocket, I didn’t know that it was a knife, he hid it with his arm behind him then he came at us. He came running at me. He grabbed hold of my arm, really tight, so I couldn’t escape and he was aiming for this area [pointing to her neck].”Nick Robinson, defending, said Wilkes lived an “isolated” life with his mother and had a low IQ. He said the attack had been “unplanned and spontaneous”.In a statement read out after sentencing, the girl’s parents praised their daughter for her “resilience, bravery, endurance, strength, power and determination”.Explore more on these topicsCrimeDorsetSouthport attacknewsShareReuse this content"

The new licence “shows that a copyright exception is neither necessary nor desirable”, said the ALCS.The government’s proposal “would give very limited choice, wouldn’t remunerate creators or provide any transparency about which works are being used”, said Hayes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

China imposed the levies in retaliation to the White House’s 145% rate that threatens to significantly slow down the world economy.Kelly Ortberg, Boeing’s chief executive, said he hoped “over time these tariffs can be resolved”, in a call with investors on Wednesday. He was speaking after the company announced that losses for the first quarter of 2025 had narrowed to $31m (£23.4m), compared with $355m a year earlier.He added that Boeing and Airbus, its main rival, would favour a “non-tariff environment”, in stark contrast to Trump, who believes – contrary to the overwhelming consensus of economists – that tariffs willrestore US manufacturing to global dominance.Ortberg said “many of our customers in China have indicated they are not taking delivery”. However, Boeing has already received queries from airlines outside China for some of the planes. The company is seeking to “re-market” them and, if necessary, to repaint planes with different airlines’ colours.Production has already started on 41 aircraft originally destined for China, with another nine planned for delivery this year.“It’s an unfortunate situation, but we have many customers who want near-term deliveries,” Ortberg said. The manufacturer has 5,600 planes on order as airlines around the world forecast strong growth.Overall demand for planes has not been dented by the tariffs so far, Ortberg said. That has allowed the company to continue with plans to raise production of its bestselling 737 Max to 38 each month, despite the tariffs. Boeing’s share price rose by 5.7% on Wednesday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is criminally charged with forcing oral sex on her in 2006, but she also accused him in a civil lawsuit of groping her against her will four years earlier, when she was 16.Like the two other accusers in the case, Sokola alleges a complex series of encounters and reactions – being sexually assaulted, yet staying in touch, wary of Weinstein but wanting to remain on good terms with a power broker who dangled the possibility of an acting career.“Why did the defendant hold this level of power and control in the eyes of these three women? … It’s becauseHarvey Weinsteindefined the field,” prosecutor Shannon Lucey told jurors in an opening statement. “He knew how tempting promises of success were. He produced, he choreographed, he therefore directed their ultimate silence for years.”Weinstein has pleaded not guilty, and defense lawyer Arthur Aidala countered by portraying the accusers as willing partners in a showbiz quid pro quo.“The casting couch is not a crime scene,” Aidala told the majority-female jury. He compared prosecutors’ allegations to the preview of a movie that “falls flat on its face”.The 73-year-old Weinstein, seated in the wheelchair he now uses because of health problems, did not look at Lucey or the jury during her presentation before the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, and others in a packed courtroom audience. But Weinstein watched intently as Aidala outlined his defense.The retrial is happening because New York’s top court last year threw out Weinstein’s conviction, which in 2020 was a watershed moment for the#MeToo movementagainst sexual misconduct. The high court found that the previous trial judge had allowed prejudicial testimony about allegations that were separate from the charges.Weinstein’s retrial is playing out at a different cultural moment than the first. #MeToo, which exploded in 2017 with allegations against Weinstein, has evolved and ebbed.At the start of Weinstein’s first trial, chants of “rapist” could be heard from protesters outside. This time, there was none of that.Nevertheless, Sokola’s lawyer, Lindsay Goldbrum, has called Weinstein’s retrial a “signal to other survivors that the system is catching up – and that it’s worth speaking out even when the odds seem insurmountable”.While this jury will not hear about the allegations that got the first conviction thrown out, the panel is expected to hear from Sokola. After the high court sent the case back for retrial, prosecutors added a criminal-sex-act charge based on her allegations.The Polish-born Sokola met Weinstein in 2002 after traveling alone to New York for a modeling trip aged 16, according to prosecutors. She alleges he invited her to lunch to discuss potential acting jobs but detoured to his apartment and demanded she take off her shirt if she wanted to make it in the movie business. Then, Sokola alleges, Weinstein fondled her while making her touch his genitals.Over the next few years, Sokola stayed in contact with Weinstein, even after telling him off for allegedly groping her in a car around 2004, Lucey told jurors. She said Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra and talk to the stars of the 2007 romcom The Nanny Diaries, and she invited him to lunch with her visiting sister, hoping to impress the sibling.After the lunch, he lured Sokola to his Manhattan hotel room by saying he had scripts for her to see, ordered her to undress, held her down on a bed and performed oral sex on her while she tearfully implored him not to do so, Lucey said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lucey told jurors that power imbalances often “cause victims to behave in ways that laypersons possibly might not expect”.‘I want to talk about it honestly’: trauma of Weinstein’s unknown British victims is revealedRead moreAfter other allegations emerged against Weinstein in 2017, Sokola sued. Prosecutors said she received $3.5m in compensation.Aidala said Sokola and the other accusers had been “trying to take advantage of Mr Weinstein when he was at the top”, then benefited from making allegations “when he was headed toward the bottom”.Outside court, Sokola’s attorney decried Weinstein’s defense as full of “victim blaming” and “rape myths”.In addition to the charge related to Sokola, Weinstein is being retried on a criminal-sex-act charge for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on then production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006, and a third-degree rape charge for allegedly assaulting then aspiring actor Jessica Mann in 2013.Weinstein’s 2020 acquittals on two other charges – predatory sexual assault and first-degree rape – still stand.The Associated Press generally does not identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley, Mann and Sokola have done.Explore more on these topicsUS newsHarvey Weinstein#MeToo movementWomenGenderRape and sexual assaultUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Pakistan has denied involvement in the attack and said its prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, would chair a national security committee meeting on Thursday to respond.View image in fullscreenA candlelit vigil was held on Wednesday in Srinagar to condemn the attack.Photograph: Adnan Abidi/ReutersIndian security forces fanned out across the Himalayan region of Kashmir on Wednesday as the army and police launched a massive manhunt for the perpetrators of the attack on Tuesday that killed at least 26 tourists, all men.Amid rapidly rising tensions in the region, which has been riven by militant violence since the start of an anti-Indian insurgency in 1989, survivors said the militants had asked men they had rounded up to recite Islamic verses before executing those who couldn’t.Asavari Jagdale, from India’s western state of Maharashtra, who lost her father and uncle in the attack, told local media that she and her family hid inside a nearby tent along with other tourists when the shooting started.When the militants reached their tent, Asavari said, they asked her father, Santosh Jagdale, to come out and recite an Islamic verse. “When he failed to do so, they pumped three bullets into him, one on the head, one behind the ear and another in the back,” she said. “My uncle was next to me. The terrorists fired four to five bullets into him.”Debasish Bhattacharyya, a Hindu who teaches at Assam University and who grew up in a Muslim neighbourhood in the state, told Reuters he had been spared because he was familiar with Islamic verses.The militants ordered him and those nearby on to their knees and when the others started chanting the verses, he followed along.“I knew the words and at that moment it was probably the only way to save our lives. Those who failed were killed,” he said, adding that they fled when the gunmen left, and trekked through a forest for two hours.A little-known militant group, the Kashmir Resistance, claimed responsibility for the attack. Posting on social media, it expressed discontent that more than 85,000 “outsiders” had been settled in the region, spurring a “demographic change”.The attack, reportedly involving four gunmen, took place in a meadow in the Pahalgam area of the scenic Himalayan federal territory. The dead were 25 Indians and one Nepalese national. It was the worst attack on civilians in India since the 2008 Mumbai shootings.View image in fullscreenSecurity personnel inspect the site in the aftermath of the attack in Pahalgam.Photograph: Basit Zargar/Zuma Press/Rex/ShutterstockThe prime minister, Narendra Modi, cut short a two-day visit to Saudi Arabia and returned to Delhi on Wednesday morning. He held a meeting with his national security adviser, the foreign minister and other senior officials at the airport, and a special security cabinet meeting was called for later on Wednesday.The incident is being viewed as a major escalation in the regional conflict, in which attacks targeting tourists have been rare. The last deadly attack took place in June 2024 when at least nine people were killed and 33 injured after militants caused a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims to plunge into a deep gorge.The Kashmir Resistance claimed those attacked on Tuesday “were not ordinary tourists; instead, they were linked to and affiliated with Indian security agencies”.The attack prompted an immediate exodus of tourists from the region, with airlines operating extra flights from Srinagar, the summer capital of the territory. Local television showed tourists carrying their bags to taxis and filing out of a hotel in Srinagar.“How can we continue our trip in such a situation?” Sameer Bhardwaj, a tourist from Delhi, said to the news agency ANI. “We need to prioritise our safety. We can only travel if our minds are relaxed but everyone is tense here. So we cannot continue to travel.”Gulzar Ahmad, a taxi driver in Pahalgam, said: “This attack will impact our work but we are more concerned about the loss of lives. No matter what we do in the future, our tourism industry has been stained by this attack. The perpetrators must receive exemplary punishment so that no one dares to commit such an act again.”The attack occurred during a four-day visit to India by the US vice-president, JD Vance, who called it a “devastating terrorist attack”.Omar Abdullah, the region’s top elected official, posted on social media: “It’s heartbreaking to see the exodus of our guests from the [Kashmir] valley after yesterday’s tragic terror attack in Pahalgam. But at the same time, we totally understand why people would want to leave.”View image in fullscreenThe market street in Pahalgam was empty on Wednesday morning, a day after the attack.Photograph: Basit Zargar/Zuma Press/Rex/ShutterstockThere has been an increase in the number of targeted killings of Hindus, including migrant workers from other Indian states, in the disputed Himalayan region since Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party government unilaterally revoked Kashmir’s limited autonomy in 2019 by imposing a communication blockade and jailing activists and political leaders.It split the state into two federally administered territories – Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh – and allowed local authorities to issue domicile certificates to outsiders, enabling them to apply for jobs and buy land. Since then, civil liberties and media freedom in the region have been severely curtailed.Pakistan’s foreign office spokesperson, Shafqat Khan, issued a statement saying Pakistan was “concerned about the loss of tourists’ lives in the attack”, and extended condolences to the victims.Explore more on these topicsIndiaPakistanKashmirSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

For years, he prominently displayed a photo in his living room of Baruch Goldstein, who massacred 29 Muslim worshippers in Hebron in 1994.In 2022, the Biden administration condemned Ben-Gvir’s visit to the memorial ofviolently racist and anti-Palestinian rabbi Meir Kahane, whom the national security minister was a follower of in his youth.“Celebrating the legacy of a terrorist organization is abhorrent. There is no other word for it,” US state department spokesperson Ned Price saidat the time. “We urge all parties to maintain calm, exercise restraint, and to refrain from actions that only serve to exacerbate tensions and that includes in Jerusalem.”But since joining Netanyahu’s coalition government, Ben-Gvir has continued his provocations, including an inflammatory visit to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound last year – also a historically significant and highly venerated holy site in Judaism – that drew international outrage and a rebukefrom Netanyahu himselflast summer. Ben-Gvir again visited the Al-Aqsa mosque earlier this month,prompting more outragein the region.The White House did not return a request for comment.Following Yale, Ben Gvir wasexpected to addressa gathering on New York’s Upper East Side, focusing on “securing Israel post-October 7th”.Explore more on these topicsIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuYale UniversityTrump administrationMar-a-LagoUS politicsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The strike ignited a huge fire that claimed most of the casualties, said a civil defence spokesperson, Mahmoud Bassal.The Qatari network Al Jazeera and Palestinian media broadcast footage of several bodies wrapped in white shrouds at al-Shifa hospital’s morgue, and women weeping over the body of a child.“We were sleeping and suddenly something exploded, we started looking and found the whole school on fire, the tents here and there were on fire, everything was on fire,” a witness, Umm Mohammed al-Hwaiti, told Reuters.“People were shouting and men were carrying people, charred [people], charred children, and were walking and saying ‘dear God, dear God, we have no one but you’. What can we say? Dear God, only,” she said.Unusually, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not comment on the school attack. Israeli officials say fighters from Hamas and allied factions hide behind civilian infrastructure, claims that the Palestinian militant group denies.Israel has renewed its aerial and ground campaign since the collapse of a two-month-old ceasefire and hostage and prisoner release swap in mid-March. Since then, according to the UN, nearly 2,000 people have been killed and another 420,000 forced to leave their homes or shelters as Israel seizes ever-larger swathes of the territory for what it terms security buffer zones.More than 51,300 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory offensive after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and another 250 taken captive. Fifty-nine hostages remain in Gaza.Israel imposed a total blockade on the strip two weeks before it unilaterally restarted the fighting. Food, water, fuel and medicine are now running critically low, leading aid agencies to declare that Gaza’s already devastating humanitarian crisis is worse than ever.On Wednesday, the foreign ministers of the UK, France and Germany urged Israel to stop blocking aid into Gaza, warning of “an acute risk of starvation, epidemic disease and death”.“Humanitarian aid must never be used as a political tool and Palestinian territory must not be reduced nor subjected to any demographic change,” the ministers said. The joint statement – unusually strong criticism from some of Israel’s closest allies – came several weeks after similar calls from the UN, EU and Arab states.Efforts led by Qatari and Egyptian mediators to resume talks aimed at a ceasefire and ending the war have not yet led to a breakthrough. Reports of a new plan emerged on Wednesday that would include a truce of between five and seven years, and the release of the rest of the Israeli hostages seized in October 2023.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Israel has not responded to the invitation to another round of indirect negotiations.There has been little sign that either side is willing to move closer on fundamental issues such as the disarmament of Hamas or the withdrawal of Israeli troops, although it is believed mediators are under pressure from Washington to show progress before Donald Trump’s visit to the Middle East next month.The president of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA), Mahmoud Abbas, made a rare intervention in the conflict on Wednesday, calling for Hamas to free the Israeli hostages and saying their captivity provided Israel with “excuses” to attack Gaza.Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, called Abbas’s remarks “insulting”. Hamas and Abbas’s secular Fatah party, which dominates the semi-autonomous Palestinian Authority, fought a brief civil war in 2007 that resulted in Hamas seizing control of Gaza.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Subjects on the agenda are expected to include security, defence, Ukraine, tariffs and trade.The Nordic country’s minister for research and higher education, Sigrun Aasland, said: “It is important for Norway to be proactive in a demanding situation for academic freedom. We can make a difference for outstanding researchers and important knowledge, and we want to do that as quickly as possible.”Aasland added: “Academic freedom is under pressure in the US, and it is an unpredictable position for many researchers in what has been the world’s leading knowledge nation for many decades.”The research council said it would put out a call for proposals next month including in the areas of climate, health, energy and artificial intelligence.The scheme is planned to take place over several years, with 100m kroner set aside for 2026.Mari Sundli Tveit, the chief executive of the research council, told broadcaster NRK: “This is particularly relevant to the situation in the US. Academic freedom is under pressure and funding is being cut.”Other countries to take similar action include France, wherenearly 300 academicshave applied to Aix-Marseille University after it offered to take US-based researchers, and the former French president François Hollande called for the creation of a “scientific refugee” status for compromised academics.The Belgian university Vrije Universiteit Brussel has also opened up new postdoctoral positions targeted at Americans, and the Netherlands has said it plans to launch a fund to attract researchers there.Explore more on these topicsAcademicsNorwayEuropeUniversitiesHigher educationFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

The interior minister, Ali Yerlikaya, said the earthquake lasted 13 seconds and was followed by more than 50 aftershocks, the strongest measuring 5.9 magnitude.The quake happened at 12.49pm on Wednesday, during a public holiday when many children were out of school and celebrating in the streets of Istanbul. Panicked residents rushed from their homes and buildings into the streets. The disaster and emergency management agency urged people to stay away from buildings.“Due to panic, 151 of our citizens were injured from jumping from heights,” the Istanbul governor’s office said in a statement. “Their treatments are ongoing in hospitals and they are not in life-threatening condition.”View image in fullscreenPeople gather in a park after a powerful earthquake in Istanbul on Wednesday.Photograph: Tolga Bozoğlu/EPAMany residents flocked to parks, schoolyards and other open areas to avoid being near buildings in case of collapse or subsequent earthquakes. Some people pitched tents in parks.The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said at an event marking the National Sovereignty and Children’s Day holiday: “Thank God, there does not seem to be any problems for now. May God protect our country and our people from all kinds of calamities, disasters, accidents and troubles.”Leyla Ucar, a personal trainer, said she had been exercising with her student on the 20th floor of a building when they felt intense shaking.“We shook incredibly. It threw us around, we couldn’t understand what was happening, we didn’t think of an earthquake at first because of the shock of the event,” she said. “It was very scary.”Senol Sari, 51, told Associated Press he had been with his children in the living room of their third-floor apartment when he heard a loud noise and the building started shaking. They fled to a nearby park. “We immediately protected ourselves from the earthquake and waited for it to pass,” Sari said. “Of course, we were scared.”They later were able to return home calmly, Sari said, but they are worried that a bigger quake will someday strike the city. He said it was “an expected earthquake, our concerns continue”.Cihan Boztepe, 40, was one of many who fled to the streets with his family in order to avoid a potential collapse. Standing next to his sobbing child, Boztepe said that in 2023 he had been living in Batman province, an area close to the southern part ofTurkey, where major quakes struck at the time, and that Wednesday’s tremor felt weaker and that he wasn’t as scared.“At first we were shaken, then it stopped, then we were shaken again. My children were a little scared but I wasn’t. We quickly gathered our things and went down to a safe place. If it were up to me, we would have already returned home,” he said.Yerlikaya said authorities had not received reports of collapsed buildings. He told Habertürk television that there had been reports of damage to buildings.Turkey is crossed by two major faultlines and earthquakes are frequent. A7.8-magnitude earthquakeon 6 February 2023, and a second powerful tremor hours later, destroyed or damaged hundreds of thousands of buildings in 11 southern and south-eastern provinces, leaving more than 53,000 people dead. Another 6,000 people were killed in the northern parts of neighbouring Syria.Explore more on these topicsTurkeyEarthquakesnewsShareReuse this content"

Writing on X, where he is known for his lengthy and sometimes late-night posts, Petro criticized the press and said he had better things to do than spend time with his foreign minister while visiting the French capital.“Isn’t Paris full of parks, museums, bookstores, more interesting than the letter’s writer, to spend two days in? Almost everything in Paris is more interesting. Don’t I have daughters and granddaughters in Paris who are far more interesting than the writer?” Petro wrote.Leyva’s letter sparked a political firestorm in Colombia, with newspapers stamping his claims across their homepages.Writing in El Tiempo, the journalist Juan Sebastián Lombo Delgado, said that never before in recent Colombian history had a key ex-member of the government publicly questioned “the faculties” of his former boss.Congresswoman Katherine Miranda told the same newspaper the “grave” accusations would be irrelevant “if we were talking about any old person – but we are talking about the head of state”.In 2023, after similar allegations from a Colombian journalist, Colombia’s president responded: “The only thing I am addicted to is a morning coffee.”Earlier this year Petro claimed cocaine – a drug Colombia produces more of than any other country – was “no worse than whiskey” and was only illegal because it was made in Latin America. Cocaine production has soared since he took office nearly three years ago. According to the UN office on drugs and crime there wasa 53% potential increasein cocaine production during 2022, with production reaching 2,664 metric tons.Colombia risks return to violent past, says architect of landmark peace dealRead moreThe claims came as Petro again locked horns with Donald Trump, with whom he had avery public falling out earlier this year over deportation flights.The row between Petro and Trump began at 3.41am local time in Colombia, on 26 January, when the former took to X to condemn the US’s treatment of Colombian migrants and announce he would not allow US planes to land in his country.Trump responded swiftly and ferociously, threatening visa restrictions and tariffs unless Petro backed down, which he quickly did.On Tuesday, Petro said he believed the US had now “taken away” his visa and claimed he could no longer travel there. “I’ve already seen Donald Duck numerous times so I’ll go see other things,” he added sarcastically.Explore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But the group said it did not support the “exploitation of the pain of victims for propaganda purposes in an effort to cover up injustices being committed against innocent Venezuelans, either inside or outside of the country”.The committee opposed those incarcerated being “played with” or “used as a political resource to make invisible the inhumane conditions” in which prisoners were being detained in both countries.Bukele repeated his offer on Tuesday after Maduro’s administration rejected what it called his “cynical” gambit, with Venezuela’s top prosecutorcallingEl Salvador’s president a “tyrannical” human trafficker.Scores of Venezuelan immigrants have been deported to El Salvador since mid-March without due process, withDonald Trump’s officials accusing them of being dangerous terrorists and gang members. However, the administration has produced little evidence for those claims and many of the detainees – who were at least initially held in a maximum-security prison called the Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot) –appear to have no criminal background. Their relatives insist they are innocent.“First they were supposedly alleged terrorists – and now they are no longer terrorists, they’re part of a political exchange,” complained Suárez, who believed the Venezuelan migrants were being treated by Bukele “as if they were animals”.Adelys Ferro, a Florida-based Venezuelan American activist who runs an advocacy group called the Venezuelan-American Caucus, said she also wanted freedom for both Venezuela’s political prisoners and the innocent immigrants being held in El Salvador.Ferro slammed Bukele’s “painful and disgusting” political stunt. “What he’s trying to do – to negotiate innocent Venezuelans back and forth with the Maduro dictatorship – is despicable,” Ferro said.“We cannot celebrate two authoritarians negotiating back and forth with Venezuelan lives.”Explore more on these topicsEl SalvadorVenezuelaTrump administrationDonald TrumpNicolás MaduroUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It also took an active role in demonstrations in Amman, Jordan’s capital, against Israel’s war in Gaza.Last year, Human Rights Watch criticised Jordanian authorities for arresting and harassing “scores of Jordanians” who participated in the pro-Palestine protests or posted online in support of them.Jordan’s government has been outspoken against the war in Gaza, expelling Israel’s ambassador and consistently calling for an end to the humanitarian siege on the territory.Protesters have called for the government to scrap the peace treaty between the two countries, cancel an unpopular gas deal and end all exports to Israel.The Muslim Brotherhood and its ally in Gaza, Hamas, have seen a surge in popularity among Jordanians since the start of the war. Jordan expelled Hamas’s leadership and shut its offices in 1999, and it views the group’s growing popularity among its own population warily.Authorities searched the headquarters and branches of the IAF across the country on Wednesday. A week earlier, authorities arrested Khaled al-Johani, the office director of the IAF.Wael Sakka, the IAF’s general secretary, told the Guardian that the group’s work would continue despite the ban on the Muslim Brotherhood.“Our party has no organisational link with any other entity and we are in compliance with the provisions of the constitution, the political parties law and Jordanian law,” Sakka said.Farraya said the government was committed to guaranteeing freedom of expression and political activity in accordance with the law. The country’s cybercrime unit later said publishing anything on social media relating to the Muslim Brotherhood would be met with legal action.Rights groups have warned of a steady erosion of civic space in Jordan in recent years, with Freedom House downgrading the country from “partially free” to “not free” in 2021 due to its crackdown on civil society.The passing of a new cybercrime law in 2023 that criminalised speech on social media that “undermined national unity” drew criticism from rights groups.Explore more on these topicsJordanMuslim BrotherhoodMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

There is the mystery, the ritual, the vestments; the spectacle of a lone, fragile human being poised over an abyss of history and good and evil; the elevation of one flawed man to a position of supreme authority, an exaltation whose parallel to the crucifixion is sensed but not acknowledged.Discussing the onscreen representation of the pope in Conclave would risk the blasphemy of spoilerism but there have been many popes on screen, some cheekily fictional, many factual. Many a heavyweight British thesp has turned in a gamey cameo as some hooded-eyed Renaissance pontiff. Peter O’Toole was the lizardly and capricious Paul III in TV’s The Tudors (2007), presiding over a simperingly submissive 16th-century court of cardinals. Jeremy Irons was a small-screen Alexander VI inThe Borgias(2011), a family member whose face radiated sensual refinement and hauteur.If the pope has to be a minor or supporting character, it is easier to play him as a baddie. Rex Harrison was a very stately and boring Julius II, the so-called Warrior Pope in Carol Reed’s The Agony and the Ecstasy (1965), always being shouted at by Charlton Heston’s Michelangelo while he is trying to get on with painting the Sistine Chapel ceiling.View image in fullscreenSensual refinement and hauteur … Jeremy Irons as Alexander VI and Lotte Verbeek as Giulia Farnese in The Borgias.Photograph: c Showtime/Everett/Rex FeatureIn the real world, the successor to the late Pope Francis will undoubtedly have seen a pope on film or TV, and seen the actor do the signature screen-pope moment: the camera follows behind, maybe in slow-mo as the cheering gets louder and, clad in his unfamiliar robes, he emerges for the first time on the balcony overlooking St Peter’s Square as the senior cardinal intones “Habemus Papam” – “We have a pope” – and introduces him by his chosen name. From the new pope’s POV, behind his head, we see the thousands of extras – or more likely CGI images. Pope Francis’s successor must do it for real.Jonathan Pryce’s wonderfully sympathetic, humorous performance in Fernando Meirelles’sThe Two Popes(2019) as Francis – or as he is for the most of the film Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio – must surely have set the tone for memories of the late pope, at least for the secular unbelieving world. Pryce’s future pontiff is discreet, frank, humble, yet troubled, with a demotic man-of-the-people touch which irritates and yet fascinates the incumbent pope, the intensely conservative Benedict XVI, played by Anthony Hopkins. Pryce’s screen Francis is a nice guy, without the flashes of temper that he is said to have shown in the real world, the Francis that thought it was all right to punch someone who insults your mother. When Benedict resigns, it is these two men who have to share the Holy See as the two popes. This unique double act allows the movie camera to explore a profound mystery – what is it like to be pope, to see the pope as the pope sees the pope? The movie shows one pope hearing confession from another.View image in fullscreenUnique double act … Anthony Hopkins as Pope Benedict XVI and Jonathan Pryce as Cardinal Bergoglio in The Two Popes.Photograph: Peter Mountain/APImportantly,The Two Popesstarts with Cardinal Bergoglio’s Michael Corleone moment. The movie imagines Bergoglio wanting to retire as Cardinal, to retreat from the politics and show of church power – which Benedict will not countenance. Similarly, Fiennes’s Cardinal Lawrence begins Conclave by wanting to resign as dean of the college of cardinals. This initial “resignation” impulse naturally signals the very real possibility or even certainty of becomingcapo di tutti capi. Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, confesses his terrible sins in Coppola’s The Godfather Part III to Cardinal Lamberto – a fictional character who, harrowed by Corleone’s crimes, later becomes an imagined version of Pope John Paul I, and fatefully looks into the Vatican’s corruption scandals like his real namesake. Anthony Quinn’s fictional pope in The Shoes of the Fisherman (1965) follows the same “Corleone” narrative path to the top.The unwilling or unworthy pope is a screen tradition. Poor John Paul I, who died so soon after his elevation, is an inspiration for Nanni Moretti’s We Have a Pope, in which Michel Piccoli plays the fictional Cardinal Melville, who finds the top job thrust upon him and succumbs to stage-fright. The film is very good at showing how, during the conclave, most Cardinals are obviously yearning not to have this terrible burden placed upon them.Movie history’s most outrageous reluctant pope is Robbie Coltrane’s David I, in Peter Richardson’s farcical comedy The Pope Must Die (1991) – widely re-titled as The Pope Must Diet to avoid giving offence. The film interestingly takes its cue from the technicality that a new pope does not theoretically need to be a cardinal. Coltrane’s antihero is a rackety but basically honest priest, Dave Albinizi, who is accidentally elevated to the Holy See through a bizarre mistake and, like Lamberto in The Godfather Part III, is under pressure from the mob for looking too hard into Vatican bribery and corruption.View image in fullscreenFantastical … Jude Law as Pius XIII and John Malkovich as Sir John Brannox in The Young Pope’s sequel, The New Pope.Photograph: HBO/Gianni Fiorito/PAFor sheer hilarity and outrage, however, there is the fantastical Pius XIII, formerly Cardinal Lenny Belardo, played byJude Lawin Paolo Sorrentino’s streaming TV drama The Young Pope. We see this new pope smoking cigarettes – a shocking image, perhaps, although John XXIII and Benedict XVI were both smokers – and even treats us to the extraordinary vision of the pontiff striding along the beach, super buff, clad in nothing but tiny white Speedos.And how about the patriarchy and misogyny of Catholic rule? Many female stars have played the legendary and mythic Pope Joan, who supposedly ruled with her gender a secret for two years in the ninth century – Liv Ullmann was Pope Joan in 1972: pale and determined, an unworldly version of Joan of Arc.To be pope is to take an above-the-title lead role in a problematic franchise which many think should be revamped. It is a thankless and demanding role where the reviews come in at the very beginning and the very end.Perhaps someone like Peter Morgan could create a new movie, entitled Great Again, in which Jonathan Pryce can reprise his great performance as Francis, takinghis final meeting: with the oleaginous and uncomprehending JD Vance, played by, perhaps, Sam Rockwell. The ageing man of gentle wisdom tries to get through to the heartbreakingly childlike and vain vice-president, advising him on ways of buying his soul back.Explore more on these topicsFilmJonathan PryceRalph FiennesJude LawAnthony HopkinsRobbie ColtraneJeremy IronsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Messy also topped charts in Australia, Ireland and beyond and peaked at number 14 in the US.It has been streamed more than 500m times on Spotify, with listeners drawn to Young’s frank assessment of her own failings, and her compelling (and quite sweary) tale of a toxic relationship: “And I’m too perfect ’til I show you that I’m not / A thousand people I could be for you and you hate the fucking lot,” the chorus concludes.Despite the east Londoner’s seemingly overnight success, she has been in the UK music scene for years, performing gigs around the capital since around 2018. Her soulful sound caught the attention of Nick Shymansky, Amy Winehouse’s former manager, and Nick Huggett, who first signed Adele – the two became her managers.Her cover of Together in Electric Dreams was featured in the 2021 John Lewis Christmas advert, and she also featured on Tyler, The Creator’s 2024 Chromakopia album.Young’s collaborator Conor Dickinson earns two nominations for his contributions to her work.Also nominated for best song musically and lyrically is Orla Gartland with her first nomination at the awards (for Mine),Laura Marling(Child of Mine), Fontaines DC (In the Modern World) and Raye, last year’s winner of songwriter of the year (Genesis).Up for best album this year alongside Young isCharli xcxfor her cultural phenomenon album Brat, which reached No 1 in the UK, Australia and Ireland and No 3 in the US. It dominated summer 2024, leading to the trend of “Brat Summer” and a viral dance craze to its song Apple. Other best album nominees are Berwyn (for Who Am I), Jordan Rakei (The Loop) and Ghetts (On Purpose, With Purpose), the latter also nominated in the best contemporary song category for that album’s Sampha collaboration, Double Standards.Rap is well represented in that category, with Pa Salieu and Bashy joiningGhetts, plus singer-songwriter Sans Soucis and pop star Jade, who won the Brit award for pop act at 2025’s awards.Nominees for most performed work, acknowledging commercial success, are Harry Styles (As It Was, which won two years ago and is in its third year of nomination), Dua Lipa (Houdini), Cassö,Raye& D-Block Europe (Prada), Myles Smith (Stargazing) and Wham! (Last Christmas) – 21 years after George Michael was last nominated in that category.Music from The Substance, Kneecap, Rivals and The Casting of Frank Stone has been acknowledged in the film, TV and video game categories.The awards are celebrating their 70th year on 22 May at Grosvenor House in London.The Ivors 2025 nominationsBest albumCharli xcx – Brat (written by Charli xcx, AG Cook and Finn Keane)Ghetts – On Purpose, With Purpose (written by Ghetts and TenBillion Dreams)Jordan Rakei – The Loop (written by Jordan Rakei)Lola Young – This Wasn’t Meant for You Anyway (written by William Brown, Conor Dickinson, Jared Solomon and Lola Young)Berwyn – Who Am I (written by Berwyn)Best contemporary songPa Salieu – Allergy (written by Felix Joseph, Alastair O’Donnell and Pa Salieu)Jade – Angel of My Dreams (written by Pablo Bowman, Jade, Steph Jones and Mike Sabath)Sans Soucis – Circumnavigating Georgia (written by Sans Soucis)Ghetts – Double Standards (ft Sampha) (written by Ghetts, Emil, Sampha Sisay and R-Kay)Bashy – How Black Men Lose Their Smile, written by Bashy, Toddla T and Linton Kwesi JohnsonBest song musically and lyricallyLaura Marling – Child of Mine (written by Laura Marling)Raye – Genesis (written by Rodney Jerkins, Raye and Toneworld)Fontaines DC– In the Modern World (written by Grian Chatten, Conor Curley, Conor Deegan, Thomas Coll and Carlos O’Connell)Lola Young – Messy (written by Conor Dickinson and Lola Young)Orla Gartland – Mine (written by Orla Gartland)Most performed workHarry Styles: As It Was (written by Kid Harpoon, Tyler Johnson and Harry Styles)Dua Lipa – Houdini (written by Caroline Ailin, Danny L Harle, Tobias Jesso Jnr, Dua Lipa and Kevin Parker)Wham! – Last Christmas (written by George Michael)Cassö, Raye and D-Block Europe – Prada (written by D-Block Europe, Obi Ebele, Uche Ebele, Jahmori “Jaymo” Simmons and Raye)Myles Smith: Stargazing (written by Peter Fenn, Jesse Fink and Myles Smith)Rising star awardBea and Her BusinessLiang LawrenceLola YoungLulu.Nia SmithBest original film scoreFly Me to the Moon – Daniel PembertonHard Truths – Gary YershonKneecap – Michael “Mickey J” AsanteThe Substance – RaffertieThe Zone of Interest – Mica LeviBest original video game scoreEmpire of Ants – Mathieu Alvado and Mark ChoiFarewell North – John KonsolakisFlock – Eli RainsberrySenua’s Saga: Hellblade II – David Garcia DiazThe Casting of Frank Stone – Boxed ApeBest television soundtrackBlack Doves – Martin PhippsMary & George – Oliver CoatesRivals – Jack Halama and Natalie HoltTrue Detective: Night Country – Vince PopeUntil I Kill You – Carly ParadisExplore more on these topicsMusicIvor Novello awardsPop and rockRapFontaines DCRayeLaura MarlingnewsShareReuse this content"

There are no shops or even neighbours here – just trees, wild animals and a man making beguiling performance art videos. You shouldn’t, however, assume that Broms feels isolated.“I don’t see it like that,” he says through a beaming smile. In the early 1990s, the Swedish artist moved to Kumaon in northern India, right near the border with western Nepal and Tibet. Compared with that, this place couldn’t be more accessible. “It’s easy enough to get on a bike if I need something,” he shrugs.View image in fullscreen‘I gathered up the ash and said: “This is my first work”’ … Gustaf Broms.Photograph: Trishula LittlerToday Broms, 58, is speaking to me from his kitchen via video call. He’s wearing a rainbow-coloured knitted jumper and a beanie hat, his long, light grey hair flowing down from under it. It’s a chilly April day, he explains, although it could be worse – sometimes it can reach -30C around these parts.Broms’s artistic career is one marked by constant adventure and discovery. He started out taking photographs, and worked for a while as an assistant to Richard Avedon in New York, but eventually the limits of the two-dimensional image began to frustrate him. “After years of being obsessed with making imagery, I had reached a dead end,” he says.And so, during the winter solstice of 1993, Broms took all of his photographs and paintings to the waterfront in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg where he lived. After symbolically shaving his head, he set his life’s work on fire. “I realised that this action was much stronger than any of the work that went up in flames,” he says. “So I gathered up the ash and said: ‘This is my first work’. It was a real door opener.”Six months later Broms was living in the Indian mountains, looking for a new way to make work. One day while walking in Binsar Wildlife Sanctuary, where leopards roam, he came across a bone. It was another lightbulb moment for Broms. “It had a real energy. I became interested in moving away from the representation of an object to the actual thing. That’s still where I am today.”Broms spent two years collecting materials he would find on his daily walks – dried flowers, bones – and assembling them into beautiful arrangements inside a huge carpet factory that he rented out cheaply. Hardly anybody got to see the work in the flesh, other than the odd inquisitive local and the summer pilgrims who took the unpaved road past his place. Not that he minded. “I had a big space on the top of a ridge with a village below,” he says. “During monsoon season, clouds filled the valley, a real fairytale.”View image in fullscreenReal energy: Gustaf Broms pictured during his 10-day performance May Your Ripples Slowly Fade at Skövde Konstmuseum.Photograph: Christian BergenOn returning toSweden, Broms finally exhibited these works in a subterranean cave that he’d found in Stockholm. Again he was struck by a revelation – instead of showing people an image of a magical experience, why not create the magical image for them, so that they can record it directly with their senses? He moved towards performance.Through 2005 and 2006 he embarked on a project with his partner, Trish Littler, called A Walking Piece. They travelled together on foot from Vendel to Odesa in Ukraine, taking captivating triptych photographs along the way. Broms says that traversing Katowice and Gliwice in Poland, where the steel and coal industries had closed down, was somewhat hairy – “kind of Euro techno, really muscly guys and I imagine a lot of speed” – as was the night they had to pitch their tents in a graveyard. But in general, the couple stuck to forests, and savoured the incredible generosity of people they met along the way.A year later Broms performed The Sitting where he would sit cross-legged in central Stockholm during rush hour every day for a year. Not everyone appreciated his intervention – security guards hassled him, some people even spat at him – but Broms took all this in his stride. In the 2016 documentary about him,The Mystery of Life, we see him lying on the floor in public with soil on his face and worms crawling through it. His performance works have been misinterpreted as political demonstrations, advertising gimmicks, protests, provocations and even just someone who has lost their marbles. He embraces it all. Broms loves the excitement of performing in the city rather than at a gallery or festival where the audience arrive with an expectation of what they’re about to see.View image in fullscreen‘Language can only tell us so much’ … Gustaf Broms in performance in Cologne as part of Transition – Between Apocalypse and Utopia in July 2023.Photograph: Thomas ReulAt times, Broms says, it has been a “real struggle financially” to spend his life following these artistic callings. He spent a brief period doing dishes in a friend’s restaurants to help make ends meet. But these days a combination of frugal living and trickles of income from various streams including teaching – not to mention grants from the Swedish government – have put him in a steadier position.This month, Broms is in London to make his first piece of work here at the performance art festival Ceremony. He’s planning to collect materials from Hampstead Heath and see what he comes up with. He’s come to realise that the core of his work is all about trying to push beyond the limits of language. “Language can only tell us so much,” he says. “We can call two things a glass but they’re two unique objects. We work with generalisations. But in other forms of expression we can be more precise.”He flashes another beaming smile, then says: “I did expect that one day, maybe, I would grow up and want to live a different life.”Let’s hope that day never arrives – Broms clearly wasn’t born to do anything else.Gustaf Broms performs atCeremony festivalin London 7-10pm on Saturday 26 AprilExplore more on these topicsPerformance artArtSwedeninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Since their father’s funeral, when Bea scratched an obscene picture into Veda’s car bonnet, the two sisters have lost contact, and Bea has been isolated in an ever-growing haven of “stuff”. Old vinyl, books, crockery, bags for life and mountains of cutlery have turned her home into a graveyard of the past. To an outsider, it is the depths of hoarding; to Bea, every dusty item is a relic to be pored over and adored.But, now Veda has stopped by unexpectedly to “fix” things. Lawrence-Taylor’s vivid dialogue paints the sisters both as strangers, with years missing between them, and familiars, bound by their shared youth. They remember intimate details about each other; Veda drinks camomile tea, Bea loves bonsai trees. The actors, Holly Atkins (Veda) and Rosie Cavaliero (Bea), bring remarkable emotional texture to their roles; their relationship feels lived-in and layered with complication. As they bicker, laugh and plead with one another to understand their side of things, their speech rolls over each other in a natural rhythm.That realism is the key to the first section of Lucy Morrison’s delicate production. But, if you look closer within the clutter of Naomi Dawson’s set, there are signs that give away an upcoming rupture. When Veda reveals a shock of her own, lamps spread across the stage sporadically flicker and dim. A foreboding rumble is heard just below their conversation.It feels slightly premature when Bea’s junkyard kingdom starts to fall apart around the sisters. There are still holes in the women’s histories, which makes the second half of the play something of a maze. Still, Lawrence-Taylor is a master of showing the messy loops and back-and-forths that come in heated moments with loved ones. Even as a writer in germination, she has a unique grasp of human behaviour that is far beyond her years.AtHampstead theatrefrom 11 April to 17 MayExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreHampstead theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Trump’s ‘dehumanizing’ new passport rules mean he won’t perform it for US fansWed 23 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 12.59 EDTShareBells Larsen knew that releasing a low-fi, folksy album about his transition as the Trump administration relentlesslyattacked LGBTQ+ peoplewould give it an inherently political edge. But the Canadian singer-songwriter did not expect to be caught in a bureaucratic nightmare while attempting to tour the US – and ultimately have to cancel that tour due to the gender marker in his passport.On 12 April, Larsen announced on Instagram that he was pulling out of concerts to promote the album in eight cities this spring: “To put it super plainly, because I’m trans (and have an M on my passport), I can’t tour in the States,” he wrote.Earlier this month, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) updated its manual to “only recognize two biological sexes, male and female”, reversing a Biden-era policy that allowed for a third gender option on visa and immigration forms. This means that trans or non-binary travelers could face issues with their documents when applying for visas or attempting to enter the US. The update comes amid the turmoil caused by the president’sborder crackdownandtargetingofLGBTQ+ individuals.“I feel overwhelmed by the degree to which my community is being completely dehumanized,” Larsen said on a Zoom call from his Montreal apartment, where colorful figure drawings by his partner, Noah, covered the wall. “My livelihood has been robbed of me, but this is also so much bigger than me.”Larsen, 27, now finds himself in a delicate situation. He wishes to transcend the touring visa drama and “focus on the music”, while also speaking out against efforts tolegislate trans identities outof public life in America, where he has friends and fans.Larsen wrote Blurring Time, out 25 April, while beginning to identify as trans in 2021. The first line sung on the album – “Friday night, drinking boxed wine, alone in my apartment blurring time” – describes the messiness of coming out during the pandemic.“Being alone in my room and looking at myself in the mirror, seeing the way my body curves or doesn’t curve, and realizing that I’d been avoiding doing so for so long – the world paused, and I was invited to look inward in a way that I wouldn’t normally,” he said.View image in fullscreenBells Larsen: ‘I started thinking about whoIam, who is compelled by me, who am I as a lover?’Photograph: Lawrence FafardThat isolation sparked Larsen’s decision to start taking gender-affirming hormones, though he now understands that he was always trans. “Growing up, my birthday present was always getting to go to the hair salon with my older brother Charlie and choosing his hairdo,” he said. “Why would someone want to give their brother a makeover for their birthday? There are all these little things I think back on and say, I’ve always been me.”Larsen comes from an artistic family in Toronto; his father wrote children’s books and his mother went to acting school. Their support, along with seeing gay and trans characters in shows like Glee and Degrassi and watching coming out videos on YouTube, helped Larsen begin to put the pieces of his sexuality together early on. He remembers seeing a friend in a lesbian role in a middle school play and empathizing with the character.“I just had this huge aha moment,” he said. Attending an arts high school had an effect too. “I met people in grade nine who were proudly and openly self-identifying as bi or queer or gay, and I felt this huge exhale,” he said.When he was 15, Larsen wrote his first song to commemorate a breakup with his high-school girlfriend, Cara. “The very, very first lyric of any song I ever wrote started with ‘she’. Thinking back on it, I’m like, damn, that’s pretty rad that at the time I was a girl thinking about another girl and letting my freak flag fly.”‘Experimental, queer and kind of magical’: Sade and Sam Smith feature on 46-track album for trans rightsRead moreHe wrote his first album, Good Grief, as a way to process Cara taking her own life in 2017. It addressed different types of mourning – the death of a friend, the end of a relationship, the loss of innocence that comes with growing up. At the time, Larsen identified as non-binary.“My queerness before that album was always focused outward: who do I love, who am I attracted to?” he said. “Slowly, I started thinking about whoIam, who is compelled by me, who am I as a lover? Once I started asking those questions, the gender of it all started to unfurl.”Larsen wanted to start taking gender-affirming hormones as soon as he came out as trans, but he was worried about how the testosterone would impact his singing voice. “When we think of the way transition looks for transmasc people who want to pursue a physical transition, one of the first things we think about is that their voice gets deeper,” he said. “The thought of that was very euphoric for me, but also scary, because I didn’t know how it would impact my main instrument.”So Larsen recorded all of the songs for Blurring Time first with his higher voice, with the intent of revisiting everything once he started hormones. When his voice deepened, he worked with a vocal coach to relearn how to sing in the new register. Justin Bieber was an unlikely muse, since the teen popstar experienced the hormonal changes of adolescence between albums. (Larsen, a “big Belieber”, met Bieber pre-fame when he was a child busking on the Toronto streets. Larsen told him he was a musician; Bieber told him to “keep on keeping on”.) Then Larsen re-recorded each song and layered his voices together, so present-day Larsen duets with a past version of himself. He got the idea in part through the dueting feature on TikTok. “I shaped my transition around this project,” he said.Larsen’s confessional songwriting takes cues from Elliott Smith, who used multi-tracking vocals to create layers of harmony. He counts Joni Mitchell, Nick Drake and Sufjan Stevens as major influences, and calls Adrianne Lenker, who fronts the folk-rock band Big Thief, “one of the best songwriters since forever”. Larsen’s lyrics directly grapple with gender identity while also refusing to be defined by it. “It’s not as simple as either or, I’m both and I’m more, most of all I’m unsure,” he sings on the title track.In March, Canada and some European countries issuedtravel advisoriesfor trans citizens, cautioning them about the US’s stricter visa rules if their documents do not reflect their sex assigned at birth. Larsen had planned safeguards, such as performing exclusively in blue states and traveling with a cis man as a sort of buffer. But the “biological sex” listed on his US visa application form, as required by USCIS, did not match the M (for male) on his Canadian passport. After receiving an email informing him of USCIS’s rule from the American Federation of Musicians, a labor union for both US and Canadian musicians, and speaking with two immigration lawyers, Larsen cancelled the tour. He made it clear that he felt forced into doing so because of the policy.“I received an email with underlined wording stating that my application would not be able to be processed,” Larsen said. “So I know for sure that I am not able to apply for a visa and come to the States in a touring capacity, at least for the next four years.”There is no policy that can undo your existenceBells LarsenLarsen is not alone. The Nova Scotia-based singer-songwriter T Thomason, a non-binary trans man,toldWired that even though his visa does not expire until June, he cancelled a gig in Maine.Horror storiesof travelers detained at the border were enough to deter him. “I just thought if that’s happening to cis people, I really feel worried about what could happen to me,” he said.Antoinette Follert, communication director for the American Federation of Musicians, wrote in a statement: “USCIS will not accept petitions with no gender identity, and furthermore, the gender identity must be the same as what was designated at birth.We shared the information with our Canadian members, and upon receiving that information, Bells made the decision to cancel the tour. The American Federation of Musicians … supports all members equally and continues to lobby on behalf of all members in support of our mission and values.”When foreign musicians tour the US, they usually apply for an O1 visa for “extraordinary ability”, said Sarah Pitney, an immigration attorney in Washington DC who does not counsel Larsen. That visa goes into a musician’s passport and is examined at the border by US border agents. If the gender markers on the visa and the passport do not match, a musician could face invasive questioning from a border agent. Pitney said it was unclear whether they also could be denied entry.So far, there are no confirmed cases of trans or non-binary travelers of any nationality being detained or barred entry at the US border. But the fear remains.“If you were to ask me, could this musician tour in the US, the answer is likely yes, if he’s willing to put up with the disrespect of having a visa that says female,” Pitney said. “And he absolutely should not have to do that. I agree with [Larsen]. If I were a trans person coming into this country, I would not come into this country. His decision makes sense to me, and I do not question it for a second.”Pitney added that immigration lawyers were worried that US authorities could claim that a trans or non-binary traveler committed fraud if their gender markers did not match: “This isn’t something we’ve seen yet, but we’re theorizing it could and we have concerns.”View image in fullscreen‘My livelihood has been robbed of me, but this is also so much bigger than me.’Photograph: Lawrence FafardMassima Bell and Dust Reid are the producers ofTransa, a sprawling music project out of the US released last year in support of trans rights, featuring songs from more 100 artists including Sade, Beverly Glenn-Copeland and Sam Smith.“Even prior to this administration, trans people faced more hurdles with traveling, because you’re always at the behest of basically whatever border agent you get,” Bell said. “That creates an opportunity to be targeted, singled out and harassed. Now there’s a top-down, concerted effort to create barriers for travel for trans people. I think it’s part of the creation of a blueprint where trans people are test subjects of these policies that are ultimately used to establish a more authoritarian federal government in the United States.”Bell and Reid wanted to plan international events to promote Transa, but they’re holding off for now. “We’re reluctant to send artists overseas for fear of invasive questioning,” Reid said.For now, Larsen is focused on shows inCanadaand Europe. He was recently asked to tour with the Canadian musician Dan Mangan, who he counts as one of his heroes, and whose songs he used to sing while busking with Cara on Toronto subways as a teen. He wishes he could perform for his US fans, but says he has no interest in crossing the border “in the same way that you probably don’t want to date someone who doesn’t want to date you”.Larsen does not feel like he needs a travel document to validate his identity. “There is no policy that can undo your existence,” he said. “There is no politician who gets to decide that you exist or don’t exist. You are who you say you are, and that’s enough.”In the US, you can call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988, chat on 988lifeline.org, or text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

The place is packed and staff are talking customers through the menu. Would we like the slow-roasted pork with pearl barley and mushrooms? How about the rye pancakes with salmon, cream cheese and avocado? I decide on the beetroot tartare with horseradish and rye toasts, and a spelt side salad.This isn’t a fancy new Nordic restaurant – it’s a work canteen. These chefs feed 900 workers from DSB (Danish State Railways) every weekday. As well as looking and tasting great, each dish served here containsfuldkorn(wholegrains), from breakfast smoothies with oats to afternoon treats such as today’s wholemeal scones. There’s a good reason for this: DSB recently signed up to a national programme that aims to get more wholegrains into employees.View image in fullscreenBeetroot tartare at the DSB canteen.Photograph: Valdemar Ren/The GuardianThe initiative is spearheaded by theDanish Whole Grain Partnership, a group on a mission to make Danes healthier, one slice of rye bread at a time. Its members include the government, health NGOs (the Danish Cancer Society, the Danish Heart Foundation and the Danish Diabetes Association) and industry (bakers, food companies, supermarkets). It has been incredibly successful. When the partnership began in 2008, the average Dane ate 36g of wholegrains a day. By 2019, they were eating 82g, the highest intake in Europe. In contrast, the average Briton eats 20g a day, and one in five don’t eat any wholegrains. In the US,just 15% of grain consumptioncomes from wholegrains (dietary guidelines recommend at least 50%).What’s so good about wholegrains? “Eating wholegrains helps to reduce your risk of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. They help lower your cholesterol, stabilise your blood glucose levels and improve the health of your gut microbiota,” says Natasha Selberg of the Danish Heart Association. Rikke Neess, the campaign’s leader, adds: “Wholegrains make you feel full, so can help prevent obesity.” (Denmark has some of thelowest obesity rates in Europe.) “They add texture to your food – and taste really good.”In Denmark, there are nine recognised grains:wheat, spelt, barley, rice (brown and red), rye, oats, millet, corn (dried) and sorghum. The category may soon be expanded to include “pseudo-grains” such as quinoa, amaranth and buckwheat. Eating a grain’s whole kernel, which includes the bran, germ and endosperm, means you benefit from “all the good parts”, says Neess – the fibre, vitamins and minerals.“The project started because of the [low-carbohydrate] Atkins diet, which was very popular in Denmark,” Neess says. “Sales of bread were decreasing. At the same time, there was increasing evidence that wholegrains decreased the risk of cancer.”View image in fullscreenThe wholegrain logo on a bag of flour at Valsemøllen bakery.Photograph: Valdemar Ren/The GuardianOne of the Whole Grain Partnership’s first moves was to create an orange logo for products high in wholegrains. In 2010, 190 products carried the symbol; by 2019, it was 1,097. In a 2024 survey, seven out of 10 Danes recognised it. “The logo makes it really easy for consumers to choose wholegrains,” says Neess. “We’ve also had a very positive response from industry. It gives them a competitive advantage to have the logo on their products.” Selberg adds: “This logo gives producers an incentive to develop and reformulate healthy products.” According toa 2022reportfrom the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), these products are no more expensive than their refined grain equivalents.The government has supported the initiative by updating official dietary guidelines. In 2009, it recommended four servings of wholegrains a day. In 2013, it set a more specific target of at least 75g a day, and in June last year that was increased to 90g.I visit Lantmännen Schulstad, the biggest producer of rye bread, a Danish staple. “Rye bread has been part of our culture for 1,000 years,” says Neess. But young people are increasingly choosing white bagels, wraps and burger buns over boring old rectangular rye bread. In response, Lantmännen Schulstad is bringing out new shapes and sizes that are more convenient for children’s lunch boxes. “We have to make rye bread great again,” jokes Neess.Pernille Bang-Löwgren, Lantmännen Schulstad’s chief executive, shows me a table heaped with different kinds of bread. They are set out in varying amounts, illustrating how much of each type you’d need to eat to get your daily wholegrain quota. Dark rye bread? Just four small slices. White rolls? You’d have to munch your way through a towering pile of 50.View image in fullscreen‘We’re making sourdough with different ratios of wholegrain flour, from zero to 90%’ … Erik Olsen teaches Dixon at the Valsemøllen bakery.Photograph: Valdemar Ren/The GuardianFor some people, that knowledge is enough to make them choose the rye bread. But many others base their choice on taste, or price, or what the kids will eat, and may even be put off by a virtue-signalling wholegrain logo. For that reason, the partnership has encouraged producers to put a little bit of wholegrain flour inalltheir products, even the white sliced bread. Most started with 3% – nowhere near enough to see or taste – and are increasing very gradually: 5%, 7%, maybe as much 9%. These stealth wholegrains are listed in the ingredients, but not trumpeted anywhere else on the label. “There is a lot of fast food in Denmark, but the strategy of just adding a little bit of wholegrains to burger buns is a good start,” says Neess. This tactic is aimed at the 6% of Danes who eat less than 25g of wholegrains a day. “We have to get the people who eat the least amount to eat more,” says Selberg.At Valsemøllen, a Danish bakery founded in 1899, I bake bread with Erik Olsen. We’re experimenting by making sourdough with different ratios of wholegrain flour, from zero to 90%. It is surprising how little difference it makes to the appearance, texture or taste – even Olsen, who has been baking since he was 13, is taken aback. If you like the tang of white sourdough, you could probably switch to 75% wholegrain and barely notice.Wholegrains have a low carbon footprint. Only 25% of us are aware of thatOlsen has also baked some delicious cinnamon buns with 25% wholegrains. Adding a percentage of wholegrain flour into cakes is another easy way to up people’s intake, especially in Denmark, wherepastries, cakes and biscuits are a big deal. Sweet treats don’t get the wholegrain logo – products have to meet official guidelines on sugar, salt and fat, too – but adding wholegrains can still make them a bit healthier. The same goes for ultra-processed packaged food, says Selberg. “The fibre, vitamins and minerals in ultra-processed rye bread may be more important than the additives, which may just help the bread last longer.”The Whole Grain Partnership runs annual events to raise awareness. On National Whole Grain Day in January, there are activities such as cooking, baking, singing and playing games in schools, libraries and hospitals; this year a prison took part. Supermarkets have special offers on wholegrain products at this time. “It’s a day with so much positivity, happiness and community,” says Nees. There is also asmørrebrød(open sandwich) week in June, a breakfast week in September and a new dinner week in November. “Most Danes get wholegrains at breakfast and lunch, but not many get so much in the evening,” says Selberg. “Our new campaign focuses on dinner: wholegrain pasta, rice and bread.”View image in fullscreenLoaves of bread at the Valsemøllen bakery with labels displaying their wholegrain percentages.Photograph: Valdemar Ren/The GuardianI ask Neess how she gets her 90g a day. “I always eat oatmeal with blueberries and almonds for breakfast, a piece of rye bread for lunch, and focus on wholegrains at dinner – pasta, rice, pizza – with lots of veg,” she says. “I really like crispbread as a snack in the afternoon.”The EU and the OECD have awarded the partnership best-practice status for promoting public health, in 2019 and 2022 respectively. The OECD report said: “Given there is strong evidence to support the link between high wholegrain consumption and lower risk of developing certain cancers (eg colorectal cancer), type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, the DWGP plays an important role in improving population health.”How easy is it to change the diet of an entire nation? “It’s very difficult to change eating habits on a population level,” says Selberg. “You need industry partners who can increase the availability of wholegrain products and reformulate recipes to increase the amount of wholegrain. You have to ensure customers can make healthy choices in supermarkets, and increase consumer awareness and demand.” Neess agrees that the most important thing is availability: “It should be easy to make a wholegrain choice everywhere we go.” We stroll around central Copenhagen, popping into shops and supermarkets. The wholegrain logo is everywhere: on bread, cereal, pasta, rice, biscuits, snacks …It should be easy to make a wholegrain choice everywhere we goNeess stresses the importance of cooperation. “We want to increase public health, but that’s a difficult task for only one partner to achieve. But when we work closely together, we can make it happen.There is very high trustamong the partners,” she says. “Not all countries can work together with government. It’s not a political project. Leftwing and rightwing governments have all been very supportive.”“Our public/private partnership is a very Danish thing, and it’s very successful,” adds Selberg. “Most ofEuropeis moving more to the right. Politicians are not allowed to decide what’s on people’s plates.”Indeed, Denmark is leading the way with this kind of alliance. In October 2023, the country drew up the world’s firstaction plan for plant-based food, an unlikely agreement between farmers, politicians and environmental groups, aimed at reducing meat consumption for environmental as well as health reasons. Wholegrains are a part of this – they are filling but require far less water, land or energy to produce than meat or dairy. “Wholegrains have a low carbon footprint,” says Neess. “Only 25% of Danes are aware of that.”View image in fullscreenIt’s surprising how little difference it makes to the appearance, texture or taste … Olsen at the Valsemøllen bakery.Photograph: Valdemar Ren/The GuardianThe partnership is now trying to spread the wholegrain word beyond Denmark. “We’re part of theFortified Whole Grain Alliance, a Rockefeller-funded project trying to increase wholegrain consumption in Africa,” says Neess. “We also have partnerships in Germany and Japan, and we’ve just launched a partnership with Sweden.” TheInternational Whole Grain Summitwas held in Detmold, Germany, earlier this month, advocating for refined grains to be replaced by wholegrains over the next few years.How can other countries follow in Denmark’s footsteps? “Small steps. The food industry should look at what people eat and increase the amount of wholegrain gradually: 3%, 5% etc,” says Neess. At home, “If you bake a cake with 25% wholegrain flour, you’d never guess. You could make a lasagne with 50% wholewheat pasta, 50% white.”On my last day in Copenhagen, I have breakfast at my hotel. It’s easy to choose wholegrains: a bowl of oatmeal with fruit, a piece of rye toast with hummus, a wholemeal pastry. They fill me up for a morning of sightseeing – and, as Neess promised, they taste really, really good.Explore more on these topicsFoodEuro visionsNutritionDenmarkHealthEuropeDiets and dietingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Five lessons I’ve learned about good parenting from around the worldI traveled from Mozambique to Finland to learn parenting hacks, and came away with the same lesson: parenting is hard everywhere, but nowhere is it as lonely as it is in the USMarina LopesWed 23 Apr 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 10.16 EDTShareFour years ago, scarred by the pandemic experience of trying to care for two toddlers in isolation, my husband and I decided we wanted a built-in community. We were tired of being the ones solely in charge of organizing, feeding, disciplining and playing with our kids.On a whim, we moved halfway across the world toSingaporeto live next door to our best friends, Jeremy and Melissa. We aren’t polyamorous, hippies or reckless. Just another set of tired parents, exhausted by trying to do it all with little support.We rented an apartment across the street and began sharing meals, childcare and playdates – and yes, we even let my friends yell at our kids. I quickly realized that communal parenting isn’t radical; it’s practical.Parenting stress is a health issue – US surgeon general’s advisory reportRead moreI could feel the weight lift as I unlocked the door to their apartment after a long day of work each evening. Jeremy would be in the kitchen cooking something delicious, while Melissa poured me a glass of wine and the kids played in the room next door. Within weeks, I was happier, less stressed and a better mom than I had ever been before. My kids couldn’t believe their luck. They hadn’t just gained a sibling – but a whole new set of grown-ups who loved them and had their backs.The experience had me questioning the norms I grew up with: that parenting is a job best left for, well, parents, and that protecting my kids meant keeping them away from anyone whose parenting style I disagreed with.As a foreign correspondent, my favorite stories have always lived in the cracks between cultures, where what one group finds absurd, another sees as essential. But once I became a parent, I realized the deepest cultural divides weren’t about politics or food. They were about child rearing. Every country has its own sacred hacks for raising decent, independent kids who sleep through the night – and no two cultures agree.I started reporting. My book,Please Yell at My Kids, explores hacks like communal living that actually made life easier for parents around the world. I learned how Danish moms ditch anxiety by letting babies nap outside, and how Chinese mothers turn postpartum recovery into a team sport.And then I brought it all home – and tried it on my own family (sorry, kids).After watching children inMozambiquehelp run their households, I put my five- and seven-year-olds in charge of laundry. They loved it – and despite a few outfit casualties, so did I. Like Dutch parents, we gave our kids more freedom – until a police officer showed up, deeply unimpressed that my son had biked a little too far unsupervised. And I swallowed my pride (and gallons of chicken-papaya soup) when my mother-in-law moved in to oversee my post-birth recovery the traditional Chinese way.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’My husband and I had long-overdue conversations about sharing the invisible labor at home after I saw fathers in Sweden taking up their share of chores. Inspired by active grandparents in Singapore, we brought my own parents into the parenting mix –even if it meant a little more sugar and screen time than I’d like.Here are the top lessons I learned along the way:Plant a village (Mozambique)In Mozambique, the word “mom” isn’t reserved for biological parents. It’s used for the auntie down the street, the older neighbor who watches the kids while parents work, the woman who has extra snacks for everyone’s child. These networks of care often span generations – those same kids grow up to care for the elderly neighbors who once looked after them.Today, many parents in the US wonder why they don’t have a “village” to help raise their kids. But villages don’t just appear – they must be planted, nurtured and watered. When I moved back to the US, I threw open our doors for family game nights, holiday parties and after-school chaos to anyone who wanted to join. I also started keeping quiet tabs on my block: who’s slammed with work and could use a hand with the kids? Who’s been sick and might appreciate soup on their doorstep? I couldn’t replicate the village I saw in Mozambique – but I realized I could grow one, starting right where I was.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We call on a team of bridesmaids and family for our wedding – but when the baby arrives, we suddenly go it alone? No thanks.Start building your village from the beginning. Maybe you don’t want 40 people at your C-section, like new moms inBrazil, but consider expanding the guest list of people you invite into parenting. Look for non-judgmental friends who can see you at your worst. Ask your community to help you plan a meal train, or pre-schedule coffee dates that get you out of the house and into your community. Draw strength from the lessons of women who came before you. Ask the mothers, grandmothers and other women in your family about the joys of their own experiences, but also their struggles. What surprised or scared them? How do they feel about it now, years or decades later? How did their identities change after becoming parents? What do they wish they knew?Move in with your friends (Malaysia)The Iban tribe inMalaysialives communally in longhouses, where families raise children, share meals and gather every night. When we moved in next door to our best friends and began raising our kids together, I finally understood why so many cultures have embraced communal parenting for generations. There are real economies of scale when you team up with other exhausted parents.Maybe you can’t all live under one roof like the Iban – but even being in the same neighborhood, or prioritizing time with people you trust, can offer something just as valuable: a deep sense of connection and belonging for both you and your kids.Drop your kids off in the woods (Netherlands)In theNetherlands, parents send kids into the woods during summer camp with only a flashlight and snacks and let them find their way home. It’s called aforest dropping –and it’s meant to build resilience and independence.You don’t have to go full Hansel and Gretel, but start small: teach road safety, let them bike ahead of you, send them on grocery store errands. As kids gain confidence and contribute meaningfully to family life, they learn that they’re not just passive recipients of care – they’re capable members of a community.Make Granny nanny (Singapore)At school pickups in Singapore, I was often the only mom in a sea of grandparents. But these weren’t the US-style grandpas who mail a birthday check and pop in on FaceTime at Christmas. Grandparenting in Singapore is serious business. They ferry kids to after-school activities, help with homework and play a major role in passing down values and discipline.I can’t go everywhere my daughter goes – and it’s heartbreakingRead moreWhile many US parents long for this kind of support, they’re often quick to set boundaries when grandparents don’t parent exactly as they do. In Singapore, I learned that alignment doesn’t have to be total for help to be meaningful. Just because a grandparent doesn’t share your every parenting principle doesn’t mean they can’t read a bedtime story over the phone or tutor your kids in math. The key is figuring out what you need, where your values overlap and then stepping back and letting them show up in their own way.The parenting hacks I picked up varied from country to country. But in every place, from Mozambique to Finland, I came away with the same lesson: parenting is hard everywhere, but nowhere is it as lonely as it is in the US.Building community – through family, friends or neighbors – won’t solve every parenting challenge. But it can lighten the load, restore your sanity, and bring joy back into your home.When we stop trying to do it all alone and start letting others in, we don’t just raise better kids. We build fuller lives – for them, and for ourselves.Marina Lopes is the author ofPlease Yell at My Kids: What Cultures Around the World Can Teach You About Parenting in Community, Raising Independent Kids, and Not Losing Your Mind, out now.Please Yell at My Kids by Marina Lopes (Hachette Books, £25).

Suddenly I realised why women try so hard to fend off signs of ageingKathy LetteWed 23 Apr 2025 01.55 EDTShareAgrey pube. There was no denying it. If I hadn’t been contorted into what felt like an advanced yoga position trying to do up fiddly press studs on the crotch of the teddy I was wearing to a party, I would never have seen it. The party was for a novel I had written titled How to Kill Your Husband, and the theme was “dress to kill”. I had planned on wearing stockings, a miniskirt, a garter belt with dagger, and the ridiculous teddy undergarment that you clearly needed an engineering degree to operate. But how could I dress to thrill when I knew what was lurking beneath?I immediately checked in with girlfriends. Had any of them discovered a grey pubic hair? Yes, yes, they had. What’s more, having hit my 50s, there was apparently much more I had to worry about. I would soon need to spend my life savings getting rid of stretchmarks, cellulite, chin sags, eye bags, neck wrinkles, crepey cleavage, pelvic floor lethargy, dry vagina, muffin top and menopausal weight gain; apparently, hormonal changes meant that I would soon resemble one of those giant jellyfish in a Jacques Cousteau documentary, floating about like a flesh balloon.I would also require a Brazilian butt lift. Having dieted for years to be slim and trim, a peachy rear was now the bottom line in beauty. As was the trout pout, a procedure that involved taking fat from your backside and injecting it into your lips, so that you are talking out of your arse – which explains a lot about Hollywood.View image in fullscreenAt the book launch for How to Kill Your Husband.Photograph: Nick HarveyThen there was labiaplasty, or I could opt for a “Barbie”: a surgical procedure that involves a reduction of the labia minora, resulting in a smooth, flawless “clamshell” appearance. (In 2017, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery,labiaplasty was one of the fastest-growing cosmetic operations in the world.) After tightening and whitening my nether regions, the one grey pube problem could be eliminated by simply waxing the whole area, before “vajazzling” it in Swarovski crystals.But I liked my big luxuriant bush. I checked in with male friends and discovered that grey pubes are very much not on their angst-o-meter. Nor were wrinkles, crinkles, kinkles (knee wrinkles), cankles (thick ankles), waddles (neck fat) or Brazilians. So why did my grey pube discovery feel so significant?It was the first time I confronted ageist sexism up close and experienced the chauvinism sewn into our psyche. While I was being dismissed as a hag, a bag and a crone, a bloke my age would be lauded as distinguished, matured, seasoned, a manther, a zaddy, a silver fox. The fashion police would not be so ready to cast a man out to sartorial Siberia. As I have said so often, it’s time it went on a T-shirt, have you ever heard a man dismissed as “mutton dressed as ram”?In my latest novel, four women seek retribution on the men who have sabotaged their careers for the crime of being menopausal. But every publisher I approached made the repulsed face of a kid who has been offered a plate of spinach. “Nobody wants to read about middle-aged women,” one explained. “They’re just not that sexy.”For a moment, I lost confidence. Maybe I had passed my amuse-by date? Whenever I read books about women of my age, they usually die of despair in lonely flats and get eaten by their cats … But I don’t know any women like that. All my female friends are going up Everest, down the Amazon or tap-dancing on tabletops.I finally found an enthusiastic publisher and, best revenge ever, the book became a bestseller, proving that there is no justification for shelving older female authors.Do I still worry about the odd grey pube? Once I was divorced and dating again, it quickly became the least of my worries. Reared on pornography, younger blokes don’t know that women evenhavepubic hair. But the great thing about being in your 60s (or “sexties”, as I prefer to call it) is no longer caring what other people think. Great sex is about being relaxed and, by this age, you have learned to love the skin you are in, grey hair and all. In fact, I can’t believe I’m even vertical, so if you’ll excuse me …The Revenge Club by Kathy Lette is published by Head of Zeus (£9.99).To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Our circumstances have not changed and we have not made a claim for many years.I immediately phoned up to query this and was told the usual:“This is now the price the underwriters have calculated using their prescribed format, blah blah, blah.”The unfortunate person to take my call politely listened to my rant that this increase was totally unacceptable, as was the lack of explanation. Of course, she had no authority to reduce the quote and could do nothing other than agree to convey the outrage of loyal customers of 13 years and Co-op members to senior management.Anyway, I send you this information for your views as to the reasonableness or otherwise of this increase, and to keep you informed of the way we customers are being treated.RD,AscotCo-operative Bank seems to have lost £2,500 I sent abroadRead moreThe average price of an annual combined building and contents home insurance policy went up by £55 (16%) in 2024 to £395, according to the Association of British Insurers.That does not correlate with this huge increase, so I asked the Co-op about your quote. It said it worked with a panel of insurers and that they “update their risk models periodically … and when this occurs, it is usual for prices to fluctuate”.It added: “On this occasion, RD’s previous insurer had updated their risk model and the findings for that particular geographical location. He was therefore offered a policy with another suitable insurer on our panel that provided the same cover, and the price is correct and reflective of the risks attached to these circumstances.”While the Co-op’s panel of experts seemingly see dark clouds massing over your home in Ascot, insurer LV= does not. You secured a new policy with LV= for just under £700, and it includes some extra cover for valuables. It pays to shop around.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

We’re helping out the local volunteer association,Andros Routes, which has been restoring a network of ancient mule tracks, from the coast to the interior and its low mountains. The tracks form part of a new walking holiday that allows us to explore the pretty island on foot – and give something back, too.Andros, Athens and northern CycladesThe eight-day trip with Ramble Worldwide takes you from the south-east to the north-west, from Ormos Korthiou to Gavrio, via Chora on the east coast, with accommodation in low-key hotels and luggage transfer between them. Daily routes are only suggested: guests can choose full-on trekking days or easy circular walks, customising the holiday to suit energy levels and using buses or taxis to skip sections if desired. Along the way you can choose to help with the maintenance of the paths (secateurs and gloves are delivered to your hotel).Andros Routes started life in 2010 under the aegis of the sustainable tourism expert Olga Karayiannis, who returned to the island, after living in Athens, on a mission to conserve local heritage, cultural and natural. So far, 100 miles (160km) of trails have been restored and broken into numbered sections – with plans to extend them to 150 miles – and each part has its own “angel” who checks up on the route and steps in when a problem is reported.View image in fullscreenThe writer cutting back unruly foliage on the way to Chora.Photograph: Rhonda CarrierAs we descend slowly from Pythara towards the glittering Mediterranean at Chora, cats amble across our path or look on as we stop to cut back spiky bushes, pick up rubbish, move stones or check on the state of signposts. Lizards dart and butterflies kiss our bare legs as we sidle past houses where courgettes and tomatoes sprout in wild abundance. We stop to sniff wild jasmine, mints of different kinds, rosemary, oregano and lavender, and walk on carpets of figs that have tumbled from the trees.We are deep in lush vegetation, passing through shaded valleys, walking past old ruined chapels where goats now take shelterWe pass cacti and olive groves on our way down to the sea and make out caves in cliffs where locals once hid from Turkish invaders, and where monks have also sought sanctuary. We discover shaded pools where, according to folklore, fairies reside, and walk alongside chapels and ruined watermills. We end our walk with a swim in the cool green sea at Gialia beach, just outside Chora, and then sip fresh juice from the Votsalo beach bar’s watermelon garden.To get more of an insight into the Andros Routes project, guests can time a trip to coincide with a communal maintenance walk (held every second weekend in spring, autumn and winter, and flagged up on the organisation’s news page). We meet two of the “angels”, fortysomethings Valentini and Vicky, who join us for part of the walk and share stories about Andros and vegetation, and why the routes are so important, to them and this island. Most of the “angels” are women, appropriate on this island known for its culture of strong women who held the fort while the men were at sea.View image in fullscreenThe waterfalls of Pythara.Photograph: Stamatios Manousis/AlamyIslanders love these pathways, they tell us, the oldest parts of which date back to 1200, and they can already see how the scheme is helping to reinvigorate the island, once rich through its shipbuilding industry. Olga’s vision is ultimately one of a “chain of sustainability” where visitors support locals by eating in their homes and staying in restored old stone houses. This will add options to the trial bunkhouse for eight, Hikers Lodge “Konaki’ in Katakalei village, near Apikia. It’s also helping to extend the tourist season, with more people coming in March–May and September–November for the more pleasant walking temperatures.An interactive map has been created to help walkers visit small-scale producers and artisans on the islandIn the evening, my friend and I stroll the section of the path from Mesaria to Menites, following ancient irrigation channels that bring water down from the mountains. In the village of Menites, Andros Routes works with the cultural association and we happen upon a children’s looming workshop in the community centre; Andros used to be known for silk production because of its mulberry trees, and cultural association leader (and Route Angel) Despina is among those trying to keep the tradition alive.Olga is also one of the founders of the Andros Research Center, which has created aninteractive mapto help walkers visit small-scale producers and artisans on the island, with bookable visits to cheese-makers, jam-makers and beekeepers (and others) to see their work in action and stock up on goodies. Or you may just see them at work as you amble along. We stop to watch a local beekeeper tending to his hives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In some places we are deep in the kind of lush vegetation that keeps the volunteers busy, passing through shaded valleys, walking past old ruined chapels where goats now take shelter. Other areas are more rocky and arid, and copious sunscreen is a must.View image in fullscreenGavrio on the west coast of Andros.Photograph: Apostolis Giontzis/AlamyOne of our favourite days is spent exploring inland around the villages of Remata and Katakilos, which includes lots of steep, challenging-but-rewarding uphills. The section contrasts sharply with the final part of that route between the resort of Batsi and the ferry port of Gavrio, which is flatter, with heart-stirring coastal views. We take a photo of a sign that’s starting to collapse but hasn’t been noticed because it’s in quite a remote spot, to send back to Andros Routes so it can be fixed.When we reach our final hotel, the charmingly low-key IreneStudios, on San Pedro beach just outside Gavrio, we hang up our walking boots and decide to chill instead of walk that day. There, with uninhabited islands as a dreamy backdrop, we swim in the Aegean and relax at great-value beach bars serving Greek salads, paellas, sangrias and the like – the perfect antidote to hike-weary limbs.The trip was provided by Ramble Worldwide, itseight-nightWalking on Androsholiday costs from£729ppB&B, including transfers, ferry from Rafina to Andros, luggage transfers, maps and route descriptions, and 24-hour telephone assistance.Departures betweenMay and October 2025Explore more on these topicsWalking holidaysGreek Islands holidaysGreece holidaysEthical holidaysGreen travelEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

British asparagus swoops in around now, offering bright green relief from winter’s hardier vegetables, while the jarred and frozen veg in the gratin save on prep time and keep everything light.Steamed asparagus and punchy hazelnut relish (pictured top)Put the relish together while the nuts are still warm, because that helps them absorb the flavours and create a condiment that’s both bright and deeply savoury.Prep5 minCook30 minServes6100g blanched hazelnuts1 round shallot, peeled and finely chopped100ml extra-virgin olive oil2 tsp sherry vinegarJuice and zest of ½lemon½ small bunch fresh parsley, leaves and tender stems finely chopped¼ tsp salt400g asparagusHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Tip the hazelnuts on to a tray and roast for 10 minutes, until deep golden. Meanwhile, mix the shallot, oil, vinegar, lemon juice and zest, parsley and salt in a small bowl.While the roast nuts are still hot, pound them in batches in a mortar until they look rubbly (you’re aiming for some larger, chunky pieces and plenty of small ones, but no whole nuts). Tip the still-warm nuts into the oil and vinegar mix, then taste and adjust the seasoning.Trim the thicker, tough ends off the asparagus spears and use a vegetable peeler to peel the bottom half of each spear (save the peelings for stocks or soups). Steam the asparagus for four minutes, until bright green and tender to the point of a sharp knife, then lift out and arrange on a warm platter.Drizzle a third of the nut relish over the asparagus, and put the rest in a bowl on the table so everyone can top themselves up. Serve immediately. Any leftover relish can be kept covered in the fridge for up to five days; it’s wonderful spooned over polenta and greens, or drizzled over new potatoes.Spring vegetable and cannellini bean cheesy mustard gratinView image in fullscreenAnna Shepherd’s spring vegetable and cannellini bean cheesy mustard gratin.A molten, crunchy-topped gratin full of tender, verdant greens is sure to elicit a few “oohs” and “aahs” at the table.Prep15 minCook1 hr 10 minServes6For the cheesy mustard sauce40g unsalted butter40g plainflour500ml whole milk100g extra-mature cheddar, grated1 heaped tbsp wholegrain mustard100ml dry sherry, or white wineSea salt andblack pepperFor the gratin4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil2 leeks, cleaned, then white and green parts sliced into 1cm rounds2 large garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped100g spinach100g frozen broad beans50g frozen peas250g jarred artichoke hearts(drained weight), cut into quarters600g jar cannellini beans, drained1 small bunch fresh mint, leaves picked and chopped75g soft white breadcrumbs30g almonds, roughly choppedFirst make the sauce.

Separately, US district Judge James Boasberghas found probable causeto hold the government in contempt for defying his orders to halt deportations.In another case, the US district Judge Paula Xinishas forced the governmentto provide daily updates in its efforts to comply with court orders to “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Ábrego García – the man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador.It is a dynamic that underscores how a constitutional crisis between Trump and the courts is likely to be a push and pull between the government and judges that is simmering through the legal system and could very well break it.“The president is testing how much the judiciary still meaningfully constrains him,” Ben Raderstorf, a policy associate at the watchdog group Protect Democracy wrote in a blog post titled“there is no rubicon”.Whether the courts can force compliance with their orders is an essential question for American democracy, where a pillar of the rule of law is the willingness of litigants to accept court rulings, especially the ones they disagree with.“The quality of judicial independence that federal judges have enjoyed throughout most of our history has depended much more on norms than it has on rules,” said Stephen Burbank, a professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania. “Of course, a major concern from that perspective is that Trump pays no attention to norms.”Trump said on Tuesday he did not think due process was a requirement before deporting someone.“Look, we are getting some very bad people, killers, murderers, drug dealers, really bad people, the mentally ill, the mentally insane, they emptied out insane asylums into our country, we’re getting them out. And a judge can’t say: ‘No, you have to have a trial,’” he said. “No, we are going to have a very dangerous country if we are not allowed to do what we are entitled to do.”In its Saturday ruling, the supreme court hadtemporarily blockedthe administration from deporting people being held in a detention center in Anson, Texas, under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA).At the beginning of April, the supreme court had allowed deportations under AEA to move forward as long as migrants received adequate notice they were being deported under the law. “The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually” challenge their deportation prior to it occurring, the supreme court said.But infilings last week, lawyers for detainees challenging the Texas deportations told the US supreme court their clients were being presented with English-only notices informing them they were being deported under the AEA, but no information about how to challenge it.In an extraordinary move, theUS supreme courtissued a decision temporarily halting the deportations before a lower court, the US court of appeals for the fifth circuit, had even ruled on the matter. The court moved to intervene quickly even though a government lawyer had said in a hearing in a related case on Friday that there were no plans for planes to take off that day.“In a world in which a majority of the justices were willing to take these kinds of representations at face value, there might’ve been no need to intervene overnight Friday evening; the justices could’ve taken at least some of Saturday to try to sort things out before handing down their decision,” Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown, wrote in his Substack newsletterOne First.“This may seem like a technical point, but it underscores how seriously the court, or at least a majority of it, took the urgency of the matter.”However significant, the US supreme court’s ruling is only temporary and the government is likely to ask it to lift it and resume the deportations. The court’s response is likely to set off the next round of its fight with Trump. Some conservative voices, including Sean Davis, CEO of the Federalist, and Trump ally Mike Davis, have already started attacking the justices on the court.“If the Supreme Court is going to ignore the law and the Constitution, then the president is obligated to ignore the Supreme Court and put it in its place,” Sean Davissaid in a post on X on Saturday. “When we’re done deporting illegals, it’s time to start deporting rogue judges,” he wrotein another post.“Let’s hope our Supreme Court justices get their heads out of their asses. They wear robes, not capes,” Mike Davis, who runs the Article III project, a conservative group focused on the courts,wrote on X.Steve Deace, a prominent conservative talkshow host, also suggested Trump was entitled to ignore the courts.“Essentially courts are claiming you can bypass due process to illegally invade America, but then must be granted due process to have your invasion repelled. That is not a country, but judicial insurrection to undo the last election. Trump should ignore it and do what he was empowered by the sovereign will of the people to do,” he wrotein a post on X.Outside of the supreme court, Judge Boasberg laid out a series of escalating actions he could take to punish the Trump officials. (An appellate courthas paused the contempt process while the Trump administration appeals.)In the case before Xinis, the administration seems to be doing whatever it can to avoid complying with orders that it “facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador”.On 10 April, Xinisorderedthe government to take “all available steps to facilitate the return of Ábrego García to the United States as soon as possible”. Deploying one of her judicial tools, she ordered the government to provide daily updates to her on what it was doing to comply with that order.When the government made it clear it was doing nothing to comply, sheordered government officialsto respond to written questions from the plaintiffs and for key officials to sit for depositions. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said in a courtfiling on Tuesdaythat the government was essentially ignoring that order as well.The Trump administration appealed Xinis’s 10 April order to the US court of appeals for the fourth circuit. A panel of judges on the circuit denied the administration’s request to halt the lower court’s rulings. And in a striking opinion, Judge Harvie Wilkinson, a Ronald Reagan appointee once considered a top contender for the supreme court, warned of all the damage that could come if the executive branch continuedto defy the judiciary.“Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both. This is a losing proposition all around,” Wilkinson wrote. “The judiciary will lose much from the constant intimations of its illegitimacy, to which by dent of custom and detachment we can only sparingly reply. The executive will lose much from a public perception of its lawlessness and all of its attendant contagions.“The executive may succeed for a time in weakening the courts, but over time history will script the tragic gap between what was and all that might have been, and law in time will sign its epitaph.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS supreme courtLaw (US)US politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

As the recently appointed director of the Medical Research Council, University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR) and a World Heath Organization consultant, Thomson is one of the country’s leading virus experts.“We used to think that pandemics would occur maybe once in our lifetimes. Now, it’s definitely within the next few years. It could even be tomorrow,” she says.But, Thomson says, “amazing” advances in technology, including genetic sequencing, mRNA vaccines and artificial intelligence (AI), are boosting the world’s ability to deal with these threats, even as travel, urbanisation and the changing climate make pandemics much more likely. The key will be sustaining those capacities and making sure they are available everywhere.View image in fullscreenNew Yorkers getting free Covid-19 test kits in December 2021. Thomson believes the world is now more pandemic-prepared but ‘there are still quite significant vulnerabilities’.Photograph: Pacific Press/LightRocket/Getty ImagesGlobal leaders look likely tofinally agree an accord on pandemic preparednessin May at the World Health Assembly in Geneva – minus the US, which has withdrawn from the process. Anearlier deadline was missedamid wrangling about what poorer countries could expect from richer nations’ pharmaceutical companies in return for access to their data and cooperation.Thomson said the world was “probably more prepared than we were in 2019” but with quite significant vulnerabilities. “I can travel from Glasgow to Uganda in 12 hours – and back – and there’s a lot of that going on.“If we also look at road infrastructures, for example, in Africa, you see that there’s this fantastic improvement in transport infrastructure, which is great, and it’s associated with better lives that people lead. But we also have to prepare ourselves for what that can bring.”Cases ofbird fluin US cattle and an ongoinginternational mpox emergencycentred on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, have recently captured attention.View image in fullscreenContinued surveillance and testing is key to preventing potential global health emergencies.Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty ImagesConcerns on both fronts are justified, says Thomson, with any sustained transmission of avian influenza in humans “potentially very dangerous”. And while mpox could be solved with vaccines already, the issue is getting those jabs to the right places at the right time.More worrying is what could emerge left field.“If you had asked a scientist 20 years ago, ‘are coronaviruses going to cause a problem?’, they would probably have laughed at you and said that coronaviruses cause a mild cold.” Then cameSars, Mers, andCovid-19. Similarly, the study of retroviruses was “a really neglected field” before the advent of HIV.Thomson trained in medicine and parasitology in Glasgow, later specialising in infectious diseases and completing a PhD in London and Oxford. She wasawarded an OBEfor her work on the steering committee of the Covid-19 Genomics UK (Cog-UK) consortium.The world-leading programmesequenced millions of samples from people ill with the virus to track changes and identified the Kent variant, later called Alpha, in late 2020.That level of sequencing is “obviously” not sustainable outside of a major ongoing pandemic, she says, but surveillance with a more targeted approach is vital.In 2022, she was part of a team that, using sequencing techniques,identified an adenovirusas the cause of a mystery global outbreak of severe hepatitis in young children.The level of surveillance of potential threats varies considerably between countries, says Thomson. She is currently part of a project setting up wastewater surveillance systems in Ugandan hospitals, schools and transport hubs. Similar initiatives are under way in the UK.“Sewage, wastewater, is a very good place to look for emerging viruses – and other things, like antimicrobial resistance,” says Thomson.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The first documented case in that outbreak was found because the mortuary where their body was taken “was part of a study evaluating the value of sequencing samples from people that had died unexpectedly”.View image in fullscreenProf Emma Thomson.Photograph: University of GlasgowThomson is excited about the potential of new technologies, many of which will be discussed on 23 April at theUK Pandemic Sciences Network conference. A colleague at the CVR is using AI to predict what shape of proteins a virus will have, based on its genetic sequence “and that’s a huge advance, and it will help us with vaccine design ‘in silico’: on your computer”.Should a new pandemic begin, she says, “I would hope that those technologies will be there to help us. But what worries me is that what you really need is not just me tinkering away in a lab in the UK, but that there’s a widespread global resilience, so that scientists in other countries, like Uganda for example, can also do that.”That is particularly important in parts of the world with very high biodiversity – [such as] Central and South America, the African region and Asia, she says. “The next pandemic may well come from there. [That’s] not to say it won’t come from the UK, but it’s far less likely.”View image in fullscreenSystems to pick up early ‘sentinel’ cases of viruses jumping from animals to humans are vital, says Thomson.Photograph: Eloisa Lopez/ReutersPathogens already adapted for jumping from other animals into humans “are sitting there waiting”, she says. “And as our population extends into high biodiversity regions, the risk of a jump into humans is very high.

This likely comes asno surprise to Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law and one of the foremost commentators on the US abortion wars. The anti-abortion movement, she writes in her new book Personhood: The New Civil War Over Reproduction, has really “always been a fetal-personhood movement” – one that is so emboldened, it is increasingly unconcerned with public opinion or even democratic norms.Fetal personhood is the belief that embryos and fetuses deserve thelegal rights and protections afforded to people. If taken to its logical conclusionin US law, this belief would not only totally outlaw abortion, but also risk pitting the rights of fetuses against the rights of the women carrying them in all kinds of circumstances. In the first year after the US supreme court overturned Roe,at least 200 people were prosecutedfor conduct relating to their pregnancies. Most of these cases involved charges of child endangerment, abuse or neglect – language that treats fetuses as children.A Guggenheim fellow who has published seven books on reproduction and abortion, Ziegler has long seen the fight for fetal personhood as the throughline in the anti-abortion movement’s centuries-long history.In recent years, with Roe gone, she grew convinced that the movement was no longer willing to pull punches inthat fight.“The trajectory has been more and more punitive, more focused on saying: ‘Justice for the fetus means punishing a larger group of people that encompasses not just doctors, but people who assist them, and potentially abortion seekers themselves,’” she said in an interview.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Yale University PressPersonhood,which was released Tuesday, argues that the anti-abortion movement did not have to be so punitive. While anti-abortion activists have never agreed on how to best implement fetal personhood, they over time started to take more cues from Republican politicians, whose own veneration of “law and order” grew alongside its antagonism toward a social safety net. Those developments ultimately paved the way for the more extreme anti-abortion activists to grab more power within the movement.After Roe legalized abortion nationwide in 1973, anti-abortion activists organized in support of an amendment to the US constitution that would recognize embryos and fetuses as people. (The effort never gained the political traction it needed to become a serious possibility.) Around the same time, some activists broke with mainstream anti-abortion groups to push for policies that would offer more support for pregnant women, rather than just ban abortion.Yet the voices advocating for better daycare and housing for mothersfaded away as the anti-abortion movement tightened its alliance with the Republican party. Anti-abortion activists understood that, by portraying fetuses as defenseless victims of the ultimate crime, they could energize conservative voters – and open their pockets.“The Republican party, from the Reagan era onward, has really equated a kind of justice and equality with punishing wrongdoers,” Ziegler said. “It’s a natural fit for the anti-abortion movement: the more its fortunes relied on Republican politicians, the more it framed things the same way.”State-level bans on abortion stilldo not technically punish abortion patients. (Instead, it’s abortion providers, long positioned by the movement as coercing or confusing women into the procedure, and sometimes the people who help them, who are at risk of criminal consequences.)But, over the last few years, self-described “abortion abolitionists” have slowly migrated out of the fringes of the anti-abortion movement and moved towards its center. Unlike mainstream “pro-lifers”, “abolitionists” believe that, if a fetus is a person and abortion is the murder of that person, women should be punished accordingly: as murderers.Neither “pro-lifers” nor “abolitionists” are particularly popular. After Roe’s collapse enabled states to make their own abortion laws, several states – including GOP strongholds like Ohio and Missouri – passed ballot measures to protect abortion rights.According to Gallup, 85% of Americans think that abortion should be legal in all or some circumstances, while a2024 survey from the 19th News and SurveyMonkeyfound that 41% of Americans think “a fetus has rights starting at conception that should be protected by the government.”Even people who support fetal personhood can have tangled, even contradictory views on the matter. Only 9% of people think that the government should restrict access to in vitro fertilization, or IVF, even though IVF as it is currently practiced frequently involves the destruction or abandonment of embryos.None of the bills that allow abortion patients to be charged with homicide are likely to pass this year, but Ziegler doesn’t think“abolitionists” are going anywhere, for two reasons. First, the anti-abortion movement maintains a strong grip in southern Republican-dominated state legislatures, where many of these bills have emerged. Second, Ziegler believes that the anti-abortion movement is embracing “a conviction that it matters less what voters think and more what judges think”.“If you don’t worry about what you’re doing being unpopular, and you believe that ideological consistency, or even logical consistency, is paramount, you would be more inclined to go with an abolitionist argument, and you might worry less about that having political fallout in a politically uncompetitive state,” Ziegler said. “You don’t need to convince most Americans you’re right. You only need to convince five justices on the supreme court.”With abortion bans proving deeply unpopular in the US, circumventing popular will has become a necessity for an increasingly hardline movement.And by relying on the courts rather than voters, the anti-abortion movement can afford to ignore voters’ misgivings.The movement has abandoned its earlier goal of amending the US constitution to recognize fetal personhood; instead, the anti-abortion movement is now seeking to convince courts that the 14th amendment, which guarantees the right of due process and equal protection, already recognizes embryos and fetuses as people from the moment of conception. It is, according to Ziegler, yet another sign of the movement’s drift away from democratic norms.View image in fullscreenAn anti-abortion protester holding a placard reading ‘Medical Fact # 1 Human life begins at fertiliaztion, not at birth’ during International Women’s Day celebrations in New York City 8 March 1975.Photograph: Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesThis interest in the 14th amendment is also something of an about-face for the anti-abortion movement, which is predominantly white and has had a convoluted relationship with race for more than a century. At the time that the amendment passed, as part of a post-civil war effort to recognize Black people’s rights, anti-abortion leaders “didn’t want to talk about race because they weren’t sure that people of color were persons with rights”, Ziegler said. Over time, the anti-abortion movement began using the language of civil rights and affirmative action – but primarily to argue that fetuses are the greatest victim of discrimination.“I think that’s one of the reasons fetal personhood language has been resonant for so long,” Ziegler said of the movement’s co-option of civil rights rhetoric. “It gives people a way to talk about equality and a way to elevate somebody as a victim of discrimination in a way that makes sense to a largely white group of conservatives.”As Roe recedes further into the rearview mirror, Ziegler expects the movement to become even more committed to some of the most unpopular implications of fetal personhood, such as restrictions on IVF. Although Republican politicians have shied away from limiting access to the treatment, the anti-abortion movement has grown more strident on the topic. Some of its leaders even condemned Donald Trump forhis recent executive order supporting IVF.“I think the anti-abortion movement is going to be still full steam ahead,” Ziegler said. “There’s an increasing sentiment in the movement that this is not about pleasingRepublicans. This is not about pleasing voters. This is about the importance of this, ideologically, to the people involved.”"

In the years that followed, Peter gained access to his dad’s bank accounts, diverted Ray’s aged pension to his own bank account and ran up debts in his father’s name that led to two caveats being put on Ray’s home.By the time the fraud was uncovered and Ray, then 74, began to untangle the lies his son had spun, Peter had taken more than $230,000 from him, including seven years of pension totalling $152,423.33.The scam was elaborate, involving a fake letter sent by Peter to his father purporting to be from the then premier of Victoria, Daniel Andrews, as well as fake phone calls in which Peter impersonated Victorian MPs and financial ombudsman officials to reassure Ray about his missing funds, his unpaid pension and his frozen bank accounts.3:27Ray's shocking tale of financial abuse: Guardian 10 News First investigation – videoThe fraud may be more intricate and sustained than in most cases but Ray’s story, which he is telling publicly for the first time at the age of 78, is common; with older Australians the victims of increasing rates of financial abuse, most commonly perpetrated by their adult children – facilitated by a gap in technological ability.In light of his story, advocates are calling for a redesign of financial services to protect older people.Experts want to see protections against elder fraud built intoCentrelink, which sent Ray’s pension to a bank account in Peter’s name for years, without Ray knowing that Peter had changed the account details through his access to Ray’s MyGov.“[Ray’s] story is tragic in every way but it is very common,” says Robert Fitzgerald, the age discrimination commissioner. “We know for certain that financial abuse is growing … and, tragically, the vast majority of that abuse is within the family.”The crimesIn about 2011, on a trip to Thailand, Ray had his credit card stolen. He enlisted Peter, then 40, to help. Peter notified Ray’s bank and told Ray the card had been cancelled and his bank account frozen.Ray, newly retired from a 45-year career as a French polisher with a business making coffins, had just started receiving the aged pension but is not good with technology, so Peter had set up his MyGov account. Ray says he didn’t once use MyGov or know how to log on.“My age group, we’re very naive about, you know, technical communication and all that sort of stuff,” he says. “It’s not what we grew up on.”Ray didn’t realise it but, after getting access to his Centrelink account, Peter almost immediately began stealing his father’s money.Peter would eventually be convicted of three counts of obtaining financial advantage by deception, for defrauding his father of more than $230,000 – $152,000 of his pension and $78,000 in loans taken out in his father’s name. These loans, as well as other debts that Ray says Peter ran up in his name, but on which criminal charges were not filed, led to caveats being taken out against Ray’s home in Rowville, Melbourne.“When he came in, I was so shocked by his story,” says Julie Del Pra, a financial counsellor at Each who helped Ray untangle his financial affairs.While she has seen many cases of elder financial abuse, Del Pra says: “I have not seen the length that the son went to in this to defraud their own father, in the full knowledge of the poverty that he was leaving his dad in.”The fraud included fake phone calls from Peter pretending to be various politicians and officials, who assured Ray that they were looking into his situation and it would be fixed soon. The calls came at least weekly for more than five years.View image in fullscreenAge discrimination commissioner Robert Fitzgerald: ‘Most financial abuse starts off by a member of the family saying, “I’m going to help you.”’Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The GuardianMany times during this period, Ray says he was on the cusp of marching into a bank or Centrelink branch to ask about it all but Peter would reprimand him, telling him he was sorting it and that getting involved would just mess things up.“I would question him about it. And he would say, ‘Leave it to me. I’ll find out.’ And then within a couple of days, I would get a phone call from who I thought was the local Victorian ombudsman for finance, my local member of parliament, all these prominent people, saying: ‘Yes, Mr Baird, your bank accounts have been closed, but we’re working on it, your pension’s still being paid in.’“Now, I find out later that it was him all the time on the phone.“Many a time I said, ‘Come clean, is there something going on with the bank account, just tell me so we can sort it.’ He would turn around and say, ‘On mum’s grave there’s nothing going on.’ It was going on and on but I didn’t really know what to do, honestly.”Peter’s fraud came to light after he was convicted and jailed in 2020 on 18 fraud offences relating to other victims. In the judgment, which was reported in the newspaper, Ray was mentioned.Ray called his local MP’s office – an MP he believed he had been speaking to for years – only to be told that the real Kim Wells MP had never heard of him or his case. Ray, with help from his daughter, began investigating and the whole story unravelled.Ray went to the police, who laid charges against Peter. “I must say, and I’ve been asked this many times, he was never violent to me at all,” Ray says. “And let’s face it, why would you be violent to your bank account?”In May 2023, after pleading guilty to the charges against him, Peter Michael Baird was sentenced to four years in prison for his offending against Ray, though much of that was served concurrently with his sentence on the other fraud charges.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterIn sentencing, Justice Frank Gucciardo noted that Peter had an “unremarkable upbringing” with a good education and that there was “neither gambling, drug or alcohol issues in the family, nor any form of violence”.The judge noted Peter’s did not have a gambling or drug addiction, and that his “offending was motivated by the need to present as a man with money”. He described his conduct as “reprehensible”, saying what he did “defies decency”.Peter has since been released from jail and Ray has an intervention order preventing his son from contacting him.The costRay went for about eight years without access to his bank account or his pension. To survive, his wife – “she was fantastic over the whole thing,” he says – worked seven days a week.Summer was easier, he says, in part because he would work as a cricket umpire in exchange for a small amount of money, and because he didn’t have the funds to heat his home – which made the Melbourne winters difficult.He collected furniture people were throwing away on the street and used his skills to repair the items and sell them on Facebook marketplace. “I’m very embarrassed about this even now,” he says.In a cruel twist, Ray says Peter would occasionally lend him small sums to tide him over or to enable him to go on the occasional trip away with his cricket team. Ray was unaware the loans were coming from his own stolen funds.View image in fullscreenRay’s daughter has ‘worked her backside off’ to try to sort out the financial mess her brother left their father in.Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The GuardianThe emotional toll was enormous – affecting Ray’s health, sleep and marriage, leading to anxiety and depression and to isolation, because he couldn’t afford to go out and didn’t want to admit to his friends what was occurring.It caused “enormous rifts” within his family, he says, particularly in his relationship with his daughter, who suspected Peter of wrongdoing. Ray has reconciled with his daughter, who he says has “worked her backside off” to try to sort out the financial mess Peter left Ray in.Ray is stoic and plainspoken but several times in the course of telling his story he has to stop to cry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You know, you can’t bottle that up.”He knows that elder abuse, particularly when the perpetrators are one’s children, carries with it some shame, which is part of the reason why he is speaking to media for the first time.“You don’t expect your own children to do this,” he says. “It’s bad enough when you hear of other people doing this, but when it’s your own children that is just the lowest thing that can happen.”The system failurePeter was able to take more than $150,000 of his father’s pension because he was the one who set up Ray’s MyGov account and so had access to his login details, Ray says.The court found that for years Ray’s pension payments were sent to a bank account that wasn’t even in Ray’s name.“We see this a lot in elder abuse,” says Del Pra, who adds that she sees “a handful” of cases each year in which Centrelink benefits have been diverted to an abuser.They didn’t go back to Ray and say, ‘Do you actually want this money paid into your son’s account?’Paul Were, lawyer“We know there is a reliance [by] elderly parents on their children or their grandchildren to help set these things up for them because they don’t have the knowledge,” she says. “Ray doesn’t even have a computer.”After he became aware of the fraud, Ray applied for compensation from Centrelink on the grounds of “defective administration”, arguing that it had failed in its duty by not verifying that the new bank account was in his name or that the details had been changed with his consent.After an investigation, Centrelink rejected Ray’s claim, saying that when people were interacting with the service online, it authenticated their identity through their username and password. “When an authenticated person provides new account details, the agency has no requirement or process to verify the bank account,” the investigator wrote in the decision letter about the claim.Ray says: “The story [from Centrelink is], ‘We’ve done nothing wrong. You gave him the password.’ That’s what they see.”Services Australia’s general manager, Hank Jongen, said: “It’s a deeply unfortunate reality that some people prey on vulnerable relatives. Support is always available and there are a number of ways people can help us keep them safe.”Jongen urged pensioners to contact Centrelink immediately if a payment did not arrive on time. He also said Centrelink staff could offer support and correct records, adding extra security measures to prevent unauthorised access and updating or removing nominee access, if needed.Centrelink was constantly improving its systems to make them more secure, he said, including introducing passkeys, a digital ID and two-factor authentication via SMS.“Our customers don’t need to be computer savvy to set this up,” he said. “We have digital coaches who can set up options that work best for them. Customers can book a phone or face to face digital coaching appointment by calling their regular payment line, visiting a service centre or booking online.“We also have a range of personal supports available to ensure everyone gets the help they need. This includes Aged Care Specialist Officers and Financial Information Service Officers.”‘Confronting’: alleged elder abuse cases rise sharply in Australia amid CovidRead moreRay lodged an appeal with the commonwealth ombudsman’s office, which upheld Centrelink’s rejection, saying that while it was “unfortunate” Ray was a victim of fraud, the agency was “not directly responsible for the loss he has suffered … That responsibility lies with Mr Peter Baird.”The decision notice added that Centrelink “does have safeguards and requirements designed to limit fraud” and the fact that they were not sufficient in this instance “does not mean that they, as a whole, were flawed”.Paul Were, a lawyer specialising in cases of elder abuse at Eastern Community Legal Centre, which represented Ray in his compensation application against Centrelink, called it an “absolute no-brainer” that an institution should have to check with its client before arranging for the client’s funds to be paid into someone else’s account.“But in this situation, there were no checks that happened. So when those details were changed they didn’t go back to Ray and say, ‘Do you actually want this money paid into your son’s account?’ We think there’s got to be safeguards put in place for that.”Services Australia told Guardian Australia that its policy required people updating bank details to declare that the account was in the name of the Centrelink customer – but Centrelink did not have access to the beneficiary bank’s data to verify that the account name matched its records.The age discrimination commissioner says financial services need to take into account how elder abuse commonly starts.“Most financial abuse starts off by a member of the family saying, ‘I’m going to help you with your finances, your internet banking, your financial transactions’… We don’t want a situation where every relationship involving adult children and older parents around money is seen as suspect,” he says.“But the truth of the matter is, we now know the risk factors exist, and we can identify what they might be.”Anational elder abuse prevalence study, conducted by the federal government in 2021, found that one in six people over 65 living in the community reported experiencing elder abuse in the previous 12 months.Children made up the majority of perpetrators in every category of elder abuse except sexual abuse.“Our government systems are not set up to protect vulnerable people,” Del Pra says. “Therefore they’re exploited to cause harm. It’s quite simple.“The government knows their systems are causing harm, they know what that harm looks like, of people being forced into bankruptcy, living in poverty, losing their homes.

Pretty much every wildlife trust owns sheep and uses them for essential conservation work, particularly where we have short-cropped grass [for certain rare species].”Work has already begun to restore nature on the newly bought section. The trusts insist they are not abandoning farming but will use regenerative techniques to retain open landscapes that many declining bird species depend upon. In doing so, they hope to offer a new model for the uplands of profitable, nature-friendly farming.Guided by the stockman who has long managed the flock on the hilly, western part of the estate that the trusts have bought, they are slowly reducing the number of sheep while adding new cattle to the grazing community.They include Casanova, an appropriately named red Luing bull charged with increasing the herd of 100 cattle on the Simonside Hills. The Luing is an extremely hardy breed well suited to extreme conditions.Casanova, from nearby Peebles, and his offspring’s grazing and trampling will help manage grasslands to ensure an abundance of songbirds, while beef will provide income for the trust.According to Stoneman, swaths of uplands have been degraded, particularly after the system of “headage payments” in the 1970s, 80s and 90s incentivised land managers to put too many sheep on to the hills. Although flock sizes have fallen since then, they are still higher than they were in the 1940s and 50s.But the future looks grim for upland sheep farming: trade quotas which historically restricted foreign lamb sold in Britain are being phased out post-Brexit, public appetite for lamb is declining, and most sheep farms depend on rapidly disappearing agricultural subsidies.Stoneman said negative future scenarios for British upland farming include widespread land abandonment, as witnessed in central Spain and Portugal, or family farms being dissolved into vast New Zealand-style ranches.“Neither outcomes are good for the people who live, work and prosper in these uplands. At Rothbury we can try and model out a just transition for upland farming,” he said. “If we bring cattle back into the landscape we know that’s good for nature but it might be more profitable as well.”Another fear among many upland residents is landowners turning hillsides into dense stands of non-native plantation forestry, which could be as bad for biodiversity as too many sheep. If the trusts do not raise the rest of the £30m required, the remainder of the estate could still be bought by commercial forestry interests.“If we didn’t buy it, that’s probably the future for the Rothbury estate,” said Stoneman. “That’s catastrophic. Once land use is changed to sitka spruce, and split up, that opportunity for nature restoration at scale, and joining up land, is lost for ever.”Baseline monitoring on the part of Rothbury now under the charity’s care is the first step to transform it into a nature-rich mosaic of boggy moorland, woodland and meadows.Grouse moorland that has historically been burned and drained will be returned to boggy, carbon sinks, while scrub and trees will be allowed to regenerate on grassland, creating a wood pasture, which will be kept from turning into shady forest by cattle.“Our vision is gradual change but in five years’ time you’ll start to see the difference – it’s putting nature at the centre of the estate,” said Mike Pratt, chief executive of Northumberland Wildlife Trust, who is heartened by local backing for the Wildlife Trusts’ purchase of Rothbury.“The enthusiasm and support has been breathtaking,” he said. The Women’s Institute in Rothbury is raising funds and two local crafters have raised £900 in two months through the sale of their needle-felt decorations.“Lots of local people are very excited and energised by helping to restore nature in the area,” said crafter Lydia Nixon. “There’s so much potential for the River Coquet too – and the hills are just magical.”Pratt said he was hopeful that alongside the local fundraising, talks with businesses, philanthropists and funding foundations will help raise the rest of the target. “£30m is a lot of money but it will only buy you a new roundabout in Newcastle,” he said. “We’ve undervalued nature as a society and we’ve got to put nature back into health and it costs money. But in the bigger scheme of things it’s not that much.”Some farmers, including the tenant farmer on the trusts’ newly acquired land, are supportive of the charity’s vision although Pratt admitted that there were concerns about the potential loss of food production.“We can have food productivity and nature, and this is a better use of marginal land,” he said. “Northumberland is the best place, the only place inEngland, where we can really restore nature at a landscape scale.“If we don’t restore nature here, where can we do it? We need to push the envelope and honour this landscape. To restore this for nature and for people’s benefit is just a thrill.”Explore more on these topicsWildlifeEnglandRewildingConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

Anti-terrorism and anti-sabotage units are also already on the ground.View image in fullscreenThe pope’s coffin enters St Peter’s basilica for his lying in state.Photograph: Massimo Valicchia/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockThe basilica and the surrounding area are being patrolled by more than 2,000 police officers between now and the end of the conclave that is expected to take place early next month to choose Francis’s successor. They will be supported by 400 traffic police officers who will help manage the movement of the diplomatic convoys.Saturday’s funeral will conclude with the late pontiff’s coffin being taken, in procession, from St Peter’s Basilica to the Santa Maria Maggiore basilica in Rome’s Esquilino neighbourhood, where Francis will be buried.But the security operation will not end with that final journey. Once Francis has been laid to rest, attention will swiftly turn to the conclave. Should an Italian cardinal be chosen as the 267th leader of the Roman Catholic church, police are bracing for even greater numbers of the faithful to head for the Vatican.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last week theUK supreme courtgave its judgment on a case brought by a women’s group against the Scottish government over the Gender Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) Act 2018.But its judgment – that the word “woman” in equality law refers only to biological sex – has upended years of legal interpretation. And the news of the ruling led to celebrations, protest and an outpouring of emotion.For some, such as the Guardian Weekly deputy editor,Isobel Montgomery, who is a trustee of the domestic violence charity Rise, the court’s decision is reassuring. The Brighton charity offers women-only services based on biological sex, as well as separate LGBTQ services.This, she says, is essential for women who have been subject to male violence and only feel safe if they are in a space with other cis women. “You are dealing with a cohort of people who are in great distress and deserve to be met where their trauma is,” she says.But for others, such asEllie Gomersall,an activist for the Scottish Greens who campaigns for trans rights, the judgment is heartbreaking.“I think this ruling means that, as trans people, it’s now completely impossible for us to ever be able to just put our trans-ness behind us and go about our normal day-to-day lives. It’s always going to be a question for us – are we going to be told: ‘Actually, no, you can’t come in here’?”The Guardian’sScotlandcorrespondent,Libby Brooks,explains how the ruling came about and what it could mean. She tellsHelen Piddthat some legal experts have explained that this legal ruling means organisations can exclude trans women from women-only facilities – but they’re not obliged to do so.Yet with the head of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission saying trans people must use toilets that fit their biological sex at birth, and that changing rooms and hospital wards should use the same criteria, it marks a serious change in public life.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAExplore more on these topicsLawToday in FocusGenderTransgenderWomenUK supreme courtScotland"

But they kill the crocs to eat – not to sell’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 23 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 12.37 EDTShareThe Congo dwarf crocodile is a lovely species. They’re very shy and, unfortunately, very easy to find and catch. Mostly hunted for their bushmeat, these crocs only grow up to a few feet in length and during the dry season, they often spend the daytime hiding in burrows and dens at the water’s edge. Hunters use a long, woody liana vine with a hook on the end to drag them out, before binding their snout with a shorter vine and carrying them away.Last summer, I shot a story about the Congo dwarf crocodile after being given access to the Lake Télé Community Reserve by theWildlife Conservation Society(WCS), which manages this protected area in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with the Congolese government.The species is partly protected, but hunting is permitted to licensed locals within certain areas. The Lake Télé reserve employs rangers, referred to as eco-guards, who have stations on roads leading into the area. They are armed and trained to protect wildlife from poachers or those breaking the terms of their licence, and can search anyone they see coming through in a car or on a motorcycle. Often they seize dwarf crocodiles that are still alive, and release them back into the wild.Although their bite is unlikely to do serious damage, it can still inflict wounds that need stitchesOne of my photographs from this series shows an eco-guard transporting a group ofcrocodiles upriver in a boat. These had been retrieved from a poacher who had been hunting on a large scale and selling the meat on to traffickers who transported it away from local communities and into the major cities. The crocs still have their snouts tied until they are released back into the water as although their bite is unlikely to do serious damage, it can still inflict wounds that need stitches.The reserve management put me in touch with a group of hunters and I was taken to their village on a pirogue – a sort of dugout canoe. I stayed several days with them in the forest while they hunted. Spending time with people who have a very different life than mine is one of the things I most love about my job as a wildlife photojournalist. It’s amazing to sit by a campfire in the middle of the Congolese rainforest and exchange views and ideas with people who have lived their whole lives there. You learn so much.I rarely take portraits, but from the beginning of the project I had an image in mind of a hunter and his catch, and when we were out of the forest I took the time to set up a few shots. This is my favourite of those portraits because the hunter, Brice Itoua, has a particularly expressive face. He was the most skilled hunter in the group and I wanted him to have his hunting tools, the hook and the liana, in his hand. Brice seemed pretty happy with the picture, too; all the hunters got prints to hang in their homes.This isn’t how a hunter would typically carry a crocodile – they hang the crocs over their shoulder and walk through the rainforest wearing them like a backpack. But I wanted this photograph to be a portrait of the crocodile as well as Brice, so I had him hold it facing forwards. The intention was to show the hunters in a good light – these villagers hunt to eat, and even for some of the poachers across central Africa, hunting for bushmeat can be seen as the only way to make a living.For the WCS, it’s a matter of figuring out how much of a species is left and how to properly manage their numbers without completely stopping local traditions. It’s a fine line. Back in the 80s, a hunter would go out and kill maybe one forest antelope and one monkey. That would be enough to feed a family, and there was no impact on wildlife populations. But nowadays it could be five monkeys, six antelopes and two crocodiles, which are being caught not just to eat, but also to sell. That’s why the Congo is suffering from what experts call the empty forest syndrome, where many beautiful rainforest areas have become devoid of wildlife.View image in fullscreenThomas Nicolon’s CVBorn:1987, Agen, FranceTrained:Journalism school in Marseille, France, and self-taught in photographyInfluences:“Nicole Viloteau,Pascal Maitre,Thomas Peschak, Charlie Hamilton James, Christian Ziegler,Brent Stirton, Mattias Klum, and so many others.”High point:“Being awarded a National Geographic Society grant for a two-year project in northern Australia.”Low point:“Every time I put too much pressure on myself (that’s before every shoot).”Top tip:“Work on stories that you have fun shooting, look for topics you’re passionate about – the rest will follow.”Thomas Nicolonis shortlisted in the Professional competition of the Sony World Photography Awards 2025, exhibition atSomerset House, London,until 5 May.Worldphoto.orgExplore more on these topicsPhotographyMy best shotWildlifeSony world photography awardsAwards and prizesConservationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This striking installation by acclaimed French photographer JR heralds the opening of Kyotographie 2025, the city’s celebrated month-long international photography festival.The theme for this year’s event is “humanity”. Last autumn, JR and his team transformed Kyoto into a living studio, setting up mobile portrait stations across the city to capture the rich diversity of Kyōto-jin society. Monks, artisans, politicians, schoolchildren and drag queens – all life is here.View image in fullscreenShooting the Chronicles of Kyoto – each person is photographed against a greenscreen backdropThe photographer and street artist’s technique is to take each portrait on a greenscreen backdrop, with controlled lighting for continuity, so that they can be easily cut out and placed on a constructed landscape. This is based on spaces and buildings photographed from around the city that are stitched together to create a grand tableau of unexpected interactions.View image in fullscreenEvery portrait is taken with the same lighting applied for continuityEach individual is in charge of how they’re portrayed. It’s entirely up to them what they choose to wear and how they pose – there is no direction or choreography from the artist. The only brief for JR is to capture the essence and character of the population and all its vivid qualities.View image in fullscreenThe people are chosen to present a comprehensive cross-section of societyMany also contribute a brief audio reflection – sharing personal stories or everyday thoughts – creating a collective portrait of the present moment.View image in fullscreenThe Chronicles of Kyoto, seen here in its entiretyInside the Shimbun Building, a former printing press turned gallery, visitors are led through JR’s creative process via a detailed exhibition.

Examples of his Chronicles series from other parts of the world are on displayAs always, Kyotographie features a tri-continental dialogue betweenJapan, France and Africa, reflecting the cultural heritage of festival co-directors Yusuke Nakanishi and Lucille Reyboz, who spent her childhood years in Mali. Each year an African photographer is invited to spend a residency in the city to create a unique body of work and this year’s chosen artist is Laetitia Ky from Ivory Coast.Ky is known for self-portraits featuring elaborate sculptures she makes using her hair. The pictures are quirky and witty but they make a serious point about her relationship with her afro hair and the shadow of colonial legacy affecting her heritage.I was raised in a culture where straightened hair and lighter skin were seen as desirableLaetitia KyGrowing up in Abidjan, her friends and family went to exhaustive lengths to live up to an ideal of western beauty involving toxic hair-relaxing chemicals. After undergoing one disastrous chemical treatment herself, Ky discovered a community of women online who were embracing their natural hair and she began to question why she felt the need to alter her true self. Her work is an expression of acceptance and self love that she shares on social media with online communities all over the world and it makes a social and political statement about the complexities of female identity.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTote Tresses was made during Laetitia’s residency in Kyoto; Fishing in Kamo River is another image in the residency seriesDuring her time in Kyoto, Ky has made an affectionate commentary on her Japanese experience, twisting extensions held with wire into her hair to create an act of self-expression that shares and endorses cultural pride.View image in fullscreenArtists Lee Shulman and Omar Victor Diop are featured together in this image from the series Being ThereAfrican experience is also central to the series Being There created by British artist Lee Shulman in collaboration with Omar Victor Diop from Senegal. This nostalgic journey back in time takes examples of the type of photography that may appear in family albums across North America from the 50s and 60s, a time of segregation and racial inequality, and questions what is absent.View image in fullscreenBeing There looks to reimagine a world without segregationThe source images for the project are found or “orphaned” photographs that aren’t attributed to anyone in particular. The pair then add Omar, a black African, into the scene, introducing him naturally in every frame so as not to disrupt the cohesion of the family album. It’s a meticulous process that blends the light and atmosphere and even the surface texture of the original photograph. Displayed in a traditional Japanese home styled as a mid-century domestic setting, the series offers a moving meditation on representation, memory and belonging.View image in fullscreenThe series challenges social and racial stereotypesGrowing up in Senegal, Omar didn’t experience segregation himself but he feels empathy for those who did.

This year marks the return of pioneering Okinawan photographer and activist Mao Ishikawa, now in her 70s. Her 1970s series Red Flower: The Women of Okinawa documents the lives of women – including herself – working in bars frequented by African American GIs stationed on the island.

Writing on X, where he is known for his lengthy and sometimes late-night posts, Petro criticized the press and said he had better things to do than spend time with his foreign minister while visiting the French capital.“Isn’t Paris full of parks, museums, bookstores, more interesting than the letter’s writer, to spend two days in? Almost everything in Paris is more interesting. Don’t I have daughters and granddaughters in Paris who are far more interesting than the writer?” Petro wrote.Leyva’s letter sparked a political firestorm in Colombia, with newspapers stamping his claims across their homepages.Writing in El Tiempo, the journalist Juan Sebastián Lombo Delgado, said that never before in recent Colombian history had a key ex-member of the government publicly questioned “the faculties” of his former boss.Congresswoman Katherine Miranda told the same newspaper the “grave” accusations would be irrelevant “if we were talking about any old person – but we are talking about the head of state”.In 2023, after similar allegations from a Colombian journalist, Colombia’s president responded: “The only thing I am addicted to is a morning coffee.”Earlier this year Petro claimed cocaine – a drug Colombia produces more of than any other country – was “no worse than whiskey” and was only illegal because it was made in Latin America. Cocaine production has soared since he took office nearly three years ago. According to the UN office on drugs and crime there wasa 53% potential increasein cocaine production during 2022, with production reaching 2,664 metric tons.Colombia risks return to violent past, says architect of landmark peace dealRead moreThe claims came as Petro again locked horns with Donald Trump, with whom he had avery public falling out earlier this year over deportation flights.The row between Petro and Trump began at 3.41am local time in Colombia, on 26 January, when the former took to X to condemn the US’s treatment of Colombian migrants and announce he would not allow US planes to land in his country.Trump responded swiftly and ferociously, threatening visa restrictions and tariffs unless Petro backed down, which he quickly did.On Tuesday, Petro said he believed the US had now “taken away” his visa and claimed he could no longer travel there. “I’ve already seen Donald Duck numerous times so I’ll go see other things,” he added sarcastically.Explore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But the group said it did not support the “exploitation of the pain of victims for propaganda purposes in an effort to cover up injustices being committed against innocent Venezuelans, either inside or outside of the country”.The committee opposed those incarcerated being “played with” or “used as a political resource to make invisible the inhumane conditions” in which prisoners were being detained in both countries.Bukele repeated his offer on Tuesday after Maduro’s administration rejected what it called his “cynical” gambit, with Venezuela’s top prosecutorcallingEl Salvador’s president a “tyrannical” human trafficker.Scores of Venezuelan immigrants have been deported to El Salvador since mid-March without due process, withDonald Trump’s officials accusing them of being dangerous terrorists and gang members. However, the administration has produced little evidence for those claims and many of the detainees – who were at least initially held in a maximum-security prison called the Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot) –appear to have no criminal background. Their relatives insist they are innocent.“First they were supposedly alleged terrorists – and now they are no longer terrorists, they’re part of a political exchange,” complained Suárez, who believed the Venezuelan migrants were being treated by Bukele “as if they were animals”.Adelys Ferro, a Florida-based Venezuelan American activist who runs an advocacy group called the Venezuelan-American Caucus, said she also wanted freedom for both Venezuela’s political prisoners and the innocent immigrants being held in El Salvador.Ferro slammed Bukele’s “painful and disgusting” political stunt. “What he’s trying to do – to negotiate innocent Venezuelans back and forth with the Maduro dictatorship – is despicable,” Ferro said.“We cannot celebrate two authoritarians negotiating back and forth with Venezuelan lives.”Explore more on these topicsEl SalvadorVenezuelaTrump administrationDonald TrumpNicolás MaduroUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The president told reporters in Washington on Tuesday heplanned to be “very nice” to Chinain trade talks and that tariffs could drop in both countries if they could reach a deal, adding: “It will come down substantially, but it won’t be zero.”Overnight in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei rose by nearly 2%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 2.4% and the South Korean Kospi gained 1.6%.Trump news at a glance: president will be ‘very nice’ to China; Musk to step back from DogeRead moreThe rally spread to Europe in early trading on Wednesday, with the UK’s FTSE 100 index up 1.6%, while the Italian FTSE MIB rose by 1.1%. Germany’s Dax gained 2.6% and France’s Cac 2.1%.Meanwhile, US stocks opened on a high Wednesday morning, with the Dow rallying over 800 points, and the Nasdaq Composite up over 3%. The rally stalled in the afternoon but all the major stock markets managed to end the day higher.On Wednesday, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, also took a softer, optimistic tone onChinain remarks delivered at the Institute of International Finance in Washington DC, saying that China “knows it needs to change”.“If China is serious on less dependence on export-led manufacturing growth and rebalancing toward a domestic economy … let’s rebalance together,” Bessent said. “This is an incredible opportunity.”Bessenttoldinvestors in a private meeting on Tuesday that he expects a “de-escalation” of the trade war between China and the US in the “very near future”.“‘America First’ does not mean America alone. To the contrary, it is a call for deeper collaboration and mutual respect among trade partners,” Bessent said on Wednesday.Investor confidence also grew after Trump told reporters he would not fire Powell, the chair of the US Federal Reserve, reversing the previous day’s losses triggered by the presidentcalling the central bank boss a “major loser”.The president has criticised the Fed chair repeatedly for refusing to cut interest rates and last week hinted that hebelieved he could dismiss Powellbefore his term as the head of the central bank comes to an end in May next year.Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, last week that Powell’s termination “could not come fast enough”, after the Fed chair raised concerns about the impact of trade tariffs on the American economy.However, the suggestion from the White House that the US central bank will remain independent helped stocks to rise on Wednesday, as well as the prospect of lower tariffs on Chinese imports to the US.The US dollar, which hit a three-year low on Tuesday before recovering, rose by 0.25% against a basket of major currencies.Oil prices also rose on Wednesday, with Brent crude rising above $68 (£51) a barrel amid hopes that lower tariffs will be less damaging to the global economy. The rise was also led by new US sanctions targeting Iranian liquefied petroleum gas and the crude oil shipping magnate Seyed Asadoollah Emamjomeh.Meanwhile, gold, which is traditionally viewed by investors as a safe haven asset during volatile periods, retreated from thenew high of $3,500 (£2,620) an ounceit hit on Tuesday, to trade at about $3,307.Explore more on these topicsStock marketsGlobal economyTrump tariffsDonald TrumpChinaFederal ReserveTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

One diplomatic source said Indonesia requested the meeting.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterThe meeting has been described by multiple sources as part of a regular series of engagements between Pramono and Chan, who is also responsible for managing the department’s diplomatic relationship with Indonesia.Putin’s play for an Indonesian airbase was always likely to fail – but Russia has wider ambitionsRead moreNeither Pramono or the department would comment on the issues discussed at the meeting, with a Dfat spokesperson stating it was “not appropriate to comment on private conversations” in accordance with “longstanding diplomatic practice”.But Hervé Lemahieu, the research director at foreign policy thinktank the Lowy Institute, said “it would be more surprising to me ifRussiawasn’t raised in discussion than if it was”.“Given the caretaker period, Dfat would be mindful of not damaging the relationship in any way and I see it in that context,” Lemahieu said.A diplomatic source said the meeting was not called to specifically discuss Russia’s reported proposal to base military aircraft in a remote corner of eastern Indonesia, but confirmed the exchange could have extended beyond the formal discussion plan.Indonesia has featured in the federal election campaign ever since aUS military publication, Janes, reported that Jakartahad received an official request from Moscow seeking permission for its military aircraft to be based at Manuhua air force base in the province of Papua. The story cited Indonesian government sources.Tuesday’s meeting, which took place less than two weeks before an election, followed an Australian government request for more information about the Russian proposal and the Indonesian response, including from the foreign and defence ministers. It is not known when the Indonesians requested the meeting.Canberra made urgent calls to Jakarta after the story’s publication earlier this month. Within hours, Richard Marles said in a statement that he had discussed the report with Indonesia’s defence minister, Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin.“[He] said to me in the clearest possible terms, reports of the prospect of Russian aircraft operating from Indonesia are simply not true,” Marles said.Last week an Indonesian foreign ministry spokesperson, Rolliansyah Soemirat, said the government had not granted permission to any country to establish a military base on its territory, but his statement did not mention if Russia had made a request.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If only it were so simpleRead moreAsked earlier this month about visiting communities near the proposed sites on the campaign, Dutton said he had been to some in recent years, but would not “be able to get to all of them”.But is he actually avoiding the towns near where he wants to build nuclear reactors?Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterThe ‘Voldemort’ of policiesLabor has long ridiculed the Coalition’s plan for the commonwealth to underwrite the constructionof seven plants on the sites of decommissioned coal stations. Journalists tailing Dutton on the campaign trail have repeatedly questioned why no planned nuclear site has featured in Dutton’s dozens of photo ops and press conferences since the official campaign began.Sites for nuclear power plants proposed by the CoalitionDuringTuesday night’s debate, Albanese claimed Dutton “won’t go anywhere near [the proposed station sites] … because he knows that [the policy] just doesn’t stack up”.On Wednesday, the prime minister visited the Collie power station, about a 20km drive from another of the proposed sites, Muja power station. Both are due to be decommissioned in coming years; the Western Australian state Labor government is pouring hundreds of millions into the town of Collie to support renewable energy projects in the area. “You would think that there was radiation coming from these sites,” Albanese said, referencing Dutton’s absence, “because he just won’t come and won’t talk about what his plans actually are.”The energy minister, Chris Bowen, joked that nuclear power was “the dark lord of policies, the Voldemort, the policy whose name cannot be mentioned by [the Coalition]”.“Peter Dutton has not been within 50km of one of his proposed nuclear reactors in this election campaign,” Bowen claimed.The education minister, Jason Clare, gave a similar line on Wednesday, claiming: “The earthquake in the Hunter this morningwas closer to the site of one of these nuclear reactors than Peter Dutton has even been to them.”4:36Here's why Peter Dutton's nuclear power plan is a fantasy - videoIs Dutton avoiding nuclear sites?The Coalition’s plan is to build nuclear reactors at seven sites: Tarong and Callide in Queensland; Mount Piper and Liddell in New South Wales; Collie/Muja in Western Australia; Loy Yang in Victoria; and Port Augusta in South Australia.Asked at a Perth press conference on 3 April if he would visit Collie during the campaign, Dutton said: “I’ve been to Collie before. There are seven locations around the country and I won’t be able to get to all of them.”In East Maitland on 17 April, in the electorate of Paterson – around an hour’s drive from the proposed plant in the Hunter region – Dutton was asked why he had not visited that site.“I’m not going to be able to meet every Australian. I’ve had the great honour of meeting many around the country,” he answered.Dutton has claimed that “people in regions, including in the Hunter” have been receptive to nuclear power because of the energy-intensive requirements for manufacturing and steel production – and praised residents in those areas as having a higher “energy IQ”.Dutton had previouslypledged to override local opposition to nuclear power, if necessary; inlast week’s ABC debate, Dutton said he would seek local “consensus” – but if that proved impossible “then we’ll do what’s in our country’s best interests”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I have been to both of those communities.”The coastal city of Bunbury, two hours south of Perth, is around 50km away from Collie, but Dutton has not visited during the official campaign.Distance of Dutton's campaign visits from proposed nuclear sites in WADutton doubled down on his criticisms against Labor, claiming the government had not engaged “legitimately” with Hunter region residents about their plans for offshore wind.Nationals MP accused of ‘fobbing off’ Gippsland constituents concerned by Dutton’s nuclear planRead moreAsked if he was himself avoiding community engagement with towns affected by his nuclear policy, Dutton replied “no”, before suggesting he had been to the Hunter “more than once”.“We’ve made our decision, and we’re happy to consult with people in government,” Dutton said.The opposition leader on Wednesday stressed: “We are committed to nuclear, not because it’s politically popular.”“I haven’t committed to nuclear energy for votes. I committed to it because it’s in the best interest of our country,” he said.“We can’t pretend that, as the prime minister and Chris Bowen keep talking about, that wind is free and solar is free.

A small marsupial such as the pademelon, for example, occupies an area smaller than a kilometre squared, whereas the red kangaroo – the largest of all kinds – in outback Australia can hop long distances, sometimes further than 20km.But analysis of fossil teeth found near Mt Etna, 30km north of Rockhampton in Queensland, revealed something quite different. These protemnodon kept to close quarters, living and dying near the caves where their remains were found.View image in fullscreenThe Mt Etna fossil site in Queensland. Protemnodon’s restricted range increased its risk of extinction amid a changing climate, an expert says.Photograph: Scott HocknullCo-author Dr Scott Hocknull, a vertebrate palaeontologist and senior curator at the Queensland Museum, said the individuals from Mt Etna seemed to be “real homebodies” that stayed within “a tiny pocket” in and around the limestone caves.“These gigantic kangaroos were just chilling at home, eating the rainforest leaves, because there were heaps of them around. That also means that the environment was quite stable. It meant that over hundreds of thousands of years, these animals decided that staying put was a good bet.”Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterThe population at Mt Etna was “probably quite happy” for some time, Hocknull said. The rainforest probably provided a reliable source of food, while the caves offered protection from prehistoric predators, such as marsupial lions.But their restricted range was a “bad bet” in the end, Hocknull said, because it predisposed them to a risk of extinction when a changing climate and increasing aridity disrupted the rainforest environment about 280,000 years ago.View image in fullscreenDr Scott Hocknull of the Queensland Museum with a protemnodon skull fossil. The prehistoric kangaroos were ‘real homebodies’, he saysDr Isaac Kerr, who specialises in kangaroo palaeontology at Flinders University and was not involved with the study, said protemnodon fossils – found mainly in the south and east of the country – indicated there wereseveral speciesadapted to different environments.“Probably they were all over the whole continent, including New Guinea,” he said.

These unique signatures made their way into soil and plants, and were reflected in the fossilised teeth of herbivores that ate those plants.Laurikainen Gaete said the technique could be used to understand, on a site-by-site basis, why certain species of megafauna disappeared from particular places.Hocknull said: “It fundamentally shifts how palaeontologists and ecologists look at the fossil record.”Explore more on these topicsWildlifeAustralian climate and environment in focusMammalsFossilsEvolutionnewsShareReuse this content"

However, Trumpet of Patriots is not far behind the ALP, spending $5.6m on traditional TV ads.OnYouTube, a platform where there is 40% more political advertising than there was at the last federal election, Palmer is taking a blunt force approach, according to video ad measurement company Adgile.Labor, the Liberals and the Greens have embraced YouTube’s ability to home in on a specific audience based on demographics and locations, but Palmer is buying to reach broad audiences.Peter Dutton reaffirms support for antisemitism citizenship test question and re-vetting Palestinian visasRead more“This time round we are seeing a four-way battle between Labor, Liberals, Greens and Trumpet of Patriots for dominance on the platform,” Adgile’s managing director, Shaun Lohman, said.The relatively low cost of YouTube ads means the parties have been able to diversify their messages, with Labor so far making 266 different YouTube ads and the Liberals 251.“At present, Labor is outspending the Coalition in total, but the Coalition is spending more on YouTube, and it’s entirely possible that they may be holding back money for the final week of the campaign,” Lohman said.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterOn Facebook and Instagram, Labor is also ahead, so far spending almost $700,000 since the election was called.

The Coalition haspledgedto build taxpayer-funded nuclear reactors at seven sites around Australia in a bid for more “reliable” power than could be achieved with renewables firmed by storage such as batteries and pumped-hydro, using gas as a back-up.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterThe Coalition has promised a two-and-a-half-year consultation process, but some Nationals constituentshave saidtheir concerns are already being ignored and some community groupshave expressed angerthat they will not be able to veto plants in their area. The new survey suggests concern about nuclear power plants being built nearby is widespread.Australians most concerned about nuclear plants being built nearbyAlmost 10% were concerned when asked about the prospect of a nuclear plant being built within 50km of their homes, while 16% were very concerned and 38.8% were extremely concerned. By comparison, about 80% viewed wind and solar power favourably and the majority surveyed would not be concerned if solar or windfarms were built nearby.The previously unpublished data was collected in December and comes from theNational Climate Action Survey, conducted annually by researchers at Griffith University since 2021. The survey asks more than 300 questions, such as where people get information about climate change from, whether they have been affected by natural disasters and what changes they’d be prepared to make to their behaviour.The aim of the survey, according to associate professor Kerrie Foxwell-Norton, is to measure “the ways in which Australians are thinking about climate change and [climate] action”.“You can see in the way that stats play out, that there’s a lot of concern around the development of a coalmine, gas site, and a nuclear power plant, as opposed to renewable sources of power,” says Foxwell-Norton.“So people are aware of the local environmental outcomes for the development of fossil fuel energy sources as opposed to renewables.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But after that, things get really complicated in terms of how Australians are responding in regional areas as opposed to metropolitan and remote areas. How people are responding based on their socioeconomic class, upon their age, their gender and so on.“And that sort of complexity is not something to be smoothed away if we are going to seek meaningful action on climate, then we need to dig down into the complexity.”Explore more on these topicsNuclear powerAustralian election 2025EnergynewsShareReuse this content"

Rolling back the legislation would be a problem,” Harvey said.The reform passed as part of an industrial relations bill, opposed by the Coalition, which criticised Labor over a rushed process – exacerbated by a last-minute discovery thatthe bill inadvertently allowed criminal penaltiesfor breaches, which was quickly amended.2:11The election campaign reaches the pointy end as early voting opens - TLDR: Election 2025 - videoThe industrial relations minister, Murray Watt,said last yearthe laws aimed to address workers having to take “constant calls or constant emails with an expectation that they’re going to be monitoring and responding, when they’re not getting paid to do it”.Union groups backed the change, put forth by the Greens as part of complex negotiations, while business groups said it wasunnecessary and could lead to job losses. The Coalition argued it would create “confusion and uncertainty” and reduce the ability for workplaces to have flexible working arrangements.Peter Dutton has vowed to repeal the right to disconnect, a position recommitted to by the shadow IR minister,Michaelia Cash, two weeks ago. On 12 April, at a press conference with Dutton, she claimed the change was “costly, it is confusing and … complex”.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterIn a statement, Cash said the Coalition would consider any evidence that mental health protections for workers should be expanded, but claimed the changes had led to some employers having to work extra hours themselves.“There have long been protections against unreasonable overtime in the Fair Work Act, which we support. Employers also already have obligations to protect the health and safety of their staff, including their mental health. These obligations will continue,” she said.Prof Patrick McGorry from the mental health organisation Orygen, who has endorsed the mental health policies of both major parties at this election, backed the right to disconnect laws for ordinary workers.“You’ve got to look after yourself. If you can’t switch off, it will affect your mental health,” he said. “For most workers it’s not necessary for them to be available and work beyond the hours … If there is a need to contact people outside working hours, that should be formalised and they should be paid.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Does this mean no more work intrusions on personal time?Read moreMcGorry said arrangements should be different for executives or senior staff, who were better compensated than ordinary workers and therefore needed to be more flexible, but that it should be a conversation inside workplaces. “If people are forced or required to always be ‘on’, that’s not good for many people,” he said.Prof Ian Hickie, from the University of Sydney’s Brain and Mind Centre, said the laws helped create better work-life balance. He said laptops and smartphones, as well as the work-from-home shift, saw people often working longer hours at home before or after their rostered shifts.“The right to disconnect is an important piece of legislation,” he said.Hickie said he would “absolutely” have concerns if the law was repealed.Harvey said researchers were identifying increasing levels of poor mental health among young workers in Australia. While the root cause was not yet certain, he said one hypothesis was the further extension of work into home life.“It’s very hard to get away from work. Mobile phones, emails, social media can follow you everywhere. What we know is people having a chance to disconnect from work … like office workers getting a chance to switch off, is important,” he said.In a statement, Watt stood by Labor’s reform.“The right to disconnect changes made during the last term are already having a big impact on the lives of millions of workers. Uninterrupted time for yourself, with your partner and with your children is vital not only to be happier, but also helps employers with worker retention,” he said.In Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636,Lifelineon 13 11 14, and atMensLineon 1300 789 978.

The Financial Timesfirst reported Putin’s proposalon Tuesday.The vice-president,JD Vance, confirmed on Wednesday that the US would seek to “freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today”. Some territory could change hands, he said.“The current lines, or somewhere close to them, is where you’re ultimately … going to draw the new lines in the conflict,” he said. “Now, of course, that means the Ukrainians and the Russians are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own.”Vance says US will ‘walk away’ unless Ukraine and Russia accept peace dealRead moreBut reports of the US proposal do not include other Kremlin demands, including a limit on the future size of the Ukrainian military or a ban on foreign troops in the country. Russia had listed concerns over Ukraine’s military and foreign backing as among its “root causes” for launching its 2022 full-scale invasion.A draft version of the White House proposal seen by Axios reported that Russia would receive de jure recognition of Moscow’s control of Crimea, de facto recognition of Russia’s occupation of much of eastern Ukraine, and a promise that Ukraine would not become a member of Nato (although it could join the EU).Russia could also receive sanctions relief for its energy sector, enabling the Kremlin to increase vital revenue flows that have been impeded since the invasion.Ukraine, in turn, would receive a “robust security guarantee” from an ad hoc group of European nations, although the draft did not describe how a peacekeeping force would operate or whether the US would take part. Ukraine would also be promised unimpeded passage on the Dnipro River and some territory in the Kharkiv region, along with vaguely defined pledges for future financial support for rebuilding.The frontlines in Ukraine - mapSenior Russian officials have said Moscow will not take part in talks that include discussions of a European peacekeeping force in Ukraine. “Russia is still against [the presence of European peacekeepers],” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Wednesday. “That would be de facto Nato forces and resources on the territory of Ukraine. It was one of the main reasons for the start of the special military operation.”Russia ‘may be willing to drop claims to parts of Ukraine it does not occupy’Read moreThe US decision to recognise Crimea would be politically contentious in Ukraine and would mark a turning point in US postwar policy, with the White House effectively endorsing a Russian effort to redraw the borders of Europe by force.The Ukrainian leader,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said this week that Ukraine “will not legally recognise the occupation of Crimea … There’s nothing to talk about here. This is against our constitution.”Donald Trump reacted angrily to Zelenskyy’s remarks on Wednesday, calling them “very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia”.“Nobody is asking Zelenskyy to recognize Crimea as Russian Territory but, if he wants Crimea, why didn’t they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?” he wrote.“The situation for Ukraine is dire,” he said. Zelenskyy “can have peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole country”.Moscow also appears to be eyeing the deal favourably. “There is a chance to make a deal,” said one source close to the Kremlin. “But they could also miss that chance.”A draft of the plan seen by Axios, as well as the Telegraph, said that Ukraine would retain control over the Zaporizhzhia power plant but it would be managed by the US, which would supply electricity to both Ukraine and Russia.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaJD VanceDonald TrumpVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Starmer is due to meet the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in London on Thursday as momentum builds towards a UK-EU summit in May.Cabinet differences remain on the shape a youth visa deal could take. Reeves is said to be in favour of a deal that includes time-limited youth visas – the highest priority for Brussels – but the home secretary,Yvette Cooper, has insisted on a cap on numbers, with a time limit of one year.One source with knowledge of the talks said the cap would probably be about 70,000 people. “Yvette is pursuing the task she has been set by the PM – to reduce net migration,” a source close to the home secretary said.Asked in Washington on Wednesday about the possibility of a youth mobility scheme, Reeves said: “We want to see net migration fall as a government and we’ve set out plans to achieve that. We also want to have control of who comes into this country. That is really important for us.“But we’re not going to be returning to free movement. We will bring down net migration, and the talks are ongoing with the EU around reducing trade barriers.”One EU source said: “Everyone is being cautious but there is a desire to find a way that removes any suggestion that this is going to increase migration. It could come in many forms and quotas is just one.”View image in fullscreenAndrew Lewin, the Labour MP for Welwyn Hatfield, led the call for ‘a new and bespoke youth visa scheme’.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverIn their letter to the minister, 62 MPs led by the Welwyn Hatfield MP, Andrew Lewin, said the government should work with the EU to create new opportunities for British young people to work and travel in the EU, similar to agreements with more than a dozen countries including Australia and Canada.“We want to see a new and bespoke youth visa scheme for UK and EU citizens aged under 30. As with all of the UK’s existing schemes, we believe this should be time-limited and subject to a cap on numbers,” the MPs said.It is understood the UK is on the verge of agreeing to enter into negotiations on three key topics including the youth mobility scheme, a sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) deal to eliminate checks on food and drink being exported to the EU and entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, and a deal on carbon emissions.It is thought the SPS deal would be based on a deal the EU struck with Switzerland in 2023, but with substantial changes. “The EU hates the Swiss mode. It is full of complexity and inefficiency but that is not to say it could not be a conceptual model to build on,” an EU source said.A defence pact is almost certain after the EU’s white paper on defence in March paved the way for British defence companies such as Babcock and BAE Systems to bid for money from the new €150bn (£129bn)EU defence fund.UK and European sources also expect an announcement on trafficking and intelligence sharing as a way of signalling a tough approach to irregular migration.Full negotiations are expected to be given the go-ahead to start by the autumn, once the European Commission has a mandate from member states.The MPs’ intervention has been privately welcomed by some ministers as a tacit signal of the outline of what the government is seeking to achieve. In their letter to Thomas-Symonds, the MPs say the UK should seek to allow products to be tested in the UK to reduce cost and complexity for UK and EU firms.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But negotiations may be possible for specific sectors, such as pharmaceuticals.View image in fullscreenStella Creasy, the chair of the Labour Movement for Europe, said the government’s ambitions should go even further than the letter suggested.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianMPs also said the government should seek to join the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean (PEM) convention, a customs union alternative that would lift barriers particularly for the automotive, chemicals and pharmaceutical sectors.“As certainties about globalisation, trade and tariffs break down at a remarkable speed, we are reminded how our stability, prosperity and security depend on having deep and resilient partnerships with like-minded nations, based on free and frictionless trade, shared values and political trust,” the letter says.Lewin told the Guardian that Starmer should be confident he had support and a mandate for a more ambitious settlement.“This is a moment of opportunity for all who want to see a closer relationship between the UK and the EU, and that includes millions of voters who put their confidence in Labour last year,” said Lewin, who won his seat from the former defence secretary Grant Shapps.The letter has been signed by dozens from the new intake of MPs, including those with constituencies that voted to leave the EU. They include Amanda Hack, who won Andrew Bridgen’s former seat in North West Leicestershire, Mike Tapp, the Dover and Deal MP, and the prominent new backbenchers Yuan Yang, Emily Darlington, Joe Powell, Josh Dean, Simon Opher and Tom Rutland.Phil Brickell, who also signed the letter, said: “This isn’t about relitigating the Brexit years. Rather, it’s about ensuring businesses such as those in my Bolton West constituency can access the European markets fenced off from them by the Tory-botched Brexit deal.”Experts said even the push from Labour MPs would be unlikely to address the hit to UK economic growth caused by Brexit. “I think they are in a race against time to tie down whatever they want to do with the US before they do a deal with the EU. It is a two-headed monster,” said Mij Rahman, the head for Europe at the Eurasia Group consultancy.David Henig, a trade expert, said the deal was unlikely to deliver the economic growth Labour is seeking. “Perhaps it can best be seen as a reasonable first step that should be accompanied by a plan to go further within respective red lines,” he said.Stella Creasy, the chair of the Labour Movement for Europe, said the government’s ambitions should go even further than the letter suggested. “We have to be ruthless about reducing the barriers to trade with Europe that the Tory Brexit deal created, whether they are the paperwork created by VAT, emissions trading schemes that affect energy costs or the extra headaches caused by new regulations,” the MP for Walthamstow said.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionBrexitTrade policyMigrationEuropeLabourRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

There was once a time when a word from Tory Eurosceptic Bill Cash on dynamic alignment could splash national newspapers.Now the more common reaction to those terms is a barely stifled yawn. And that is exactly how No 10 would like it to stay.There are those in the Labour party who would like to seeKeir Starmerembrace a more romantic pro-European story, to extol the UK’s European values and solidarity, as a counter to the views of Donald Trump.But that is not this prime minister’s style. So there will be a more ambitious EU reset but in the most low-key way possible. The aim in Downing Street is to Make Brussels Boring Again.It seems fertile ground for the UK to seek closer trade ties with Brussels, and within No 10 there is a will to do it, as long as the words “single market”, “customs union” and “freedom of movement” do not appear anywhere.There are three key reasons why the UK can think bolder. The first is the most obvious: the international turmoil caused by both the US’s wildly wavering support for Ukraine and by Trump’s tariffs has made Brussels a far more willing partner in the coming negotiations.UK must improve trade relations with Europe amid US tariff wars, warns ReevesRead moreSecondly, the Brexit dinosaurs are mostly gone from the House of Commons. In their place are an army of Labour millennials eager to vote through closer ties withEurope, though there are some who will wobble in their “red wall” seats with Reform snapping at their heels. But Brussels need have no fear – as it once did – about the instability of the UK parliament.And there has been a significant shift in public opinion on Brexit that suggests people are more open to closer ties with Europe. Some of that is simply because of population turnover – according tothe Economist, two-thirds of the people who have died since 2020 supported leaving the EU.But each of these three factors have their downsides. Starmer has to tread carefully as he negotiates to remove US trade barriers.It is debatable whether the UK really received lower tariffs than the EU because of a desire for preferential treatment, but it is still a tightrope to walk with such an unpredictable White House inhabitant. It would be advantageous to do an agreement with the US before a deal with the EU.In parliament, the government is worried that its new Labour MPs will get too excited about Europe and begin to crow publicly about how the reset shows how wrong the Brexiters really were. Any kind of language like that is likely to be stamped on hard.And Starmer may have ejected Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker from parliament but he has a very effective foe in Nigel Farage.Some in government believe Farage will ultimately show little interest in what the government does on border sanitary checks – perhaps even he is bored of shouting “Brexit betrayal” or realises it is lower salience than immigration or net zero.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There could be a major polling backlash if the issue is likely to be seen to dominate the government’s agenda.And the drop in support for leave does not tell the full story. Downing Street sources say from their focus groups that this is not the people who say they regret voting leave. The blame is laid at the feet of the Tories who negotiated the last deal.This is how Starmer will frame his eventual EU reset, fixing the mess of the negotiation he will say was left by Boris Johnson’s government.There will even be language that will infuriate some pro-European MPs, that forging smoother trade with Europe is a “Brexit benefit”, that the UK can be more flexible with its powerful neighbour.But the strategy over the coming weeks and months will be to push for the most ambitious deal possible in the most unromantic terms possible.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerEuropean UnionBrexitForeign policyEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Zelenskyy countered by proposing a simple ceasefire without conditions on both sides, though this did not immediately gain any traction from the US.But after a day of speculation and partial disclosure of the terms of the peace proposal, Trump attacked his Ukrainian counterpart for complaining that Kyiv was unwilling to cede Crimea toRussia– the most contentious aspect of the tentative agreement that has leaked so far.US peace plan emerges as freezing of Ukraine frontlines with concessions to PutinRead moreThe US president wrote on social media that “Crimea was lost years ago” in 2014, when Barack Obama was president, and its control “is not even a point of discussion”, an apparent reference to the fact that Ukraine has been unable to recapture it in the three-year war sparked by Russia’s full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.Reports that Washington would be willing to recognise Crimea under Russian control have been circulating for a couple of days. That prompted Zelenskyy to say on Tuesday that “Ukraine will not recognise the occupation of Crimea”, arguing that doing so it would be incompatible with the country’s constitution.Responding to a report of his comments, Trump wrote on Wednesday that “this statement is very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia” and accused the Ukrainian leader of making “inflammatory statements” that “makes it so difficult to settle this War”.“Nobody is asking Zelenskyy to recognize Crimea as Russian Territory,” Trump wrote, implying that US was willing to do so, before accusing Ukraine of failing to defend Crimea. “If he wants Crimea, why didn’t they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?”Later, Trump said he thought Russia had agreed to a deal to end the conflict in Ukraine, with Zelenskyy now the holdout.“I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelenskyy,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskyy. So far it’s been harder.”Russia unilaterally annexed Crimea in March 2014 during a political crisis in Ukraine after the ousting of the country’s pro-Russia president, Viktor Yanukovych. Gunmen seized the regional parliament and airports, and in a subsequent referendum 97% voted to join Russia. The poll was not recognised as legal by the US, UK or EU.Matthew Savill, the director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said that US recognition of Russia’s control of Crimea would be a “de jure recognition of territory taken by force” and amount to “actively endorsing the Russian position in opposition to the European position and Ukrainian politics”.A Ukraine peace summit in London was hastily downgraded on Wednesday morning after Washington said the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, would not be travelling the evening before. Hosted by the UK foreign secretary,David Lammy, the meeting was said to be taking place at the level of officials instead.Downing Street said it had consisted of substantive technical meetings on how to stop the fighting, with Washington’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg; Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, and national security advisers from France and Germany among those present.Vance had earlier called on Ukraine and Russia to accept a US-led peace proposal and threatened that Washington would abandon its effort to end the war – a Trump campaign promise – if it was not accepted.“We’ve issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and the Ukrainians, and it’s time for them to either say yes or for the United States to walk away from this process,” Vance said.1:28JD Vance says Russia and Ukraine must 'both give up territory' for peace – videoThe US proposal would mean “we’re going to freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today”, Vance said, though he added there should be some adjustments. “Now, of course, that means the Ukrainians and the Russians are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own.”A ceasefire on the current frontlines has already been accepted in principle by Ukraine and Zelenskyy called again for an immediate halt to the three-year war. “In Ukraine, we insist on an immediate, full and unconditional ceasefire,” he said, adding that “stopping the killings is the number one task”.Early on Thursday, a missile attack in Kyiv killed at least two people and wounded 54, the capital’s mayor said. Thirty-eight of the injured – including six children – were hospitalised, Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram.Nine people were reportedly killedearly on Wednesday when a Russian drone hit a bus carrying workers in the Ukrainian city of Marhanets – one of 134 large drones that Ukrainian authorities reported had attacked the country overnight.Though Ukraine has indicated it is willing to accept de facto Russian occupation of about a fifth of its territory, arguing that it will reunite the country by diplomatic means eventually, it has refused to accept what would be a domestically unpopular partition by accepting Russia’s formal control of Crimea, even if the recognition came from the US.1:16Russia launches attacks across Ukraine before postponed London peace talks – videoOther anticipated elements of the deal are that Ukraine would be prevented by a US veto from joining Nato, a point largely accepted by a reluctant Kyiv. Another, that future security guarantees would be provided by a UK and French-led “coalition of the willing” made up of 30 countries, has not been accepted by Russia.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia continued to oppose the presence ofEuropean peacekeeping forces, which Ukraine sees as the only viable alternative to Nato membership for ensuring its security.Peskov said there were “many nuances” surrounding negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine and that the positions of the various parties involved had yet to be brought closer – suggesting, from a Russian perspective, that the deal was not yet agreed.Initial reports on Tuesday had suggested Russia was willing to trade territory it does not control in Ukraine – in effect, fresh air – for a US recognition of its seizure of Crimea, in what would be a formal acknowledgment that it is possible to change borders by force, creating an extraordinary post-second world war precedent.Russia may be banking on the idea that Ukraine is weary after more than three years of war and that its proposal is a reasonable counter to western suggestions, backed by the US, Ukraine and Europe, that there should be an immediate and full ceasefire to allow other wider negotiations to take place.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpJD VanceMarco RubionewsShareReuse this content"

He had been recovering from double pneumonia, which had kept him in hospital for five weeks.In keeping withhis requests for simple funeral rites, Francis was dressed in his vestments, holding a rosary, with his open casket lined with red cloth.1:29Thousands pay respects as Pope Francis moved to St Peter's to lie in state – videoUnlike those of most of his predecessors, his coffin, which is being watched over by two Swiss Guards, has not been raised on a platform. That was one of the rituals Francis shunned when he simplified rules for papal funerals last year.His funeral mass will take place at St Peter’s Square on Saturday morning, an event that will be attended by a host of world leaders and royals, including the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, the US president, Donald Trump, and Prince William. He will then be buried at the Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica in Rome’s Esquilino neighbourhood, breaking with longstandingVaticantradition.View image in fullscreenThe Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, paying her respects to Pope Francis inside St Peter’s Basilica.Photograph: Vatican Media Handout/EPAOn Wednesday morning, mourners erupted into a prolonged but sombre applause as Francis’s coffin was carried through the square by pallbearers in a solemn procession involving dozens of cardinals and bishops, and watched over by Swiss Guards.The bells of the basilica gently tolled as a choir chanted psalms and prayers in Latin, repeating the call to “pray for us”.Barriers at the basilica: the logistical challenges of Pope Francis’s funeralRead more“It was the most profound moment,” said Cardinal Thomas Christopher Collins, the former archbishop of Toronto, who was among the procession. “But from the simple prayers to the incense, it was no different to a [funeral] ritual that any baptised person would have.”As of Wednesday night, a Vatican official said almost 20,000 people, from all parts of the world, had joined the queue, which stretched along the road leading to Vatican City, to pay their respects to Francis, many holding umbrellas to shield themselves from the sun.Braced for a long wait, Abigail and her family, from California, brought food. “We’re happy to wait as long as it takes,” she said. “It’s a privilege to be here.”View image in fullscreenThe queue of people outside the basilica waiting to pay respects to the pope.Photograph: Cecilia Fabiano/LaPresse/Rex/ShutterstockIt was only a few days ago that Francis had made his way through St Peter’s Square aboard the popemobile before appearing on the basilica’s central balconyto give a blessing to the crowds gathered for Easter Sunday mass. It was his final public appearance.Even though people were aware that Francis was seriously ill, some of those waiting in the queue to pay tribute were still struggling to digest the fact of his death.“It feels strange that he is no longer with us,” said Piotr Grzeszyk, from Poland.Their shoulders wrapped with the flag of Francis’s native Argentina, Vicky Cabral and her family arrived in Rome from Buenos Aires on Saturday and saw Francis on the balcony the next day.They had been hoping to get another glimpse of him during the now suspended canonisation of Carlo Acutis, which had been due to take place on 27 April.“We came toItalyfor the Catholic jubilee year and for Carlo Acutis,” said Cabral. “But it now feels like a real blessing to be here for this special moment. Francis was a great pope and I think he should be made a saint too.”Once through the huge bronze doors and inside the cavernous basilica, pilgrims fell silent as they shuffled slowly towards the altar.View image in fullscreenThe body of Pope Francis is taken into St Peter’s Basilica.Photograph: Stefano Spaziani/UPI/Rex/ShutterstockFrancesco Catini, who travelled to Rome from Venice, had waited for four hours to see Francis’s body. “It was a beautiful experience,” he said. “To me, Francis was a living example of peace, of love, and especially of humility and solidarity.”Chiara Frassine, from Brescia in northern Italy, had waited a similar amount of time. “I’m very happy to be here,” she said as she left the basilica. “Pope Francis had a pure soul. He was a humble point of reference for many people, not just Catholics.”Not everyone waiting to pay their respects was Catholic. Standing at the end of the queue was Gunnar Prieß, from Germany, who arrived in the Italian capital on Wednesday morning.“I booked a flight only to be here to see this,” he said. “I am not Catholic, but this is so majestic. What we’re seeing here today is the expression of a holy ritual that goes back 2,000 years. There’s an aura in the Vatican and I wanted to experience it.”View image in fullscreenCrowds in St Peter’s Square as the pope’s coffin was taken into the basilica.Photograph: Cecilia Fabiano/LaPresse/Rex/ShutterstockAs the funeral rituals continue, speculation is rife about who will succeed Francis. Some 103 cardinals met on Wednesday evening and approved nine days of mourning from the date of the funeral, with a conclave –the secret election process to choose a new pope– therefore not expected to begin before 5 May.There is no clear frontrunner, although Luis Antonio Tagle, a reformer from the Philippines, and Pietro Parolin, from Italy, who were among the procession, are early favourites.Collins will be involved in the conclave too and, at 78, will be among the 135 cardinals eligible to vote. But he declined to give any hint of who he thought might succeed Francis.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismChristianityReligionThe papacyVaticanItalynewsShareReuse this content"

For years, he prominently displayed a photo in his living room of Baruch Goldstein, who massacred 29 Muslim worshippers in Hebron in 1994.In 2022, the Biden administration condemned Ben-Gvir’s visit to the memorial ofviolently racist and anti-Palestinian rabbi Meir Kahane, whom the national security minister was a follower of in his youth.“Celebrating the legacy of a terrorist organization is abhorrent. There is no other word for it,” US state department spokesperson Ned Price saidat the time. “We urge all parties to maintain calm, exercise restraint, and to refrain from actions that only serve to exacerbate tensions and that includes in Jerusalem.”But since joining Netanyahu’s coalition government, Ben-Gvir has continued his provocations, including an inflammatory visit to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound last year – also a historically significant and highly venerated holy site in Judaism – that drew international outrage and a rebukefrom Netanyahu himselflast summer. Ben-Gvir again visited the Al-Aqsa mosque earlier this month,prompting more outragein the region.The White House did not return a request for comment.Following Yale, Ben Gvir wasexpected to addressa gathering on New York’s Upper East Side, focusing on “securing Israel post-October 7th”.Explore more on these topicsIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuYale UniversityTrump administrationMar-a-LagoUS politicsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The strike ignited a huge fire that claimed most of the casualties, said a civil defence spokesperson, Mahmoud Bassal.The Qatari network Al Jazeera and Palestinian media broadcast footage of several bodies wrapped in white shrouds at al-Shifa hospital’s morgue, and women weeping over the body of a child.“We were sleeping and suddenly something exploded, we started looking and found the whole school on fire, the tents here and there were on fire, everything was on fire,” a witness, Umm Mohammed al-Hwaiti, told Reuters.“People were shouting and men were carrying people, charred [people], charred children, and were walking and saying ‘dear God, dear God, we have no one but you’. What can we say? Dear God, only,” she said.Unusually, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not comment on the school attack. Israeli officials say fighters from Hamas and allied factions hide behind civilian infrastructure, claims that the Palestinian militant group denies.Israel has renewed its aerial and ground campaign since the collapse of a two-month-old ceasefire and hostage and prisoner release swap in mid-March. Since then, according to the UN, nearly 2,000 people have been killed and another 420,000 forced to leave their homes or shelters as Israel seizes ever-larger swathes of the territory for what it terms security buffer zones.More than 51,300 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory offensive after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and another 250 taken captive. Fifty-nine hostages remain in Gaza.Israel imposed a total blockade on the strip two weeks before it unilaterally restarted the fighting. Food, water, fuel and medicine are now running critically low, leading aid agencies to declare that Gaza’s already devastating humanitarian crisis is worse than ever.On Wednesday, the foreign ministers of the UK, France and Germany urged Israel to stop blocking aid into Gaza, warning of “an acute risk of starvation, epidemic disease and death”.“Humanitarian aid must never be used as a political tool and Palestinian territory must not be reduced nor subjected to any demographic change,” the ministers said. The joint statement – unusually strong criticism from some of Israel’s closest allies – came several weeks after similar calls from the UN, EU and Arab states.Efforts led by Qatari and Egyptian mediators to resume talks aimed at a ceasefire and ending the war have not yet led to a breakthrough. Reports of a new plan emerged on Wednesday that would include a truce of between five and seven years, and the release of the rest of the Israeli hostages seized in October 2023.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Israel has not responded to the invitation to another round of indirect negotiations.There has been little sign that either side is willing to move closer on fundamental issues such as the disarmament of Hamas or the withdrawal of Israeli troops, although it is believed mediators are under pressure from Washington to show progress before Donald Trump’s visit to the Middle East next month.The president of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA), Mahmoud Abbas, made a rare intervention in the conflict on Wednesday, calling for Hamas to free the Israeli hostages and saying their captivity provided Israel with “excuses” to attack Gaza.Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, called Abbas’s remarks “insulting”. Hamas and Abbas’s secular Fatah party, which dominates the semi-autonomous Palestinian Authority, fought a brief civil war in 2007 that resulted in Hamas seizing control of Gaza.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It also took an active role in demonstrations in Amman, Jordan’s capital, against Israel’s war in Gaza.Last year, Human Rights Watch criticised Jordanian authorities for arresting and harassing “scores of Jordanians” who participated in the pro-Palestine protests or posted online in support of them.Jordan’s government has been outspoken against the war in Gaza, expelling Israel’s ambassador and consistently calling for an end to the humanitarian siege on the territory.Protesters have called for the government to scrap the peace treaty between the two countries, cancel an unpopular gas deal and end all exports to Israel.The Muslim Brotherhood and its ally in Gaza, Hamas, have seen a surge in popularity among Jordanians since the start of the war. Jordan expelled Hamas’s leadership and shut its offices in 1999, and it views the group’s growing popularity among its own population warily.Authorities searched the headquarters and branches of the IAF across the country on Wednesday. A week earlier, authorities arrested Khaled al-Johani, the office director of the IAF.Wael Sakka, the IAF’s general secretary, told the Guardian that the group’s work would continue despite the ban on the Muslim Brotherhood.“Our party has no organisational link with any other entity and we are in compliance with the provisions of the constitution, the political parties law and Jordanian law,” Sakka said.Farraya said the government was committed to guaranteeing freedom of expression and political activity in accordance with the law. The country’s cybercrime unit later said publishing anything on social media relating to the Muslim Brotherhood would be met with legal action.Rights groups have warned of a steady erosion of civic space in Jordan in recent years, with Freedom House downgrading the country from “partially free” to “not free” in 2021 due to its crackdown on civil society.The passing of a new cybercrime law in 2023 that criminalised speech on social media that “undermined national unity” drew criticism from rights groups.Explore more on these topicsJordanMuslim BrotherhoodMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Almost all the concerts of a US tour scheduled for October have sold out, it added.How Northern Irish rap trio Kneecap rose to fame by subverting the TroublesRead moreThe trio, Móglaí Bap and Mo Chara from Belfast and DJ Próvaí from Derry, have built a following in the US with a mix of Irish republican totems, punk spirit and afilmthat stormedlast year’s Utah film festival.During their set last weekend atCoachella, the California desert music festival, Mo Chara said Britain had persecuted Irish people but not bombed them from the skies. “The Palestinians have nowhere to go.”The performers led the audience in chants of “free, free Palestine” and screened pro-Palestinian messages on to screens. “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,” said one. “It is being enabled by the US government who arm and fundIsraeldespite their war crimes,” said another. The last used an expletive against Israel.Osbourne, a judge on the TV show America’s Got Talent, said the festival had “compromised its moral and spiritual integrity” by allowing Kneecap and Green Day to denounce Israel over the 18-month war.“Music’s primary purpose is to unite people. It should not be a venue for promoting terrorist organisations or spreading hate”, she said, singling out Kneecap’s “aggressive” political statements.“This band openly support terrorist organisations. This behaviour raises concerns about the appropriateness of their participation in such a festival and further shows they are booked to play in the USA.”Fox News commentators compared the band’s comments to Nazi Germany, with one saying the band should be removed from “authority positions” and that the “values of education” should be re-instilled.Kneecap posted a clip of the segment and said the commentator’s admission that she had not previously heard of the band was the “only part of this shite that made any sense”.The group said they had planned to denounce “US-backed genocide in Gaza” at an earlier performance in Coachella, on 11 April, but that the comments did not appear on the screen. The band also complained that the festival’s livestream did not carry a chant celebrating the death of Margaret Thatcher.Explore more on these topicsGazaSharon OsbourneRapIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

We have two nuclear-armed neighbours staring at each other,” said the US foreign policy author and South Asia expert Michael Kugelman. “All bets could be off.”Among its first retaliatory moves, India announced the expulsion of the Pakistan high commission’s defence, navy and air advisers; the closure of a critical border trading point; and – for the first time – the suspension of the crucial Indus waters treaty.The treaty governs the shared waters of one of the world’s biggest river systems that affects millions of lives in both countries, and India has never previously put the deal “in abeyance” – even in times of open conflict between the two neighbours.But if the terrorists hoped the assault would win support from Kashmiris or revive separatist sentiment, they miscalculated: more than a dozen Kashmiri groups staged a complete shutdown of stores and businesses to mourn the victims, while local people held protest marches chanting: “Tourists are our lives.”“Kashmiris are genuinely appalled,” said Siddiq Wahid, a professor in the department of international relations at Shiv Nadar University.Militant violence has plagued Kashmir, claimed by both Hindu-majority India and Islamic Pakistan, since an anti-Indian insurgency began in 1989.Thousands have been killed, although violence has tapered off in recent years.In a controversial move in 2019, Narendra Modi’s government revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s semi-autonomous constitutional status, splitting the state into two federally governed territories. The government, known for its embrace of a Hindu-first political agenda, also allowed non-local land ownership to further integrate Kashmir with the rest of India.The security clampdown reduced militant activity and tourism surged – a record 3.5 million people visited the Kashmir valley in 2024. Modi has framed Kashmir’s “normalisation” as a political triumph, saying firm action resolved the separatist issue and made the snow-capped, lush region “open for business”, although there is some local resentment at the heavy militarisation.“Unfortunately, this attack punctures the government’s narrative that things are ‘normal’,” said another Indian security analyst who also requested anonymity.Modi’s swift return from an official visit to Saudi Arabia signals the government’s determination to respond. Pressure is mounting for a strong response to the daylight attack in a heavily militarised zone.Delhi may opt for cross-border strikes, as it did after the 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing that killed 40 Indian paramilitary troops, analysts said.But this time, the victims were not soldiers or security personnel, making the situation even more politically charged.“India cannot twiddle its thumbs. Once the escalatory ladder is revved up, it can go out of hand,” said the security analyst. “You cannot read Modi, you can’t predict the man. He is very muscular,” he added.What heightens the political dynamics of the Kashmir attack is the timing – during a high-level US visit. The US vice- president, JD Vance, on his first official trip to India, emphasised strengthening defence ties and praised India as a strategic partner.In 2002, India and Pakistan came very close to full-scale war aftera terrorist attack on the Indian parliamentin December 2001 that New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based militant groups. The US played a key diplomatic role in de-escalating the crisis.“The messaging we are seeing from senior officials points to the US being fully behind India – and that it would not stand in the way of how India will respond,” Kugelman said.Explore more on these topicsKashmirIndiaSouth and central AsiaPakistananalysisShareReuse this content"

Pakistan has denied involvement in the attack and said its prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, would chair a national security committee meeting on Thursday to respond.View image in fullscreenA candlelit vigil was held on Wednesday in Srinagar to condemn the attack.Photograph: Adnan Abidi/ReutersIndian security forces fanned out across the Himalayan region of Kashmir on Wednesday as the army and police launched a massive manhunt for the perpetrators of the attack on Tuesday that killed at least 26 tourists, all men.Amid rapidly rising tensions in the region, which has been riven by militant violence since the start of an anti-Indian insurgency in 1989, survivors said the militants had asked men they had rounded up to recite Islamic verses before executing those who couldn’t.Asavari Jagdale, from India’s western state of Maharashtra, who lost her father and uncle in the attack, told local media that she and her family hid inside a nearby tent along with other tourists when the shooting started.When the militants reached their tent, Asavari said, they asked her father, Santosh Jagdale, to come out and recite an Islamic verse. “When he failed to do so, they pumped three bullets into him, one on the head, one behind the ear and another in the back,” she said. “My uncle was next to me. The terrorists fired four to five bullets into him.”Debasish Bhattacharyya, a Hindu who teaches at Assam University and who grew up in a Muslim neighbourhood in the state, told Reuters he had been spared because he was familiar with Islamic verses.The militants ordered him and those nearby on to their knees and when the others started chanting the verses, he followed along.“I knew the words and at that moment it was probably the only way to save our lives. Those who failed were killed,” he said, adding that they fled when the gunmen left, and trekked through a forest for two hours.A little-known militant group, the Kashmir Resistance, claimed responsibility for the attack. Posting on social media, it expressed discontent that more than 85,000 “outsiders” had been settled in the region, spurring a “demographic change”.The attack, reportedly involving four gunmen, took place in a meadow in the Pahalgam area of the scenic Himalayan federal territory. The dead were 25 Indians and one Nepalese national. It was the worst attack on civilians in India since the 2008 Mumbai shootings.View image in fullscreenSecurity personnel inspect the site in the aftermath of the attack in Pahalgam.Photograph: Basit Zargar/Zuma Press/Rex/ShutterstockThe prime minister, Narendra Modi, cut short a two-day visit to Saudi Arabia and returned to Delhi on Wednesday morning. He held a meeting with his national security adviser, the foreign minister and other senior officials at the airport, and a special security cabinet meeting was called for later on Wednesday.The incident is being viewed as a major escalation in the regional conflict, in which attacks targeting tourists have been rare. The last deadly attack took place in June 2024 when at least nine people were killed and 33 injured after militants caused a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims to plunge into a deep gorge.The Kashmir Resistance claimed those attacked on Tuesday “were not ordinary tourists; instead, they were linked to and affiliated with Indian security agencies”.The attack prompted an immediate exodus of tourists from the region, with airlines operating extra flights from Srinagar, the summer capital of the territory. Local television showed tourists carrying their bags to taxis and filing out of a hotel in Srinagar.“How can we continue our trip in such a situation?” Sameer Bhardwaj, a tourist from Delhi, said to the news agency ANI. “We need to prioritise our safety. We can only travel if our minds are relaxed but everyone is tense here. So we cannot continue to travel.”Gulzar Ahmad, a taxi driver in Pahalgam, said: “This attack will impact our work but we are more concerned about the loss of lives. No matter what we do in the future, our tourism industry has been stained by this attack. The perpetrators must receive exemplary punishment so that no one dares to commit such an act again.”The attack occurred during a four-day visit to India by the US vice-president, JD Vance, who called it a “devastating terrorist attack”.Omar Abdullah, the region’s top elected official, posted on social media: “It’s heartbreaking to see the exodus of our guests from the [Kashmir] valley after yesterday’s tragic terror attack in Pahalgam. But at the same time, we totally understand why people would want to leave.”View image in fullscreenThe market street in Pahalgam was empty on Wednesday morning, a day after the attack.Photograph: Basit Zargar/Zuma Press/Rex/ShutterstockThere has been an increase in the number of targeted killings of Hindus, including migrant workers from other Indian states, in the disputed Himalayan region since Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party government unilaterally revoked Kashmir’s limited autonomy in 2019 by imposing a communication blockade and jailing activists and political leaders.It split the state into two federally administered territories – Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh – and allowed local authorities to issue domicile certificates to outsiders, enabling them to apply for jobs and buy land. Since then, civil liberties and media freedom in the region have been severely curtailed.Pakistan’s foreign office spokesperson, Shafqat Khan, issued a statement saying Pakistan was “concerned about the loss of tourists’ lives in the attack”, and extended condolences to the victims.Explore more on these topicsIndiaPakistanKashmirSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

That leaves some investors reconsidering their US plans for fear of losing money.Last week the Trump administrationordered a haltto work on a new windfarm off the coast near New York owned by the Norwegian company Equinor. “That kind of thing really worries investors,” said one insider. “Nobody knows what will happen next.”On Thursday afternoon, Keir Starmer will address theenergy security summit, which is being held in partnership with the International Energy Agency, He will vow to double down on the UK’s commitments to a low-carbon economy despite attacks on net zero from the Conservatives and Reform UK.Starmer said before the summit’s start: “Let my message to the world go out: come and build the clean energy future in Britain.”Ajai Ahluwalia, the head of supply chain at RenewableUK, a trade association, said: “US companies are already interested in investing in the UK’s rapidly expanding clean energy sector, for example in helping to develop ports for the offshore wind industry.“The global uncertainty currently being caused by President Trump’s ever-changing policies on tariffs, and his opposition to clean energy, mean that the UK has an even greater opportunity than before to provide a stable, attractive market for international investors in renewables.”Labour has pledged £8.3bn to Great British Energy, a nationally owned company that willco-invest in clean energy projectswith the private sector, over this parliament, though this has been called into question as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, takes an axe to spending.The US will send a senior official to the summit, which will take place at Lancaster House in London on Thursday and Friday, but China will skip the event.China’s president, Xi Jinping,attended a small UN online climate meetingon Wednesday with heads of state and the UN secretary general, at which he vowed to press ahead with clean energy despite “some major country’s pursuit of unilateralism and protectionism”.While the renewable energy industry welcomed the government’s measures, wildlife campaigners raised concerns over changes to the planning system designed to streamline new energy and other developments.The government tabled an amendment to its planning and infrastructure bill on Wednesday that would mean less consultation at the pre-application stage for “nationally significant infrastructure projects”.Matt Browne, the head of public affairs at the Wildlife Trusts, said the move was a “misstep” and called for reconsideration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Mike Childs, the head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, said much more effort was needed to insulate draughty homes, as well as to build renewables.“Our country has been held hostage by the yo-yo-ing price of dirty fossil fuels for far too long,” he said.Ed Miliband bows to pressure with ban on solar panels linked to Chinese slaveryRead moreLabour will face opposition to its clean energy plans, and its commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, in the local elections next week.Reform and the Conservatives arelikely to blame net zero for high pricesand the crisis in the steel industry, though experts have said these arethe result of an overreliance on fossil fuels.Rob Gross, a director at the UK energy research centre, said the UK’s electricity costs would begin to fall once it had severed its reliance on gas power plants, which generate the most expensive electricity on the grid and set the overall market price.“If you look across Europe, and you look at the electricity wholesale price, those with the lowest wholesale market prices are those which are least reliant on gas for generation. Those that have the highest prices are those most exposed to gas generation,” he said.“Our reliance on gas for electricity generation has been decreasing steadily as the share of renewables increases, but it will take several more years before we have severed the link to price formation.”Explore more on these topicsRenewable energyEnergy industryGreen politicsEd MilibandLabourEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

Change is good, but patient safety must come first | Jeremy HuntRead moreStaff end up fatigued because of long shifts, heavy workloads and a lack of breaks and rest facilities at work, the HSSIB added. But personal issues such as caring responsibilities, menopause, pregnancy and religious practices can also contribute.“Being a doctor typically involves high intensity, time-pressured working patterns. This can lead to sleep deprivation and fatigue, affecting doctors’ health, wellbeing and performance, their safety and that of their patients,” said Dr Latifa Patel, the chair of the British Medical Association’s representative body and workforce lead.“The findings of this report are concerning, but will come as no surprise to the doctors who have faced 13-hour back-to-back shifts with no respite.”NHS trusts and health boards need to do more to improve rest facilities, doctors’ rotas and common room areas, to stop medics getting so exhausted, she added.“This report lays bare the daily reality for nursing staff. They are overstretched, understaffed and regularly work beyond their hours caring for too many patients,” said Patricia Marquis, the Royal College of Nursing’s executive director for England.“This drives dangerous levels of fatigue which not only harms patients but also follows staff home, with sometimes devastating consequences.“Nursing fatigue is deadly and in health and care services should be treated as a public safety emergency.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This government inherited a broken NHS with an overworked, demoralised workforce and this report highlights the profound consequences this can have for patients and staff alike.”They highlighted the pay rises the government gave NHS staff in England and a recent support package intended to improve their working lives, including easier access to flexible working.Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthRoyal College of NursingnewsShareReuse this content"

A record number of female conductors will be at the podium – 15 – and the Last Night will be the first to feature an all-female lineup of conductor and soloists:Elim Chanwill conduct, with trumpeter Alison Balsom and sopranoLouise Alder, plus the evening will feature two world premieres, by 34-year-old French composer Camille Pepin, andRachel Portman, who was the first woman to win an Oscar for best original score, both making their Proms debuts.Also making herPromsdebut will be Claudia Winkleman, who, fully cloaked, will present a Traitors Prom featuring a mix of symphonic pop and classical music exploring timeless themes of intrigue, treachery and betrayal. Suzy Klein, the head of arts and classical music TV at the BBC, promised that the concert would evoke all the drama of the Highland castle where the hugely popular reality TV show takes place. There won’t be gameplay or interaction, she added, but “it is going to be shaped and curated as a dramatic evening. There’s so much music featured in the series that we wanted to take some of that and say to people, ‘Welcome to the world of classical music, you’re already listening to it and loving it without realising it!’” Winkleman will be joined by the BBC Scottish Symphony and the BBC Singers, with other guests and the full programme to be announced. Will season three fan favourite Linda Rands, a retired opera singer, be taking part? Potentially, said Klein.View image in fullscreenCloak and drama … Claudia Winkleman in BBC’s The Traitors.Photograph: Cody Burridge/PASuccessfulBBCbrands will also be giving shape to the children’s concerts: a CBeebies bedtime story prom and the return of the Wildlife Jamboree Prom in Gateshead’s Glasshouse Centre for Music. The Ulster Orchestra will perform a concert celebrating the centenary of the Shipping Forecast with music inspired by the sea and a new work composed and performed by poet laureate Simon Armitage.The Proms 2025 season offers plenty both to cherish and challengeRead moreAnd, although not quite a Proms first (1983’s seasonfeatured an all-night prom of Indian classical music), the first overnight prom of the 21st century will run from 11pm to 7am and, curated and conducted by organist Anna Lapwood, will also feature Japanese pianist and YouTube sensation Hayato Sumino alongside the much loved Norwegian ensemble Barokksolistene. “We want it to be very engaging, there will be a real breadth of repertoire,” said Sam Jackson, the controller of BBC Radio 3 and the Proms. “There’s something very special about classical music at night time. The intimacy of certain repertoire really lends itself to that kind of immersive listening,” he continued. “But the intention is not simply to put people to sleep for eight hours, although audiences can of course come and respond to the music in whatever way you want!” Blankets and pillows will however not be allowed into the Royal Albert Hall, the venue confirmed, nor will the seating be reconfigured.View image in fullscreenNight owl … organist Anna Lapwood at the Royal Albert Hall.Photograph: Sisi Burn/ BBC“The only time Lapwood gets to practice the RAH organ is usually between midnight and four in the morning, because it’s the only time when somebody isn’t getting in or getting out for another gig. She absolutely knows how to unleash energy at that time of the day!” added Klein.Among some notable anniversaries honoured this year, there will be a focus on the music of Shostakovich, who died in 1975, and a complete performance – only the second ever at the Proms – of his opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, with the chorus of the English National Opera. Proms regulars Aurora Orchestra will perform his fifth symphony by heart following a dramatic exploration of its troubled origins and meaning, andChineke!will celebrate their 10th birthday with guest conductor Simon Rattle leading the Black and ethnically diverse orchestra through a programme that includes Shostakovich’s 10th symphony.View image in fullscreenBirthday bows … Chineke! will return to the Proms.Photograph: Mark AllanRavel – born 150 years ago – features on the opening weekend: his Piano Concerto for the Left Hand will be played by Nicholas McCarthy, which will be the first time the concerto has been played at the Proms by a one-handed pianist since it was performed by the man it was composed for, Paul Wittgenstein, in 1932.Boulez, whose centenary is celebrated this year, features in three proms including a late-night one performed by the Ensemble intercontemporain (the group he founded), which places his modernist music alongside Luciano Berio’s, whose centenary it also is.Other international orchestras include the Royal Concertgebouw with their chief conductor designate Klaus Mäkelä, the Vienna Philharmonic, and the Budapest Festival Orchestra. Twenty-five proms will be televised – more than ever before, said Klein. “We had record breaking numbers last year, over 5m streams on BBC Sounds, and across TV and iPlayer we reached nearly 13 million people.”Proms star Elim Chan: ‘Being who you are is powerful. Not all orchestras can take it’Read moreTheRoyal Albert Hallwas full to 96% capacity for evening Proms in 2024, said Jackson. He confirmed that the Last Night will end in its now traditional style, with Rule, Britannia among the closing pieces. “The Last Night always evokes strong opinions and discussion. There are some people for whom it’s a really important tradition, and there are some who say it’s now part of how they would like to celebrate in the summer,” he said. “Our job is to cater for as broad an audience as possible, but also to ask, how can we continue to develop this festival? What can we do differently? How can we introduce new music? And how can we over the course of 86 concerts make sure that there’s a real breadth of repertoire of artists? And then there’s something for everybody.”The Promswill run from 18 July to 13 September.

We want to get the right deal that’s in our national interest, and those talks are ongoing,” she said.Asked about her discussions with Bessent – the first time the pair will meet face to face – Reeves said: “We’re not going to be, I don’t think, discussing the intricacies of autos and food standards.”Instead, she said, they would be talking about “how we can build on the trade relationship that we have”.Trump’s an unstable bully – but it’s hard to defend the economic orthodoxies he is attacking | Larry ElliottRead moreThe UK has already offered concessions to the US in the hopes of getting tariffs cut, including reducing the digital services tax on US tech companies. Reeves travelled to Washington for the spring meetings of the IMF with hopes of securing a carve-out from the 25% levies on cars, aluminium and steel.Car industry bosses have warnedjob losses are weeks awayin Britain’s premium automotive sector unless the UK can secure a deal to shield the likes of Jaguar Land Rover, Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Aston Martin and McLaren from tariffs.It is unclear whether an exemption from the 10% base tariff Donald Trump has levied on all imports is on the table.Hopes of an early agreement were undermined on Wednesday by a leaked document setting out new US demands.The text, which first appeared in the Wall Street Journal, dismayed UK officials by including calls for concessions in a series of new areas, including a demand for the government to drop its standards on agricultural products including beef.Allowing US hormone-treated beef into the UK has long been a demand from Washington, which successive British governments of all stripes have rejected. Reducing agricultural standards is a particular red line for Labour because it would kill hopes of a veterinary agreement with the EU.Reeves flatly rejected the idea that food or other product standards would be up for grabs. “We’re not going to be relaxing our food standards. We are clear with the US about that and they respect that and understand that,” she said.She added: “These are all discussions around tariffs and trade barriers but we are not going to be changing our standards based on asks from foreign governments. Decisions around food standards, around digital services, around auto standards, are decisions for the UK government to make and we will continue to do that.”She did not rule out discussing another request in the leaked US negotiating document, that the UK should reduce import tariffs on US cars from 10% to 2.5% to secure a deal.“I’m not going to give a commentary on the numbers but I have always been clear that I believe in free trade,” Reeves said.Later on Wednesday, appearing at a live event for global investors, Reeves appeared to hint that the UK was indeed prepared to cut import taxes on some US goods to placate Washington.“There are still tariffs, both ways, even before ‘liberation day’, between our two economies. I would like to see those tariffs – and non-tariff barriers – reduce,” she said.Reeves’s cautious tone contrasted withrecent mood musicfrom the government suggesting much of the deal had all but been agreed.Asked about the urgent plight of UK carmakers, Reeves said: “We’re under no illusions about the scale of the challenges that tariffs pose to UK car manufacturers and beyond, which is why we are working to secure a deal.“But I think everybody agrees that the most important thing is that we get the right deal for Britain in our national interest, rather than rush into a poor deal.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the Guardian revealed this week that the agreement does not cover pharmaceutical products. Officials say it will therefore need to be renegotiated, should the president follow through on his promise to target that industry as well.“Our assumptions have had to be reset a few times during this process,” said one Whitehall source, “and they probably will be again.”The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, speaking in Washington, said he and his colleagues were concerned about the risks to economic growth in the UK from the chaos in the global trading system.“We do have to take very seriously the risk to growth,” he said. “Because the UK is such an open economy, so when we do our modelling … we also have to take into consideration the effect on growth in the rest of the world.”Earlier on Wednesday, official figures underlined the perilous fiscal position the government faces. The Office for National Statistics said borrowing in the financial year ending in March was £151.9bn,more than £20bn higherthan in the previous financial year.Asked about the downbeat figures, which prompted some analysts to reiterate warnings that she may have to raise taxes in her autumn budget, Reeves stressed that her fiscal rules were non-negotiable.“The numbers today just reinforce to me the importance that this government is placing on controlling the public finances,” she said.The chancellor announced welfare cuts and reductions to future Whitehall budgets in herspring statement last monthin order to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules.As Reeves prepared to meet her counterparts from a string of other large economies in Washington, shares on global stock markets were soaring after Trump appeared to indicate a softening of his stance on Chinese tariffs.The US presidentsaid he expectedthat tariffs on China would “come down substantially, but it won’t be zero”. Beijing has been facing 145% tariffs and has hit back with 125% levies of its own.The IMF’s spring meetings in Washington opened on Tuesday with astark warningabout the economic impact of the trade war, which the fund said would prompt a “major negative shock”.Later on Wednesday, Trump said that tariffs on Canadian-made cars “could go up” past 25%, adding: “I really don’t want cars from Canada.”Explore more on these topicsTrade policyEconomic policyRachel ReevesTrump tariffsTariffsEconomicsInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Governor Ron DeSantis and some Republican lawmakers have argued that if an 18-year-old Floridian can serve in the military, they should be able to purchase a firearm.In the wake of the FSU shooting, student activists – including some who were in the vicinity of both mass shootings – were walking the halls of the capitol building in Tallahassee, lobbying lawmakers to support gun control policies in the final two weeks of the legislative session, which is scheduled to end on 2 May.“No one should ever have to experience a school shooting – let alone two – just to have to beg lawmakers to care enough to stop the next one,” said Stephanie Horowitz, who was a freshman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in 2018 and is now a graduate student at FSU.Two people were killed and six others injured in the shooting last Thursday that terrorized FSU’s campus, about a mile from the state capitol. Logan Rubenstein, a 21-year-old junior at FSU, says it could have been much worse, if a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers had not taken action after Parkland.Rubenstein believes gun restrictions passed by theFloridalegislature in 2018 helped prevent the FSU shooter from carrying out more carnage – like what happened at Rubenstein’s high school in Parkland seven years ago.Rubenstein was in eighth grade at nearby Coral Springs middle school when a 19-year-old gunman armed with an AR-15-style rifle killed 17 people and injured 17 others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.Investigators say the suspect in the FSU shooting, a 20-year-old student at the university named Phoenix Ikner, armed himself with a handgun that was the former service weapon of his stepmother, a local sheriff’s deputy. Under the state’s current laws, he could not legally buy a rifle from a federally licensed dealer.“The law that we passed after Parkland worked,” Rubenstein said. “Because if he was able to buy an AR-15, body armor and a bump stock and unlimited ammo, how much more deadly would it have been?”About three weeks before the FSU shooting, the Florida house passed a bill that would lower the state’s minimum age to buy a gun to 18. The proposal had stalled in the state senate even before the FSU shooting, and it appears even less likely to advance now.Still, speaking at a rally with student activists on the steps of Florida’s historic old capitol on Wednesday, the Democratic state senator Tina Polsky said she was not letting up. Polsky, whose district includes Parkland, is among the Democrats who have sponsored gun control bills this session that never got a hearing in the capitol, where Republicans hold a supermajority in both chambers.“I am begging them to do something like we did after the horrific Parkland shooting,” Polsky said. “I don’t know if it’s going to happen. But we will continue to fight.”Explore more on these topicsUS gun controlFloridaParkland, Florida school shootingUS politicsRon DeSantisnewsShareReuse this content"

The president told reporters in Washington on Tuesday heplanned to be “very nice” to Chinain trade talks and that tariffs could drop in both countries if they could reach a deal, adding: “It will come down substantially, but it won’t be zero.”Overnight in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei rose by nearly 2%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 2.4% and the South Korean Kospi gained 1.6%.Trump news at a glance: president will be ‘very nice’ to China; Musk to step back from DogeRead moreThe rally spread to Europe in early trading on Wednesday, with the UK’s FTSE 100 index up 1.6%, while the Italian FTSE MIB rose by 1.1%. Germany’s Dax gained 2.6% and France’s Cac 2.1%.Meanwhile, US stocks opened on a high Wednesday morning, with the Dow rallying over 800 points, and the Nasdaq Composite up over 3%. The rally stalled in the afternoon but all the major stock markets managed to end the day higher.On Wednesday, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, also took a softer, optimistic tone onChinain remarks delivered at the Institute of International Finance in Washington DC, saying that China “knows it needs to change”.“If China is serious on less dependence on export-led manufacturing growth and rebalancing toward a domestic economy … let’s rebalance together,” Bessent said. “This is an incredible opportunity.”Bessenttoldinvestors in a private meeting on Tuesday that he expects a “de-escalation” of the trade war between China and the US in the “very near future”.“‘America First’ does not mean America alone. To the contrary, it is a call for deeper collaboration and mutual respect among trade partners,” Bessent said on Wednesday.Investor confidence also grew after Trump told reporters he would not fire Powell, the chair of the US Federal Reserve, reversing the previous day’s losses triggered by the presidentcalling the central bank boss a “major loser”.The president has criticised the Fed chair repeatedly for refusing to cut interest rates and last week hinted that hebelieved he could dismiss Powellbefore his term as the head of the central bank comes to an end in May next year.Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, last week that Powell’s termination “could not come fast enough”, after the Fed chair raised concerns about the impact of trade tariffs on the American economy.However, the suggestion from the White House that the US central bank will remain independent helped stocks to rise on Wednesday, as well as the prospect of lower tariffs on Chinese imports to the US.The US dollar, which hit a three-year low on Tuesday before recovering, rose by 0.25% against a basket of major currencies.Oil prices also rose on Wednesday, with Brent crude rising above $68 (£51) a barrel amid hopes that lower tariffs will be less damaging to the global economy. The rise was also led by new US sanctions targeting Iranian liquefied petroleum gas and the crude oil shipping magnate Seyed Asadoollah Emamjomeh.Meanwhile, gold, which is traditionally viewed by investors as a safe haven asset during volatile periods, retreated from thenew high of $3,500 (£2,620) an ounceit hit on Tuesday, to trade at about $3,307.Explore more on these topicsStock marketsGlobal economyTrump tariffsDonald TrumpChinaFederal ReserveTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

China imposed the levies in retaliation to the White House’s 145% rate that threatens to significantly slow down the world economy.Kelly Ortberg, Boeing’s chief executive, said he hoped “over time these tariffs can be resolved”, in a call with investors on Wednesday. He was speaking after the company announced that losses for the first quarter of 2025 had narrowed to $31m (£23.4m), compared with $355m a year earlier.He added that Boeing and Airbus, its main rival, would favour a “non-tariff environment”, in stark contrast to Trump, who believes – contrary to the overwhelming consensus of economists – that tariffs willrestore US manufacturing to global dominance.Ortberg said “many of our customers in China have indicated they are not taking delivery”. However, Boeing has already received queries from airlines outside China for some of the planes. The company is seeking to “re-market” them and, if necessary, to repaint planes with different airlines’ colours.Production has already started on 41 aircraft originally destined for China, with another nine planned for delivery this year.“It’s an unfortunate situation, but we have many customers who want near-term deliveries,” Ortberg said. The manufacturer has 5,600 planes on order as airlines around the world forecast strong growth.Overall demand for planes has not been dented by the tariffs so far, Ortberg said. That has allowed the company to continue with plans to raise production of its bestselling 737 Max to 38 each month, despite the tariffs. Boeing’s share price rose by 5.7% on Wednesday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some of these acolytes are sentimental for the days of Blockbuster and famedNew Yorkinstitutions like Kim’s Video. Others are so young that Blu-ray Discs, DVDs and VHS tapes represent novelty, not nostalgia.Either way they’re here, at a small, freshly painted storefront in Brooklyn, to buy movies that you hold in your hand, store on a shelf and watch whenever you’d like – the powerful but fickle newer gods of Netflix, Hulu and Prime be damned.The film fans who refuse to surrender to streaming: ‘One day you’ll barter bread for our DVDs’Read moreJust in time for Easter, the physical video store has risen again. This month, Night Owl Video in Williamsburg became New York City’s first new physical video store in a long time. The store’s provocative slogan is: “Death to streamers! Physical media forever!”“I’ve lamented for years that this type of place doesn’t exist,” Aaron Hamel, who co-founded Night Owl with his friend Jess Mills, said. “I used to love going to Kim’s [Video] andVideologyand all that. I’m still very nostalgic, and I think there’s value to a place where you can browse the shelves for movies.”Kim’s rental inventoryre-openedin 2022 as an attraction in Alamo Drafthouse’s lower Manhattan cinema. Some Barnes and Noble locations in New York also sell Blu-ray Discs and DVDs. To Hamel and Mills’ knowledge, however, Night Owl is the only freestanding video boutique in New York.Part of the appeal of reviving the video store, Mills said, is the community. She and Hamel met while working at the indie film label Troma.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Wenting Gu“I love seeing someone pick up a title and another customer say, ‘Hey, that’s a really good one,’” she said. “It inspires people to watch something that they might not have. These streaming platforms are feeding you an algorithm of what to watch; they’re not giving you real suggestions. But if you get 20 movie lovers in a room, that knowledge just blossoms.”That pitch may find a receptive audience in Williamsburg. Night Owl’s location on Grand Street is right next to a board games store and not far from comic book and record shops and other geek meccas.“That’s so cool!” a young woman said as she entered Night Owl on a recent Thursday afternoon. As she entered, a young man departed without buying anything, but murmured “Good to know, good to know,” to his companion.Despite its reputation as a city of cinephiles, New York has not been immune to the economic trends that have shuttered video stores across theUnited States,Britainand other countries. Streaming and video-on-demand services have steadily undermined physical media for years, and last year US sales of physical video discs fell below $1bn for the first time since 2014,accordingto industry data andreportingby Variety. Increasingly few Americans even own a dedicated DVD/Blu-ray player, though some video-game consoles play film discs.Yet physical media has had amodest renaissancein recent years. Somemovie buffshave found their way back to physical formats such as Blu-ray – the DVD’s higher-definition successor – and 4K Blu-ray, an even higher-definition format considered the “final format” of home theater.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Wenting GuPhysical media is unlikely to ever regain the heights it had in the heyday of VHS and DVD, but enthusiasts hope it may achieve the kind of surprisesecond lifethat vinyl records have since the late 2000s. In 2022, more vinyl records were sold than CDs,accordingto a music industry trade group.Hamel used to run a record label. “I feel like physical-media movies are where vinyl was maybe 15 or 20 years ago,” he said. Although the landscape is tough, new video stores – or in some cases non-profit video libraries – have opened in recent years inNew Orleans,Calgary,Baltimore, andWorcester, Massachusetts, and boutique retailers such asAtomic Movie Store,Orbit DVD,DiabolikDVDandGrindhouse Videoseem to have no shortage of online business.Five or six patrons perused Night Owl’s selection of Blu-rays, 4K Blu-rays, DVDs, VHS tapes, and Laserdiscs as several linked televisions around the store screened Ed Wood, the 1994 Tim Burton picture, from a Laserdisc player. A life-sized Halloween skeleton sat in an armchair near the door.Night Owl sells new and used movies from cinephilic Blu-ray labels such asCriterion,Radiance,Severin,Vinegar Syndrome,Kino Lorber,88 FilmsandUmbrella, as well as film-related books, posters and vinyl soundtracks. Currently, the shop only sells videos, though Hamel and Mills may offer renting in the future.Buying collectible physical films at retail prices isn’t cheap – most new Blu-rays at Night Owl cost $20 to $40 – but customers seemed willing to entertain physical media’s value proposition. Around 550 people attended Night Owl’s soft launch, Mills estimated: “It just warms my little goth heart.” She and Hamel have had to re-order stock because of brisk sales.Bailey Blake, 22, Ava Sharahy, 23, and Leah Calixto, 22, came to Night Owl from the Bronx and Washington Heights after hearing about the store on Instagram. The three were recent college graduates who had studied film at Sarah Lawrence.“I don’t have a lot of physical DVDs or anything like that,” Sharahy said. “This is gonna be my first foray into it. I don’t want to have to pay so much for so many streaming services when I could justownsomething, you know?”View image in fullscreenLeah Calixto, 22, Bailey Blake, 22, and Ava Sharahy, 23, came to Night Owl after hearing about the store on Instagram.Photograph: J Oliver ConroySharahy bought a John Waters film that included an interactive scratch-and-sniff feature. Blake bought the vinyl soundtrack to The Color of Money. Calixto was looking at Blood In Blood Out, a Chicano crime epic she loved from childhood.Part of the draw of physical media for movie fans, the three friends said, was thedifficultyof finding manybeloved or important filmson streaming.Mills echoed that argument, and added that streaming platforms have also become more and more expensive, contain intrusive ads, and aggressively promote their own original content rather than curate cinematic “gems”.Hamel jumped in. “When you’re buying digital you’re not buying the film,” he said. “You’re buying a license to watch the film, which theycan revokeat any time. But when you buy something on Blu-ray, you have it forever.”Explore more on these topicsFilmShopping tripsFilm industryNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It said app developers could not fully benefit from alternative channels, so consumers could not discover cheaper offers.The commission ordered the company to remove the restrictions within 60 days or risk further fines.Applesaid it would appeal against the fine.EU will not rip up tech rules for trade deal with Trump, senior official saysRead moreMeta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, was fined €200m over its“consent or pay model”introduced in November 2023, which was an attempt to comply with EU data privacy rules.Under this model, EU users of Facebook and Instagram had a choice between consenting to their data being used for advertising, or paying a fee for an ad-free service. The commission said this approach was not compliant with the DMA, arguing that users should be able to get a Facebook or Instagram equivalent to the personalised ad service, but based on less of their data.EU officials said they were still assessing a new version of the free, personalised ads modelMetaintroduced in November 2024. The fine relates to the noncompliance found by the commission over eight months after the DMA became legally binding in March 2024.The fines fall far short of the 10% of annual global turnover that tech companies can be ordered to pay. Meta earned $165bn (£124bn) in 2024, while Apple sold goods and services worth $391bn in its last financial year.EU officials described the 10% figure as a ceiling, rather than a parameter to set fines. In determining the fines, officials took into account the newness of the legislation and the relatively short duration of the offences.The commission also announced on Wednesday that it was closing an investigation into Apple’s user-choice obligations under the DMA after “a constructive dialogue” with the company. Apple has made it possible for EU users to uninstall its Safari web browser, Photos app and other programs and made it easier to choose another default web browser, the commission said.Teresa Ribera, the commission executive vice-president in charge of competition, said Apple and Meta had fallen short of compliance with the DMA “by implementing measures that reinforce the dependence of business users and consumers on their platforms”. The commission had “taken firm but balanced enforcement action against both companies, based on clear and predictable rules”, she said. “All companies operating in the EU must follow our laws and respect European values.”EU officials haverejected claimsfrom the Trump administration that tech regulation is being used as a weapon against successful US companies.Apple said: “Today’s announcements are yet another example of the European Commission unfairly targeting Apple in a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free.”The company said it had spent “hundreds of thousands of engineering hours” and made dozens of changes attempting to comply with the law, and accused the commission of moving the goalposts “every step of the way”.Meta is expected to appeal to the European court of justice. In astatement, Meta’s chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan, said the commission was “attempting to handicap successful American business” while allowing Chinese and European firms to operate under different standards.“This isn’t just about a fine,” he said. “The commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multibillion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service.”The Computer and Communications Industry Association, whose members include Apple and Meta, said the commission’s enforcement of the DMA was “opaque and discretionary, lacking both predictability and proportionality”.However, the European Consumer Organisation praised the decisions as good for consumers. Its director general, Agustín Reyna, said: “Apple and Meta have had ample time to comply with the Digital Markets Act but instead have delayed compliance and tried to twist the rules to their advantage.”Explore more on these topicsTechnology sectorEuropean UnionMetaAppleEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He did not name the US or Trump but made apparent reference to them while noting that China had “built the world’s largest and fastest-growing renewable energy systems as well as the largest and most complete new energy industrial chain”.Xi said: “Although some major country’s persistent pursuit of unilateralism and protectionism has seriously impacted international rules and the international order … as long as we enhance confidence, solidarity and cooperation, we will overcome the headwinds and steadily move forward global climate governance and all progressive endeavours of the world.”After the meeting, Guterres said no government or fossil fuel interest could hold the world back from pursuing a clean energy future.“The world is moving forward, full speed ahead,” Guterres said. “No group or government can stop the clean energy revolution.

Baseballhas Shohei Ohtani. For professional football, enter Travis Hunter.There are good prospects, there are great prospects, and then there is whatever Hunter is. The Heisman Trophy winner and soon-to-be top-five draft pick is looking to do the improbable: play both sides of the ball in theNFL, offense and defense, full-time.Some college prospects major in one position and minor in another. Some switch positions once they arrive in the league. Hunter is the first elite college player this century to line up on both sides of the field for entire games, dominating at two positions. In his final season at Colorado, Hunter played 713 snaps on offense and 748 on defense on his way to winning the Heisman Trophy, switching between cornerback and receiver.Lotteries, stashed teens and bidding wars: reimagining the NFL draftRead moreThe draft has never seen anything like it, a player whocouldbe the keystone on offense and defense.With Hunter, the talent is overwhelming and obvious. As both a corner and receiver, he moves differently. Hethinksdifferently. Somehow, the league has a draft class where the same person is the best cornerbackandreceiver.Now, NFL teams have to figure out what in the hell they are going to do with the supernova talent. Do they limit him one role or allow him to try to play both? The downside of not letting him try: “It’s never playing football again,” Hunter told Garrett Podell of CBS Sports. “Because I’ve been doing it my whole life, and I love being on the football field. I feel like I could dominate on each side of the ball, so I really enjoy doing it.”That’s an idle threat – Hunter won’t walk away from millions of dollars because a team won’t let him play corner. But it’s indicative of his mindset. He wants to be the crux of a team’s offense and defense.Plenty of people believe that is impossible. “There’s absolutely no way he can do them both full-time,” one executive toldGo Long. “They’ll just wear him out. Each team will look at him differently as far as what they want to do with him.”Hunter’s insistence on playing both ways will be a paradigm shift for a sport built on specialists. What meeting room will he sit in? Who will be his position coach? What will hiscontract look like? Will splitting time cap his talent at one position? How do you manage his reps? If he plays both ways, Hunter will be taking on twice the injury risk, perhaps even more so with the accumulated fatigue.“What he would attempt to do has not really been done in our league,” Andrew Berry, the general of the Cleveland Browns, who hold the No 2 overall pick in the draft, said last week. “But, we wouldn’t necessarily put a cap or a governor in terms of what he could do. We would want to be smart in terms of how we started him out.”For his part, Hunter has cited NFL games being slower than in college, with roughly 35 seconds between snaps, and the minimal contact he will absorb at each position as the reasons why he can continue to manage the workload.It’s a small crop of players who have ever had the technical, intellectual or athletic qualities to consider lining up two ways. Deion Sanders, the Hall of Fame cornerback who coached Hunter in college, was a situational wide receiver during the prime of his career (as well as playing Major League Baseball). Charles Woodson, another Hall of Fame defensive back, returned kicks and caught a few passes at Michigan. In the NFL, he was an all-world defensive back who caught only two passes on offense. Champ Bailey, who is commonly compared to Hunter, caught 59 catches in college and teased that he would play both ways in the pros. He finished with just four receptions during his 15-year, Hall of Fame career as a lockdown corner.On the offensive side, the history is more limited. New England wide receiver Julian Edelman was used as an emergency cornerback, but only in rare circumstances. Small, goalline packages are where players typically dabble with switching sides of the ball, usually to add some extra beef on to the field. But the grind of an NFL season makes it tough for teams to chuck a player on the field for an entire game. “You’re always worried about the length of the season in the NFL,” Giants GM Joe Schoen said at this year’s Combine. “If he gets hurt doing something that he’s not doing full-time, you’re going to kick yourself.”Teams have discussed a set package of plays for Hunter. But building an individual collection of plays for a single player is tricky. It steals away precious practice reps, and can turn an offense (or defense) predictable, a cardinal sin for most coaches.Hey, here comes the Travis package.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionNFL players are masters of their chosen craft. Covering professional receivers is a full-time gig. The top cornerbacks pile hours into film study, allowing them to leap routes and concepts before they develop. Professional offenses are built on rhythm, timing and the chemistry between the quarterback and his receivers. It is the accumulation of thousands of practice hours. With the current Collective Bargaining Agreement, there are strict parameters on how often and for how long teams can practice. It will be tough for Hunter toget enough time to perfect his craft on one side of the ball while cameoing elsewhere.There is a question of value, too. If Hunter can only play one role full-time while having a limited package of plays elsewhere, in which spot will a team extract the most juice?As a cornerback, Hunter has rare vision. There is an artistry that allows him to undercut routes to make plays. And he is always –always– around the ball. And when he’s not, it’s because the opposing offense has done whatever it can to remove him from the picture, in case he peels off his intended assignment to hunt for the ball. He is not the kind of corner who will lock down a side of the field for an entire game; he is out there to force turnovers. With that profile, it is difficult for a team to ensure that the most gifted player on their squad will touch the ball. On offense, there is more certainty: teams can manufacture touches or design plays with the sole purpose of getting the ball in Hunter’s hands.Yet as a receiver, Hunter is a little sloppier, possibly due to the sheer exhaustion of totting up 100-plus snaps a game. He is less refined on offense than on defense, but just as dynamic. There is some Justin Jefferson to Hunter’s receiver game, skipping across the grass like he’s moving in fast-forward. He bobs and weaves through coverage, subtly shifting gears to force defenders off balance before driving to his destination. And he grabs everything, happy to leap up for highlight reel grabs or absorb heavy shots in the middle of the field to keep the chains moving.The calculation runs something like this: As a receiver, he may be one of the 10 best in the league; as a corner, he may be the most impactful. But for a team to sacrifice the offensive production for the defensive payoff, Hunter would probably have to post double-digit turnovers a season, and turnovers are a volatile figure that no player can guarantee.What Hunterwantsis different from how a team can maximize him. If Hunter hits his ceiling as a receiver, he will be among Jefferson, Ja’Marr Chase and AJ Brown at the top of the charts. Yet even if he is, say, the eighth-best wideout in football, that ismore valuable than a top-tier cornerbackin the offense-first, pass-happy era. As a cornerback, Hunter’s ceiling is different. There, we are talking not just about on-field production, but changing the fabric of the position. Now we are in gold jacket territory. You’re talking about a generation growing up wanting to play a position because they want tobe like Travis,a dynamic, game-tilting cornerback who fuels paranoia in the league’s quarterback. One may be more valuable to Hunter; the other may be more valuable to a team.“A lot of teams don’t know what to do with me,” Hunter toldNBC Sports. “They’ve seen me do it at the college level. Nobody actually thought I’d be able to do it at the college level, so everybody is amazed that I’ve done it for this long and I’ve done it at a high level.”Where Hunter plays will most likely come down to one of two teams: the Browns or the Giants, who pick second and third in the draft. Will they let him be the football answer to Ohtani? It would feel like a crime against football not to let him try.Explore more on these topicsNFLCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsShohei OhtanifeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a match that could have represented a microcosm of their domestic season, Arsenal appeared to be heading towards a narrow victory against a doggedCrystal Palaceside. Eberechi Eze’s brilliant volley had cancelled out Jakub Kiwior’s early opener but Leandro Trossard then restored the Gunners’ lead.However, an uncharacteristic mistake from William Saliba allowed Jean-Philippe Mateta, on as a substitute, to equalise with seven minutes to play and secure a deserved point for Palace, who will now head to Wembley for their FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa on Saturday brimming with confidence.Relegated players who will be targets for Premier League clubs this summerRead moreLiverpool’s players had gathered to watch events unfold in north London knowing that a defeat would seal a record-equalling 20th league title with five games still to play. As it is, they have a 12-point lead and a vastly superior goal difference, with a draw against Tottenham on Sunday all that is required to make it official.At leastArsenal– who look destined to end up as runners-up for a third year in row, having drawn nine games this season from winning positions and 13 in total – still have the consolation of their Champions League semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain next week.“The game wasn’t grabbed like we normally do,” said Mikel Arteta, who revealed that Ben White and Mikel Merino are doubts to face PSG after being left out due to unspecified injuries. “We have to wait and see but they weren’t able to be in the squad tonight.”Arteta insisted beforehand that, as well as delaying Liverpool’s title procession, Arsenal had an incentive to win this game to maintain the momentum of theirvictories against Real Madrid. Reports emerged just before kick-off that Arsenal have opened talks with Thomas Partey over extending his contract which expires in the summer having previously seemed set to depart – surely a reward for some consistently commanding performances in central midfield this season, even if his suspension from the first leg against PSG will give Arteta a headache.Palace have previously played the role of party poopers when they famously came back from 3-0 down against Liverpool in 2014 to virtually assure Manchester City of the title. With one eye on their own big day out at Wembley, there didn’t seem to be much chance of history repeating itself this time – especially when Kiwior rose unmarked to head in Martin Ødegaard’s free-kick in the third minute.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze hits his shot into the ground to beat David Raya and make it 1-1.Photograph: Simon Dael/ShutterstockOliver Glasner, who complained that Palace had been put at a disadvantage after getting 24 hours less than Villa to prepare for their meeting on Saturday, was delighted with how his much-changed team refused to give up. “The response of the players was unbelievable,” the Palace manager said. “I’m very proud of them.”Arsenal’s unbeaten record in all competitions stretches back to the end of February, although four draws in their previous sevenPremier Leaguematches had undermined any chance of catching Liverpool.Declan Rice was inches away from doubling his side’s lead when he flashed a shot just wide but Palace had been more than holding their own when they summoned up a spectacular equaliser. Arsenal’s defenders didn’t seem to have noticed Eze on the edge of the box for a corner and he was picked out perfectly by Adam Wharton to volley the ball in off the post.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Suddenly Arsenal’s supporters were venting their frustrations. Yet after scoring twice at the weekend,Trossard continued his rich vein of formwhen he squeezed a shot past Dean Henderson via a deflection off Jefferson Lerma on the stroke of half-time to restore their lead.The Palace goalkeeper needed treatment at the start of the second half when Nketiah clattered into him as he attempted to head away a free-kick but Henderson was able to continue. The introduction of Bukayo Saka off the bench on the hour drew almost as big a roar as either of the home side’s goals as Arsenal attempted to put the game to bed.Justin Devenny spurned a massive opportunity for Palace to draw level again when he failed to make proper contact with an Ismaïla Sarr cross before David Raya denied Marc Guéhi from the resulting corner. Somehow Sarr could not get enough power behind his header after Daniel Muñoz headed another corner across the face of goal as Palace piled on the pressure.Gabriel Martinelli thought he had settled matters when he touched in Jurriën Timber’s cross but VAR eventually ruled that the ball had already gone out of play. A stunning save from Henderson kept out Saka’s volley from close range and it was to prove vital as Mateta pounced on the ponderous Saliba’s error and chipped the stranded Raya to send the travelling supporters behind his goal home ecstatic.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Which of their players deserve to stay up?Ben McAleerWed 23 Apr 2025 07.41 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 17.48 EDTShareLeicester were relegated at the weekendand will joinSouthampton in the Championshipnext season. Ipswich are 15 points from safety with five games to play, so it’s only a matter of time before they too are consigned to the second tier. The three sides have been extremely disappointing this season, picking up just 10 wins between them, but they have some talented players who will be targets for Premier League sides in the summer transfer window.Mateus Fernandes, SouthamptonA summer signing from Sporting, Fernandes was thrown in at the deep end at Southampton, but he is one of few players who has managed to swim rather than sink this season. The central midfielder adjusted well to the rigours ofPremier Leaguefootball. Despite playing in one of the worst teams the Premier League has seen, he has averaged 2.8 tackles, 1.5 dribbles and 1.1 key passes per 90 minutes. Fernandes has represented Portugal at various youth levels and, at just 20 years old, he has time on his side to develop further.Tyler Dibling, SouthamptonIt would be a shock if Dibling is still playing forSouthamptonat the end of the summer transfer window. The club have demanded £100m for the winger and, while it is an astronomical fee for an unproven 19-year-old, there are a number of interested parties. Dibling has made 34 appearances this season, scoring four goals. Like Fernandes, it has been tough for him in a poor team but he has represented his country at various age groups, playing for England’s under-16s, under-17s, under-18s, under-19s and under-21s. The youngster has laughed off his price tag. “Nobody takes it seriously. It’s just a number. It’s all fun,” he says. He also says he is not angling for a move – “I love Southampton. I have been here since I was eight. It’s such a great team and I am working to do big things with them” – but, given the clubs who have expressed an interest, he may change his mind over the summer.Aaron Ramsdale, SouthamptonRamsdale has now been relegated from the Premier League with three clubs – Bournemouth, Sheffield United and Southampton – but Saints would have dropped back into the Championship far sooner were it not for the England international’s performances. The newly promoted Leeds, who are reportedly looking to replace Illan Meslier, have been linked with a move for Ramsdale, who has made the third most saves (106) in the division this season.Kyle Walker-Peters, SouthamptonA bit of a gimme, Walker-Peters’s contract is up in a couple of months’ time and any number of Premier League clubs should be lining up at St Mary’s to sign him. The 28-year-old full-back can play on either flank and is tidy in possession. His pass success rate of 90.5% would appeal to a number of Premier League outfits. Tottenham, West Ham, Wolves and Fulham are among those believed to be keeping tabs on the former England international.Mads Hermansen, LeicesterLeicester’s relegation was confirmed at the weekend despite the best efforts of Hermansen, whose performance between the sticks in their 1-0 defeat against Liverpool on Sunday earned him a place in our Premier League team of the week. The 24-year-old ranks fourth for saves (98) in the division this season. His distribution needs work but he would prove a smart signing for a promoted side who need a new shotstopper.Wilfred Ndidi, LeicesterInjuries have prevented Ndidi from hitting the heights many expected when the Nigerian joined Leicester in 2017. Even so, the 28-year-old has proven an effective ball winner, with his average of 3.3 tackles per 90 minutes ranking among the top 10 players in the league this season. Ndidi, an FA Cup winner with 64 international caps, would be a handy squad player for a club in need of an injection of top-flight experience.View image in fullscreenWilfred Ndidi celebrates with his Leicester teammates after scoring against Southampton.Photograph: Nick Potts/PABilal El Khannouss, LeicesterEl Khannouss has been Leicester’s shining light in a dreary Premier League campaign. Leicester spent £21m to sign the Moroccan last summer and his performances have caught the eye. El Khannouss has always excelled for his country – he won an Olympic bronze medal in Paris last year having made his debut in the Morocco side that reached the semi-finals of the World Cup in Qatar. Arsenal have reportedly shown an interest in the 21-year-old, whose two goals and two assists do not tell the full story of a player who has performed admirably this season.Abdul Fatawu, LeicesterFatawu was unfortunate to sustain a season-ending knee injury in Leicester’s 3-0 defeat against Manchester United in November. It was a big blow for the winger and his club. While a small sample size, Fatawu’s average of 4.5 successful dribbles is among the best in the Premier League this season. Clubs weighing up the possibility of bringing in a tricky winger should cast their eye over the 21-year-old. His lengthy absence may put some off but he proved his quality in the opening weeks of what proved to be a doomed campaign for Leicester.Liam Delap, IpswichMany scoffed at Ipswich’s decision to spend big on a striker who had struggled in the Championship, yet Liam Delap has enjoyed a whirlwind few months. The club’s impending drop is unlikely to deter the Premier League’s big hitters. On the contrary, news of a £30m release clause has put clubs on red alert. Twelve goals and two assists is a return to be commended and his willingness to throw himself about means Delap will earn a high-profile move this summer.Leif Davis, IpswichLeif Davis’s first-half red card against Arsenal on Sunday compounded a miserable afternoon for the relegation-bound Ipswich, but that dismissal should not detract from the 25-year-old’s attacking quality. No defender has made more key passes than Davis (54) in the Premier League this season. He has been a handy attacking outlet for Kieran McKenna’s team and clubs in need of a forward-thinking left-back would be wise to land themselves a bargain.Premier League team of the weekView image in fullscreenWhoScored’s team of the week.This is an article byWhoScoredExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueGuardian Sport NetworkLeicester CityIpswich TownSouthamptonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Since that day in 1954, when Bannister achieved a feat many had thought was impossible, just over 2,000 others have followed in his footsteps – all of them men.However, the pages of history could soon be freshly rewritten after the Olympic 1500m champion, Faith Kipyegon, and her sponsorsNike, announced plans “to make the impossible possible” again by becoming the first woman to run a sub-four-minute mile this summer.The Kenyan, who is widely regarded as the greatest female ­middle-distance runner of all time, holds the mile record of 4min 07.64sec. And while cutting nearly eight seconds off that mark would appear to be ­extraordinarily difficult, she will be armed with the next generation of super shoes and the assistance of male pacers to help her achieve her goal.“I’m a three-time Olympic ­champion. I’ve achieved world ­championship titles,” said Kipyegon. “I thought: ‘What else? Why not dream outside the box?’ And I told myself: ‘If you believe in yourself, and your team believes in you, you can do it.’”“I want this attempt to say to women: ‘You can dream and make your dreams valid,’” added the 31-year-old, who will make her attempt at the milestone on 26 June at the Stade Charléty in Paris. “This is the way to go as women, to push boundaries and dream big.”View image in fullscreenFaith Kipyegon will make her attempt at the milestone on 26 June at the Stade Charléty in Paris.Photograph: NikeNike is calling her attempt “Faith Kipyegon vs the 4-Minute Mile” and while most experts believe she is up against it, the US sportswear brand does have form when it comes to what it calls “moonshots”.In 2017 there was also considerable scepticism when Nike announced that another Kenyan, Eliud Kipchoge, would attempt “breaking two” – to run a marathon in under two hours at the Monza Formula One race track.And while hefell just shorton that occasion, two years later he went on torun 1:59.40 in Vienna– albeit in an event that did not count under World Athletics rules as he used 41 ­pacemakers, who subbed in and out of the run to help him draft and reduce wind resistance.Kipyegon will adopt similar ­tactics for her attempt, with a recent ­scientific paper suggesting that she “could run 3:59.37 with drafting ­provided by one pacer in front and one in back who change out with two other pacers at 800m”.Further help will come in the form of the next generation of super shoes, which are currently being tested by Nike athletes. As Trevor Painter, coach of the Olympic 800m gold medallist Keely Hodgkinson, told the Guardian: “Nike’s tech team came out to South Africa earlier this year to show us samples of what’s to come. Next year there’s a new shoe coming out which is like: ‘Wow, this is a bit of space age.’ It will shave tenths off track times, no doubt.”View image in fullscreenFaith Kipyegon celebrates winning the gold medal and setting a Olympic record in the women’s 1500m at the 2024 Paris Olympics.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianStill, the challenges Kipyegon faces are considerable. Typically an ­athlete has to be capable of ­running an 800m in 1.52 or 1.53 to run under four minutes for a mile, while the ­Kenyan’s personal best is 1.57. Even with better shoes and better ­drafting, she needs to cut a ­substantial amount of time. It makes it look less like a moonshot and more like trying to make it to Mars.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You start by calling your moonshot,” it added. “And as ­moonshots go, Faith Kipyegon’s is as audacious as they come.”Meanwhile, Seema Simmons, Nike’s vice-president of global ­women’s running, told the Guardian that she saw parallels with Kipchoge’s sub-two-hour marathon attempt and what Kipyegon is hoping to achieve.“I was here in 2017 and you have that same daring spirit,” she said. “We have an athlete that is ­determined and has an audacious goal to break barriers. And then from our side, we’re committed to making sure that we provide that advanced ­innovation, holistic support, and the ideal conditions to push the potential of human limits.”Whatever happens, Kipyegon is likely to capture plenty of hearts and headlines. And while her attempt is being conducted outside World ­Athletics’ rules, if such an ­insurmountable barrier does come crashing down, that fact will be a mere footnote amid the noise.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsNikeKenyanewsShareReuse this content"

Two US presidents – Donald Trump and Barack Obama – plus huge names from worlds outside sport have contacted the Northern Irishman since he completed the career grand slam at Augusta National. Amid moving scenes at Augusta, McIlroy’s outpouring of emotion reverberated way beyond golf. The achievement meant “everything and more” to McIlroy. It struck chords elsewhere.McIlroy, who beat Justin Rose in a playoff to win the Green Jacket, returns to action at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans, which starts on Thursday. The Northern Irishman was in bed with a fever on Monday, and was still slightly jaded when he addressed the media at TPC Louisiana on Wednesday.R&A ‘would love’ the Open to return to Donald Trump’s Turnberry courseRead more“It’s been an amazing few days, to be able to reflect on everything that happened and the magnitude of everything,” McIlroy said. “I think the big thing for me is just how the whole journey sort of resonated with people and the people that have reached out to me. That’s been absolutely amazing. It’s not every day you get to fulfil one of your lifelong goals and dreams. I’ve just really tried to enjoy everything that comes along with that.“I spoke to two presidents the day after, which was pretty cool. Just people reaching out from all walks of life, whether it be sports, entertainment, culture. Just all of it. People you would never even think would watch golf or would know what’s going on; that was very, very humbling.“I think people can see themselves in the struggle at times, and everything that you sort of try to put into getting the best out of yourself in that journey. Watching someone finally get it done, something they’ve been trying to do for a decade plus, I think it resonated.”McIlroy spent time post-Augusta at his house on the outskirts of London, before visiting his parents in Northern Ireland. Noticeably private celebrations were spent with those closest to the now five-time major winner. He is just the sixth golfer in history to win the grand slam. “I honestly could not be in a better place in my life professionally, personally, all of it,” the world No 2 said. “To celebrate with the people that have been a part of this whole thing for my entire career, my entire life was absolutely amazing.”McIlroy and Shane Lowry are the defending champions at the pairs event in New Orleans. Lowry grabbed McIlroy in a euphoric moment as Rose was seen off. The tournament organisers are clearly delighted McIlroy is here. Lowry was unsure his partner would make the trip as a dramatic final Masters round unfolded.“On the 15th hole at Augusta, I was done so I was watching the leaderboard,” Lowry said. “I think he’d just made double on 13. I said to Darren [Reynolds, Lowry’s caddie]: ‘No matter what happens the next few holes, I think we’re going to do well to get him to New Orleans.’ If things didn’t go his way, I don’t think he’d want to be here and I thought if things did go his way, he’d want to be somewhere else. I’m happy he’s here. I’m not saying we’re going to be down on Bourbon Street every night but we’re here to enjoy it.”As Lowry reflected on that 13th hole, where McIlroy found water with his third shot, the Masters champion visibly balked. “I’m eager to get back out there,” McIlroy said. “I think this is the perfect atmosphere to do it in.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I also know that it’s not all on me; he has to do some of the work, too. Maybe a lot of it the next two days.“It’s a perfect tournament to come back to, just good positive vibes from last year. I don’t know if that gives me more confidence, I’ve always been very confident in my abilities as a golfer. The whole day on Sunday at Augusta, I don’t think I’ll have to ever play a harder round of golf in my life. I certainly don’t want to be placed back on that 15th tee box on that Sunday afternoon. So I think to be able to get through that and produce the shots when I needed to, that gives me confidence and I can always draw back on that experience.”McIlroy has cited Europe retaining the Ryder Cup at Bethpage later this year as a remaining goal for 2025. It has been confirmed that José María Olazábal, who captained Europe to victory in Medinah 13 years ago, will join Luke Donald’s backroom team as a vice-captain.Explore more on these topicsRory McIlroyGolfThe MastersEuropean TourPGA TournewsShareReuse this content"

It was ceasing to be a positive place to be.”Brasher also accused X of not being a force for good and contrasted it sharply with the aims of the London Marathon, which was set up in 1981 by his father Chris and John Disley. “The London Marathon is about positivity,” he added.“One of the aims of my father and John was to show that on occasion, the family of humankind could be joyous together and celebrate together. That’s what the London Marathon is about. It is a force for good. And we didn’t feel that channel shared those values, and therefore we have come off.”Brasher also confirmed that the London Marathon would continue its policy of barring trans women from elite and championship female races, while allowing them to participate in the mass participation event, in the wake oflast week’s UK supreme court rulingthat a woman is defined by biological sex under British equalities law.However, he said he was waiting to see a detailed report from the Equalities Human Rights Commission and Sport England over how to implement the court’s ruling before deciding whether that policy might change.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Modern-day Manhattan is built on cricket pitches, among other things. They are there under the streets, among the farms and tenements cleared to make way for skyscrapers. There’s another under Central Park, a third below the NYU Langone medical centre, where – in 1844 – Canada beat the USA by 23 runs in what is considered the first international fixture in all sport.People have been dreaming of reviving American cricket ever since it died during the civil war, more than 160 years ago. It was killed by a shortage of pitches, kit and coaching, and by the rise of baseball, the great American pastime. Baseball had two advantages. It was easier to play – all you needed was a bat, a ball, four bases and a field – and if you were good at it, you could make a lot more money. Plenty of professional cricketers made the switch. The brothers George and Harry Wright, who had both played for St George’sCricketClub in New York, where their father was groundsman, were founding members of the first pro baseball team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings. Both are in the Hall of Fame, and Harry is still known as the “father of the game”. Early proprietors such as AG Spalding, another ex-cricketer, sold baseball as the indigenous American sport. It was the patriotic choice. Cricket was inescapably English.Even so, it persisted into the 20th century in pockets of North America, especially around Philadelphia, where it had established itself as a country-club sport. But the USA were excluded from the game’s new international governing body, the Imperial Cricket Conference, founded in 1909. By the time they were finally admitted to the renamed International Cricket Council, in 1965, cricket was a minority sport, played by expats on patches of parkland.View image in fullscreenThe players of St George’s CC in 1861, with two members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, Harry Wright (far left) and George Wright (fifth from left).Photograph: Transcendental Graphics/GettyThe Philadelphia Club is still the spiritual home of the game in the US, although the grounds are largely used for lawn tennis now – so more like the deconsecrated church of an extinct religion. Nearby is the CC Morris Cricket Library, which has the largest collection of cricket literature in the Americas. The odd truth is that, in the century since the great Philadelphian fast bowler John Barton King played his last game, the US has produced more great novels about cricket than it has great cricketers. In 2008, Joseph O’Neill published Netherland, which won the PEN/Faulkner award. O’Neill is Irish, and grew up in The Hague. He played age-group cricket and, after he moved to New York in 1998, he wanted to carry on. “It was really a question of driving around, spotting people playing cricket and asking them: ‘Can I play?’” he said.There is cricket in New York, most of it in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. You can find the old Jamaican umpire Steve Bucknor out there most weekends, standing in local leagues filled with first- and second-generation immigrants. “When I decided to write about this world, I didn’t really have a big story in mind,” said O’Neill. “But I had a couple of characters, people I’d met in the game, dreamers who were obsessed with cricket.” One inspired Chuck Ramkissoon, a key character in the novel – a charismatic fixer who is convinced cricket is a “bona fide American pastime” and dreams of getting rich by building a stadium right in the heart of New York City: “An arena for the greatest cricket teams in the world, twelve exhibition matches a summer, watched by eight thousand spectators at fifty dollars a pop.”The Spin | What will be the legacy of Cricket World Cup’s New York adventure?Read moreRamkissoon wasn’t alone. In 2004, a real-life entrepreneur named Kalpesh Patel launched the Pro Cricket League, promising that “in three years we will be an established entity”. It was shut down after a farcical first season. (One of Patel’s innovations was the five-ball over: “If you try to explain a six-ball over to Americans, they will say ‘why six?’ and we don’t have an answer. If they say ‘why five?’ then it’s easy maths.”) Another entrepreneur, Jay Mir, started the American Premier League in 2009, and 13 years later staged a second season, blighted by complaints about non-payment of fees. Allen Stanford, the Texan fraudster who set up the Stanford 20/20, was so sure he could “crack America” he spent $3m on a large test-marketing programme in Fort Collins, Colorado. The Cricket All-Stars exhibition series, led by Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar, managed three matches in New York, Houston and Los Angeles in 2015, but was scrapped before its second edition. Even O’Neill admits his own project was dreamy. “People would ask: ‘What’s your book about?’ When I told them ‘It’s about cricket in New York,’ obviously they would say: ‘That doesn’t sound promising.’”Then there’s the ICC. The Imperial Cricket Conference may have excluded the US, but its modern incarnation, the International Cricket Council, has made them a strategic priority. It launched Project USA in 2004, the year the national team qualified for the Champions Trophy in England (and were humiliated by New Zealand and Australia). In 2005, the ICC ditched the project, citing “fundamental governance issues”.There’s never been any doubt about the US’s large expatriate market. The country has always provided a large part of the audience for websites covering the sport, and is able to sustain a specialist subscription broadcaster, Willow TV. The Indo-American population grew by 50% in the 2010s, and is now almost five million, along with the best part of a million more Bangladeshi-Americans or Pakistani-Americans, and another 4.5 million Caribbean-Americans.What it has lacked is an administrative body able to make anything of that audience, let alone bring the various communities, spread across an area near enough the size of Europe, into an organised whole. The USA Cricket Association was regarded, in the words of an ICC insider, as a “basket case”. After a series of scandals, and three separate suspensions from the ICC, the USACA was expelled in 2017, and replaced two years later by USA Cricket – still a shoestring organisation, run by a small staff on a scant budget. It seems peripheral to the sport’s accelerating development.Because it is accelerating, at last. The lure of the dollar was irresistible to the ICC, which relies so heavily on India, and is keen to stake a claim in the US, the largest sports market on earth. There are three strands to its plan. One is to support the growth of Major League Cricket, the six-team franchise league launched in 2023, and given official T20 status a year later. The second was to get the sport into the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, which it achieved in October 2023. The last was to stage a major tournament, which was why, in 2021, the ICC gave the green light to a joint bid from Cricket West Indies and USA Cricket to host last year’s T20 World Cup.So, 15 years after Netherland, Ramkissoon’s dream came true. Almost. The actual stadium wasn’t in New York City, but Eisenhower Park in Nassau County, a 45-minute train ride away. And it wasn’t permanent, but a great pop-up scaffolding palace. The stands were trucked in from Las Vegas, where they were used for Formula One races, and the beds for the drop-in pitches shipped up from Australia. The whole thing was put together in days, and cost around $30m.View image in fullscreenA general view of the stadium during play in the T20 Cricket World Cup match between West Indies and USA at Nassau County International Cricket Stadium.Photograph: Robert Cianflone/GettyThere were two other venues – at Grand Prairie, a suburb of Dallas-Fort Worth in Texas, and at Lauderhill in Florida. The Florida leg was a washout, with two matches abandoned because of persistent rain and poor drainage. If the games had been in Grand Prairie, they would have gone off without a hitch. An old baseball stadium, it is the former home of the late Texas AirHogs, which has been converted into a cricket ground by MLC, which uses it as one of its two venues. The place was hit by a tornado in the week before the World Cup, but still got itself in shape for the opening group match, a reprise of the historic fixture between Canada and the USA.Yet, if the games had been played at Grand Prairie, hardly anyone would have noticed. The Indian, Pakistani and Nepali Americans in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area were excited about the tournament, but nobody else had the faintest idea what it was, let alone that it was happening in the little ground out by the turnpike (to get there, take a left at the scale replica of the Taj Mahal by the local branch of Ripley’s Believe It or Not!). The cricket was all people were talking about in the districts where the cricket fans lived, and ignored where they did not.Which was why the ICC decided it needed to play in New York, too. Call it the Frank Sinatra strategy: if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. It needed to whet America’s appetite. And it worked. The US team, packed with talented players who had relocated from round the cricket-playing world, beat Canada and, better still, Pakistan. All of a sudden, the country discovered it had a cricket team. ESPN, which had warned the ICC it was unlikely to cover the tournament since it didn’t have broadcast rights, featured it on its daily show. Media organisations who had shown no interest a week earlier made late requests for accreditation. One journalist pleaded that his editor-in-chief had demanded to know why they were the “only mainstream publication in the US not writing about the cricket”. It all built towards the showpiece between Pakistan and India, which – according to the Nassau County police chief – would be “like the Super Bowl on steroids”. It was a 34,000 sell-out, the largest crowd to attend a game of cricket in the US; the ICC’s media team were delighted it included a scattering of celebrities. At Citi Field in Queens, thousands watched on the big screens.It was a wildly ambitious project, and there were problems. The security was overbearing, the advertising around the city minimal, the fan zone at One World Trade often derelict, even on match days, and the drop-in pitches awful – palpably dangerous during the opening games, and nearly impossible to bat on thereafter. Sixes were as rare as home runs, which infuriated the broadcasters, and yet, when it was over, there was an unmistakable sense that it had worked – despite it all. Or perhaps because of it all, since the low-scoring pitches meant a string of exciting finishes. Independent research commissioned by the ICC suggested the tournament had received over 50,000 pieces of media coverage in the US alone, making it their second-largest market for the event. And the competition made over $500m – the most profitable the ICC had ever held.View image in fullscreenLast year’s T20 World Cup match between India and Pakistan.Photograph: Stefan Jeremiah/APSo it was a surprise to find members of the ICC board giving anonymous briefings about how badly it had gone, amid “outrage and alarm” about a $20m overspend. This, it turns out, had more to do with internal politics, not least the promise of the incoming chair, Jay Shah, to stop the ICC from wasting money – which could be redistributed to member nations who had elected him. It’s unclear what will happen to the ICC’s US strategy now Shah is in charge, and many of the people who drove the project have been moved on. But complaints about overspend have quietened since he took office.New York’s cricketers were perplexed by the whole thing, which passed through their city without affecting them. This could be considered a positive outcome, since one alternative had involved building the temporary stadium on their pitches in Van Cortlandt Park, wiping out their season. Instead, the authorities shut down the three golf courses in Eisenhower Park. Still, once the circus had moved on, the cricketers were left wondering about the benefit.Howdy or howzat? When USA and Canada made cricket history in 1844Read more“The first thing they’d need to do is try and create one good cricket field,” said O’Neill. “Just one, on a par with the worst cricket field in London – you know what I mean? There’s just no grassroots investment. Zero. And that continues to be the case.” The problems are the same as they were 160 years ago: pitches, kit, coaching. The T20 World Cup did little to address this. Its legacy, so far as there was one, was that it piqued US interest in cricket, and provided proof of concept for the Olympics.The eight drop-in pitches, though, do have a future. They will probably be bought by MLC, and perhaps installed at the Oakland Coliseum, a 46,000-seat on the west coast, and the one baseball stadium large enough to contain a cricket field. The ICC had considered using it itself, but there are plans to turn it into the home of MLC’s San Francisco Unicorns.That signposts the way the game is heading: it won’t be the ICC that develops the sport, but MLC. Fundamentally unlike any of the US’s earlier cricket leagues, it has serious investors, with serious money. They’re members of the diaspora, too, just the same as the people playing in Van Cortlandt Park – but most have made a lot of money working in tech firms and venture-capital funds in Silicon Valley. They include Satya Nadella, chair of Microsoft; Shantanu Narayen, chair of Adobe; and Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, who were instrumental in the growth of Amazon. They also have strong ties with India: Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings all have stakes in franchises. In two seasons, they have built a league containing teams that, the Unicorns’ chief executive, David White, argues, would beat most Big Bash and T20 Blast sides. After the Unicorns signed Pat Cummins on a four-year deal, he was asked why he had chosen MLC ahead of the Hundred, which overlaps with it. Cummins said he simply “hadn’t thought” of the Hundred.MLC is planning to expand. It already has a Minor League, and some sides have established academies. Investors say the next step will be to develop venues. There are plans to build one in Brooklyn, near the spot Ramkissoon imagined. It may end up hosting Olympic cricket, given that Nita Ambani – who sits on the board of the International Olympic Committee – is one of the investors.There’s little doubt the US is capable of staging the Olympic event and a high-end, made-for-TV league – and of filling grounds with the Indo-American community. Given the sums involved, the acumen of the people behind MLC, and the support of Indian investors, they could even win the race to become the world’s second-best T20 competition.This ought to be enough. So it was a surprise to find that the men behind it want more – that they are harbouring their own versions of that same old dream. “I know it sounds daunting,” Sivaramakichenane Somasegar, co-owner of the Seattle Orcas, said. “But in my mind, the interesting thing here is to see cricket become a mainstream sport. It’s going to take decades: it is not an overnight thing. The closest analogy I can give you is what happened to soccer in the US. Go back to the 60s and 70s, hardly anybody knew soccer, and even in the 90s it was not well thought of. But the World Cup happened here, and Major League Soccer was launched, and people started to feel it could be serious.”There are differences. A football match lasts only 90 minutes. Even a three-hour T20 match is a stretch, when baseball – which runs to the same sort of length – is doing everything it can to cut down the duration of games. Football also had a significant playing base among the school and college populations, even if they didn’t pay to watch it at the weekend.Participation in cricket remains small, but it is rising, and being taken up by an increasing number of inner-city schools as a way to engage with the growing Asian-American and Caribbean-American populations. America is changing, and cricket can be part of its modern, multiracial identity, just as rodeos and Nascar driving are for another chunk of the population. Whether it can ever become bigger, and reach those without a family background in it, is another question. The proposal is so ambitious you feel it must be beyond reach.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: WisdenDuring the T20 World Cup, I met exactly one new fan, an elderly golfer in Nassau County who wanted to find out what all the fuss was about, and why his course had been shut to make way for cricket. One new fan seems a small return on a $30m investment. But then, as a couple of those MLC investors might tell you, even Amazon started small.This piece isan edited extract from theWisden Cricketers’ Almanack 2025, released on Thursday 24 April.

Guro Reiten opened from the spot before Catarina Macario scored a brace. Mia Fishel rounded off the night to restore their six-point lead at the top of the Women’s Super League.Sonia Bompastor praised her side’s performance to gain a “crucial result” but warned that “nothing is done yet” in terms of the league title. “We are in a good position but nine more points need to be played and it’s enough for Arsenal to come back,” the Chelsea manager said. “Everything is possible. I will only relax when it is mathematically done.”Arsenal and Chelsea face uphill battles in Champions League – Women’s Football WeeklyRead moreChelsea were clear favourites coming into this game: the hosts were unbeaten in the league, while Palace were rooted to the bottom.The one doubt surrounding Chelsea was how quickly they could recover fromtheir weekend disappointment against Barcelonawhich all but destroyed their quadruple hopes. Bompastor rotated heavily, making seven changes to bring fresh energy into the side. The experienced Guro Reiten made her first start since returning from a back injury while Macario also returned in a changed attacking line. Naomi Girma made her second start since joining the club in January, replacing Nathalie Björn in defence.Leif Smerud’s Palace side had not played a competitive fixture in three weeks, a quirk of the scheduling which did little to help them gain momentum. They had at least been able to replenish an injury-hit squad over the break with Clarissa Larisey recalled alongside Mille Gejl.Chelsea set the tone early on with the visitors having to put bodies on the line to protect their goal. Macario had an effort blocked before Allyson Swaby’s instinctive reaction deflected a goalbound strike from Aggie Beever-Jones just wide.View image in fullscreenMia Fishel (centre) wheels away after netting Chelsea’s fourth.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAIt was only a matter of time before Chelsea found the breakthrough and two goals in two minutes put them in firm control. The first came when a cross from the influential Reiten struck Molly-Mae Sharpe’s hand in the box. The Norwegian stepped up to take the penalty, coolly dispatching her eighth league goal of the season.Chelsea took advantage of Palace’s naivety to double the lead when Girma and Sandy Baltimore combined to exploit the space left by an advanced Lily Woodham. Baltimore found Macario in the area and she drove a low effort past Shae Yanez. Palace’s evening got worse immediately after the break when they were reduced to 10 players after Swaby saw red for denying a goalscoring opportunity, bringing down Sjoeke Nüsken just outside the box. The punishment became even more severe when Macario stepped up to convert the free-kick, aided by a heavy deflection.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was her first goal since recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury which had kept her out for more than a year. “I’m really happy for her,” Bompastor said. “It is a special moment for her individually and for the team.

The matter is being reviewed internally in line with club policies and no further comment will be made at this time.”There was no immediate response from McClean, 28, who is a brother of the Wrexham winger and Ireland internationalJames McClean.A colour party in paramilitary-style attire and with faces covered joined dozens of people who marched from the Creggan area to Free Derry corner in the Bogside. Afterwards a group of youths attacked police with petrol bombs and fireworks. Police arrested two men, aged 30 and 55.Ch Supt Gillian Kearney of the Police Service of NorthernIrelandsaid the disorder was orchestrated. “Young people were shamelessly and deliberately used in an attempt to distract from and shield the masked individuals as they took cover,” she said. “This is child criminal exploitation. It is utterly shameful.”There is no suggestion McClean was involved in disorder or engaged by police.The annual parade, which commemorates the 1916 Easter rising, has erupted in clashes in previous years. It was organised by the National Republican Commemoration Committee, which is said to arrange events on behalf of a fringe republican party called Saoradh that has been linked to the New IRA, although it denies this.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.McClean, who is from Derry and played for the city’s club as well as Waterford and Sligo Rovers, joined Glentoran in 2019.

He has been a standout performer forBournemouththis season and is a key target for Chelsea, who are keen to add a ball-playing centre-back to their ranks.‘I’ve always been pretty chilled’: Dean Huijsen on Bournemouth, defending and his celebrationRead moreA potential stumbling block forChelsea, who could also face competition from Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle, is that Madrid have been monitoring the Spain international. Sources have indicated that Huijsen – who has just turned 20 – would favour a move to the Bernabéu if it were on the table.Yet Madrid are understood to be unsure over whether funds are available. The club have not been in the habit of paying big fees for signings in recent years. They have looked to get players on free transfers and are closing in on a deal for the Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold.Chelsea have been working behind the scenes on a deal for Huijsen. They have a good relationship with the player’s representatives and want to wrap up the signing before the Club World Cup, which begins in mid-June.Part of Huijsen’s appeal is that he is two-footed and adept at playing out from the back. Enzo Maresca puts a heavy emphasis on possession and believes his plans have been compromised by Wesley Fofana’s fitness problems. The centre-back is out for the season after another hamstring injury.Chelsea have also looked at Ajax’s Jorrel Hato, Crystal Palace’s Marc Guéhi and Everton’s Jarrad Branthwaite. A striker is also a priority, with Ipswich’s Liam Delap and RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko shortlisted. Chelsea are keen to bring in a winger and have considered Manchester United’s Alejandro Garnacho and Borussia Dortmund’s Jamie Gittens.Explore more on these topicsChelseaBournemouthReal MadridnewsShareReuse this content"

Just bring on the weekend, really.”Villa’s 1996 League Cup triumph brought their last major honour. Watkins, who signed in 2020, said: “This is the furthest since I’ve been at the club we’ve got in theFA Cup. We’ve always gone out quite early and it’s disappointing. You want to win these competitions and it’s nice that we’re in the latter stages of it.“I’ve been saying to the boys one thing I set my eyes on when I joined the club was winning a trophy. It’s been so long since the club has done that and that’s the main aim, so Saturday is massive.”Watkins shrugged off being dropped for Marcus Rashford at City despite having scored in last weekend’s4-1 win at Newcastlewhen starting.

The 27-year-old has impressed there, scoring four times and making six assists in 17 appearances, his latest goal a penalty inthe 2-1 defeat at Manchester Cityon Tuesday. Villa have an option to buy him for £40m, subject to the player wanting to join and agreeing terms.Rashford’s representatives will wait until mid-June for discussions regarding his future. United are intent he should leave after the breakdown in the relationship and with money from his sale needed tohelp their summer transfer strategy. If Rashford is sold to a club other than Villa his fee could be higher.Wolves’ Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap of Ipswich are Amorim’s prime forward targets. Rashford earns about £365,000 a week and has three years on his contract, so his transfer would release about £56m in saved salary.Villa are outside the Champions League places after losing at City, who went third thanks to Matheus Nunes’s 94th-minute winner. Nunes is conscious of the importance of Champions League qualification.“This is our Premier League trophy now, to qualify for the Champions League,” he said. “It’s massively important for us, in terms of everything, the club, in terms of the players. We cannot describe how incredible it’s going to be in the Champions League, because now we cannot fight for the Premier League trophy.”Nunes again impressed at right‑back against Villa despite it not being his natural position. “It’s not easy, especially because my whole career I played as a No 8, No 10 sometimes,” he said. “So I’m adapting. Every game I’m thinking I’m feeling even more comfortable. So hopefully I can improve even more.”Explore more on these topicsMarcus RashfordManchester UnitedAston VillanewsShareReuse this content"

Apple TV withdrew from advanced negotiations over a global deal last summer after a disagreement over valuation, with Fifa reportedly demanding $4bn, and a subsequent attempt to sell the rights on a regional basis foundered.Although Dazn’s latest accounts say it has 300 million monthly users globally, it remains a challenger company in certain markets, including the UK, which led to an agreement to sublicense the rights to ensure larger viewing figures for Fifa and its commercial partners. Warner Bros has a sublicensing deal in the United States.The Guardian reported this month that theBBC and ITV had opted not to bidbecause their main football focus will be their joint coverage of England’s defence of the Women’s European Championship.

I was frightened to death’Simon BurntonWed 23 Apr 2025 19.01 EDTShareAndrew Flintoff has described his return to cricket as a coach over the past 18 months as “the one thing that saved me” as he struggled to come to terms with the mental and physical scars caused in acar accident during filmingfor the BBC’s Top Gear in December 2022.Flintoff talks for the first time about the accident and its aftermath in a Disney+ documentary to be released on Friday. “After the accident I didn’t think I had it in me to get through,” he says.Andrew Flintoff reveals anxiety after Top Gear accident: ‘I couldn’t get out of the room’Read more“This sounds awful: part of me thinks I should have been killed. Part of me thinks I wish I had died. I didn’t want to kill myself, I won’t mistake the two things. I wasn’t wishing, I was thinking: that would have been so much easier. Now I try to take the attitude, you know what, the sun will come up tomorrow, and my kids will still give me a hug. I feel in a better place now.”For several months after the accident Flintoffrefused to leave his houseexcept for medical appointments. He had taken little involvement in cricket since his retirement in 2010 and move into TV presenting, but it was his sport which eventually coaxed him from seclusion, initially to run a few sessions for the England men’s team in 2023 and then with formal appointments in 2024as coach of England Lions, a B-team largely composed of emerging players, and of theHundred side Northern Superchargers.“If one thing’s come out of it which is positive it’s being back in cricket,” Flintoff said. “It’s probably the one thing that saved me. I’ve been welcomed back into that fold. It’s such a good place. I feel it’s safe. I have moments when I’m sat in a dressing room and I’m watching a game of cricket surrounded by cricketers and friends, and I’m able to forget.”The 47-year-old sustained serious facial injuries when a three-wheeled, open-topped car overturned while he was driving it on a runway at Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey, Top Gear’s regular filming location. “I remember everything about it,” Flintoff says in the documentary.“When I think about it now I’m back in that car. They were showing me how to get the car going sideways. And the wheel came off at the front. It’s a funny thing, rolling a car, because there’s a point of no return, and everything slows down. It’s so weird.“I used to play cricket, and if you bat you get point four of a second to make your mind up where the ball’s going, what shot are you going to play, how are you going to move your feet. And as it started going over, I looked at the ground and I knew if I get hit on the side [of his head], I’m going to break my neck. If I get hit on the temple I’m dead. My best chance is go face down … My biggest fear [afterwards] was I didn’t think I had a face. I thought my face had come off. I was frightened to death.”I still live it every day. Still in the car every night when I go to bed. It’s so vivid. I’ve not slept the same sinceAndrew FlintoffEarlier in the film he says of the accident: “I’m still arranging it in my mind. Still coming to terms with it. I still live it every day. Still in the car every night when I go to bed. And it’s so vivid. I’ve not slept the same since. It’s a movie in my head.”After the accident Flintoff was airlifted to St George’s hospital in Tooting. The film features graphic images of injuries that Jahrad Haq, the surgeon who operated on him, describes as “very complex … In the past 20 years of seeing maxillofacial trauma, probably in the top five”.In 2023 Flintoffreached a settlement with BBC Studios, the commercial subsidiary of the BBC that produced Top Gear, reportedly worth £9m. That November the corporation announced the programme had been cancelled. Flintoff had been co-presenting since 2019, alongside Paddy McGuinness and Chris Harris, with great success: its last series had an average audience of 4.5 million viewers. However, Flintoff feels the presenters’ safety had been put at risk in the desperate attempt to improve ratings.“Everyone wants more. Everybody wants that that thing that nobody’s seen before,” he said. “Everybody wants to dig that a little bit deeper. Everybody wants an exclusive. Everybody wants the biggest stunt. Like: ‘Let’s have that near-miss because that’ll get viewers.’ Everything’s about viewers. Always.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the momentum of the NFL in the homeland of AFL has not been universally welcomed, with some Americans dismayed by the dominance of mature punting imports within the college ranks.Former Wallabies star Jordan Petaia signs NFL deal with LA ChargersRead moreFive-year Florida State punter Alex Mastromanno, who grew up in Brighton and played in the Magpies’ VFL team once in 2017, is in contention for selection in the NFL draft which gets under way on Friday morning AEST and runs over three days.Prokick Australia’s Nathan Chapman, who helped fine-tune Mastromanno’s game and prepare him for college, says the Victorian was one of several punting prospects who could be picked, including Jeremy Crawshaw from Florida, James Burnip from Alabama and Jesse Mirco from Vanderbilt.“There were 25 Prokick players finishing up at college this year who will either be trying for the NFL or the Canadian Football League, it’s a big year of names coming out – probably one of the biggest – so hopefully it’s a good weekend for us,” Chapman says.View image in fullscreenThe rise of Super Bowl winner Jordan Mailata underlines the growing reputation of the NFL in Australia.Photograph: Rob Carr/Getty ImagesThe pipeline of Australian punting talent to American colleges has been so rich that a class action was brought against the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in February. The lead plaintiff is a parent of a teenage punter, seeking to limit the number of overseas punters competing with locals for scholarships. 61 out of 133 top US programs had at least one Australian punter on a scholarship in 2023, court documents allege.Chapman says he was proud of what Prokick had achieved. “We’re not going to get caught up too much in some parents and opposition kicking instructors who think they’ve got a given right to have these scholarships for themselves, it’s a global sport,” he says.The 26-year-old Mastromanno has been one of three finalists in the Ray Guy Award for the best college punter in both of the past two seasons, and is known for his mix of skills and large build for the position. He gained notoriety as an ambidextrous punter who also acts as a holder for his team’s kicker, and has worked in recent years to demonstrate he is ready for the NFL.Kye Beveridge, Jackson Starcevich + Alex Mastromanno will be Black + White in '17 -https://t.co/N7QszNn6ZPWelcome to the#vflmagpieslads!pic.twitter.com/8F0VFXHxx8— Collingwood FC (@CollingwoodFC)March 1, 2017Dozens of Australian punters have proven themselves in the American professional game, including pioneer Darren Bennett and more recently former Sydney Swans NEAFL player Michael Dickson and West Australian Mitch Wishnowsky.Chapman believes Mastromanno has NFL-ready leg power and technique, but he also believes recruiters could be drawn to his broad portfolio of work, including an ability to kick stationary or while on the move.“You’ve just got to get a coach that can look through the amount of different kicks that he did at college, and says, ‘Let me focus on what we do have, we’ve got a pretty talented guy who can do multiple things, actually, that might be a weapon’,” Chapman says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Offensive tackle Mailata, defensive lineman Adam Gotsis, and guard Daniel Faalele – a fourth-round draft pick in 2022 and Pro Bowl alternate last season – have shown Australians don’t need to kick to make their mark.Their emergence has coincided with anincreasingly global outlook from NFL officials, who have scheduled seven overseas matches this year. The LA Rams are due to play the first regular-season match in Australia at the MCG in 2026, and 90,000 people have expressed an interest in tickets even though the date of the match and even the Rams’ opponent are still to be confirmed.NFL heads to Australia with multi-year Melbourne deal confirmed from 2026Read moreResearch carried out by the league’s Australian office has found the number of self-identified local fans of the competition has grown from 5.7 million to 7.5 million over the past two years. “1.3 million of those 7.5 million are considered avid fans,” says Charlotte Offord, general manager for NFL in Australia and New Zealand. “What we are seeing is not only a huge uplift in casual fandom, in terms of non-fans becoming fans, but we’re also seeing shifts in people becoming more avid as well,” she says.The international player pathway program – which was established in 2017 – allows often raw overseas recruits to join NFL squads without taking up a precious roster spot. The Los Angeles Chargers announced they hadused the program to sign former Wallaby Jordan Petaiaas a tight end last month. The Australian NFL Academy has been open for a year on the Gold Coast, and all eight players – none of whom are punters – have received Division I college offers.Explore more on these topicsNFLAustralia sportUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Axel Radukabana wasjailed for a minimum of 52 yearsfor carrying out the attack.The board said the three posts, which contained a range of anti-Muslim sentiment, incited violence and showed support for the riots, “created the risk of likely and imminent harm” and should have been taken down. It added that Meta had been too slow to implement crisis measures as riots broke out across the UK.The first post, which was eventually taken down by Meta, was text-only and called for mosques to be smashed as well as buildings where “migrants“ and “terrorists” lived to be set on fire. The second and third posts featured AI-generated images of a giant man in a union jack T-shirt chasing Muslim men, and of four Muslim men running after a crying blond toddler in front of the Houses of Parliament, with one of the men wielding a knife.The board added that changes to Meta’s guidance in January meant users could now attribute behaviours to protected characteristic groups, for example, people defined by their religion, sex, ethnicity or sexuality, or based on someone’s immigration status. As a consequence, users can say a protected characteristic group “kill”, said the board.It added that third-party factcheckers, which are still being used by Meta outside the US, had reduced the visibility of posts spreading a false name of the Southport attacker. It recommended the company research the effectiveness of community notes features – where users police content on platforms – which are also being deployed by Meta after the removal of US factcheckers.“Meta activated the crisis policy protocol (CPP) in response to the riots and subsequently identified the UK as a high-risk location on August 6. These actions were too late. By this time, all three pieces of content had been posted,” the board said.“The board is concerned about Meta being too slow to deploy crisis measures, noting this should have happened promptly to interrupt the amplification of harmful content.”In response to the board’s ruling, a Meta spokesperson said: “We regularly seek input from experts outside of Meta, including the oversight board, and will act to comply with the board’s decision.“In response to these events last summer, we immediately set up a dedicated taskforce that worked in real time to identify and remove thousands of pieces of content that broke our rules – including threats of violence and links to external sites being used to coordinate rioting.”Meta said it would respond to the board’s wider recommendations within 60 days.The board ruling also ordered the removal of two anti-immigrant posts in Poland and Germany for breaching Meta’s hateful conduct policy. It said Meta should identify how updates to its hateful content policy affect the rights of refugees and asylum seekers.Explore more on these topicsMetaFacebookInstagramSocial mediaHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Once a year the Paintress, a giant god-like woman visible from across the sea, wakes, paints a number on a large monolith, and in the peaceful town of Lumière, everyone whose age corresponds with the number dies. This process, called the Gommage, has shortened people’s lives for 67 years, and now it’s Sophie’s turn. Immediately after this heart-wrenching goodbye, Gustave and his adopted sister Maelle get ready to set sail as part of Expedition 33, on a journey to defeat the Paintress and end her gruesome cycle.While stunningly beautiful, the continent you arrive at is no friendly place, and the path to the Paintress is filled with surreal monsters called Nevrons, which you fight in turn-based battles. Characters have a melee attack and a long-range attack, but most importantly, they have a large variety of unique skills including elemental magic attacks and strong attacks with multiple hits that have the chance to stun. Each member of your team has a special way of building up damage even further; Maelle for example uses a defensive, offensive or aggressive combat stance, inspired by fencing, while the magic that Lune wields builds up so-called stains that you can then spend to make other spells more powerful. Add to this long list of optional passive skills called Pictos, and soon you have a wide array of ways to enhance your characters. The interplay between building up action points to use skills, building up damage and defending is really interesting, and I enjoyed trying out different tactics, even as it meant that a lot of my time was spent in menus.View image in fullscreenAn enigma wrapped in a mystery … Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.Photograph: Sandfall InteractiveIt can feel overwhelming, but each new skill gets introduced gradually, and permanent tool tips in the battle menu helpfully list each skill’s effect and cost. Clair Obscur’s combat can be quite a challenge, however, since battles use a parry and dodge system. If you don’t dodge at least, battles will quickly be over. Successful parries, which have a narrower reaction window than dodging, let characters answer with powerful counters, which can be crucial to beating your foes. Even regular enemies kept me on my toes with their many attacks, but the absolute screen-shaking force of a successful counter felt deeply satisfying every time. I continuously got a kick out of parrying because I’m the right kind of bad at it – it might get boring if you don’t get that hit of dopamine from occasional success, or feel frustrating if you struggle constantly. Enemies also feint incredibly often, which is meant to increase the difficulty of parrying but also lengthens their attacks, sometimes overly so.Developer Sandfall Interactive has been very open about taking inspiration from Japanese role-playing games. While combat is certainly a prominent example, I saw the influences everywhere: the menu design is as much Persona-inspired as the combat is, the enemies are as surreal as Bloodborne’s gruesome creations. But when it comes to storytelling, Clair Obscur shares the tendency of many JRPGs to over-complicate things.The dialogue though is well written and acted. Your party goes through some incredibly bad times, but they talk about it candidly and try to support each other as best they can. Optional conversations help you to get to know everyone better – some of Clair Obscur’s best writing is here. It’s the main plot where things eventually get exhausting. For the most part, Clair Obscur is the adult fantasy that Final Fantasy XVI tried to be. But it’s also an enigma wrapped in a mystery, and for hours and hours, it adds new questions and characters until it’s all revealed in an absolute dump of late-game information. Conversations, locations and gameplay repeat themselves in the final third, making things feel artificially lengthened.Towards the end, Clair Obscur constantly finds more ways to be even sadder than it was mere minutes ago, so unwilling to let you go that it forces you through lengthy boss fights accompanied by a whole soundtrack’s worth of operatic metal. It also culminates in a very frustrating ending that made me question everything I spent hours doing. Everywhere else, from combat to enemy design to music, I appreciated Clair Obscur’s flair for the epic, but too much subterfuge, too many tears, too many fights ultimately made for a seriously fumbled ending.Clair Obscure: Expedition 33 is out on 24 April; £44.99.Explore more on these topicsGamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Kyiv and other European governments are rightly alarmedWed 23 Apr 2025 13.39 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 15.47 EDTShareThere could hardly be clearer evidence than Donald Trump’s latest attack on Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the US administration’slast-minute snubof London peace talks, that what matters to him is not Ukrainian sovereignty and safety, nor the transatlantic alliance, but a deal with Vladimir Putin. The US president saysan agreement is close, withleaks suggestingthat Washington would recognise annexed Crimea as Russian with Moscow giving little if anything in return. For Mr Trump, it is Ukraine’s president who is harming negotiations by saying he will not recognise Russia’s control.Mr Putin is passionate about maximising Russian interests, attentive to every detail, skilled in negotiations, and believes that time is on his side. Mr Trump does not care about the outcome as long as he can claim he has ended the war, has little interest in the detail and has a habit of handing over the prize at the start of the process.He described Russian aggression towards Ukraine as “genius” days before the 2022 full-scale invasion and his administration isabandoning effortsto hold Moscow accountable for war crimes. He holds a grudge against Mr Zelenskyy, and believes Mr Putin would“keep his word”on a peace deal. Above all, he is in a hurry. Having pledged that he could end the war “in 24 hours”, he wants something to brag about as he nears the end of his first 100 days in office.No one wants peace more than Ukrainians, after so many deaths and so much devastation. Kyiv understands that there will be no magical restoration of territorial integrity. But in the words of Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, it is ready to negotiate, not to surrender.JD Vance, the US vice-president,has a simple answer: it is time for the two sides to “either say yes or for the US to walk away from this process”. That might not suit Mr Putin quite as well as a carve-up. But US military aid to Ukraine is already reaching its end, intelligence could soon follow, and Washington could also restrict arms purchases even if Europe was willing and able to fund them to the extent needed.Mr Putin has played an expert hand so far, throwing a bone to Mr Trump whenever it seemed expedient – as with the offer of an“Easter truce”, which did not halt attacks. His latest gambit isreportedlyto offer to cede claims on Ukrainian land that Russia does not actually control: the kind of Potemkin concession that Mr Trump might laud. He does not want a European “reassurance force” in Ukraine, said to be part of the US proposal, but may also conclude that its significance would be limited without a US security guarantee.The timing of the leaks on the US plans, as well as the slight to Europe’s diplomatic efforts – with the abrupt withdrawal of the secretary of state,Marco Rubio, and Mr Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, meaning that London’s discussions were downgraded – reinforces the European understanding that a US-brokered deal may be a beginning, not the end, for Russian ambitions. A grotesquely one-sided, imposed agreement would encourage territorial aggression elsewhere too. It isn’t surprising that Mr Putin sees Europe as an obstruction and prefers bilateral talks. It should continue to alarm and appal us that the US, too, now sees its old allies as the problem, not the solution.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The economy is weak. Government borrowing has just come inhigher than expected. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) hasdowngraded its forecasts for UK growth. And to cap it all, she is trying to get the arch-protectionist Donald Trump tolower tariffs on British exportsas part of a UK-US trade deal. Being chancellor of the exchequer is a tough gig, but nobody told her it would be this tough.Reeves is in Washington this week for the half-yearly meetings of the IMF and the World Bank and there is no shortage of problems that the two venerable institutions could be getting their teeth into. There is a need forspeedier and deeper debt reliefto allow poor countries to spend more on tackling climate change. There is a need to redouble international efforts to hit the2030 development goalsset by the United Nations. There is a need to change the way the fund and the bank are managed to reflect the fact that the global economy has moved on since they were created in 1944.Inevitably, though, the meetings have been overshadowed by the increasingly unhinged antics of Trump. This week began with the president taking aim at Jerome Powell after the man in charge of America’s central bank said tariffs would push up US inflation and make it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Trump called Powell a “major loser” and triggered panic in the markets by suggesting his reluctance to reduce borrowing costsmeant he was for the chop.This was more than a run-of-the mill wobble in the stock market. Instead, there was the unusual combination of US share prices, US bonds and the US dollarall falling at the same time. Normally when share prices tumble bond prices go up, while nervous investors pile into the dollar. Faced with the prospect that the US currency might no longer be considered a safe haven, Trump was forced to backtrack, saying he never had any intention of sacking Powell. But nobody can be sure. Trump is vindictive and will need a scapegoat when his policies backfire. According to the IMF, the US will take the biggest hit from tariffs of any major economy, but was perhaps also being a little generous in predicting growth this year of close to 2%. It could be a lot worse than that.Let’s be clear. Some of Trump’s criticisms of the way the global economy has been managed – or rather mismanaged – are warranted. There is an argument for the use of protectionism as part of an industrial strategy. There is an argument for reform of the way the IMF and World Bank operate. And there is certainly a case for taking a long, hard look at whether central bank independence should be taken as given.Powell and the Fed deserve criticism for some of the decisions they have taken in recent years, particularly in the period after the pandemic when policy was initially too lax and then too tight. The same applies to the Bank of England. The golden period of central bank independence came in the 1990s when the arrival of cheap goods from China kept inflation low. Central banks took the credit but they just got lucky.What’s more, the idea that independent central banks are truly independent is questionable. Voters have been sold the idea that control of interest rates should be handed to supposedly apolitical technocrats who will not be tempted to tweak policy for short-term electoral gain and can therefore be better trusted than elected representatives to make policy in a rational manner.But more often than not these “rational” decisions reflect the prejudices of central bankers, not least that keeping inflation low is the only thing that really matters. One of Powell’s predecessors – Paul Volcker – crushed inflation in the early 1980s by pushing US interest rates to punitive levels. The result was a deep recession and thedemise of whole communitiesin the American midwest. Alan Greenspan, who took over from Volcker at the Fed, would cut interest rates if there was a risk that a slump on Wall Street would become too pronounced. These were deeply political decisions taken with full knowledge of the consequences, one of which is strong support for Trump in the rust belt.But Trump’s personal attacks on Powell have the paradoxical effect of making the Fed’s independence more secure. As was the case with tariffs, the president has found it is impossible to buck the markets. Yet the notion that things will be calmer now is for the birds. Trump is an unstable bully who just happens to be in charge of the world’s most important economy. He is likely to lash out as things get worse – as they will.All of which brings us back to Reeves. What Britain wants out of a trade deal is clear. It would like to be exempt from Trump’s across-the-board 10% tariff imposed on all countries, and to see a cut – preferably to zero – in the 25% levy on car exports to the US. The US wants easier access for its food exports, including chlorine-washed chicken, something the UK considers a red line.This would be a tricky negotiation at the best of times but the brutal truth is that nobody can predict what Trump will do or say from one moment to the next. There will be other casualties of his wrecking-ball approach. The UK could be one of them.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFederal ReserveOpinionDonald TrumpGlobal economyInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)Rachel ReevesWorld BankEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

So what is their aim?Wed 23 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 11.15 EDTShareMalcolm and Simone Collins, the pro-natalist couple who are reportedly consulting the Donald Trump administration on how to encourage American women to have more babies, are something of a deliberate heel: they often seem to be attempting to provoke the ire of their audience. The couple espouse the pro-natalism that is sweeping the political right with an explicit eugenicist tilt (self-styled “elites”, the Collins scan their IVF-generated embryos before their pregnancies, in an effort to select for features like high IQ). They dress in the severe black outfits of German modernists, with an emphasis on the “German” part, and wear large, unusually shaped eyeglasses; Simone has also taken to wearing large bonnets that make her look likeMother Goose, or, in their less subtle versions, like an extra onThe Handmaid’s Tale.”The pair met on Reddit.The founders of a pro-birth organization, the Collinses’ assert that there is a crisis of declining birth rates in America. (In reality, the slight dip in America’s birth rate in recent years is almost entirely due to thedecline of teen pregnancies.) They aim to fix this in part by breeding as many of their own children as possible: they currently have four, blameless innocents they have cruelly burdened with names like “Industry Americus” and “Torsten Savage”. But they seem to be more adept at siring media profiles of themselves, of which there have been many. The couple insist upon their own genetic superiority, like a breeding-obsessed Boris and Natasha. They aim to advance a future of more babies and – by their own terms – better ones: what Simone calls “genetically selected humans”. They must be doing it on purpose: no one could become so off-putting by accident.Black maternal health means navigating a broken system. But there is hope | Venice HaynesRead moreBecause these people are styling themselves after the villains of a Saturday morning cartoon, they are of course now deeply influential in the Trump administration. A New York Timesreportfinds that the couple has been solicited by White House advisers to develop proposals to “persuade” American women to have more babies.“Persuasion” may not be entirely the right word. After all, with the fall of Roe v Wade in 2022, more than half the states now have abortion bans in effect, meaning that many American women, unable to access legal care to end their pregnancies, are being not so much persuaded asforced to have children. But for the pro-natalists, this isn’t good enough. What the movement desires – and what they are hoping their partnership with the Trump administration will achieve – is not just a rise in the American birthrate but a wholesale revolution in American culture, with enforcement of rightwing social values and a profound transformation of women’s role in American life.The actual proposals, such as they are, are not especially inventive. Pro-natalist activists who are working with the Trump administration have advised the creation of fertility awareness classes, supposedly to make women more alert to the times of the month when they are ovulating and more likely to conceive; they have proposed “baby bonuses” of up to $5,000 each time a woman gives birth.One proposal by activists would limit a large proportion of the prestigious Fulbright grants to scholars with children – a criterion that would exclude many early career female researchers, who often find, as ambitious women in most fields do, that raising young children is incompatible with doing the kind of rigorous and demanding work that can earn them a fancy award. For their part, the Collinses proposed that the federal government should award a “National Medal of Motherhood” to women who birth six or more children. The award reminds one of the “Ehrenkreuz der Deutschen Mutter,” or the Cross of Honor of the German Mother, a Nazi prize given to mothers of four or more children. That medal took the form of a blue cross with a swastika in the center.Conspicuously absent from these proposals are any measures to address what actual American mothers describe as their urgent needs: namely paid family leave, affordable childcare or measures to address America’s soaring maternal mortality rate. That’s because the pro-natalist movement, for all its proponents’ insistence on the supposed demographic emergency facing the United States, is not really interested in making parenting easier or less burdensome for women. It is not interested in making children more affordable, or making them healthier.It is not interested in making pregnancy safer, or in making childrearing less damaging to women’s careers. It is not interested in these because all of these pursuits are in fact antithetical to the movement’s real agenda, which is to encourage primarily white births, to enforce regressive, highly hierarchal and stratified social roles, to push women out of the public sphere and to narrow women’s prospects for social, professional and intellectual life to little more than pregnancy, childbirth, childrearing and housekeeping – or, as the Collinses might put it, “Kinder, Küche, Kirche.”Despite the extreme anti-woman bigotry and regressive gender politics of the pro-natalist movement, American liberals have been hesitant to combat the right’s embrace of pro-natalism on cultural grounds. Eager to overcorrect for the perceived excesses of the social movements of the 2010s – and seeing little downside in antagonizing an American feminist movement that has endured near-fatal blows in both politics and popularity over the past decade – several prominent liberals have chosen to join the pro-natalist chorus, using their platforms at outlets likeVox,the Atlantic,the New Yorker,the Point, and theUniversity of Chicagoto call for the left to join in the pro-breeding cause. Even the most pointed of the mainstream liberal critics tend to concede cultural ground, arguing that American women want babies (as, it is assumed, they should) but cannot afford them.This is shortsighted: it cedes the pro-natalist’s biggest point, which is in dictating what kind of life American women should want – and be enabled – to have.In their rush to affirm that American women should be tricked or coerced into having more babies – or encouraged in doing so with an expanded welfare state – these thinkers are abandoning the crucial point: that women should be able, free and encouraged to live lives that do not conform to regressive notions of women’s proper roles as wives and mothers, that they should be free to invent themselves on their own terms – including as permanently childless adults. This is not, as the pro-natalists would have it, an abandonment of their biological duty – and it is not, as their liberal sympathizers would say, an example of cultural decadence.It is instead a matter of personal liberty – something that some of us, at least, still believe in for women, too.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist.Explore more on these topicsWomenOpinionParents and parentingPregnancyFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

In the widely shared video clip, it was hardly audible. The morning after, Francis died, and Vance jetted to visit India, finding time totweetthat his heart went out to the millions of Christians who loved Francis (implying, I suppose, that not all Catholics loved him) and patronizing the dead pontiff by calling one of his homilies “really quite beautiful”).Francis had been as outspoken as could be without naming names, when he criticized Vance in his February letter to US bishops; but he was not just registeringhis rebukeof Trump and Vance’s cruel treatment of refugees and migrants; he was reacting to a broader trend of instrumentalizing religion for nationalist and authoritarian populism.In February, Vance had an online “close-quarters street fight” with Rory Stewart, the former UK Conservative minister, diplomat and nowprofessor in the practice of grand strategyat the very university from which Vance obtained his law degree. At issue was what to most of us wouldn’t seem an obvious source of social media outrage: the correct reading of St Augustine’s notion ofordo amoris, the right ordering of love.Look to his stand on Gaza: Pope Francis gave us moral leadership in amoral times | Owen JonesRead moreIn January, Vance had alluded to the concept in aninterview with the Trump courtier Sean Hannity; according to the Catholic convert, it was a “Christian concept” that love and compassion start with family, then extend to neighbors, then nation, and, last and least, reach fellow human beings as such.Stewart had registered skepticism,observingthat Vance’s stance was “a bizarre take on John 15:12-13 – less Christian and more pagan tribal. We should start worrying when politicians become theologians, assume to speak for Jesus, and tell us in which order to love.” The infamously very online Vance hit back with: “Just google ‘ordo amoris’.” In typically snarky fashion, Vance thenquestioned Stewart’s IQand added that “false arrogance” of the Stewart type “drives so much elite failure over the last 40 years” (never mind what would constitute appropriate or correct arrogance).As plenty of learned observers remarked at the time, complex theological questions will not have bumper-sticker-size answers. But eventually a figure not entirely irrelevant for Catholics weighed in with a view that perhaps carries indeed more weight than those of others. Francis, in aletter to US bishops, instructed the flock that “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups. In other words: the human person is not a mere individual, relatively expansive, with some philanthropic feelings!”Vance is not the only far-right populist who has smuggled nationalism into what he touts as the correct notion of ChristianityHe added, driving home the rebuke without naming names, that “the trueordo amoristhat must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the ‘Good Samaritan’ … that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.” Apparently,Cardinal Pietro Parolin was dispatchedon Saturday to explain all this to Vance again.Vance is not the only far-right populist who has smuggled nationalism into what he touts as the correct notion of Christianity. Viktor Orbán, a great model for Vance and other self-declared US “post-liberals” (meaning: anti-liberals), has been declaring for years that a proper understanding of “Christian Democracy” is not only “illiberal”, but nationalist.That would have been news to the many Catholics who experienced nation-building projects in Germany and Italy during the 19th century as outright oppressive. After all, Catholics were suspected of putting loyalty to Rome ahead of civic duties (a suspicion still very much alive in the US when JFK ran for office). Bismarck started theKulturkampf(the original meaning of culture war) against Catholics in the 1870s; the Vatican forbade the faithful to participate in the political life of unified Italy.Far-right populists claim that only they represent what they call “the real people”. Of course, they have to explain who “the real people” are (and, who by contrast, does not truly belong). Many have instrumentalized Christianity for that purpose. Giorgia Meloni, in herautobiography, states: “The Christian identity can be secular rather than religious.” What matters is not believing (let alone actual Christian conduct), but onlybelonging. It’s what the social scientist Rogers Brubaker has called “Christianism”, in contrast with actual Christianity.Some far-right populists have tried to square their Catholicism with their populism by criticizing the hierarchy as a somehow illegitimate, or at least hypocritical, elite. Italy’sMatteo Salvini, who likes to flaunt the Bible and a rosary when riling up the masses of “real” Italians, pioneered this move; Vance copied it when he insinuated that there was something corrupt about church leadership; concretely he had accused US bishops of resettling “illegal immigrants” in order to obtain federal funds (an accusation deemed “very nasty” by Cardinal Timothy Dolan).The point is not that the correct understanding of Catholicism (orChristian Democratic political parties, as they have existed in Europe and Chile) has always been liberal; that’s hardly plausible. The point is that Francis reaffirmed that Catholicism is not compatible with the “America first” (and humanity last) view of the Trumpists.Jan-Werner Müller is a Guardian US columnist and a professor of politics at Princeton UniversityExplore more on these topicsPope FrancisOpinionUS politicsJD VanceCatholicismChristianityRory StewartThe papacycommentShareReuse this content"

I do it because the March 1966 ballot, which was for men born between January and June 1946, includes my dad’s birthday. He was picked and hefought in Vietnam, arriving just before the Tet Offensive in 1968.Not only is my dad’s birth date in that March 1966 ballot; so is mine. And that chills me.It’s part of why I revere the Australian War Memorial as a sacred place – it’s hard not to when you’ve stood beside your dad as he pointed to the names of those he knew on the Roll of Honour.It is why I have no qualms in saying I hate the AWM’s lackof commemoration of the frontier wars, and deeply despise the $500m spent turning it into a “Disneyland of war”.1:47Voting 101: Don’t be an ass! Donkey votes are still valid! - videoIt’s also why I have deep contempt for a party using the days beforeAnzac Dayto announce a jingoistic $21bn in defence spending and which talks about putting us on a “war footing”. But it is mostly about very expensive, redundant toys.I also ask the question that is often linked to Anzac Day: what are we defending? What are these values we hear soldiers sacrificed their lives for? And are our politicians brave enough to propose policies that reinforce and deliver those values?Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterIs it a society where the unemployed live in poverty while the Reserve Bank believes there needs to be about 4.5% of the labour force without a job to keep inflation stable, and yet jobseeker is about 38% below the poverty line?If the graph does not display, click hereIs that Australia’s“fair go”?Excuse my cynicism, but after 25 years of the same housing policies, could Australian leaders try something else? | Greg JerichoRead moreWhat about our native flora and fauna? Is there anything more deserving of our protection?This month we were told thatthe Great Barrier Reefis near a tipping point for survival. Surely a political party proud of Australia would be making the loudest noise possible to get action on climate change. Instead, when asked last week about climate change, Coalition leader Peter Dutton meekly said, “the question is what we can do about it as a population of 27 million people?”What about decisions that affect our own shores? Is there any bravery there? No. Instead, the government and the opposition rushed through legislation to ensure salmon farms in Macquarie Harbour can continue even though the industry is almost certainly sentencing theMaugean skate to extinction.Neither party showed any bravery failing to stand up to foreign companies that employ few workers and which pay negligible amounts of tax.If the graph does not display, click hereDutton at least has been brave enough to be the first leader of the Liberal party to admit we don’t have a shortage of gas – something the ALP doesn’t admit.If the graph does not display, click hereBut there is no bravery from either party about higher taxes on these mostly foreign-owned gas companies.

If that wasn’t a bad enough omen, the Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, Donald Trump’s acolyte and self-styled “Christian nationalist”, appeared to welcome the pope’s death as a sign of“evil” being “defeated”.In fact, despite a series of clashes with the Trump White House, Francis was no liberal. While refraining from judging homosexuality, he explicitly disapproved of the liberalising synodal path embarked on by theCatholic church in Germany, which ruled in 2023 that church employees could not be sacked for entering same-sex relationships or remarrying after divorce. On abortion, euthanasia, women and LGBTQ+ rights, Francis betrayed the high hopes that liberals and progressives had bestowed upon him.Liberals also had reason to be critical of the pope’s stance on Ukraine, where Francis appeared to sympathise with Russia’s narrative of the war, suggesting it was caused by, in his words, “Nato barking at the gates of Russia”. This didn’t make Francis unsympathetic to Ukrainian suffering. The pontiff, especially through the efforts of Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, tirelessly sought to mediate over the war’s humanitarian issues, starting with Russia’s allegedabduction of Ukrainian children, for which the international criminal court has issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin. But the pope’s political reading of the war – blaming Nato’s expansion, lambasting Europe’s rearmament, suggesting thatUkraine should surrenderand downplaying Russia’s imperial ambitions – were problematic.In this respect, the Argentina-born pope was unambiguously one of the global south’s most powerful voices, if not the most powerful. Francis was not only the first pope from Latin America, but the first non-European to lead the church since the Syrian-born Pope Gregory III in the eighth century. Francis’s scepticism of US foreign policy, sympathy towards Russia and criticism of consumerism and globalisation should be read in this light.But Francis was not just a powerful voice from the global south. He was a uniquely principled one as well. On the Middle East, and in particular Gaza, he was steadfast in his support for human rights and international law. What was so striking was not just his moral stance, but his unwavering solidarity with Palestinian suffering. Every evening, including as he became increasingly frail and ill, hecalled the only Catholic parishin the devastated Gaza Strip.More broadly, Francis stood for inter-faith dialogue, resetting Christian-Muslim relations after the strains caused by his predecessor, Benedict XVI. Francis engaged with Sunni leaders, with the first visit of a pontiff to the Gulf and the signing of adocument on human fraternityin 2019. His outreach extended to Shias, with hishistoric meetingin Najaf, Iraq with Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani in 2021.View image in fullscreenFilipino Catholics at a requiem mass at Manila Cathedral, 22 April 2025.Photograph: Lisa Marie David/ReutersFrancis made himself a pope of the global south also by speaking out forcefully on health, poverty, climate and migration. In his 2015 encyclical,LaudatoSi’, Francis elevated climate and environmental protection to the same level as social justice in the Vatican’s doctrine. During the Covid-19 pandemic, his address in a creepily empty St Peter’s Square will remain ingrained in the hearts and minds of hundreds of millions of followers. As the son of migrants and a spokesperson of the left behind, Francis was scathing in his criticism of Fortress Europe. His very first trip as pontiff was to the island of Lampedusa, in the Italian Mediterranean, wheretens of thousandsof people attempting to migrate to Europe have lost their lives.More recently, Francislambasted the inhumanityof Trump’s mass deportations, taking issue with Vance’s distortion of the Catholic principleordo amoris. Vance had suggested that compassion should be shown to one’s own family and compatriots before the rest of the world, and citedordo amorisas theological justification for what is a morally unjustifiable migration policy.Pope Francis brought an outsider’s eye to the papacy – even if healing the church’s divisions was beyond him | Catherine PepinsterRead moreFrancis spoke about issues close to the left behind. He did so by upholding a level of principle rarely, if ever, demonstrated, by leaders of the global north or, in fact, of the global south. Last week I was in Bandung, Indonesia, at a conference on the lessons of the very first Afro-Asian conference in 1955, at which 10 principles were agreed. Covering human rights, sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-aggression and the equality of races and peoples, the 10 Bandung principles inspired a new spirit of solidarity among formerly colonised countries.Today, that spirit seems lost. Countries in the global south rightly accuse the global north of hypocrisy and double standards. But they are often driven as much by transactionalism, populism, opportunism and self-interest as countries in the north. They are adamant about denouncing their adversaries’ violations of rights and the rule of law, but far more reluctant to do so when these are committed by friends. And they are extremely reluctant to take concrete action in defence of international law when it might harm their own interests.Francis was different. He was close to the causes of the global south but took an unquestionably principled stance towards them. He embodied the spirit of solidarity enshrined in the Bandung agreement – a spirit that is now in alarmingly short supply.When the 135 cardinals in the conclave meet in a few weeks to choose the next pontiff, there is good reason to believe that the apocalyptic direction of travel desired by the far-right Maga world will not come about.The Catholic church under Francis has changed significantly and several of the cardinals consideredpapabili(literally, “papable”) either come from the southern hemisphere or are close to the views that Francis embodied. Living up to Francis’s legacy as a principled voice of the global south will not be easy. But the world needs it more than ever.Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnistExplore more on these topicsPope FrancisOpinionCatholicismReligionThe papacyEuropeChristianitycommentShareReuse this content"

The Coalition’s braves are barracking for a $21bn increase in spending over the forward estimates to bring our national defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030.Dutton refuses to specify what Coalition’s $21bn of pledged defence spending would be used onRead moreThere is no courage in calling for increased spending. Lots of would-be experts do, even thoughonly a third of Australians agree.But it is clearly a bridge too far in the courage stakes to say where the money will come from. There are only three sources: increased taxation; cuts to existing programs or increased debt – or a combination of these.In a political climate that favours the path of least resistance, no one is going to advocate tax increases. So, what about cutting aged care, veterans’ services, health, education and social security support? Good luck with that.So just kick the $21bn to the future and let the kids worry about it. They’ll really appreciate that.Increased defence spending is just another way of throwing up our hands, refusing to deal with the present (which is tricky enough), and displaying our inability to deal with the future (which is even trickier).In PPP terms, we are already theseventh-biggest defence spenderin the Asia-Pacific region and13th globally, which includes the Europeans.It is a kneejerk response to unsupported claims of a rapid increase in the threat of armed conflict, without the careful analysis of risk that is an intrinsic aspect of strategic assessment.Threat involves the intention to use armed force. Risk deals with probabilities. Is Australia really more threatened than, say, Taiwan, Pakistan, Finland or Poland – all of which spend less? Or are we conniving in a kind of strategic sleight of hand where our imagined military dependency on America necessitates going to war, whether our interests are engaged or not?To answer this question, the Coalition is proposing yet another national defence strategy to replaceLabor’s effortreleased just a year ago.Of course, much has changed in a year. For a start, the US president, Donald Trump, has discovered tariffs – with global economic malaise an immediate result. He has also abandoned Ukraine. He has designs on Greenland and the Panama canal and has suggested that Canada would make a lovely 51st state.Like Labor’s 2023Defence Strategic Review, the Coalition’s offering will be prepared by leading “nationally recognised figures” (code for ideologically aligned confidants) rather than “bureaucrats”. Given the Coalition’s exposure to bureaucrats in its design of the illegal Robodebt program which brutalised social security recipients, this is perhaps unsurprising.The Coalition’s media release reiterated the promise of a fourth squadron of F-35 joint strike fighters. But it failed even to mentionAukus, the Morrison government’s vanity and fantasy project that is now a bipartisan frolic. Apart from shadow ministerial references to more money to be spent on infrastructure in Western Australia – essentially for American submarines, but there we are – there is as yet no hint of how the Coalition is planning for the inevitable collapse of the Aukus submarine proposal.Let’s be clear: Australia needs submarines. We needed them in the 1980s, when Kim Beazley instituted the Collins program, and we need them now. The indecision and mismanagement that has generated what may well be one of the most serious capability gaps Australia has ever faced needs to be fixed now.It is time for a fundamental rethink of an achievable pathway from clapped-out Collins-class submarines to vessels that meet Australian, rather than American, defence needs. This would be an inordinately difficult task, bringing together military, industrial, educational and training, financial, personnel and organisational challenges of a complexity we have never before confronted – much less solved.Whoever wins government will have to address them. If the Coalition is serious about national defence, it has to move on from an impossible dream to a practical and realisable defence policy with the full range of capabilities to handle the unlikely chance of a direct attack on Australia. The Coalition’s approach to national defence fails this test at the first hurdle.Allan Behm is a special adviser and director of the international and security affairs program at the Australia Institute in CanberraExplore more on these topicsAustralian militaryOpinionAustralian foreign policyAukusAustralian election 2025CoalitionAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Me too. Only, for the past week, it’s not my WhatsApp, email or social media I’ve been desperate to check, but how many moose have managed to swim across the Ångerman river overnight.I know. I need more going on in my life, right? How else to explain my fascination with watching dozens of Swedish moose (yes, moose is the plural of moose, sadly not “meese”) undertake theirannual spring migrationto summer pastures?Except, it’s not just me. Last year, the 24-hour online live stream – which sees Sweden’s national broadcaster SVT deploy 12 miles of cable and 34 cameras along the route these animals have taken since the ice age – was viewed by 9 million people, compared with under a million when it first aired in 2019.Watching television was always supposed to be relaxing but rarely is these days. I doubt anyone was blissed out in front of Adolescence,and even reality shows such as my belovedMarried at First Sight Australiaare made for shouting at the screen (“Am I the only one who can see that he’s gaslighting her? HELLO?”).View image in fullscreenStaff of Swedish TV station SVT working on The Great Moose Migration livestream near Junsele, Sweden.Photograph: SVT/APSlow TV – a marathon event, shown in real time, in its entirety – is filling that gap and helping us unwind. There is no music, no script, no narration, no editing. The moose don’t know they are being watched (or, indeed, written about in the Guardian).The genre began in Norway in 2009, with a seven-hour broadcast of a train journey between Bergen and Oslo, which was viewed by 1 million people. Otherslow TV successeshave included 12 hours of knitting and afive-day boat journeythat was watched by half the population. In 2015, BBC Four broadcast atwo-hour barge tripdown the Kennet and Avon canal, doubling the channel’s usual viewing figures. For those of us craving a gentler pace of life, slow TV is a balm.It is why the BBC’sMortimer and Whitehouse: Gone Fishingattracts an average 1.3 million viewers and has been nominated for several Baftas, despite being little more than two ageing men sitting on the riverbank. And why Springwatchoccupies a primetime slot on BBC Two for several nights a week from May onwards, when millions of us tune in to watch nesting birds and badgers in their setts. Wookey Hole Caves in Somerset has a “cheese cam” for watching its wheels of cheese age in real time (ie at a speed when changes are not visible to the naked eye).As well as the moose migration, currently open on my laptop tabs is the Somerset Wildlife Trust’sbarn owl cam, which livestreams the arrival of owlets. And a “fish doorbell” in the Dutchcity of Utrechtwhere, should a fish appear in the murky green water, you press a button to allow them through a river lock (after more time than I care to admit, I’m yet to see a single perch). A camera beside a watering hole in theNamib desertattracts the odd visiting crow and was being watched live by 600 people when I randomly tuned in.It turns out you’re never too old to go Interrailing around Europe | Phil MongredienRead moreEven in the moments when you’re not watching, keeping these live streams running in the background means your work, or life admin, is accompanied by nature’s relaxing soundtrack. The moose migration is mostly birds tweeting, waterfowl honking and water flowing. And the scenery! Snowy riverbanks, pale sunlight pouring through spruce and pine forests, wild geese and swans gliding across fjords. It’s magical – and good job, because there are fewer sightings of actual moose than you might imagine from amoose live stream. Hours can pass without a glimpse, but it’s worth it when you spot a furry creature meandering peacefully through the trees or soundlessly swimming. However bad your own day, it’s soothing to know that, somewhere in Sweden, a moose is living its best life.That’s not to say there aren’t heart-stopping moments: when the river current was particularly strong, I momentarily thought the sound of whooshing water was coming from my own kitchen. Not to mention the discovery that the on-screen counter, tracking how many animals have crossed the river, had jumped from 46 to 54 while I wasn’t paying attention. Blink and you’ll moose it.Yet it’s weirdly gripping, waiting for something to happen. A total contrast to opening a social-media app on your phone, where you know something will be happening and will probably make you feel inadequate by comparison. Slow TV is the antidote to doomscrolling for the social-media generation. But, worry not, there are opportunities for connection, too. The moose migration live stream also has a chat function where excited followers debate how many will make the river crossing and (if my translation skills are up to scratch) chat about knitting, while waiting for something to occur.

Starmer can prove him wrongRafael BehrLabour must deliver the green transition voters want, leaving Reform and the Tories on the side of economic decline and dictatorsWed 23 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 06.35 EDTShareWhich former British prime minister described the climate emergency as “a clock ticking to the furious rhythm of hundreds of billions of pistons and turbines and furnaces and engines … quilting the Earth in an invisible and suffocating blanket of CO2”?The florid style gives it away. You’d guess Boris Johnson even if you’d forgotten that the master of Brexit bombast also had a sideline in net zero evangelism. It wasn’t the most memorable part of his repertoire and it didn’t catch on as a Conservative catechism.Subsequent Tory leaders abandoned Johnson’s rhetorical urgency over carbon emissions and repudiated Theresa May’s targets for cutting them. Kemi Badenoch acknowledges that the science of global heating is real but only as an afterthought, once she has finishedcomplaining about the costsof a green transition and the improbable timetable set to achieve it.As in most matters, the Tories are flattering Nigel Farage with pale policy imitation. The Reform UK leadercalls net zero“lunacy” that destroys jobs and drives up household bills. Reform’s policy is to scrap carbon targets entirely and tax renewables.Farage needs a vehicle for economic and cultural grievance to replace his old anti-European bandwagon. It served him so well but was immobilised in multiple collisions with reality. He wants climate-scepticism to be his second crusade, rallying demoralised, alienated voters against arrogant metropolitan elites. “This could be the next Brexit, where parliament is so hopelessly out of touch with the country,” the Reform leadersaid over the weekend. (He seems to have dropped an earlier demand for a referendum on net zero.)The Tories are too beaten, too drained of intellectual autonomy, to do anything but tag along behind Reform.Labouris not immune to the same paralysing anxiety – the fear that Farage, despite his public school pedigree and City trader swagger, has an uncanny way with working-class voters.It doesn’t help that the rightwing press amplify Reform’s campaigns and caricature Ed Miliband, energy secretary, as a zealous crank. In the ever-seething stew of Labour factionalism it isn’t hard to find MPs who use Miliband’s name as a byword for electoral liability. That resentment bubbles to the surface as media speculation that he might be removed at the next cabinet reshuffle, or that he should be.That isn’t the signal coming out of Downing Street. No one actually involved in writing or presenting government climate policy is preparing a U-turn in flight from Faragism. On the contrary, later this week, Keir Starmer will reaffirm his commitment to the renewable energy transition in a speech at an international summit in London, co-chaired by Miliband.It won’t be a green rhapsody in the key of Johnson. That isn’t the current prime minister’s style. Starmer’s case will be grounded in economic pragmatism and the national interest – investment in high-skilled, high-wage industries; ending the vulnerability of supply that pegs household bills to the coercive whim of Vladimir Putin; safe British jobs in secure British energy.If delivered well, it is a message with enough potential public resonance to box Reform on to the side of economic decline and dependence on dictators. Theevidence from opinion polls(supported by accounts from focus groups that test these issues) suggests that climate scepticism is not the Brexit sequel craved by Farage.Opposition to the government’s net zero target is a minority position across every segment of the electorate. Even Reform and Conservative voters are more likely to say that green investment will have a positive impact – growing the economy and reducing the cost of living – than the opposite.Anxiety about climate change is not confined to places that voted to remain in the EU. In one survey by research organisation More in Common, 68% of Farage’s constituents in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, declared themselves “somewhat” or “very” worried about the issue.There are places where net zero is universally despised, but they are online. In those radical rightwing digital arenas, climate consciousness is the stuff of woke activism, a badge of culture-war villainy worn alongside gender-neutral pronouns. Those digital silos, skewed by their fanatical American conservative audience (and, in the case of Elon Musk’s X, a maniacal American proprietor) seethe with conspiracy theories and denial of climate science. Party leaders and prominent commentators of the British right who play to that crowd are pulling away from the mainstream position in their domestic political market.There are still plenty of hazards for the government navigating a complex energy transition. There is a way to sell the long-term goal as a happy alignment of future prosperity and cleaner living, but there are still upfront costs and tricky trade-offs.One cautionary tale is a notoriously botched German scheme to phase out gas boilers. Households were spooked by the cost of heat pumps and, despite promised subsidies, the backlash helped bring down Olaf Scholz’s ruling coalition. The main beneficiary was the far-right Alternative für Deutschland.Another instructive episode is the July 2023 Uxbridge byelection,which the Tories wonin defiance of national polling trends. The result was credited to a Conservative campaign targeting London mayor Sadiq Khan’s plans to extend congestion charging to the capital’s outer suburbs.But two years on, the lessons from that tale are not so clear-cut. Rishi Sunak thought he had found a template for attacking Labour as a party of anti-motorist ecowarriors. But when he tried to scale the message up into a new policy direction he was pilloried for reneging on Britain’s international climate commitments. Uxbridge wasover-interpreted in Westminster, held up as a distorting lens that continues to warp conversations about environmental regulation. The seat flipped to Labour in the general election a year later.That is worth remembering if, as seems likely,Reform does wellin council elections and theRuncorn byelectionnext month. Farage will want the results to prove that his fossil-fuelled bandwagon is on the roll. Tory climate-sceptics will eagerly jump aboard even if the true motivations of voters are messy and hard to untangle. They usually are.There will be calls for Starmer to fend off the radical right with concessions to Reform’s agenda. Yielding to that temptation is a mistake. The tributes go unappreciated by their target audience. They land instead like a slap in the faces of long-suffering Labour supporters who had hoped the era of coddling Farage would end once the Tories were evicted from power.It doesn’t take too many demoralised liberal-left voters in marginal seats switching to the Liberal Democrats, Greens or Scottish National party to put new obstacles on the road to a second Starmer term. Allegiances that have been frayed by cuts to benefits, overseas aid and other sundry disappointments would be irretrievably severed in a retreat from climate commitments.Leaning into the green transition slows that decay in morale. It draws a clarifying line between the Starmer project and an axis of Tory-Reform climate defeatism. Deftly argued, it is a way to position the prime minister on the side of optimism, mainstream British opinion, resilience in an uncertain world and clean air. His opponents can have Putin, Donald Trump and pollution on their team. It is the smart move in terms of electoral strategy. It happens also to be the right thing to do.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionLabourReform UKConservativesClimate crisisGreen politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Will I finally see the Finland I dreamed of?Mike WatsonMy adopted home has been a dark place of late. But in last week’s local elections, voters turned against cruel politics – and raised hopes of a more progressive futureWed 23 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 11.52 EDTShareThe Finns say “spring comes in swinging” – when winter gives way to spring, and green shoots meet the final flurries of snow, often well into April. In Finnish politics, too, some hope is beginning to emerge after a long, dark winter.In municipal, regional and mayoral elections held across the country last week, rightwing populist parties were roundly defeated, while parties on the left gained ground. In particular, the far-right Finns party saw its vote share collapse, from20% in the general electionof 2023to as low as 7.6%now. This leaves the coalition government of which it forms a part severely weakened and the centre-left Social Democratic party (SDP) with the biggest vote share nationwide (23%). When the Finns party leader, Riikka Purra, admitted defeat on results night, she complained that apunainen aalto, a “red wave”, had swept the country.The difference between now and the end of last year is like day and night. Back then, I was beginning to wonderwhy I had moved to Finland. It was dark and cold, and “the most rightwing government” the country has ever seen was working hard to slash public spending and immigration. It felt as though the reality of my adopted home couldn’t be further from the rose-tinted accounts I often read in the media, which spoke of “the happiest nation on Earth”, a welfare paradise that is the envy of progressives across the west.You might ask what has changed since winter. In short, Antti Lindtman’s SDP, along with Minja Koskela’s the Left Alliance and Sofia Virta’s the Green League, campaigned as if these elections were a referendum on the governing coalition’s austerity measures. “The number one issue is health and social care,” Koskela told me during her campaign. “People are worried about services moving further away from them, about the accessibility and quality of these services.” Already, qualified workers werethreatening to leavethe country in the face of the government’s cruel tightening of visa rules. With welfare cut and thecost of living soaring, perhaps it is no wonder there has been a backlash from voters.A direct, open account of the effects of poverty has characterised this election and the approach of some left candidates.Take Alma Tuuva, who won a council seat after pledging to deliver free transport, promotion of the arts and healthcare for transgender people in Helsinki. She is better known to many voters as “pikakahvimemegirl”, an Instagram account with 40,000 followers that posts memes riffing drily about poverty, women’s rights and public spending. In an interview with the Helsinki newspaperKansan Uutiset, Tuuva said: “We, the poor, need support and an easier everyday life so that we can improve our own situation. This reduces exclusion and prevents the escalation of problems.”View image in fullscreenAntti Lindtman, leader of Finland’s Social Democratic party, celebrates success in municipal elections, 13 April 2025.Photograph: Kimmo Brandt/EPAOf course, it’s still early days: a few local election wins do not make for a progressive future and the next general election could be as late as 2027. It seems the brunt of dissatisfaction at the coalition government was borne by its junior partner, the Finns party; the leading party, Petteri Orpo’s National Coalition party, actually gained 0.5% overall. Perhaps the culture wars-style rhetoric of the Finns party is on its way out, but the party itself will regroup, and its voters tend to turn out in bigger numbers for general elections. What kind of country might Finland therefore become? It’s hard to say, given that Lindtmanhas signalled his opennessto forming coalitions with the centre right. Perhaps we await something more akin to Starmerism than a full leftist tilt.One place I find reassurance is in the stoicism I see in the Finns. TheEU’s recent issuingof emergency guidance for its citizens in the event of war reportedly caused panic. Yet as I recall, whensimilar advicewas published here last autumn, the Finns didn’t bat an eyelid. I think it comes from their decades of preparedness for conflict with the Russians. I’ve noticed that most Finnish towns tend to have oversized underground car parks that are clearly designed todouble as bomb shelters.Goodbye Lenin: Finnish museum reinvents itself in response to shifting relations with RussiaRead moreHowever, shortly after moving toFinlandin 2018, I noticed that late at night, after several drinks, Finns would often lower their voices to a hush and speak of “the threat from Putin”. I first believed this to be the product of generational trauma, given Finland’s history of invasion by Russia. It did not occur to me then that the Finnish assessment of the threat was accurate and that Europe (certainly Ukraine) was indeed at risk from its neighbour.Unlike certain other leaders across Europe, who have expressed support oreven admirationfor Vladimir Putin, even Finland’s far-right parties haverushed to distance themselvesfrom Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. This is, after all, a country that recognises the dangers posed by autocratic leaders. Perhaps, then, Finland has this to teach the rest of the world: that cuts to welfare and public spending are popular until they hit voters in their pockets; that genuinely progressive policies appeal to voters tired of austerity; and that there is value in standing up to tyrants.Perhaps if social democrats build upon these lessons, we would finally see spring begin to break out acrossEurope. But for now, I dare to believe that I see the first shoots of recovery in this country I have grown to respect.Mike Watson is a media and art theorist and educator born in the UK and based in Finland.

We do know that his heritage is meaningful to himTue 22 Apr 2025 21.50 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 00.19 EDTShareSome observers were surprised at the depth of emotion thatAnthony Albanese showedwhen delivering his statement responding to the death of Pope Francis. The status of Australia’s prime minister as “mourner-in-chief” is now well established but at this time of the year it is normally displayed in a rather different context – the Anzac Day ceremony.Albanese was mourning a foreign head of state but also a man recognised as a spiritual leader by Australia’s Catholics, who were a fifth of the population at the last census. We don’t know if Albanese marks that box on his census form. We do know, from things he had to say since the Pope’s death and from other statements over the years, that his Catholic heritage is meaningful to him.“I think what people do is they draw on who they are and certainly my Catholicism is just a part of me,” he said, after he took questions from journalists. And he repeated a comment he has made often over the years: that his mother raised him in three great faiths, the Catholic church, theLabor partyand South Sydney football club, or the Rabbitohs. What seems to have begun as an amusing quip seems to have solidified into a more serious statement of personal identity. It evokes belonging, even a kind of tribalism.2:32From heartwarming to hilarious: Pope Francis’s most memorable moments – videoIt is also tied up in the wider story that Albanese tells about where he came from and who he is. His mother, Maryanne, has always been central to that story but there is also his Italian father, Carlo, a ship’s steward. The story young Anthony heard was that his father had died in a car accident soon after marrying his mother. Eventually, Anthony learnt from his mother that there was no marriage and no car accident. At a time, and in a religious tradition, where such things still mattered, Maryanne had given birth out of wedlock. Anthony finally met Carlo in 2009 on a visit to Italy, and stayed in touch until his death in 2014.Perhaps Albanese’s emotion was connected with this wider story. Australian Catholicism could be punitive and unforgiving, especially to single mothers, but Francis was a man whosaid it was a religion for the poor and oppressed. The church needed its teachings and its truths but it should not devote itself to judging the lives of others. His was a generous and expansive vision of the faith, one of compassion, humility and justice. It is little wonder that global reaction to his death recalls that of another pope with the common touch, John XXIII, in 1963, the year of Albanese’s birth.Look to his stand on Gaza: Pope Francis gave us moral leadership in amoral times | Owen JonesRead moreThe social justice tradition within the Catholic church – expressed most famously in Pope Leo XIII’s 1891 encyclical, Rerum Novarum, on the “rights and duties of capital and labour” – was one of the forces that led to Catholics gravitating to the party that Albanese would come to lead. Another was that Catholics were disproportionately working class. But Labor’s collectivist ideology and tight discipline chimed with the Catholic stress on community. Protestants, in their elevation of the individual conscience, could find themselves alienated by Labor’s expectation that individuals would sometimes cast aside their judgments and beliefs for the sake of solidarity.The result was a broad alignment of Labor withCatholicismand Liberal with Protestantism. As a working-class party, Labor still naturally attracted many Protestants as voters and parliamentarians, but it was disproportionately Catholic at least until 1955. The Liberal party and its predecessors attracted Catholic voters – and the United Australia Party in the 1930s even had a Catholic prime minister in Labor renegade, Joseph Lyons – but Catholics were hard to find in Menzies’ postwar Liberal Party. “Be careful, boys. Here comes the Papist”, Robert Menzies would joke of John Cramer, the lone Catholic in his ministry. But unlike many Liberal activists in the party’s branches, Menzies himself would have been happy enough to have more in the parliament.The Protestant-Catholic divide now seems remote from present-day Australia, in which the number of people professing no religion at all rivals the number calling themselves Christian. But sectarian feeling was high in the 1950s and contributed to a split in the Labor party that led to many Catholics departing, some of them forming the breakaway Democratic Labor party. Catholic support for the Liberals, even Catholic prime ministers and premiers, would in time become normal; Tony Abbott trained for a time as a priest in the 1980s, Malcolm Turnbull was a Catholic convert, and Peter Dutton, like Albanese, identifies as Catholic. Catholics today can be found in all major parties.Albanese’s evocation of a Catholic tribalism in his “three faiths” quip harks back to an earlier Australia. But his claim to a share in the broader cultural and political influence of Catholicism onAustralian politicsand society is thoroughly modern. He does not appear to be a regular churchgoer. He is not a “practising Catholic”, we would once have said.Rather he is what is sometimes called a “cultural Catholic”. When I first heard that term in the mid-1980s I assumed that it was a handy euphemism for not going to church. Almost 40 years on I can see that it is more meaningful.It is the impulse that might move an Australian prime minister to the brink of tears on the death of a pope.Frank Bongiorno is a professor of history at the Australian National UniversityExplore more on these topicsCatholicismOpinionAnthony AlbaneseLabor partyAustralian politicsPope FrancisChristianityCoalitioncommentShareReuse this content"

A record number of female conductors will be at the podium – 15 – and the Last Night will be the first to feature an all-female lineup of conductor and soloists:Elim Chanwill conduct, with trumpeter Alison Balsom and sopranoLouise Alder, plus the evening will feature two world premieres, by 34-year-old French composer Camille Pepin, andRachel Portman, who was the first woman to win an Oscar for best original score, both making their Proms debuts.Also making herPromsdebut will be Claudia Winkleman, who, fully cloaked, will present a Traitors Prom featuring a mix of symphonic pop and classical music exploring timeless themes of intrigue, treachery and betrayal. Suzy Klein, the head of arts and classical music TV at the BBC, promised that the concert would evoke all the drama of the Highland castle where the hugely popular reality TV show takes place. There won’t be gameplay or interaction, she added, but “it is going to be shaped and curated as a dramatic evening. There’s so much music featured in the series that we wanted to take some of that and say to people, ‘Welcome to the world of classical music, you’re already listening to it and loving it without realising it!’” Winkleman will be joined by the BBC Scottish Symphony and the BBC Singers, with other guests and the full programme to be announced.

The intimacy of certain repertoire really lends itself to that kind of immersive listening,” he continued. “But the intention is not simply to put people to sleep for eight hours, although audiences can of course come and respond to the music in whatever way you want!” Blankets and pillows will however not be allowed into the Royal Albert Hall, the venue confirmed, nor will the seating be reconfigured.View image in fullscreenNight owl … organist Anna Lapwood at the Royal Albert Hall.Photograph: Sisi Burn/ BBC“The only time Lapwood gets to practice the RAH organ is usually between midnight and four in the morning, because it’s the only time when somebody isn’t getting in or getting out for another gig. She absolutely knows how to unleash energy at that time of the day!” added Klein.Among some notable anniversaries honoured this year, there will be a focus on the music of Shostakovich, who died in 1975, and a complete performance – only the second ever at the Proms – of his opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, with the chorus of the English National Opera. Proms regulars Aurora Orchestra will perform his fifth symphony by heart following a dramatic exploration of its troubled origins and meaning, andChineke!will celebrate their 10th birthday with guest conductor Simon Rattle leading the Black and ethnically diverse orchestra through a programme that includes Shostakovich’s 10th symphony.View image in fullscreenBirthday bows … Chineke! will return to the Proms.Photograph: Mark AllanRavel – born 150 years ago – features on the opening weekend: his Piano Concerto for the Left Hand will be played by Nicholas McCarthy, which will be the first time the concerto has been played at the Proms by a one-handed pianist since it was performed by the man it was composed for, Paul Wittgenstein, in 1932.Boulez, whose centenary is celebrated this year, features in three proms including a late-night one performed by the Ensemble intercontemporain (the group he founded), which places his modernist music alongside Luciano Berio’s, whose centenary it also is.Other international orchestras include the Royal Concertgebouw with their chief conductor designate Klaus Mäkelä, the Vienna Philharmonic, and the Budapest Festival Orchestra. Twenty-five proms will be televised – more than ever before, said Klein. “We had record breaking numbers last year, over 5m streams on BBC Sounds, and across TV and iPlayer we reached nearly 13 million people.”Proms star Elim Chan: ‘Being who you are is powerful.

He confirmed that the Last Night will end in its now traditional style, with Rule, Britannia among the closing pieces. “The Last Night always evokes strong opinions and discussion. There are some people for whom it’s a really important tradition, and there are some who say it’s now part of how they would like to celebrate in the summer,” he said. “Our job is to cater for as broad an audience as possible, but also to ask, how can we continue to develop this festival? What can we do differently? How can we introduce new music? And how can we over the course of 86 concerts make sure that there’s a real breadth of repertoire of artists?

Three teachers reveal allAmelia TaitWed 23 Apr 2025 10.48 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 12.21 EDTShareWhen English teacher Joe Scott used to sign homework planners, it was because students were in trouble. But things changed in January, when the Southampton-based secondary schoolteacher appeared in the latest series of the BBC reality showThe Traitors. Pupils started voluntarily pressing their planners into his hands – for autographs. “It felt funny,” says the 38-year-old. “It was such a juxtaposition.”Teachers have always gone on reality TV – but they haven’t always come off well. In 2001, a contestant on the second series of Big Brother wasfiredfrom her job at an east London girls’ school after her towel slipped on air. Six years later in 2007,parents complainedafter an American elementary school teacher missed 22 days of work to appear on The Bachelor. Just last year, a Canadian educator waslet goafter taking unauthorised leave to compete on Survivor.A pupil wrote a message on the whiteboard: ‘Seriously congratulations, we are all so proud of you, you D-list celebrity’Expulsions like these make for explosive headlines, but like Scott, many teachers do in fact return to the classroom after appearing on reality TV. What is it like to try to discipline teenagers after they’ve watched you lose a gameshow or snog a stranger?“I was mindful that I needed to act in a certain way because I knew my pupils would be watching,” says Scott, who was in teacher training and working at a placement school when he applied for The Traitors. Handily, the show’s shooting schedule coincided with the school holidays, but he says BBC rules dictated that police officers, medical professionals, prison workers and teachers had to inform their employers they were going on the show. He told the headteacher his plans.View image in fullscreen‘I only swore once’ … Joe Scott on The Traitors.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio Lambert“They were so supportive, they said it would be good to show the pupils that as teachers we do have a life outside the classroom,” Scott says. Nonetheless, the school wrote him a letter of dos and don’ts: don’t name the school, and definitely don’t name any pupils. Scott told himself not to swear during the show’s heated “round table” arguments – but naturally the one time a curse slipped out, it was aired. “I thought, ‘Oh, I’ve been so good! And that’s the bit that gets shown!’”Today, Scott is permanently employed at his placement school. Students only found out he was going to be on the show when the general public did – the school then sent an email to parents so they wouldn’t be shocked to see their child’s English teacher pop up on the telly. Almost immediately, Scott’s pupils went into “game mode”, dissecting the episodes after they aired. “As opposed to being like, ‘Oh my God sir, you’re on TV!’ it was more like, ‘Oh my God sir, do you not know Linda’s a traitor?’”Scott survived for 10 of the 12 episodes, but – perhaps overestimating how life-changing theprize moneywould be – students surmised that he couldn’t have won, or he wouldn’t still have been standing in front of them. Scott implemented a routine where he would take the register and allow pupils to ask questions about the show for a couple of minutes before he began teaching. He says this “outlet” was better than the “constant disruption” of questions popping up during class. “And then as it went on, they stopped asking. It was quite humbling. One of my classes, I said, ‘Right, any questions?’ and someone put their hand up and said, ‘Sir, is there a new seating plan?’”Unfortunately for Scott, the general public were a lot more vocal than his pupils. Tweets with thousands of likes branded him “one of the worst people to ever be on The Traitors”, while posters on Reddit objected to his “sneering, aggressive tone”. Some even claimed he couldn’t possibly be a good teacher.“It did affect my confidence at one point,” Scott says. “I know I’m not like that, but then you almost start believing what you’re reading.” Scott spoke with his headteacher as well as the BBC’s welfare team. He reminded himself that no students had ever complained about his conduct – and in fact, some became protective when they saw the online hate. “Because they all know me and my character, they know what people were saying wasn’t an accurate representation.”View image in fullscreen‘If anything, I felt like they were even more invested’ … Scott takes on a challenge.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertScott says the show hasn’t affected his ability to discipline his pupils. It’s easy to imagine an impish whippersnapper sneering, “Whatever, you lost The Traitors!” when being told off, but Scott says nothing like this has happened to him. In fact, he feels better able to command respect. “If anything, I felt like they were even more invested than usual, I held their attention even more. It seemed to go to my advantage.”Kai Fagan, a 26-year-old PE teacher in Milton Keynes, won the ninth season ofLove Islandin 2023. Although he quit his secondary school job to appear on the dating show, he resumed teaching at a different college in 2024. “I woke up really early because I was nervous, I was so anxious,” he says of his first day. “My students were shocked, but I just addressed it straight away.” Like Scott, Fagan offered the opportunity to ask questions. “But then I also made it clear exactly what I expected from running the lessons, to not be disrespectful.”During his time on Love Island, Fagan “coupled up” with five women and took part in so-called “raunchy” challenges; naturally, he was also frequently filmed with his top off. “None of the [students] have ever asked me about any of the challenges,” he says. “They just don’t care.” Fagan thinks this is partly because his students are all over 16 and are learning in a college environment where they are treated like adults. He also believes it’s because he is the same person, whether on TV, online or in the classroom. “If you show people exactly who you are and what you stand for, they can’t really laugh at you. They can only laugh if you’re completely different and you’re putting on a different persona.”Like Scott, Fagan reports no issues with discipline and even thinks his time on the show (and his work as an influencer) has engendered respect. Now, he can teach students about more than just PE. “I’m a massive advocate for social media. So if they have a passion, how can they differentiate themselves? If you want to be a football analyst, why don’t you do some football analysis on TikTok? If you want to become a football journalist, why don’t you do some match reviews?”View image in fullscreen‘Draining’ … Grace Elliott, right, and her sister on Hunted.Photograph: Channel 4/ShineWhile it’s hard to imagine reality TV experience benefiting, say, geography lessons, it’s easy to see how it might be useful in drama class. Scott teaches drama once a week and has been able to introduce games inspired by the show. Grace Elliott, a 27-year-old drama teacher based in Berkshire who appeared on the Channel 4 show Hunted in 2022, found benefits, too. “All the time in drama, we’re pushing students out of their comfort zones. That’s how we grow as performers,” she says. Whenever pupils seem reluctant to get up on stage, she has a ready retort. “I’m like, ‘Well, I went on telly for 16 days. I wasn’t in my comfort zone for any part of that at all!’”Contestants on Huntedhave to go on the run and evade being captured: “You don’t know when you’re next going to get a meal or water, or where you’re going to sleep, and it is mentally draining,” says Elliott. When the show came out, she was honest with her students about how challenging she found it as well as her previous experiences with ill mental health. She initially worried that pupils might think, “Oh, my teacher is not as strong as I thought she was,” but she now believes it was beneficial for them to see her overcoming low moments. And as a result, “Now I’m locked into Duke of Edinburgh for life!”When Elliott ultimately lost the show, a pupil wrote a sweet message on her whiteboard: “Seriously congratulations, we are all so proud of you, you D-list celebrity.” Her students even monitored social media so she didn’t have to, saying: “Don’t worry, we’ll keep an eye on all the comments for you and shut down any trolls.’” Mums and dads were positive too, congratulating her at parents’ evening.Elliott says it was a valuable experience for her pupils to see that she was a real person with her own life. “They can talk to you about things, they’ll open up to you about things, and that’s how they’ll learn from you,” she says. Although, as time goes by, younger cohorts don’t necessarily recognise her. Scott only appeared on TV two months ago, and already the students’ requests to autograph homework planners have stopped. “They don’t really mention it now,” he says. “It’s yesterday’s news. Back to normality.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionReality TVThe TraitorsLove IslandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

From pointless paintings to emotionless snapshots, the once-controversial award tiptoes too earnestly across the minefield of today’s culture warsWed 23 Apr 2025 09.16 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 09.18 EDTShareRemember when controversy was fun? If not, that’s because you’re too young. But back in the 1990s, my child, Britain got itself in hilarious knots about conceptual art, the readymade and whether a pickled shark or elephant dung can be art, with the Turner prize as battleground. It was a culture war but with laughs, because no one’s identity was at stake and it wasn’t likeBrian Sewellwas going to become prime minister and have Rachel Whiteread jailed.It is by embracing the earnestness of today’s high-stakes culture wars that theTurner prizehas lost its edge, the art getting more careful as the ideologies loom larger. This year’s shortlist is the soppiest yet. Two of the artists nominated are painters. Painters, I ask you! This makes some sense of the shortlist announcement taking place on JMW Turner’s 250th birthday. But as painters go, do Mohammed Sami and Zadie Xa (who also creates bland installations) compare with the boldness of Mr Turner? Neither is pushing back the boundaries of what a painting might be, or redefining this art for the 21st century in scale, freedom, audacity.View image in fullscreenPointless … Zadie Xa with Benito Mayor Vallejo, Moonlit Confessions Across Deep Sea Echoes: Your Ancestors Are Whales, and Earth Remembers Everything, 2025.Photograph: Danko Stjepanovic/Courtesy of Sharjah Art FoundatioI honestly don’t know why Xa has been shortlisted. She’s one of those artists whose mildly impressive but pointless work you see at every art fair and Biennial. Her figurative fantasy paintings framed by rambling, decorative installations mix up the myths of Vancouver and Korea, but the lack of rawness or shock or surprise is stultifying.Sami is in another league, and the quality artist on the shortlist. His large landscape paintings meditate on the horrors of war and agonies of enforced migration with a disconcerting poetry rooted in an impressionistic mistiness. You look at a blue sky over water, or trees above a rocky cliff, tenderly painted with whiffs of Monet and Cézanne, but then notice a refugee camp through the woods, or starbursts of ordnance in the Iraq sky.Surely he’s a shoo-in to get the Turner prize. He is not only the best artist on this list but a real international talent whose seriousness and subtlety are obvious. So why am I not more thrilled? I suppose because this is good for you. Sami is important but he’s not shocking. His art embraces skill instead of setting out to scandalise or create a new language. I would like it more if it had no moral value at all.So what about the non-painters? Will they provoke us with … balls of coloured paper and wool? That’s what Nnena Kalu makes, hanging her multicoloured tangles of streamers and strands in poetical arrangements. These craftily wrought sculptures won’t scare, or amaze, anyone. Kalu’s work has a familiar appearance, and that’s not just because she’s been doing this stuff for two decades before recently getting recognition. It’s because this kind of post-minimalist, found yet handworked sculpture has dried-out, attenuated roots in art movements that started way back in the 1960s. Nice, academic, dull.View image in fullscreenA shoo-in … installation view of Mohammed Sami’s After the Storm at Blenheim Palace, 2024.Photograph: Tom LindboeThe artist who makes most sense as a Turner candidate, even firing the old flames of raw controversial reality, is Rene Matić, whose photographs portray intimate moments with family and friends – and report on skinhead subculture. Sadly these close, fragmentary images don’t have great emotional pull on a stranger – it’s a bit like looking at someone else’s family snapshots. To make that work takes more flamboyance and poignancy than Matić shows. Rene’s not a laugh. Yet there’s something in their work that you don’t get from the others: a glimpse of life in Britain right now.I think this goes to the heart of this Turner shortlist’s fragility. It is determinedly globalist, reflecting a jury made up exclusively of curators who have shortlisted the kind of stuff they see all the time on the international circuit – Xa, for instance, has been shortlisted for work at the Sharjah Biennial, in the United Arab Emirates.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If Xa was a better artist this would be a more powerful gesture.But this shortlist’s lack of connection with the realities of contemporary Britain is just another way to dig the ailing Turner prize deeper into irrelevance and empty bourgeois ritual. This year’s exhibition will be in Bradford, far from the liberal elite metropolis this shortlist reeks of. So we’ll go to Bradford, applaud these right-minded artists, approve of art without borders and ignore the rising vote for Reform outside this introspective event.Obviously there’s good in all these artists but not enough to make the Turner matter again. Only one gives you a glimpse of what’s going on in the streets, as opposed to the Biennials. I hope they win.

Brice Itoua is the most skilled hunter in his village. But they kill the crocs to eat – not to sell’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 23 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 12.37 EDTShareThe Congo dwarf crocodile is a lovely species. They’re very shy and, unfortunately, very easy to find and catch. Mostly hunted for their bushmeat, these crocs only grow up to a few feet in length and during the dry season, they often spend the daytime hiding in burrows and dens at the water’s edge. Hunters use a long, woody liana vine with a hook on the end to drag them out, before binding their snout with a shorter vine and carrying them away.Last summer, I shot a story about the Congo dwarf crocodile after being given access to the Lake Télé Community Reserve by theWildlife Conservation Society(WCS), which manages this protected area in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with the Congolese government.The species is partly protected, but hunting is permitted to licensed locals within certain areas. The Lake Télé reserve employs rangers, referred to as eco-guards, who have stations on roads leading into the area. They are armed and trained to protect wildlife from poachers or those breaking the terms of their licence, and can search anyone they see coming through in a car or on a motorcycle. Often they seize dwarf crocodiles that are still alive, and release them back into the wild.Although their bite is unlikely to do serious damage, it can still inflict wounds that need stitchesOne of my photographs from this series shows an eco-guard transporting a group ofcrocodiles upriver in a boat. These had been retrieved from a poacher who had been hunting on a large scale and selling the meat on to traffickers who transported it away from local communities and into the major cities. The crocs still have their snouts tied until they are released back into the water as although their bite is unlikely to do serious damage, it can still inflict wounds that need stitches.The reserve management put me in touch with a group of hunters and I was taken to their village on a pirogue – a sort of dugout canoe. I stayed several days with them in the forest while they hunted. Spending time with people who have a very different life than mine is one of the things I most love about my job as a wildlife photojournalist. It’s amazing to sit by a campfire in the middle of the Congolese rainforest and exchange views and ideas with people who have lived their whole lives there. You learn so much.I rarely take portraits, but from the beginning of the project I had an image in mind of a hunter and his catch, and when we were out of the forest I took the time to set up a few shots. This is my favourite of those portraits because the hunter, Brice Itoua, has a particularly expressive face. He was the most skilled hunter in the group and I wanted him to have his hunting tools, the hook and the liana, in his hand. Brice seemed pretty happy with the picture, too; all the hunters got prints to hang in their homes.This isn’t how a hunter would typically carry a crocodile – they hang the crocs over their shoulder and walk through the rainforest wearing them like a backpack. But I wanted this photograph to be a portrait of the crocodile as well as Brice, so I had him hold it facing forwards. The intention was to show the hunters in a good light – these villagers hunt to eat, and even for some of the poachers across central Africa, hunting for bushmeat can be seen as the only way to make a living.For the WCS, it’s a matter of figuring out how much of a species is left and how to properly manage their numbers without completely stopping local traditions. It’s a fine line. Back in the 80s, a hunter would go out and kill maybe one forest antelope and one monkey. That would be enough to feed a family, and there was no impact on wildlife populations. But nowadays it could be five monkeys, six antelopes and two crocodiles, which are being caught not just to eat, but also to sell. That’s why the Congo is suffering from what experts call the empty forest syndrome, where many beautiful rainforest areas have become devoid of wildlife.View image in fullscreenThomas Nicolon’s CVBorn:1987, Agen, FranceTrained:Journalism school in Marseille, France, and self-taught in photographyInfluences:“Nicole Viloteau,Pascal Maitre,Thomas Peschak, Charlie Hamilton James, Christian Ziegler,Brent Stirton, Mattias Klum, and so many others.”High point:“Being awarded a National Geographic Society grant for a two-year project in northern Australia.”Low point:“Every time I put too much pressure on myself (that’s before every shoot).”Top tip:“Work on stories that you have fun shooting, look for topics you’re passionate about – the rest will follow.”Thomas Nicolonis shortlisted in the Professional competition of the Sony World Photography Awards 2025, exhibition atSomerset House, London,until 5 May.Worldphoto.orgExplore more on these topicsPhotographyMy best shotWildlifeSony world photography awardsAwards and prizesConservationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

From Mike Ashley’s son to a Tetra Pak heir, moneyed promoters explain their motivationsPhin JenningsWed 23 Apr 2025 06.46 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 11.26 EDTShareNestled between Millwall FC stadium and an intersection of southLondonrailway lines, the 350-capacity Venue MOT – once an actual MOT garage – is a cornerstone of the city’s underground music scene. But every Tuesday, owner Jan Mohammed gathers his staff at the bar and tells them how much money it has lost since the weekend.Mohammed, a sculptor, started renting a nearby space to use as a studio more than a decade ago. With no residential neighbours and relatively low costs, he opened Venue MOT in 2018 based on simple intuition: “I thought music could thrive here,” he says. Despite the losses and Mohammed calling his operation a “comedy of errors”, it does. Time Outrecently labelledVenue MOT the best nightclub in London and Jamie xxcalled it“one of the last places in London that feels genuinely free and DIY” after his 10-night residency last year with guests including Charli xcx and Daphni. Mohammed describes the club’s atmosphere as “DDS” – deep, dark and sweaty. Indomitable characters like him are the lifeblood of a financially unstable scene that must constantly adapt to licensing rules and urban redevelopment.But there is another side to London’s underground clubland: numerous promoters, including some who organise events in nightclubs such as Venue MOT, are from very wealthy backgrounds.Some of London’s most successful and longstanding dance brands were set up by highly privileged individuals: Krankbrother, known for its parties in Finsbury Park with headliners including Four Tet and Solomun, is run by Danny and Kieran Clancy, the sons of the late construction magnate Dermot Clancy. Blaise Bellville, founder of dance music livestreamers Boiler Room is English gentry: the Marlborough College-educated son of Lady Lucinda Wallop (though he has said he “didn’t have any money” growing up). Today, newer ventures include Figura, an ambitious new project founded last year and funded by Tetra Pak heir Magnus Rausing, and one of the latest people to hire out Venue MOT is Ollie Ashley, the son of billionaire Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley.Ollie Ashley’s last venture, the loss-making London-based online radio station Radar Radio, stopped operating in 2018 amida storm of allegationsincluding sexual harassment by station staff – Ashley himself wasn’t accused, but he did preside over a dysfunctional working environment and a station accused of cultural appropriation. (In a company statement at the time, Radar said “we don’t agree with all the opinions” made in the allegations, but said it was “capable of making mistakes” and apologised “to anybody who has felt unsafe or discriminated against”.)Ashley didn’t comment further, and has kept a fairly low profile since. But last year he launched a new club night, Virus, and his Venue MOT-hosted lineup in February included big names such as Hudson Mohawke, the night after he supported Justice at Alexandra Palace.View image in fullscreenInside Venue MOT.Photograph: Louis SartoriSome in the scene fear that monied promoters will pay over the odds for star DJs like these, leading to over-inflated markets that end up making the overall scene less sustainable. “If there’s more money, things get frothy, things become unreal, and it takes a long time for them to settle down afterwards,” says DJ, producer and promoter Rob Venning, who started putting on events in his home of Watford in 2013, and only made his first significant profit last year. “On a number of occasions, I didn’t break even,” he says, and had to make up the difference with his own savings.It’s made harder by the fact that clubbing, though an important part of British cultural life, is rarely supported by the kind of philanthropy that often props up visual art, theatre, opera or dance, nor does it tend to receive public funding. The cost of living crisis also hits clubs from both sides: their costs increaseandtheir audience’s propensity to go out goes down. “You expect young people to go out, but how many have the money and how often can they do it?” asks Mohammed.All of this contributes to an environment where those investing personal wealth can go a long way. It’s opened up a debate in the scene: are people like Ashley and Rausing buying their way into a grassroots culture? Or are they a new generation of arts patrons that could bring exciting opportunities?When I meet Ashley outside of the Virus headquarters in east London, I expect him to be terse and tight-lipped, but he’s friendly and candid. Tattooed on one of his arms is a black circle, covering up what was once the Radar Radio logo. On the other is a black square. It was a tattoo of underground dance label Night Slugs’ logo, he tells me, until he and label founder Bok Bok fell out. The latter wrote under an Instagram post about Virus: “That billionaire money at work again”.Virus is in the same building that once housed Radar, which now contains a number of recording studios that Ashley offers artists without payment, with recent guests including Skepta and Fred Again. Most artists who perform at Virus do so in exchange for studio time – so Ashley may not be driving up DJ fees, but this is a resource that very few others can offer. Despite his advantage over other promoters, Ashley says he wants to avoid going up against them: “We’re not trying to compete or discourage other promoters. That’s why we normally do pop-ups on odd days in the week like Tuesdays or Wednesdays and tend to announce events at the last minute.”Before Radar, Ashley worked at London radio stations Rinse FM and NTS and flyered for the legendary, now-defunctdubstep night FWD>>. He presents himself as an enthusiast who is proud to be funding this scene. “The whole nepo baby set should be doing stuff like this,” he says. “We should be putting our money and resources into things we’re passionate about and that make people happy.” He’s under no illusion about his privilege, but says he wants to use it to build something that “inspires young people to learn how to DJ, make music, throw a party, the same way parties like FWD>> did for me when I was 18”. He’s also hosted promoters including Genesys and Evian Christ’s Trance Party in his studios. “We’re actively trying to build community between promoters,” he says.View image in fullscreenI Jordan.Photograph: Marshall LawrenceDJ and producer I Jordan cancelled their Radar show in 2018. “We all benefited so much from it,” they say, “but at the same time there was this general lack of accountability and responsibility that often happens when people that come from wealth don’t think about the consequences of their actions.” (For his part, Ashley says he had “never run a company before, which isn’t an excuse. I was really trying my best, but I let people down. I’ve learned so much from it and if I could do it again I’d do nearly all of it differently.”)For Jordan, the unequal clubbing economy is part of a wider problem: “We all exist under exploitative, unethical capitalism.” They and their agent have to make a case-by-case decision on who to work with and what fee to take. Recently, they took a well-paid gig and spent the money on gender-affirming surgery; it wouldn’t be fair to ask DJs like Jordan to routinely resist the draw of wealthy bookers. But it’s worth asking, as Jordan does, “how can we redistribute that wealth or use that wealth in good ways?”Cyndi Anafo, who organises events with her husband Chris Ellis as the Handson Family, is happy to be a channel for wealth redistribution. For seven years, she’s been running free-to-attend events at Brixton Market, funded by its owner, property developer Taylor McWilliams. She’s glad to spend his money on organising nights that platform Black artists and pay them well, and believes that they give McWilliams something in return. “Wealthy people are currently on the back foot when it comes to their brand identity,” she says. “They want to make money – but their brands want to align with the good side.” So dance music can allow the rich to buy their way into a certain community, giving them cultural cachet.That’s not a deal that Rausing, the Tetra Pak heir who funds Figura, seems interested in making: “I don’t like loud music and I like being in bed early,” he says. But he knows enough about London’s nightlife to believe that there’s room for improvement. “I just want there to be a better experience out there. And for it to be just that, an experience. A place for people to get lost in the music, the production, and the people around.” He wants his financial support to allow Figura “to be a celebration of art, and nothing else”.This simple goal can be difficult for poorly funded promoters to achieve. Venning started his Watford events because he wanted to platform artists who might not be heard otherwise, but as his nights have grown to demand more of his time and money, he’s tempted to be more conservative in who he books, “and it’s an impulse I have to work against”.View image in fullscreenJohn Becker.Photograph: (PR)No such problem for Figura’s founder and chief executive, John Becker, who started his career at Berlin club Tresor before consulting for nightlife brands such as Boneca and Unleash. Back then, he repeatedly booked the same artists who he knew would do well. With Figura, Rausing’s support reduces the immediate financial pressure on the project, and gives Becker the freedom to programme more experimental events: next month’sSeeing in Dreamswill have boundary-pushing musicians including Andy Stott, Crystallmess and the Sun Ra Arkestra.Becker denies overpaying artists or competing unfairly with other promoters. He wants to position Figura not as a competitor but “a collaborator that tries to enable creative freedom, risk-taking and artist-first programming, rather than an arms race for booking fees”. Rausing’s funding, he says, instead allows him to encourage artists to work with them on less commercial projects and gigs. “We can take a bit more of a risk than others,” he says, “and maybe if we don’t exactly break even, that’s something we can cover”.Figura is also hosting a takeover from Accidental Meetings, an event series and label co-founded by Lucien Calkin, who also works at Venue MOT and runs free-thinking Bristol music festivalSaccade. Accidental Meetings started in Brighton, where Calkin spent his student bank account overdraft on organising events. It still uses the same bank account, and when we speak, it’s £1,000 in the red. “You’re constantly having to top it up yourself, and that’s made me quite skint in the last few years,” Calkin says. “It has to be a passion project.”View image in fullscreenBehind the decks at Venue MOT.Photograph: Louis SartoriIt’s unfair that grassroots promoters have to dip into modest savings and hope to break even, running events on hard-mode, while their better funded counterparts play a lower-stakes game. In the case of Ashley, his wealth might be seen to have helped him weather controversy.At the same time, the Rausing money that Calkin receives via Figura is useful – many of the best nights struggle to make a profit and it’s unrealistic to expect a scene to run solely on the passion that drives him, Mohammed and Venning. When I ask Mohammed and Calkin what the plan is for the next five years, they both laugh. “I don’t know what’s going on next week,” Mohammed tells me. “Because it’s so fragile, we’ve got no fucking clue,” says Calkin.Explore more on these topicsClub cultureClubbingDance musicElectronic musicLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Did my personal MySpace page have a nauseating Lisa-Frank-on-acid aesthetic with a mouse cursor that transformed into a unicorn spewing glitter when it moved? Absolutely. Did I have a Xanga page with cringe poetry that detailed things I wanted to do to Keanu Reeves while Such Great Heights played on a loop in the background? Of course my basic ass did.I think my internet sense of humour is rooted mainly in a deep, sincere love for bad music, which is any music that gives me a manic grin and makes me whisper to myself, “What the fuck … ” I need to know how these works of art got greenlit. I need to know why there are 17 lead vocal tracks on the Cadillac song (see below). I need to know if Nick Jonas practised AT ALL before going on stage at the CMAs. I need to know if the Christian music influencers know they are using a blaccent, or if they know a single Black person. Either way, the results are a gift to us all. Or a gift to me, anyway.1.

Cadillac – Every Now and ThenListen to this fucking production. There are five lead vocals. None of them are in tune. The melodies stretch OVER the bar and it’s unclear what time signature it’s in. The background vocals are LOUDER than the lead vocal. The drums are barely audible but definitely not in time. The bassline meanders aimlessly in what feels like an INVERSE groove. Then it randomly speeds up in the middle and goes back to its original tempo. I could listen to this on loop for hours and still discover something new every time.3.

There is the mystery, the ritual, the vestments; the spectacle of a lone, fragile human being poised over an abyss of history and good and evil; the elevation of one flawed man to a position of supreme authority, an exaltation whose parallel to the crucifixion is sensed but not acknowledged.Discussing the onscreen representation of the pope in Conclave would risk the blasphemy of spoilerism but there have been many popes on screen, some cheekily fictional, many factual. Many a heavyweight British thesp has turned in a gamey cameo as some hooded-eyed Renaissance pontiff. Peter O’Toole was the lizardly and capricious Paul III in TV’s The Tudors (2007), presiding over a simperingly submissive 16th-century court of cardinals. Jeremy Irons was a small-screen Alexander VI inThe Borgias(2011), a family member whose face radiated sensual refinement and hauteur.If the pope has to be a minor or supporting character, it is easier to play him as a baddie. Rex Harrison was a very stately and boring Julius II, the so-called Warrior Pope in Carol Reed’s The Agony and the Ecstasy (1965), always being shouted at by Charlton Heston’s Michelangelo while he is trying to get on with painting the Sistine Chapel ceiling.View image in fullscreenSensual refinement and hauteur … Jeremy Irons as Alexander VI and Lotte Verbeek as Giulia Farnese in The Borgias.Photograph: c Showtime/Everett/Rex FeatureIn the real world, the successor to the late Pope Francis will undoubtedly have seen a pope on film or TV, and seen the actor do the signature screen-pope moment: the camera follows behind, maybe in slow-mo as the cheering gets louder and, clad in his unfamiliar robes, he emerges for the first time on the balcony overlooking St Peter’s Square as the senior cardinal intones “Habemus Papam” – “We have a pope” – and introduces him by his chosen name. From the new pope’s POV, behind his head, we see the thousands of extras – or more likely CGI images. Pope Francis’s successor must do it for real.Jonathan Pryce’s wonderfully sympathetic, humorous performance in Fernando Meirelles’sThe Two Popes(2019) as Francis – or as he is for the most of the film Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio – must surely have set the tone for memories of the late pope, at least for the secular unbelieving world. Pryce’s future pontiff is discreet, frank, humble, yet troubled, with a demotic man-of-the-people touch which irritates and yet fascinates the incumbent pope, the intensely conservative Benedict XVI, played by Anthony Hopkins. Pryce’s screen Francis is a nice guy, without the flashes of temper that he is said to have shown in the real world, the Francis that thought it was all right to punch someone who insults your mother. When Benedict resigns, it is these two men who have to share the Holy See as the two popes. This unique double act allows the movie camera to explore a profound mystery – what is it like to be pope, to see the pope as the pope sees the pope? The movie shows one pope hearing confession from another.View image in fullscreenUnique double act … Anthony Hopkins as Pope Benedict XVI and Jonathan Pryce as Cardinal Bergoglio in The Two Popes.Photograph: Peter Mountain/APImportantly,The Two Popesstarts with Cardinal Bergoglio’s Michael Corleone moment. The movie imagines Bergoglio wanting to retire as Cardinal, to retreat from the politics and show of church power – which Benedict will not countenance. Similarly, Fiennes’s Cardinal Lawrence begins Conclave by wanting to resign as dean of the college of cardinals. This initial “resignation” impulse naturally signals the very real possibility or even certainty of becomingcapo di tutti capi. Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, confesses his terrible sins in Coppola’s The Godfather Part III to Cardinal Lamberto – a fictional character who, harrowed by Corleone’s crimes, later becomes an imagined version of Pope John Paul I, and fatefully looks into the Vatican’s corruption scandals like his real namesake. Anthony Quinn’s fictional pope in The Shoes of the Fisherman (1965) follows the same “Corleone” narrative path to the top.The unwilling or unworthy pope is a screen tradition. Poor John Paul I, who died so soon after his elevation, is an inspiration for Nanni Moretti’s We Have a Pope, in which Michel Piccoli plays the fictional Cardinal Melville, who finds the top job thrust upon him and succumbs to stage-fright. The film is very good at showing how, during the conclave, most Cardinals are obviously yearning not to have this terrible burden placed upon them.Movie history’s most outrageous reluctant pope is Robbie Coltrane’s David I, in Peter Richardson’s farcical comedy The Pope Must Die (1991) – widely re-titled as The Pope Must Diet to avoid giving offence. The film interestingly takes its cue from the technicality that a new pope does not theoretically need to be a cardinal. Coltrane’s antihero is a rackety but basically honest priest, Dave Albinizi, who is accidentally elevated to the Holy See through a bizarre mistake and, like Lamberto in The Godfather Part III, is under pressure from the mob for looking too hard into Vatican bribery and corruption.View image in fullscreenFantastical … Jude Law as Pius XIII and John Malkovich as Sir John Brannox in The Young Pope’s sequel, The New Pope.Photograph: HBO/Gianni Fiorito/PAFor sheer hilarity and outrage, however, there is the fantastical Pius XIII, formerly Cardinal Lenny Belardo, played byJude Lawin Paolo Sorrentino’s streaming TV drama The Young Pope. We see this new pope smoking cigarettes – a shocking image, perhaps, although John XXIII and Benedict XVI were both smokers – and even treats us to the extraordinary vision of the pontiff striding along the beach, super buff, clad in nothing but tiny white Speedos.And how about the patriarchy and misogyny of Catholic rule? Many female stars have played the legendary and mythic Pope Joan, who supposedly ruled with her gender a secret for two years in the ninth century – Liv Ullmann was Pope Joan in 1972: pale and determined, an unworldly version of Joan of Arc.To be pope is to take an above-the-title lead role in a problematic franchise which many think should be revamped. It is a thankless and demanding role where the reviews come in at the very beginning and the very end.Perhaps someone like Peter Morgan could create a new movie, entitled Great Again, in which Jonathan Pryce can reprise his great performance as Francis, takinghis final meeting: with the oleaginous and uncomprehending JD Vance, played by, perhaps, Sam Rockwell. The ageing man of gentle wisdom tries to get through to the heartbreakingly childlike and vain vice-president, advising him on ways of buying his soul back.Explore more on these topicsFilmJonathan PryceRalph FiennesJude LawAnthony HopkinsRobbie ColtraneJeremy IronsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are no shops or even neighbours here – just trees, wild animals and a man making beguiling performance art videos. You shouldn’t, however, assume that Broms feels isolated.“I don’t see it like that,” he says through a beaming smile. In the early 1990s, the Swedish artist moved to Kumaon in northern India, right near the border with western Nepal and Tibet. Compared with that, this place couldn’t be more accessible. “It’s easy enough to get on a bike if I need something,” he shrugs.View image in fullscreen‘I gathered up the ash and said: “This is my first work”’ … Gustaf Broms.Photograph: Trishula LittlerToday Broms, 58, is speaking to me from his kitchen via video call. He’s wearing a rainbow-coloured knitted jumper and a beanie hat, his long, light grey hair flowing down from under it. It’s a chilly April day, he explains, although it could be worse – sometimes it can reach -30C around these parts.Broms’s artistic career is one marked by constant adventure and discovery. He started out taking photographs, and worked for a while as an assistant to Richard Avedon in New York, but eventually the limits of the two-dimensional image began to frustrate him. “After years of being obsessed with making imagery, I had reached a dead end,” he says.And so, during the winter solstice of 1993, Broms took all of his photographs and paintings to the waterfront in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg where he lived. After symbolically shaving his head, he set his life’s work on fire. “I realised that this action was much stronger than any of the work that went up in flames,” he says. “So I gathered up the ash and said: ‘This is my first work’. It was a real door opener.”Six months later Broms was living in the Indian mountains, looking for a new way to make work. One day while walking in Binsar Wildlife Sanctuary, where leopards roam, he came across a bone. It was another lightbulb moment for Broms. “It had a real energy. I became interested in moving away from the representation of an object to the actual thing. That’s still where I am today.”Broms spent two years collecting materials he would find on his daily walks – dried flowers, bones – and assembling them into beautiful arrangements inside a huge carpet factory that he rented out cheaply. Hardly anybody got to see the work in the flesh, other than the odd inquisitive local and the summer pilgrims who took the unpaved road past his place. Not that he minded. “I had a big space on the top of a ridge with a village below,” he says. “During monsoon season, clouds filled the valley, a real fairytale.”View image in fullscreenReal energy: Gustaf Broms pictured during his 10-day performance May Your Ripples Slowly Fade at Skövde Konstmuseum.Photograph: Christian BergenOn returning toSweden, Broms finally exhibited these works in a subterranean cave that he’d found in Stockholm. Again he was struck by a revelation – instead of showing people an image of a magical experience, why not create the magical image for them, so that they can record it directly with their senses? He moved towards performance.Through 2005 and 2006 he embarked on a project with his partner, Trish Littler, called A Walking Piece. They travelled together on foot from Vendel to Odesa in Ukraine, taking captivating triptych photographs along the way. Broms says that traversing Katowice and Gliwice in Poland, where the steel and coal industries had closed down, was somewhat hairy – “kind of Euro techno, really muscly guys and I imagine a lot of speed” – as was the night they had to pitch their tents in a graveyard. But in general, the couple stuck to forests, and savoured the incredible generosity of people they met along the way.A year later Broms performed The Sitting where he would sit cross-legged in central Stockholm during rush hour every day for a year. Not everyone appreciated his intervention – security guards hassled him, some people even spat at him – but Broms took all this in his stride. In the 2016 documentary about him,The Mystery of Life, we see him lying on the floor in public with soil on his face and worms crawling through it. His performance works have been misinterpreted as political demonstrations, advertising gimmicks, protests, provocations and even just someone who has lost their marbles. He embraces it all. Broms loves the excitement of performing in the city rather than at a gallery or festival where the audience arrive with an expectation of what they’re about to see.View image in fullscreen‘Language can only tell us so much’ … Gustaf Broms in performance in Cologne as part of Transition – Between Apocalypse and Utopia in July 2023.Photograph: Thomas ReulAt times, Broms says, it has been a “real struggle financially” to spend his life following these artistic callings. He spent a brief period doing dishes in a friend’s restaurants to help make ends meet. But these days a combination of frugal living and trickles of income from various streams including teaching – not to mention grants from the Swedish government – have put him in a steadier position.This month, Broms is in London to make his first piece of work here at the performance art festival Ceremony. He’s planning to collect materials from Hampstead Heath and see what he comes up with. He’s come to realise that the core of his work is all about trying to push beyond the limits of language. “Language can only tell us so much,” he says. “We can call two things a glass but they’re two unique objects. We work with generalisations. But in other forms of expression we can be more precise.”He flashes another beaming smile, then says: “I did expect that one day, maybe, I would grow up and want to live a different life.”Let’s hope that day never arrives – Broms clearly wasn’t born to do anything else.Gustaf Broms performs atCeremony festivalin London 7-10pm on Saturday 26 AprilExplore more on these topicsPerformance artArtSwedeninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Messy also topped charts in Australia, Ireland and beyond and peaked at number 14 in the US.It has been streamed more than 500m times on Spotify, with listeners drawn to Young’s frank assessment of her own failings, and her compelling (and quite sweary) tale of a toxic relationship: “And I’m too perfect ’til I show you that I’m not / A thousand people I could be for you and you hate the fucking lot,” the chorus concludes.Despite the east Londoner’s seemingly overnight success, she has been in the UK music scene for years, performing gigs around the capital since around 2018. Her soulful sound caught the attention of Nick Shymansky, Amy Winehouse’s former manager, and Nick Huggett, who first signed Adele – the two became her managers.Her cover of Together in Electric Dreams was featured in the 2021 John Lewis Christmas advert, and she also featured on Tyler, The Creator’s 2024 Chromakopia album.Young’s collaborator Conor Dickinson earns two nominations for his contributions to her work.Also nominated for best song musically and lyrically is Orla Gartland with her first nomination at the awards (for Mine),Laura Marling(Child of Mine), Fontaines DC (In the Modern World) and Raye, last year’s winner of songwriter of the year (Genesis).Up for best album this year alongside Young isCharli xcxfor her cultural phenomenon album Brat, which reached No 1 in the UK, Australia and Ireland and No 3 in the US. It dominated summer 2024, leading to the trend of “Brat Summer” and a viral dance craze to its song Apple. Other best album nominees are Berwyn (for Who Am I), Jordan Rakei (The Loop) and Ghetts (On Purpose, With Purpose), the latter also nominated in the best contemporary song category for that album’s Sampha collaboration, Double Standards.Rap is well represented in that category, with Pa Salieu and Bashy joiningGhetts, plus singer-songwriter Sans Soucis and pop star Jade, who won the Brit award for pop act at 2025’s awards.Nominees for most performed work, acknowledging commercial success, are Harry Styles (As It Was, which won two years ago and is in its third year of nomination), Dua Lipa (Houdini), Cassö,Raye& D-Block Europe (Prada), Myles Smith (Stargazing) and Wham!

The new licence “shows that a copyright exception is neither necessary nor desirable”, said the ALCS.The government’s proposal “would give very limited choice, wouldn’t remunerate creators or provide any transparency about which works are being used”, said Hayes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Meta “would have to initiate individualised negotiations withmillionsof authors”, a process which “would be onerous for even a few authors; it is practically impossible for hundreds of thousands or millions.”ALCS said that in theory US tech companies would be able to acquire licensed material through the new model. Asked for details on how much money writers might expect to get if they opt in to the scheme, ALCS said it will “be in a better position to answer this following conversations with prospective licensees.”PLS CEO Tom West said that he is “pleased to move forward with this important and much needed initiative to support an equitable, transparent, and sustainable framework for content use in the age of AI.”Explore more on these topicsBooksArtificial intelligence (AI)PublishingnewsShareReuse this content"

According to Luminate, which tracks streaming viewership,Conclavewas viewed for about 1.8m minutes on 20 April, and 6.9m minutes the next day – an increase of 283%.The pope’s death, from complications caused by a stroke, was announced early on Easter Monday. The news also appeared to have spurred renewed interest in the 2019 Oscar nomineeThe Two Popes, starring Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins.That drama saw a 417% spike, from 290,000 minutes watched on Sunday, to 1.5m the following day.Experts talk realism of Conclave movie: ‘Gets a lot of the details right’Read moreThe awards campaign for Conclave coincided with the pope’s hospitalisation for kidney failure in late February, and the cast – which includesRalph Fiennes, John Lithgow and Stanley Tucci – were frequently asked about the pontiff’s health.Both the key Italian actors in the cast, Isabella Rossellini and Sergio Castellitto, were particularly vocal in their praise and concern forPope Francis.“First of all, we would like to wish Pope Francis a quick recovery,” said Rossellini as the cast picked up their ensemble prize at the SAG awards.Castellitto added: “For us that live in Rome, to live at a few meters, few yards from the pope is to have a much closer relationship. We see the helicopter leaving his place: ‘Oh, is the pope flying off today and coming back?’ So, our relationship as Italians to the pope is much closer. I repeat, I really wish him well.”Rossellini’s ex-husband, Martin Scorsese, was among many from the film industry who paid tribute to the pope.“He was, in every way, a remarkable human being,” Scorsese wrote. “He acknowledged his own failings. He radiated wisdom. He radiated goodness. He had an ironclad commitment to the good. He knew in his soul that ignorance was a terrible plague on humanity. So he never stopped learning. And he never stopped enlightening. And, he embraced, preached and practised forgiveness. Universal and constant forgiveness.”Conclave was adapted from the novel by Robert Harris by Peter Straughan, whose screenplay won a Bafta and an Oscar. Fiennes stars as Cardinal Lawrence, who must silence his own religious doubts after the death of the pope and preside over the secretive voting process to choose his successor.Explore more on these topicsFilmConclaveRalph FiennesPope FrancisVaticannewsShareReuse this content"

Each anonymous essay was paired with a brief commentary by Anderson – and, tantalisingly, one of the essays themselves is by the actor, leaving readers left to guess which one.The follow-up anthology will continue in the same vein: “Whether you’re the Queen of Kink or have never been kissed, whether you’ve read Want cover to cover, or are just hearing about it now, I want to hear your favourite fantasies – and this time, I want to hear it all,” Anderson said.

The English edition is currently available in 74 countries, and translation rights have been sold for 27 different languages.Anderson pledged a sum of £500 for each letter published in the original Want book, to be split equally between the charities Women for Women International and War Child. The book’s publisher Bloomsbury also gave £50,000 to Women for Women International. Bloomsbury and Anderson said they will commit to the same contributions for this second collection.Alexis Kirschbaum, editorial director at Bloomsbury, said working with Anderson “has been an immense and inspiring undertaking.

She wrote and drew voraciously and much of this art depicts the depth she had and it also represents the pain she suffered. Many of her writings and artwork are roadmaps of her struggles and traumas.“Even with those roadmaps, diagnoses, and her own revelations, those closest to her, plus therapists, law enforcement officers and others who tried to help her are heartbroken their efforts couldn’t save her […] She repeatedly said she would ‘handle it’ on her own and was compelled to reject the treatment that might possibly have saved her life.”Nyweide had her first screen credit aged six as the titular character in the weepie Bella, about a chef with a mysterious past who spends the day with a waitress who needs a friend.Roles followed in Law & Order, and the films And Then Came Love, Noah Baumbach’s Margot at the Wedding and New York City Serenade. She played the daughter of Gael García Bernal and Michelle Williams’ characters in the 2009 film Mammoth, and a young girl in the Russell Crowe-starring Noah in 2014.Her last screen credit was in a 2015 episode of the social experiment reality show What Would You Do?.The obituary concluded: “Sophie.

He moved to London to pursue his theatrical career, leaving her in Stratford-upon-Avon and stipulating in his will that she would receive his “second best bed”, although still a valued item.Now a leading Shakespeare expert has analysed a fragment of a 17th-century letter that appears to cast dramatic new light on their relationship, overturning the idea that the couple never lived together inLondon.Matthew Steggle, a professor of early modern English literature at the University of Bristol, said the text seemed to put the Shakespeares at a previously unknown address in Trinity Lane – now Little Trinity Lane in the City. It also has them jointly involved with money that Shakespeare was holding in trust for an orphan named John Butts.Addressed to “Good Mrs Shakspaire”, the letter mentions the death of a Mr Butts and a son, John, who is left “fatherles”, as well as a Mrs Butts, who had asked “Mr Shakspaire” to look after money for his children until they came of age. It suggests the playwright had resisted attempts to pay money that the young Butts was owed.Steggle said: “The letter writer thinks that ‘Mrs Shakspaire’ has independent access to money. They hope that Mrs Shakspaire might ‘paye your husbands debte’.“They do not ask Mrs Shakspaire to intercede with her husband, but actually to do the paying herself, like Adriana in The Comedy of Errors,who undertakes to pay a debt on her husband’s behalf, even though she was previously unaware of it: ‘Knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.’”Steggle added: “For about the last 200 years, the prevailing view has been that Anne Shakespeare stayed in Stratford all her life and perhaps never even went to London.”View image in fullscreenAn illustration of Anne Hathaway and William Shakespeare from the 1860s-1870s. The couple married in 1582 and had three children.Photograph: Heritage Image Partnership/AlamyThis document, which refers to the couple who “dwelt in trinitie lane”, suggests that she did spend significant time with her husband in the capital.The fragment was preserved by accident in the binding of a book in Hereford Cathedral’s library. Although it was discovered in 1978, it has remained largely unknown because “no one could identify the names or places involved”, Steggle said.Crucial evidence includes the 1608 book in which the fragment was preserved, Johannes Piscator’s analyses of biblical texts. It was published by Richard Field, a native of Stratford, who was Shakespeare’s neighbour and his first printer.Steggle said that it would be a “strange coincidence” for a piece of paper naming a Shakspaire to be bound, early in its history, next to 400 leaves of paper printed by Field, “given Field’s extensive known links to the Shakespeares”.John Butts seems to have been serving an apprenticeship because the letter mentions “when he hath served his time”. Scouring records from the period 1580 to 1650, Steggle found a John Butts, who was an apprentice, fatherless and in the care of his mother.He also unearthed a 1607 reference to a John Butts in the records of Bridewell, an institution whose tasks included the disciplining of unruly apprentices. A document told of “his disobedience to his Mother” and that he was “sett to worke”.Steggle found John Butts in later records, placing him in Norton Folgate, outside the city walls, and living on Holywell Street (Shoreditch High Street today), home to several of Shakespeare’s fellow actors and associates.It was an area in which Shakespeare worked in the 1590s, first at theTheatrein Shoreditch, the principal base for the Lord Chamberlain’s Men throughout those years, and then at its near neighbour, the Curtain theatre. Shakespeare’s lifelong business partners, the Burbages, were involved in innkeeping and victualling nearby.Steggle said: “The adult John Butts, living on the same street as them, working in the hospitality industry in which they were invested … would very much be on the Burbages’ radar. So Shakespeare can be linked to Butts through various Norton Folgate contacts.”If the writing on the back of the letter – in another hand – was written by Anne, the words would be “the nearest thing to her voice ever known”, he noted.The research is being published inShakespeare, the journal of theBritish Shakespeare Association, on 23 April, the anniversary of his birth.Steggle writes: “For Shakespeare biographers who favour the narrative of the ‘disastrous marriage’ – in fact, for all Shakespeare biographers – the Hereford document should be a horrible, difficult problem.”Explore more on these topicsWilliam ShakespeareHeritageWarwickshireLondonTheatrenewsShareReuse this content"

Since their father’s funeral, when Bea scratched an obscene picture into Veda’s car bonnet, the two sisters have lost contact, and Bea has been isolated in an ever-growing haven of “stuff”. Old vinyl, books, crockery, bags for life and mountains of cutlery have turned her home into a graveyard of the past. To an outsider, it is the depths of hoarding; to Bea, every dusty item is a relic to be pored over and adored.But, now Veda has stopped by unexpectedly to “fix” things. Lawrence-Taylor’s vivid dialogue paints the sisters both as strangers, with years missing between them, and familiars, bound by their shared youth. They remember intimate details about each other; Veda drinks camomile tea, Bea loves bonsai trees. The actors, Holly Atkins (Veda) and Rosie Cavaliero (Bea), bring remarkable emotional texture to their roles; their relationship feels lived-in and layered with complication. As they bicker, laugh and plead with one another to understand their side of things, their speech rolls over each other in a natural rhythm.That realism is the key to the first section of Lucy Morrison’s delicate production. But, if you look closer within the clutter of Naomi Dawson’s set, there are signs that give away an upcoming rupture. When Veda reveals a shock of her own, lamps spread across the stage sporadically flicker and dim. A foreboding rumble is heard just below their conversation.It feels slightly premature when Bea’s junkyard kingdom starts to fall apart around the sisters. There are still holes in the women’s histories, which makes the second half of the play something of a maze. Still, Lawrence-Taylor is a master of showing the messy loops and back-and-forths that come in heated moments with loved ones. Even as a writer in germination, she has a unique grasp of human behaviour that is far beyond her years.AtHampstead theatrefrom 11 April to 17 MayExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreHampstead theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Warning: there will be tears and travel disastersHannah J DaviesWed 23 Apr 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Apr 2025 17.22 EDTShareIt’s hard to believe that Race Across the World has only been on TV since 2019, so integral is it to the BBC’s springtime schedules. In six short years, the reality competition has become a flagship format, skipping over from BBC Two to BBC One and scooping up Baftas for both its civilian and celebrity series, which airs in the autumn. And so to a fifth adventure for Britain’s bravest normies, who are dumped at a far-flung location and told to make it to another, via a series of hard-to-reach checkpoints. As always, they’re given the price of an air fare between the start and finish lines, which has to cover bed, board and transport for two whole months, with the possibility of earning some extra dosh by working strenuous jobs such as cleaning or working in kitchens. And, as ever, the cracks begin to show slowly – then all at once – for the pairs.There are some firsts this time around. If you thought 20-year-olds Owen and Alfie fromthe last serieswere young, get ready for teenage couple Fin and Sioned, who at 18 and 19 are the show’s youngest ever contestants. Yin and Gaz are also the show’s first separated couple, and the story of their against-the-odds relationship and subsequent split unfurls in shocking fashion over the first episode. While this revelation shattered any remaining belief I had in the power of love, next week’s second episode does well to provide more context to their split – and hopefully to stop random people across the country (and by that, I mean me) petitioning to get them back together.View image in fullscreenOn your marks … Race Across the World.Photograph: BBC/Studio LambertSome things, of course, remain the same. We’ve got Elizabeth and Letitia, who are siblings on a quest to get to know one another better; Caroline and Tom, a mother and son duo also on a quest to get to know one another better; and sexagenarians Brian and Melvyn, who are there to remind us that life experience can be a major attribute in this game. They’re also – would you believe it – siblings on a quest to get to know one another better, and haven’t holidayed together since the 70s.We’re in Asia for this new race, with the teams heading across China and Nepal to the tip of India, covering a total distance of 14,000km. It quickly becomes clear that Letitia has an advantage, having previously lived in China for six months and speaking a basic level of Mandarin. I can already feel the tabloid heat this is likely to attract (a young, well-educated black girl who speaks Chinese? Travelling to a destination pre-chosen by a TV production company, which happens to be China? Outrageous!) but I am quietly hopeful that they’ll be too dazzled by Letitia’s instant grit and smarts to do a hatchet job on her. Meanwhile, Brian and Melvyn are straight out of the gate and ready to go … before they stop for cake, clearly ready to Graze Across the World.View image in fullscreenOn a quest to get to know each other better (of course!) … Elizabeth and Letitia in Race Across the World.Photograph: BBC/Studio LambertAll the teams have teething issues, but Caroline and Tom are the first to crack, tearful and overwhelmed before they’ve even reached the first checkpoint. Like Alexander Dragonetti – the plummy people’s champ from the most recent series of The Traitors – you get the sense that Caroline and Tom know their way around a Fortnum & Mason hamper. But they’re also quite genuine, and their honesty might be their secret weapon, with Caroline, a housewife, keenly admitting that people have long underestimated her at home.Brian is quite honest, too, but in a way that has the potential to grate. He’s used to living in the lap of luxury, thanks to his success as a businessman (which he mentions a lot). His wife, he says, has warned him not to come across as too pompous; hopefully, as he continues to bond with the more down-to-earth Melvyn, this will subside. Or maybe there will be some horrifying sob story in a later episode that will make us regret ever having rolled our eyes as he harped on about his love of Michelin-starred restaurants.Race Across the World isn’t exactlyThe X Factorin that regard, but we do get potted histories peppered throughout the series. For Fin and Sioned that mostly means soundbites about how huuuuuuuge China is compared to Wales. Hopefully they will get to discuss something else that isn’t Wales-related as the series continues.Of course, nothing goes to plan – but, as always, the joy comes from watching the pairs come way out of their comfort zones and bask in new experiences. Or, as Letitia puts it while working on a farm: “If I wasn’t being stabbed every three seconds by the thorns, it would actually be quite relaxing.”Race Across the World airs on BBC One and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewReality TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

After the National Theatre’s Gareth Southgate bio-dramaDear England, this must be the first season that both big subsidised companies have filled stages with young men in replica club shirts and jockstraps.Before this Much of the Day starts, a TV sports feed tells us that FC Messina have beaten Madrid FC 3-2 in a European final, with a hat-trick from young winger Claudio. But cocky journeyman midfielder Benedick – jibed as “Signor Own-Goal”, replacing Shakespeare’s sexualised insult “Mountanto” – refuses to be interviewed by TV sportscaster Beatrice, due to some past bad match.While Hamlet takes place surrounded by sea, this re-sported Messina is more of a stretch, requiring “war” to become “game”, Leonato “owner” rather than “governor” and nobleman Don Pedro a “manager”, although football’s nickname culture permits him to be addressed as “Sweet Prince”, which is relatively modest in comparison with José Mourinho’s “Special One”.View image in fullscreenMasked balls … Freema Agyeman as Beatrice and Nick Blood as Benedick.Photograph: Marc BrennerAnd for football aficionados, it is shaming how well the game fits the plot of the brutal misogynistic slandering of a young woman, Hero. Indeed, a play revolving around falsehoods and pranking gains new power when everyone has a mobile phone. And masked balls (on which many misunderstandings depend) also feel plausible partying for Champions League millionaires.Less happily, the footballing cliche about a game of two halves also applies to the production. After halftime, as football kit gives way to wedding gear, the metaphor visually vanishes. Also, a common football-managerial complaint about the pace of play – moving the ball faster here, tactically slowing things down there – is something director Michael Longhurst might look at before a second elsewhere.View image in fullscreenFootballers’ wives … Megan Keaveny (Ensemble), Eleanor Worthington-Cox (Hero), Gina Bramhill (Margaret) and Lydia Fraser (Ursula).Photograph: Marc BrennerOne of the most remarkable lines in Shakespeare, Beatrice’s demand that Benedick “Kill Claudio”, is gabbled without a preceding pause, while other scenes need much quicker passing, especially as the comic coppers (cut completely fromJamie Lloyd’s recent London Much Ado) get a full game. Dogberry and the other members of his watch as hi-vis private security is a good sight gag but their lines frequently die.Freema Agyeman’s winning Beatrice looks – although the conceit can’t encompass women’s football – as if she might be a better player than Nick Blood’s Benedick, who has the poignancy of a late-career athlete, while Peter Forbes’ sleazy Leonato would easily fail the Premier League’s “fit and proper owners” test. Eleanor Worthington-Cox’s hopeful Hero could have walked on from Amazon Prime’s Married to the Game. Jon Bausor’s set makes amusing use of a folding massage table, and the clothes, from tracksuits to designer suits and frocks, should win him a costume trophy.

Appearances might suggest otherwise: it is written and presented almost entirely in the familiar style of that genre, with largish print, short sentences, snappy maxims in italics and lots of lists and charts (“six signs you may be on the wrong side of history”). Its proposals are delivered with all the annoyingly hectic bounciness of the genre.But it is worth taking Bregman (a thirtysomething historian and author labelled “one of Europe’s most prominent young thinkers” by the Ted network) at his word. He begins from the deep and corrosive anomie experienced by so many gifted young professionals who find themselves making substantial sums of money in exhausting and (at best) morally compromising jobs. The “moral ambition” of the title is about recognising that serious financial, organisational, technological and analytical skills – the kind that in the US will get you through, say, law school with a secure ticket to prosperity – can be used to make tangible improvements in the lives of human and nonhuman neighbours.For this to happen, we need vivid, granular narratives of how, in the past, this has become not just a possibility but an urgent imperative. In Nazi-occupied France and the Netherlands, who exactly sheltered Jews and why? In the 20th-century US, who named and shamed the naked abuses of corporate power? In the 18th century, how did the campaign to end the slave trade gain traction so decisively within a relatively short period of time?The stories that Bregman tells are vivid and often genuinely inspiring. His pages on the career of the radical US activistRalph Naderand his spectacular series of victories over corporate inertia and self-interest stand in stark contrast with the near total abandonment of the values he stood for in the present-day US. But Bregman also has important things to say in his account of Nader about the nature of effective radical leadership, including distributing responsibilities and allowing a fair bit of room for people to set their own agendas (“The function of leadership is to produce more leaders, not more followers,” Nader says).Bregman does not gloss over the unhappy climax of Nader’s career, a presidential run in 2000 that effectively delivered the presidency to George W Bush. The unrelenting intensity of his campaigns, the demands he made of himself and others, and a near messianic confidence in his problem-solving abilities all contributed in the end to a profound unrealism and a deafness to criticism. Bregman – while provocatively claiming that to make a difference, you have to create something like a “cult” – is clear that unrelieved high-octane idealism is unsustainable and actively dangerous.He has some judiciously positive things to say about the tangles of the “effective altruism” movement (much tarnished by the association with it of problematic figures such asSam Bankman-Fried). The one-note emphasis on measurable effectiveness encouraged the idea that you could do the maximum amount of good by making the maximum amount of money so that you could give it all away. But the effect of this was, for some, to blur the focus to the extent that trying to actually solve global problems could be replaced by discussing endlessly what you might do if you were even richer.There are pages where some readers at least will be tempted to mutter about white saviourismThere is nothing morally superior about inefficiency, and no alibi for ineffectiveness to be found in good intentions. Bregman has stringent and necessary things to say about the myth of the “noble loser”, as he neatly christens it, in which purity of motive outweighs actual delivery. “Winning” is a moral imperative, and accountability is essential.And accountability requires at least two critical habits. One is simply to take the trouble to find out what the problem is, especially from those who experience it firsthand. The other, more challengingly, is to beware of those varieties of purism and maximalism that make it impossible either to construct serious long-term strategies for policymaking, or to make tactical alliances with those who don’t necessarily share every detail of your convictions.The developing awareness of intersectionality – the interwoven nature of a wide variety of factors that inhibit human dignity and freedoms – has been a genuinely important aspect of recent thinking about what justice might mean. Ultimately, talking about the emancipation of one group will and should lead you to see that you have to link it to the emancipation of other groups. But the danger, Bregman argues, is that you may end up refusing to work with anyone who does not sign up to a formidable and ever-expanding list of supposedly interconnected orthodoxies, a moral package-deal in which you can’t begin to act on one issue unless all the other bases are secured, and in which no one can be a genuine ally without acknowledging every article of the creed. It is a pseudo-religious attitude that leads inexorably to division and ineffectuality, privileging the sense of the activist’s moral integrity over any urgency around the alleviation of actual suffering.As a corrective, Bregman describes a number of successful movements that have thought seriously about necessary tactical compromises and the acceptance of delay in order to arrive at a more secure if less dramatic outcome – from the abolitionist movement to the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955 (he shows how Rosa Parks’s famous protest was in fact carefully planned and “curated” for maximum impact).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

His appeal is very much to the high-flyer, looking for a cause that will give the fullest moral satisfaction; and there are pages where some readers at least will be tempted to mutter about white saviourism. Yet he is also admirably realistic about the need to park one’s own desire for a certain kind of sainthood, to accept the need for ordinary self-care so as to avoid falling victim either to burnout or – worse – to one’s own mythology, and to remain clear about what measurable differences might look like – never mind whether they are as dramatic and global as you would have wished. Because the book is pitched so strongly towards the young and gifted, there is a lot of emphasis on achievement and satisfaction – but the book as a whole probes more deeply, aware of the risks of self-dramatising.Which is why it is indeed more than a self-help manual. It may be more optimistic than current global trends seem to warrant; it may be a bit thin on how you sustain imaginatively, even spiritually, the moral ambition it prescribes. But at its best it offers a bracingly hopeful perspective, insisting on the necessity of doing all you can to allow yourself to be sensitised and resensitised to that which eats away at the dignity not only of humanity but (an important element in Bregman’s argument) of the entire living environment. And, as he notes at the very end of the book, believing that individuals can’t make a difference is paradoxically a deeply individualistic conviction, a refusal to see the interwovenness of human agency. Oversimplified? Perhaps. But calls to arms often have to be.Moral Ambition: Stop Wasting Your Talent and Start Making a Difference by Rutger Bregman is published by Bloomsbury (£20).

Having already looked overBotticelli’s Primavera, Burton now turns to Raphael’s wall fresco in the Vatican palace, arguably the high point of the artist’s prodigious output and a work to rival Michelangelo’s Sistine chapel decorations.Burton has already tackled The School of Athens as part of hismammoth survey of Raphael’s entire oeuvre, Raphael: A Portrait, but here he gets to drill down in considerable detail for the film’s 81-minute running time. Admittedly, the visuals are as rudimentary as Burton’s previous offerings – it looks like a glorified PowerPoint, with Burton’s sonorous commentary overlaid in unpunctuated voiceover – but as before, the tone works: Burton is scholarly without being dull, and clear without being obvious.It’s also unusual, to say the least, to hear about some of the names Burton pulls into his disquisition – Neoplatonist thinkers such asGemistos Plethon,Nicholas of CusaandMarsilio Ficino– as Burton ruminates on the symbolism of the painting’s imagery, from the postures of the figures involved, to their much-discussed (but surprisingly mostly uncertain) identity, to the meaning behind the spectacular masonry backdrop.Burton is also very good on the mechanics of the fresco’s creation, and how the details of the architecture of the former papal apartments play into its meaning, in concert with the complementary works on the ceiling, floor, and adjacent walls. He even takes a 15-minute mea culpa for having not paid much attention to Renaissance chronicler Giorgio Vasari’s religion-based interpretation of the painting, suggesting that Vasari might have been right to identify the foreground figures (one of whom is supposedly inspired by Michelangelo himself) as the four evangelists, rather than the classical philosophers that they are routinely ascribed to be. Not light viewing, for sure, but rewarding all the same.Raphael’s School of Athens is on Prime Video from 24 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsRaphaelPaintingArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

A girl of 11 or 12 clutching the side of the boat looks less thrilled. A squall is the most action you’ll get from this delicate, contemplative, rather eccentric documentary from film-maker Huw Wahl. It’s a love letter to engineless sailing: the art of navigating using only the wind, tides and good old fashioned seamanship. Though, really, that should be seawomanship, since the sailor we see most is Rose Ravetz (the director’s sister) who moors her engineless boat, the Defiance, at Maldon in Essex.Filmed over three years and shot on 16mm film, there are some gorgeous images here that would give Turner a run for his money, like a milky sky melting into the white sea. It’s a feast for the ears, too, with a soundtrack of waves, creaking wood, the clank of metal and shrieking oystercatchers. Over in Maldon, Ravetz twists yarn to make rope by lamplight. Her musings about the effect of sailing on her anxious tendencies make it sound like meditation: “When you’re in that conversation with nature, it’s not in your head. It’s just feeling and responding without analysing it.”People have sailed for 6,000 years using the wind and tides, says a sailor from the Dutch company Fairtransport; engines entered the picture 100 years ago. They run the world’s only cargo sailing fleet, an environmentally friendly alternative to heavily polluting cargo ships. We watch the crew of his boat, the Tres Hombres, load up barrels; elsewhere hobbyists take part in a engineless sailing jolly in Norfolk. The film is a gentle audiovisual meditation – though, personally speaking, it crossed the fine line between meditative and sleepy more than once, the lapping waves exerting a gentle pressure on my eyelids. Still, it’s the only film I’ve seen with a cast list of boats rather than people in the credits.Wind, Tide & Oar is in UK and Irish cinemas from 25 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsSailingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Ruijie is a schoolgirl afflicted with a degenerative disease:“affixed to her legs were battery-powered titanium braces; the latest model, customised circuitry to aid her ability to walk”. As the novel opens, Ruijie is in a robot junkyard, scavenging for spare parts and better legs. Here she meets a robot boy, Yoyo, discarded despite being a highly sophisticated model. Ruijie takes the quirky Yoyo to school with her, and a group of friends assemble to protect him from scavengers and exploitation in the robot-fighting ring.This element of the novel reads like a YA adventure, though the rest is more adult-focused: cyberpunk, violent and sexualised. In an author’s note, Park says that they began writing Luminous as children’s fiction, until a bereavement took the work in a different direction, making the novel “a shape-shifter, no longer so appropriate for children”. There’s an awkwardness to this mix of tone, although we could say it reproduces, on the level of form, the book’s central topic of hybridisation, cyborgification, different elements worked together, as the novel’s setting – a future unified Korea – does on the level of geography.Yoyo has two younger human siblings – but he is forever 12 years old, and they are now adults. One is Detective Cho Jun, of Robot Crime, who is investigating a missing persons case: the person in this case being a robot. Jun is a cyborg, more machine than man; blown up by an IED during the unification war, he “damaged 78 percent of his body beyond recovery. They repaired him by attaching not the bionic to his body but his body to the bionic.” He will be paying off the cost of the surgery for a long time: “it’s going to take another 30 years before I can afford to upgrade my cock.”Luminous is profoundly interested in what it means to be a person, in where authenticity is located – through love, grief and connectionJun’s sister Morgan is a designer, working for the corporation Imagine Friends. She lives with Stephen, her robot lover, whom she built from scratch, modelling him on a film star heartthrob. Though constructed specifically to meet her needs, Stephen is a distinct and original individual, in some ways the most interesting character in the novel.The future Korea of Luminous is busily and vividly rendered. Robot-sex addiction is rife. Kids have grown dependent on their robot nannies: “botwired, these children were called. Children who supposedly couldn’t go anywhere without a robot. Undersocialised, entitled, prone to tantrums and anger issues.” This speaks, obviously enough, to present-day anxieties, but Park is doing more than satirising our current tech dependencies. Luminous is profoundly interested in what it means to be a person, in where authenticity is located – through love, grief and connection.There are similarities with Kazuo Ishiguro’sKlara and the Sun, although Luminous is busier, more capacious, more streetwise. The book is also in dialogue with Brian Aldiss’s Supertoys Last All Summer Long, the story behindSteven Spielberg’s AI. Yoyo explains his existence to Ruijie: “My father’s older brother died in a fire. He was 12 years old. I was made in his image. When I woke up, I saw my father weep. I learned people can cry from sadness, they can cry from joy, and sometimes they don’t even know the reason why. I wept with my father, but he pulled away and the feeling went away. My tears repelled him. Because it was a different kind of sadness. A movie sadness.”For all its exuberance, Luminous betrays some roughness. It is too long, the work of a writer in love with their imagined world and pouring in detail. The pacing is uneven, the plotting a little messy. Stylistically it is vibrant, sometimes funny and memorable, although the prose can stray into oddness: “his body shuddered with a molecular resistance”; “heat stuffed up his nose squeezing his eyes”. But the larger sweep of this energetic and imaginative debut carries the reader through: it’s a novel of huge humanity not despite but because Park is so attuned to the encroachments of technology and artificiality upon the human condition.

John Lennon’s arms stretch at angles like the sails of a windmill. His face wears a toothy, incandescent smile. Beads of water dance around him like an upside-down waterfall as he swims off Miami Beach.“He’s so carefree,” saysJoshua Chuang, director of photography at the Gagosian art gallery. “It’s almost like you’ve never seen him like that; he’s always kind of joking around or brooding or being sarcastic. He’s so happy. It’s his best friend at the time capturing that and, when you know about what happened, it’s so moving.”With a little help from my friend: John, Paul and the ‘romance’ that transformed cultureRead moreThe best friend in this case is Sir Paul McCartney, whose recently rediscovered photographs go on display from Friday at Gagosian in Beverly Hills, California. The exhibitionRearview Mirrorcharts the rise of Beatlemania between December 1963 and February 1964 and marks the first time that 82-year-old McCartney has made signed editions of his photos available (a portion of proceeds from sales will go to Los Angeles-based fire relief organisations).A thousand images taken by the musician were found by his archivist during the coronavirus pandemic after being largely forgotten for half a century. An initial museum exhibition,Eyes of the Storm, organised by the National Portrait Gallery in London, contained 250 pictures and has toured various venues including the Brooklyn Museum and de Young Museum in San Francisco.If that show was a sprawling anthology box set, Rearview Mirror is more of a sleek Revolver or Rubber Soul. It presents 36 works, some previously unseen, some overlapping with the museum show but often in different formats, for example intact contact sheets versus individual frames. It emphasises the formal qualities of the photographs as art objects.Speaking via Zoom from Beverly Hills, Chuang says: “The museum show almost had a scrapbook quality to it. We wanted to do something that was much more focused, much more object-driven with works that were beautiful, printed to the highest standards with the latest technology and, if you were to acquire one, you feel like you’re owning a piece of history. I think we managed to do it.“When Paul came into the studio to sign the first batch he was knocked out by them. What he kept saying as he was walking around was, ‘I feel like I’ve never seen this before.’ Visitors to our exhibition who have seen the touring museum exhibition at whatever venue will have that same reaction: ‘Oh, yeah, I saw that show. But is that the same picture?’”View image in fullscreenPaul McCartney – Self-portrait in my room at the Asher family home, Wimpole Street, London, December 1963.Photograph: Paul McCartney and GagosianChuang knew he had to make the show’s title distinct fromEyes of the Stormand settled on something that reflects both a literal perspective from car windows and the metaphorical act of looking back at this pivotal period. He jokes: “Paul is the greatest lyricist of all time – can’t you come up with it?! I started looking at the pictures that we chose and one of the motifs was of a mirror.“There are self-portraits where Paul’s trying to frame himself in a mirror. There’s Paul caught in the reflection of a rearview mirror of the car; so many pictures were taken from inside cars because that was the only safe space in public. I suggested ‘Rearview Mirror’ both literally and metaphorically and he loved it.”The Fab Four remain an unstoppable cultural and commercial juggernaut. Late last year saw the release ofBeatles ’64, a Disney+ documentary about that heady conquest of America; last month there was Ian Leslie’s book,John & Paul: A Love Story in Songs, study of Lennon and McCartney’s marriage of true minds; last week it was the turn ofOne to One: John & Yoko, a Kevin Macdonald film about Lennon and Yoko Ono’s time living in Greenwich Village in the early 1970s.So it is that McCartney’s photographic oeuvre receives a second look. The pictures offer an intimate glimpse of the Beatles’ adventures in London, Paris and the USthrough the lens of one of their own – a counterpoint to press images of the time. They preserve candid moments and intense fan reaction, from frenzied crowds in New York to the overwhelming greetings at airports.Chuang worked with McCartney’s archivist, Sarah Brown, to drill down to the specifics of eachday in the life. “Whereas in the museum show it’s very general – John and Ringo, Paris, January 1964 – now it will say this is John playing the guitar in the hotel suite at the George V on 16 January, hours before they get the telegram that I Want to Hold Your Hand is number one in America and hours later they’re doing the famous pillow fight. It’s like filling in these gaps in the visual narrative and from the most unique perspective you could think of, which is Paul.”Another such example is a colour contact sheet of the Beatles and their entourage at Heathrow airport before flying to America, offering something akin to “stop motion sequence” of a band on the verge of global fame and cultural immortality. Chuang is impressed that McCartney had the presence of mind to run ahead on the tarmac, turn around and capture the moment.“There’s three pictures of John Lennon on there; it looks like three different people. It’s like you’re seeing these different facets of them basically hours before they’re about to change the world. You can almost get a sense in those pictures they’re excited, maybe they’re tired – they had been touring non-stop leading up to that - and I’d like to think there’s a good kind of nervousness, a sense that something is about to change.”View image in fullscreenBeing chased by fans on West 58th Street, New York City, 12 February 1964Photograph: Paul McCartney and GagosianSomething did change. On 9 February 1964 the Beatles made their live TV debut on the The Ed Sullivan Show, watched by 73 million people. Less than 48 hours later they performedtheir first US concertat the Washington Coliseum (tickets ranged from $2 to $4) with more than 8,000 people in attendance, including future vice-president Al Gore. By April the Beatles had the top five spots on the US Billboard charts.Perhaps it was no surprise that McCartney wanted to photograph people and things that went before. Cameras run in the family: his brother Mike, first wife Linda and daughter Mary all became professional photographers. McCartney grew up admiring sports photographyin the Observer newspaperand won a school art prize.Time surrounded by professional snappers during the Beatles’ ascent further honed his eye. Chuang ventures:“I would like to think – and Paul doesn’t quite remember – that buying a camera was both a way to create your own memento but also a way to play with the photographers who constantly had the lens pointed at you. If you’ve seen thepress conferences at JFK [airport], there’s this banter with the reporters. They’re giving as good as they’re getting and the camera seemed to serve a similar function.”McCartney was using a 35mm SLR Pentax camera, a technology that enabled spontaneity and the “snapshot aesthetic” of the 1960s. He toldCBS Newsin 2023: “We were moving fast. So, you just learned to take pictures quickly.”Chuang comments: “He’s a natural. The pictures have a sense of amateur zeal. The two self-portraits, if you will, which were both taken in a mirror, have this wonderful sense of amateurism but it doesn’t detract from the power of the picture. You can see his skill level improve from December to February, in part because the light’s different in America, especially in Miami, where it was super bright. Those tend to be super sharp.”One photo is taken in the attic of McCartney’s then girlfriendJane Asher. “This is the room in which he woke up with a tune in his head. He starts jotting down the tune on the piano, didn’t have words and came up with dummy words – scrambled eggs, oh, baby, how I love your legs. It took him about a year to come up with the actual lyrics, which became Yesterday. The fact he’s in Jane Asher’s house, he’s got a camera – there’s a kind of self-awareness of wanting to memorialise that moment. That doesn’t exist anywhere else.”Rearview Mirror: Photographs, December 1963–February 1964 byPaul McCartneyis at Gagosian in Beverly Hills from 25 April to 21 June.Explore more on these topicsPaul McCartneyPhotographyThe BeatlesExhibitionsArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This striking installation by acclaimed French photographer JR heralds the opening of Kyotographie 2025, the city’s celebrated month-long international photography festival.The theme for this year’s event is “humanity”. Last autumn, JR and his team transformed Kyoto into a living studio, setting up mobile portrait stations across the city to capture the rich diversity of Kyōto-jin society. Monks, artisans, politicians, schoolchildren and drag queens – all life is here.View image in fullscreenShooting the Chronicles of Kyoto – each person is photographed against a greenscreen backdropThe photographer and street artist’s technique is to take each portrait on a greenscreen backdrop, with controlled lighting for continuity, so that they can be easily cut out and placed on a constructed landscape. This is based on spaces and buildings photographed from around the city that are stitched together to create a grand tableau of unexpected interactions.View image in fullscreenEvery portrait is taken with the same lighting applied for continuityEach individual is in charge of how they’re portrayed. It’s entirely up to them what they choose to wear and how they pose – there is no direction or choreography from the artist. The only brief for JR is to capture the essence and character of the population and all its vivid qualities.View image in fullscreenThe people are chosen to present a comprehensive cross-section of societyMany also contribute a brief audio reflection – sharing personal stories or everyday thoughts – creating a collective portrait of the present moment.View image in fullscreenThe Chronicles of Kyoto, seen here in its entiretyInside the Shimbun Building, a former printing press turned gallery, visitors are led through JR’s creative process via a detailed exhibition.

Everyone is equalJRView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenJR talks through the exhibition detailing his methods at the Shimbun Building, a former printing plant in Kyoto. Examples of his Chronicles series from other parts of the world are on displayAs always, Kyotographie features a tri-continental dialogue betweenJapan, France and Africa, reflecting the cultural heritage of festival co-directors Yusuke Nakanishi and Lucille Reyboz, who spent her childhood years in Mali. Each year an African photographer is invited to spend a residency in the city to create a unique body of work and this year’s chosen artist is Laetitia Ky from Ivory Coast.Ky is known for self-portraits featuring elaborate sculptures she makes using her hair. The pictures are quirky and witty but they make a serious point about her relationship with her afro hair and the shadow of colonial legacy affecting her heritage.I was raised in a culture where straightened hair and lighter skin were seen as desirableLaetitia KyGrowing up in Abidjan, her friends and family went to exhaustive lengths to live up to an ideal of western beauty involving toxic hair-relaxing chemicals. After undergoing one disastrous chemical treatment herself, Ky discovered a community of women online who were embracing their natural hair and she began to question why she felt the need to alter her true self. Her work is an expression of acceptance and self love that she shares on social media with online communities all over the world and it makes a social and political statement about the complexities of female identity.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTote Tresses was made during Laetitia’s residency in Kyoto; Fishing in Kamo River is another image in the residency seriesDuring her time in Kyoto, Ky has made an affectionate commentary on her Japanese experience, twisting extensions held with wire into her hair to create an act of self-expression that shares and endorses cultural pride.View image in fullscreenArtists Lee Shulman and Omar Victor Diop are featured together in this image from the series Being ThereAfrican experience is also central to the series Being There created by British artist Lee Shulman in collaboration with Omar Victor Diop from Senegal. This nostalgic journey back in time takes examples of the type of photography that may appear in family albums across North America from the 50s and 60s, a time of segregation and racial inequality, and questions what is absent.View image in fullscreenBeing There looks to reimagine a world without segregationThe source images for the project are found or “orphaned” photographs that aren’t attributed to anyone in particular. The pair then add Omar, a black African, into the scene, introducing him naturally in every frame so as not to disrupt the cohesion of the family album. It’s a meticulous process that blends the light and atmosphere and even the surface texture of the original photograph. Displayed in a traditional Japanese home styled as a mid-century domestic setting, the series offers a moving meditation on representation, memory and belonging.View image in fullscreenThe series challenges social and racial stereotypesGrowing up in Senegal, Omar didn’t experience segregation himself but he feels empathy for those who did. The work he has made over the last 12 years has been about travelling through time to explore the place of African people in the world.Playing this fictional character gave me a chance to give a seat at the table to those who didn’t have a seat or a voiceOmar Victor DiopView image in fullscreenThe work is displayed in a mid-century middle-class American settingJapanese perspectives are central too. This year marks the return of pioneering Okinawan photographer and activist Mao Ishikawa, now in her 70s. Her 1970s series Red Flower: The Women of Okinawa documents the lives of women – including herself – working in bars frequented by African American GIs stationed on the island. These candid, intimate images confront lingering stigmas and the complex sociopolitical legacy of the US military presence in postwar Okinawa.View image in fullscreenA photograph from the series Red Flower: The Women of OkinawaThese women lived with a kind of bold, unrestrained freedom that was very coolMao IshikawaView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPhotographs from the Red Flower series by Mao Ishikawa, exhibited at Kyotographie 2025Another Japanese highlight is Keijiro Kai, a sports photographer fascinated by the primal intensity of physical contests. From the chaotic Shrovetide football match in Ashbourne, England, to Japan’s Hadaka Matsuri – where naked men clash in a frenzied struggle for fortune – Kai captures the raw, boundary-blurring energy that unites people in shared physical experience. His work is a visceral exploration of masculinity, ritual and collective identity.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenShrove Tuesday, Keijiro Kai’s exhibition at Kyotographie 2025View image in fullscreenClothed in Sunny Finery, Okayama, 2018, by Keijiro KaiRounding out the festival is the first ever Japanese retrospective of legendary Mexican photographer Graciela Iturbide. Spanning six decades, the exhibition traces her poetic journey across deserts, mountains and cultures – from the indigenous Seri people in the Sonoran desert to Zapotec women in Oaxaca, and beyond. Inspired by Henri Cartier-Bresson’s “decisive moment”, Graciela’s memorable images – such as the majestic Angel Woman or the iguana-crowned Nuestra Señora de las Iguanas – merge documentary precision with spiritual wonder.View image in fullscreenMexico City, 1969View image in fullscreenAngel Woman, shot in the Sonoran desert, Mexico, in 1979View image in fullscreenOur Lady of the Iguanas, photographed in 1979 in Juchitán, Oaxaca, MexicoWhen I look at my images, I see fragments of myself – my thoughts, my desires, my dreamsGraciela IturbideNow in her 80s, Graciela is still taking pictures today.

We’re helping out the local volunteer association,Andros Routes, which has been restoring a network of ancient mule tracks, from the coast to the interior and its low mountains. The tracks form part of a new walking holiday that allows us to explore the pretty island on foot – and give something back, too.Andros, Athens and northern CycladesThe eight-day trip with Ramble Worldwide takes you from the south-east to the north-west, from Ormos Korthiou to Gavrio, via Chora on the east coast, with accommodation in low-key hotels and luggage transfer between them. Daily routes are only suggested: guests can choose full-on trekking days or easy circular walks, customising the holiday to suit energy levels and using buses or taxis to skip sections if desired. Along the way you can choose to help with the maintenance of the paths (secateurs and gloves are delivered to your hotel).Andros Routes started life in 2010 under the aegis of the sustainable tourism expert Olga Karayiannis, who returned to the island, after living in Athens, on a mission to conserve local heritage, cultural and natural. So far, 100 miles (160km) of trails have been restored and broken into numbered sections – with plans to extend them to 150 miles – and each part has its own “angel” who checks up on the route and steps in when a problem is reported.View image in fullscreenThe writer cutting back unruly foliage on the way to Chora.Photograph: Rhonda CarrierAs we descend slowly from Pythara towards the glittering Mediterranean at Chora, cats amble across our path or look on as we stop to cut back spiky bushes, pick up rubbish, move stones or check on the state of signposts. Lizards dart and butterflies kiss our bare legs as we sidle past houses where courgettes and tomatoes sprout in wild abundance. We stop to sniff wild jasmine, mints of different kinds, rosemary, oregano and lavender, and walk on carpets of figs that have tumbled from the trees.We are deep in lush vegetation, passing through shaded valleys, walking past old ruined chapels where goats now take shelterWe pass cacti and olive groves on our way down to the sea and make out caves in cliffs where locals once hid from Turkish invaders, and where monks have also sought sanctuary. We discover shaded pools where, according to folklore, fairies reside, and walk alongside chapels and ruined watermills. We end our walk with a swim in the cool green sea at Gialia beach, just outside Chora, and then sip fresh juice from the Votsalo beach bar’s watermelon garden.To get more of an insight into the Andros Routes project, guests can time a trip to coincide with a communal maintenance walk (held every second weekend in spring, autumn and winter, and flagged up on the organisation’s news page). We meet two of the “angels”, fortysomethings Valentini and Vicky, who join us for part of the walk and share stories about Andros and vegetation, and why the routes are so important, to them and this island. Most of the “angels” are women, appropriate on this island known for its culture of strong women who held the fort while the men were at sea.View image in fullscreenThe waterfalls of Pythara.Photograph: Stamatios Manousis/AlamyIslanders love these pathways, they tell us, the oldest parts of which date back to 1200, and they can already see how the scheme is helping to reinvigorate the island, once rich through its shipbuilding industry. Olga’s vision is ultimately one of a “chain of sustainability” where visitors support locals by eating in their homes and staying in restored old stone houses. This will add options to the trial bunkhouse for eight, Hikers Lodge “Konaki’ in Katakalei village, near Apikia. It’s also helping to extend the tourist season, with more people coming in March–May and September–November for the more pleasant walking temperatures.An interactive map has been created to help walkers visit small-scale producers and artisans on the islandIn the evening, my friend and I stroll the section of the path from Mesaria to Menites, following ancient irrigation channels that bring water down from the mountains. In the village of Menites, Andros Routes works with the cultural association and we happen upon a children’s looming workshop in the community centre; Andros used to be known for silk production because of its mulberry trees, and cultural association leader (and Route Angel) Despina is among those trying to keep the tradition alive.Olga is also one of the founders of the Andros Research Center, which has created aninteractive mapto help walkers visit small-scale producers and artisans on the island, with bookable visits to cheese-makers, jam-makers and beekeepers (and others) to see their work in action and stock up on goodies. Or you may just see them at work as you amble along.

In some places we are deep in the kind of lush vegetation that keeps the volunteers busy, passing through shaded valleys, walking past old ruined chapels where goats now take shelter. Other areas are more rocky and arid, and copious sunscreen is a must.View image in fullscreenGavrio on the west coast of Andros.Photograph: Apostolis Giontzis/AlamyOne of our favourite days is spent exploring inland around the villages of Remata and Katakilos, which includes lots of steep, challenging-but-rewarding uphills. The section contrasts sharply with the final part of that route between the resort of Batsi and the ferry port of Gavrio, which is flatter, with heart-stirring coastal views. We take a photo of a sign that’s starting to collapse but hasn’t been noticed because it’s in quite a remote spot, to send back to Andros Routes so it can be fixed.When we reach our final hotel, the charmingly low-key IreneStudios, on San Pedro beach just outside Gavrio, we hang up our walking boots and decide to chill instead of walk that day. There, with uninhabited islands as a dreamy backdrop, we swim in the Aegean and relax at great-value beach bars serving Greek salads, paellas, sangrias and the like – the perfect antidote to hike-weary limbs.The trip was provided by Ramble Worldwide, itseight-nightWalking on Androsholiday costs from£729ppB&B, including transfers, ferry from Rafina to Andros, luggage transfers, maps and route descriptions, and 24-hour telephone assistance.Departures betweenMay and October 2025Explore more on these topicsWalking holidaysGreek Islands holidaysGreece holidaysEthical holidaysGreen travelEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

British asparagus swoops in around now, offering bright green relief from winter’s hardier vegetables, while the jarred and frozen veg in the gratin save on prep time and keep everything light.Steamed asparagus and punchy hazelnut relish (pictured top)Put the relish together while the nuts are still warm, because that helps them absorb the flavours and create a condiment that’s both bright and deeply savoury.Prep5 minCook30 minServes6100g blanched hazelnuts1 round shallot, peeled and finely chopped100ml extra-virgin olive oil2 tsp sherry vinegarJuice and zest of ½lemon½ small bunch fresh parsley, leaves and tender stems finely chopped¼ tsp salt400g asparagusHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Tip the hazelnuts on to a tray and roast for 10 minutes, until deep golden. Meanwhile, mix the shallot, oil, vinegar, lemon juice and zest, parsley and salt in a small bowl.While the roast nuts are still hot, pound them in batches in a mortar until they look rubbly (you’re aiming for some larger, chunky pieces and plenty of small ones, but no whole nuts). Tip the still-warm nuts into the oil and vinegar mix, then taste and adjust the seasoning.Trim the thicker, tough ends off the asparagus spears and use a vegetable peeler to peel the bottom half of each spear (save the peelings for stocks or soups). Steam the asparagus for four minutes, until bright green and tender to the point of a sharp knife, then lift out and arrange on a warm platter.Drizzle a third of the nut relish over the asparagus, and put the rest in a bowl on the table so everyone can top themselves up. Serve immediately. Any leftover relish can be kept covered in the fridge for up to five days; it’s wonderful spooned over polenta and greens, or drizzled over new potatoes.Spring vegetable and cannellini bean cheesy mustard gratinView image in fullscreenAnna Shepherd’s spring vegetable and cannellini bean cheesy mustard gratin.A molten, crunchy-topped gratin full of tender, verdant greens is sure to elicit a few “oohs” and “aahs” at the table.Prep15 minCook1 hr 10 minServes6For the cheesy mustard sauce40g unsalted butter40g plainflour500ml whole milk100g extra-mature cheddar, grated1 heaped tbsp wholegrain mustard100ml dry sherry, or white wineSea salt andblack pepperFor the gratin4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil2 leeks, cleaned, then white and green parts sliced into 1cm rounds2 large garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped100g spinach100g frozen broad beans50g frozen peas250g jarred artichoke hearts(drained weight), cut into quarters600g jar cannellini beans, drained1 small bunch fresh mint, leaves picked and chopped75g soft white breadcrumbs30g almonds, roughly choppedFirst make the sauce. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan on a medium-low heat. Once it’s bubbling, stir in the flour and cook, stirring, for a couple of minutes. Gradually whisk in the milk, then cook, stirring regularly, for five to seven minutes, until the mixture thickens and coats the back of the spoon. Stir in the cheese, mustard and sherry, and season to taste.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put half the oil in a large, shallow casserole or 30cm ovenproof frying pan on a medium-high heat, then add the leeks and a half-teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring often, for five to seven minutes, until softened and just starting to colour in places. Stir in the garlic and saute for a minute, until fragrant.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Add the spinach, broad beans and peas, cover the pot and leave to cook for two minutes, until the spinach wilts.

Scatter this all over the top of the cheesy vegetable mix, then cover and slide on to the middle shelf of the hot oven and bake for 25 minutes. Lift off the lid, then bake for 15 minutes more, until the top is browned and the gratin is bubbling.
