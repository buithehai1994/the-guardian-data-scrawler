Several warned in a cabinet meeting of the risk of unintended consequences.David Lammy, the foreign secretary,said earlier this monththat the US plan could be a “big strategic mistake” that would allow China to step into the gap and extend its global influence.Writing in the Guardian, Lammy said the decision to cut aid was an “extremely difficult one” but added: “We are a government of pragmatists not ideologues – and we have had to balance the compassion of our internationalism with the necessity of our national security.”The government said it hoped savings could be made from the third of the development budget that goes on hotel accommodation for asylum seekers.Starmer also said the decision to cut aid had been an “extremely difficult and painful” one, but said it was necessary to increase defence spending because “a generational challenge requires a generational response”.At a Downing Street press conference, he told reporters: “I’ve taken a difficult choice today because I believe in overseas development, and I know the impact of the decision that I’ve had to take today, and I do not take it lightly.“It is not a decision that I, as a British Labour prime minister, would have wanted to take, but a decision that I must make in order to secure the security and defence of our country.”European leaders have been shocked by Trump’s hostile approach towardsUkrainein recent weeks, including falsely accusing Volodymyr Zelenskyy of being a dictator and aligning the US with Russia despite its brutal invasion.However, the UK prime minister, who is travelling to Washington for what is likely to be a diplomatically fraught visit to the White House on Thursday, denied that he had been “bounced into” increasing defence spending by Trump.The Guardian view on Starmer’s aid cuts: they won’t buy security, but they will undermine it | EditorialRead more“I think in our heart of hearts, we’ve all known that this decision has been coming for three years since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine. The last few weeks have accelerated my thinking on when we needed to make this announcement,” he said.Trump has repeatedly put pressure on European countries to take more responsibility for their own defence, after years of relying on the US. Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, described the increase as “a strong step from an enduring partner” after a call with his British counterpart.The defence spending is the equivalent of £6bn a year extra from 2027, rather than the £13.4bn claimed by Starmer, as the higher figure is dependent on the defence budget being frozen until that point, creating an artificially low baseline.Downing Street insiders believe that cutting the aid budget could be popular with the type of voters inclined to back Reform UK that Labour needs to retain. However, they acknowledge there is a risk they could lose support over the policy to the Liberal Democrats and Green party.The prime minister discussed the move with his cabinet before announcing it, officials said, and secured “agreement” before going ahead – though Downing Street would not say what the tone of the conversation had been.However, cabinet sources said that while there had been unity over increasing defence spending, several ministers had warned about the “unintended consequences” of the decision on Britain’s international reputation and influence.One source described the move as a “necessary evil”, while a second said: “It feels like a moment for the UK to really step up on defence but we’ve taken a risk internationally.The Guardian understands that the longstanding pledge to spend £11.6bn on climate finance for the developing world, made by Boris Johnson and reaffirmed by Starmer at the UN Cop29 climate summit last year, will be ringfenced despite the slashing of the budget elsewhere.Underspending on climate finance by the previous Tory government has meant the pledge – of £11.6bn in the five years to 2025-26 – will be harder to meet, with analysis last year suggesting that£3.8bn would need to be spent, taking up alarge slice of the official development assistance (ODA) budget.David Miliband, a former Labour foreign secretary who now leads the International Rescue Committee, said: “The UK government’s decision to cut aid by £6bn in order to fund defence spending is a blow to Britain’s proud reputation as a global humanitarian and development leader.”Sarah Champion, the Labour chair of the international development committee, said: “Aid and defence are linked, but they build upon each other to keep everyone safe. Cutting one to fund the other will have dire consequences for us all as it will make the world less stable.”The Tory MP Andrew Mitchell, a former international development secretary, criticised Starmer’s plan as “shortsighted and damaging”.He said: “Balancing the books on the backs of the poorest people in the world isn’t just wrong, it also makes the UK weaker and less secure. In taking this decision, the government risks cutting off its nose to spite its face.“While there is an unanswerable case for increasing defence spending, the evidence shows that doing this at the expense of international aid increases health and security risks to the UK in the long run.”Romilly Greenhill, the chief executive of Bond, which represents British aid organisations, described the development cuts as “a shortsighted and appalling move” that would undermine the UK’s global commitments and credibility, but also weaken British national security.Starmer’s visit to the White House, the second time he has met Trump, will take place days after the third anniversary ofRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, amid tensions after aUN voteand during a turbulent period in transatlantic relations.It will be thebiggest test yetof his diplomatic and negotiating skills, as he tries to balance the UK’s security and economic interests with retaining good relations with the unpredictable US president.As part of a continued Europe-wide push on security, defence ministers from across the continent are expected to meet in London on Sunday for a hastily arranged summit. Donald Tusk, the Polish prime minister, hinted at the plan earlier on Tuesday, which was then confirmed by UK sources.100 days of Trump’s presidency, with Jonathan Freedland and guestsOn 30 April, join Jonathan Freedland, Kim Darroch, Devika Bhat and Leslie Vinjamuri as they look at Trump’s presidency on his 100th day in office, live at Conway Hall, London, and livestreamed globally.Book tickets hereor atguardian.liveExplore more on these topicsDefence policyKeir StarmerAidForeign policyUS foreign policyUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

While those teams often agree on changes needed, disagreements between them have also held up key policy initiatives.However, NHSE personnel will bear the brunt of job losses, which will be “significant” in scale, it is understood. Some teams will be merged, including the two organisations’ respective communications teams, amid much closer joint working.A Whitehall source said: “In future, NHS England will still play a crucial role but it will have a smaller and leaner role. It will be a smaller role than what it’s currently doing, which is a lot, but which involves a lot of duplication.“Historically there have been too many disagreements [between the overlapping teams of officials] and duplication of tasks and roles and responsibilities.”In an example of the tension that can occur, Streeting’s desire to publish a new plan to tackle the long waits patients can face for urgent and emergency care, such as A&E treatment and getting an ambulance, has been delayed after NHS England raised doubts about whether such a plan was needed and what genuinely new initiatives could be included, one senior official said.Streeting has already removed Richard Meddings, NHS England’s Conservative-appointed chair. He has chosen Dr Penny Dash – a doctor who shares his zeal to radically reform the NHS – to replace Meddings, in a move NHS insiders and health policy experts say will strengthen Streeting’s grip.Meddings was “disappointed” and “dismayed” when the minister told him he wanted him to quit a year before the end of his four-year tenure, he told the Sunday Times recently.Dash is the chair of the north-west London integrated care board – a regional grouping of NHS trusts and local councils. She is a “no-nonsense character who is happy to provide robust challenge to senior people in the NHS about the progress they are, or aren’t, making”, according to someone who has worked closely with her.One former DHSC special adviser said Pritchard’s resignation will give Streeting more power and “is another sign of power moving back to DHSC and ministers. With Meddings and Pritchard now gone, ministers are fully in control.” The layoffs will further weaken NHS England, they added.But Sarah Woolnough, the chief executive of the King’s Fund thinktank, issued a veiled warning to Streeting not to impinge too much on the freedom that NHS England was given as a result of then health secretary Andrew Lansley’s controversial shake-up of the service in 2012.“It is crucial that the two organisations continue to work well together but equally important that NHS leaders retain operational and clinical independence for the day-to-day running of the service,” she said.Pritchard explained her “hugely difficult decision for me to stand down” saying it was her belief that the NHS needed new leadership to implement the government’s forthcoming 10-year health plan.Streeting has denied he had asked Pritchard to step down. Speaking at an event at Apple’s headquarters in London, he said: “No, I have so much respect and time for Amanda Pritchard. I’ve loved working with Amanda Pritchard for nearly eight months now, since I became health and social care secretary. She’s given me wise counsel, she’s led the NHS from the front … over the last more than half a decade now.”However, NHS sources said that in recent meetings Streeting had encouraged her to consider her future, given the major reforms he was planning, and that as a result she concluded that she should go. In an unusual move, two Commons select committees last month criticised her alleged lack of drive and dynamism.A well-placed source said that the office of Christopher Wormald, the cabinet secretary – who until recently was the DHSC’s permanent secretary – had advised Streeting to “do it nicely” when announcing Pritchard’s exit, and “make it look like she was leaving on her own terms”.Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthWes StreetingPublic financenewsShareReuse this content"

The inquiry was triggered by a 2022 Guardian and BBC News joint investigation intoallegations of sexual misconductandpredatory behaviourby the DJ.Leading KC Gemma White, who heard from more than 120 people during the inquiry, found that while there was no “significantBBCknowledge of allegations or concerns about sexual misconduct” by Westwood, there were “a range of factors which ought to have alerted the BBC to the possibility that [he] might present a risk to young women and girls”.The BBC board, which commissioned the review in 2022, added that the allegations “were treated in isolation rather than being brought together. Had this happened, the BBC may have seen a pattern of behaviour that it could have acted on.”Apologising to those affected it said: “There is evidence of bullying and misogynistic behaviour on the part of Mr Westwood and the plain fact is that his general conduct was entirely incompatible with BBC values – not just now, but then. The organisation fell short and failed people – including our own staff – who had a right to expect better from us.”The inquiry comes almost three years after a joint investigation by the Guardian and BBC News in whichseven women accused Westwood, 67, of sexual misconduct and predatory behaviour.The DJ – who became one of the best-known names in hip-hop after hosting BBC Radio 1’s first Rap Show in 1994 – denied all the allegations, with a spokesperson saying they were “completely false”.A little more than 24 hours after the publication of the allegations, and the broadcast of the BBC Three programmeTim Westwood: Abuse of Power, Westwood stepped down from his show on Capital Xtra.A further10 women made claims of sexual abuse, sexual misconduct and inappropriate behaviouragainst Westwood in another joint investigation in July. The report included a claim from a woman who said Westwood first had sex with her in the early 1990s when she was 14 and he was in his 30s. Westwood did not respond when contacted about the allegations.The women’s stories provoked a criminal inquiry by the Metropolitan police, during which the DJwas questioned under cautionby officers.The BBC external report – which was delayed after a request from the Metropolitan police – details a number of new allegations against Westwood. They include 22 testimonies from members of the public, 18 of which are redacted to protect a criminal investigation, according to a source at the BBC. White said she had been told in “numerous interviews” of a widely shared belief among Radio 1/1Xtra staff, “that Tim Westwood had a ‘type’, namely significantly younger Black women”.The new testimonies include an allegation that Westwood “hounded” a 17-year-old black girl, invited a 15- or 16-year-old girl back to his home after an under-16s night and repeatedly talked about the breasts of a 1Xtra drive-time show guest. Westwood’s lawyers told the inquiry that he “has never had any sexual interest in children under the age of 16”, had not acted in a “predatory and/or sexual manner” and “did not (and does not) present any risk to young women, at the BBC nor elsewhere”.Staff members who had worked with Westwood said he had left colleagues in tears, but many felt unable to complain because of the “feeling that … that senior management were likely to side with presenters” and a perception that the DJ was “close” with top BBC figures.Westwood – who declined to take part in the review – denied bullying and harassment. His lawyers said that on occasions he had confronted some of his colleagues’ “poor attitude to work” and accepted that this “contributed to a divisive atmosphere” in some teams.White found evidence of senior management “reacting firmly” to public complaints about the DJ, and wanting to create an environment where employees could raise concerns. But a “lack of formality” was likely to have left employees not feeling confident that concerns about the DJ “would be properly addressed.”Sophie*, who gave evidence to the inquiry after speaking to the Guardian and BBC News, said the apology from the BBC “not good enough”.“He’s not the first, definitely won’t be the last,” she said. “It is good that it has come out, because everybody should be accountable for their actions. I hope something positive can come from it, but I feel like it’s just a tick box.”The report had to be a “watershed moment” for the BBC, said Philippa Childs, head of the Bectu union. “The review’s findings all too plainly speak to the culture of extreme power dynamics and ‘untouchable’ talent that persists in the creative industries,” she said.The BBCannounced an independent reviewinto its workplace culture last August after the disgraced former presenter Huw Edwardspleaded guiltyto possessing indecent images of children. It also apologised in January aftera review into the behaviour of Russell Brand.On Tuesday it said the BBC had “been too siloed [and] deferential to high profile individuals”. That had changed “considerably” since Westwood left in 2013, and processes and policies had been improved.In a meeting with the BBC director general, Tim Davie, on Tuesday the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, said it was essential that BBC staff and the wider public could have confidence in the national broadcaster. “The allegations against Tim Westwood are very serious,” said Nandy.“There have been far too many instances of appalling behaviour in the media industry and there has been a culture of silence around inappropriate behaviour for too long. This cannot continue. In my discussion with the BBC director general, I was clear that the BBC board and executive must grip the issue of workplace culture and respond at pace to the independent review they have commissioned as soon as it has concluded.”In November, the Met said Westwood had been interviewed under caution on four separate occasions regarding offences alleged to have happened in London between 1982 and 2016 and confirmed it had submitted a file to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). On Tuesday, a CPS spokesperson said it had no updates to provide on the case.* Name has been changed.Explore more on these topicsTim WestwoodBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

Israeli forces have remained there ever since, despite protests by Syria’s new government and the UN, which monitors the demilitarised zone between the two countries.Israel’s air force also carried out hundreds of airstrikesagainst weapons depots, naval bases and Syrian military infrastructure in the weeks after the fall of the Assad regime in an attempt to prevent the weaponry from falling into rebel hands. Israeli airstrikes in Syria had mostly stopped since the new year.Hours before the Israeli bombings on Tuesday, Syria condemned Israel’s invasion of the buffer zone and called for it to withdraw its forces from Syrian territory. The statement was issued at the end of a national dialogue conference which gathered hundreds of Syrian activists and leaders to plan the country’s post-Assad political transition.Besides verbal condemnations, the new Syrian government has not confronted Israeli forces in Syria. Battered by 14 years of civil war and still building the country’s new army, the Syrian military has little capacity for a fight with its heavily armed southern neighbour.Though Syria officially dissolved all military factions on 29 January, the new government has not yet managed to form a national army. In practice, disparate militias are still not entirely under state control, with the defence ministry working out how to absorb tens of thousands of rebel fighters.Prior to the fall of Assad, Israel bombed Syria periodically, though it usually did not publicly claim responsibility for the strikes. Most of Israel’s military activity in Syria was concentrated on Iranian forces and weapons transfers to Hezbollah in Lebanon.Hezbollah and Iranian-backed forces left Syria in the run-up to the fall of Assad. However, Israel also views Syria’s new rulers with suspicion, with Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, on Monday calling the new rulers of Syria a “jihadist, Islamist terror group”.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The exact cause remains unknown,” a WHO spokesperson, Tarik Jašarević, told a briefing on Tuesday.The villages have limited surveillance capacity and health infrastructure, he noted.The larger outbreak, reported on 13 February from Bomate village in the Basankusu health zone, has killed 45 people out of 419 cases.The interval between the onset of symptoms – which include fever, vomiting and internal bleeding – and death has been 48 hours in most cases and “that’s what’s really worrying”, said Serge Ngalebato, medical director of Bikoro hospital, a regional monitoring centre.Samples from 13 cases have tested negative forEbolaand Marburg, but the WHO said health teams were locally investigating other potential causes, including malaria, food poisoning, typhoid, meningitis or other viral haemorrhagic fevers.An earlier outbreak, involving eight deaths among 12 cases, was reported from Boloko village in the Bolomba health zone on 21 January, the WHO said.This outbreak was traced back to three deaths among children under five years old in the village earlier that month. Symptoms including fever and fatigue progressed to haemorrhagic signs such as nosebleeds and vomiting blood.Reports indicated that the children had eaten a dead bat before falling ill.The other cases were found in Boloko and the nearby Dondo village, all with similar symptoms.The WHO said no links had been established between the two clusters of cases.“We are looking into whether it is another infection or whether it is some toxic agent. We have to see what can be done and at what point WHO can support,” said Jašarević, noting similar outbreaks in the past.An outbreak of unknown cause reported in the DRC in December wasultimately identified as malaria.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaEbolaHealthInfectious diseasesShareReuse this content"

By 2016, he was the proud owner of a Tesla, revelling in the thumbs up he would get from other drivers as he whizzed along Europe’s highways in the electric vehicle.But of late the sheen of owning a Tesla has begun to wear off. For years the brand has been synonymous with Elon Musk and his stance against the climate crisis. Recently, Schwede watched aghast as the Tesla CEOpoured hundreds of millionsinto backing Donald Trump as he made promises to ramp up domestic oil and gas production.“He was getting more and more weird,” said Schwede, an entrepreneur and digital strategist based in Switzerland. The final straw came when Musk made back-to-backfascist-style salutesduring Trump’s inauguration in January. “I felt nothing but utter disgust,” said Schwede. “And I no longer enjoyed sitting in my Tesla.”On Tuesday, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association showedsales of new Tesla cars almost halvedin Europe last month. The figures left analysts scrambling to assess how big a factor customers turning their backs on the brand because of Musk’s foray into far-right politics may be.The Texas-based carmaker sold 9,945 vehicles in Europe in January, down 45% from last year’s 18,161, the association said.View image in fullscreenA parody ‘Tesla – The Swasticar’ advert posted at a London bus stop.Photograph: People vs ElonNow, there are signs existingTeslaowners who have become disgruntled with Musk’s views are making their anger heard.Schwede contemplated selling his car, but after racking up more than 60,000 miles on it, there was little value left in it. So he came up with his own means of reclaiming his Tesla and the liberal ethos that had underpinned his purchase; he began donating 10 cents for every kilometre driven to a range of charities, countering Musk’s support of the far right with direct support tothose who help LGBTQ+ youthor fight hate and extremism. “It was something Elon wouldn’t like,” he said. “That’s my personal revenge.”It’s a hint of how some Tesla owners in Europe are fighting back, putting up their own – albeit small-scale – resistance as Musk wades into global politics, using his wealth to help secure Trump’s return to the White House and his sprawling influence to back far-right and anti-establishment parties across Europe.For Germany’s Patrik Schneider, the turning point came as he was heckled by a stranger at a petrol station, who pointed to his Tesla and called him a Trump supporter. Saddled with a long-term lease on the vehicle, he scrambled to find a way to address his relationship with a brand that – in his mind – had soured.“Of course, as a Tesla driver you were always the fool: the Green party voter, the world saviour, the CO2guy,” Schneider told Germany’s Capital.de media. “But now you’re in a category that’s no longer funny.”What he came up with was a line of “Anti-Elon stickers” for Tesla cars. In an echo ofan American initiative,he began selling the stickers online six months ago, taking orders for messages that range from “I bought this before Elon went crazy” to “Elon sucks”.As Musk waded more deeply into German politics,hosting the far-right AfD’s co-leader, Alice Weidel, in an interview on X andturning up at an AfD rallywhere he disparaged multiculturalism and lambasted the country’s focus on “past guilt”, demand for the stickers soared.View image in fullscreenThe far-right AfD’s Alice Weidel talks online to Elon Musk during her speech at an election campaign launch.Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/EPADemand has now climbed to as much as 2,000 stickers a day, with orders pouring in from across the German-speaking world but as far as Australia and South Korea. All of it was done without any advertising, said Schneider, adding wryly: “Elon Musk does that for us.”Others have called for the actions to go further. In Poland – where the Nazi German occupation led to the deaths of 6 million Poles, including 3 million Jews – the country’s tourism minister called on citizens to boycott Tesla after Musk’s surprise appearance at the AfD rally. “All I can say is that probably no normal Pole should buy a Tesla any more,” Sławomir Nitras recently told Polish broadcaster Tok FM. “A serious and strong response is necessary, including a consumer boycott.”In August, the German drugstore chain Rossmann saidit would no longer buy Tesla cars for its corporate fleet, citing Musk’s support for Trump, while the German energy company LichtBlick said on social media that it would be “pulling the plug” on the Tesla vehicles in its fleet, citing Musk’s backing of “a rightwing populist and extremist party”.The message was echoed recently by UK-based campaign group Led by Donkeys after theyprojected images of Musk’s salute on to the facade of the Tesla gigafactorynear Berlin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Tottenham, north London, a member of the activist group People vs Elon took a cardboard cutout of Musk’s salute into a Tesla dealership.In Sweden, the EV maker Polestar has sought to capitalise on the discontent. “We get a lot of people writing that they don’t like all this,” the company’s CEO, Michael Lohscheller,told Bloomberg, adding that he had directed sales staff to target disgruntled Tesla owners.After a Dutch pollsuggested31% of respondents who owned Teslas were considering selling them or had already done so, it remains to be seen what the impact will be on the company. Matthias Schmidt, a Germany-based automotive analyst, said “2025 will be one of the biggest tests for Tesla.”“With all respect, consumers tend to be like goldfish; they tend to forget things very quickly,” Schmidt added. “But Germany is potentially slightly different because of its history … The shift to him backing the AfD was potentially far more damaging in Germany than his move to back Trump.”View image in fullscreenElon Musk wields a chainsaw during his appearance at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in the US.Photograph: Carol Guzy/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockLast year, Tesla saw sales in Germanyplunge 41%– outpacing the overall 27% decline in EVs across the country – as rivals rolled out their own electric vehicles and governments rolled back subsidies.Figures for early 2025showthat Tesla sales fell sharply across several European markets. Registrations were down 63% on a year earlier in France, 59% in Germany, 44% in Sweden, 38% in Norway and 12% in the UK.While buyers could be reacting to Musk’s comments, other factors may also be at play as consumers await Tesla’s release of the updated Y model, said Schmidt.When contacted by the Guardian, Tesla did not reply to a request for comment. But late last month, Musk appeared to be upbeat during a call with investors, hinting that 2025 may be a tough year but that 2026 would be “epic” for the company.“Musk is kind of like a character that – like a cat – has nine lives,” said Schmidt. “And he’s almost used up those nine lives.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.London fashion week took place this weekend, with established brands and new talent on the schedule. But, when it comes to independent labels, the hot ticket among young fashion editors, art world mavens and film stars is the Irish-born designer Simone Rocha.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Her show on Sunday afternoon took place in the grand environs of Goldsmiths’ Hall, a Grade I-listed building that serves as the headquarters of London’s goldsmith guild. The front row was packed with editors from Elle and Vogue, and Rocha flexed her connections to celebrities. Rather than having them watching on, Alexa Chung and actors Fiona Shaw, Andrea Riseborough and Bel Powley walked in the show.Part of Rocha’s might is down to that enviable quality in fashion: a unique and identifiable aesthetic – one made of girlie sweetness (bows, frills, lace) – and the seriousness of thoughtful references. That was the case here too, with her signature styles out to play. The clothes were a mix of tailoring, evening wear and … the rest, from Rocha’s take on a rugby shirt to a football scarf. Partly inspired by the fable The Tortoise and the Hare, models carried cuddly toys.View image in fullscreenRocha takes a bow after her show at Goldsmiths’ Hall in February.Photograph: Stuart C Wilson/Getty ImagesFounded in 2010, Rocha’s label, which now includes menswear as well as womenswear, has attracted a fanbase that is intense in its ardour – members include the artist Laila Gohar, the dancer Francesca Hayward and the playwright Jeremy O. Harris. Mandy Lee, a fashion analyst who runs the Old Loser in Brooklyn account on TikTok,describes herself as obsessedwith the brand and wore the designer for her recent wedding. In a 2023profile of Rocha in GQ, writer Murray Clark describes the designer’s studio as “so Simone Rocha”, implying that fans would be able to conjure up exactly what that means.Rocha, 38, is based in east London but she grew up in Dublin, the daughter of the designerJohn Rocha, who was a stalwart of London fashion during the 1980s and 90s, and Odette Rocha, who worked in the business. Simone says her father’s studio was formative “I was always very, very happy there”View image in fullscreenMikey Madison wearing Simone Rocha at the London Critics’ Circle film awards in February.Photograph: Scott A Garfitt/Invision/APAs the daughter of a famous designer, did her peers judge her as she begun to make her own way in fashion? The label of ‘nepo baby’ is now ingrained in pop culture, aimed at everyone from Kendall Jenner to Romeo Beckham. “Once you’re in fashion everyone is up for criticism,” Rocha says simply.If the clothes are expensive – there’s very little on the website under £200 – Rocha’s influence has rippled out to more accessible trends. Those bows that formed the cornerstone of last year’scoquette aesthetic, which can now be found everywhere fromClaire’stoZara, can be traced back to her. In fact, Rocha wore a bow in her hair at the show, as well as on the day we spoke a few weeks beforehand. She describes it as “part of my signature”, but is happy the detail has made its way beyond high fashion. “Oh, it’s fantastic,” she says. “I love that the aesthetic of being feminine or flirtatious or playful can still feel grounded in reality.”With women’s reproductive rights curtailed in the US, and the burgeoning of movements such as “trad wife”, which celebrates traditional gender roles, have her symbols of overt femininity become a kind of rebellion? “Absolutely,” says Rocha. “I see [them] as a layer of protection and a layer of defiance.”Rocha’s clothes are sold in high-end stores such as Dover Street Market and Selfridges, and worn by actors on the red carpet – as well as fashion lovers with events to dress for. Anora’s Mikey Madison wore a red satin halter-neck gown to the London Critics’ Circle awards, while Harris chose arose-decorated transparent coatfrom the brand for the premiere of Wicked. The dress worn by Shaw on Sunday, with ruffles at the knee and neck, is sure to find its way into artistic wardrobes next season.The company’s turnover has seen double digit growth over the past five years, and there are now flagship stores in London, New York and Taipei. Menswear, which launched in 2023, is a big part of this, with sales doubling in two years.View image in fullscreenSimone Rocha.Photograph: William WaterworthThe success of the menswear is proof that there is demand for designs subverting established ideas of what a man “should” wear. In Rocha’s world, men are just as likely as women to wear pearls, rose prints or pink – as was evident at her show. “I think people feel powerful dressing today by being themselves,” she argues, “and now there’s much more of a licence to dress in a way that you want to.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There was an embroidered suit worn with a mullet at the SAG awards in 2023, and a top decorated with roses for a recent TV appearance. Members of the Dublin band Fontaines DC have also worn her clothes. “It’s incredible for me to be able to dress someone who is so talented in their own field,” she says.View image in fullscreenPaul Mescal wearing Simone Rocha – and a mullet – at the SAG Awards in 2023.Photograph: Valérie Macon/AFP/Getty ImagesAs well as a successful label, Rocha’s profile has grown through collaborations. In 2021 sheworked with H&Mon a sell-out collection, and last year she produced a celebrated couture collection forJean Paul Gaultier,, while her pearly take on Crocs is consistently popular. H&M was, she says, a no-brainer. “As a student, I queued for Comme des Garçons, Marni and Margiela [collaborations],” she says. She loved seeing a new generation do the same for her designs. “I’m aware that my identity is very specific, so it was insane to see all these people knowing it and queueing up [for it.]”As one of the most talented and popular designers of her generation, Rocha will no doubt have been courted by bigger brands to become a creative director. But she has witnessed the turbulent “musical chairs” of the industry, with different names taking jobs at top houses only to be ousted two years later. “At this moment in time, it’s very transient, and I think that’s very scary,” she says. “I want to do what I do, and do it very well, and [I am] very lucky I can do it for myself.”View image in fullscreenA tutu and denim jacket for the Simone Rocha SS25 show, partly inspired by choreographer Pina Bausch.Photograph: ShutterstockRocha is known for collections that have a backstory or meticulous research (for this interview she sits backdropped by shelves of books). “Some collections are very autobiographical … looking at my own heritage, which is Irish and Chinese,” she explains. Sometimes, the collections are more about being “a voyeur”, she says, namechecking the collection inspired by Bausch.But, despite the historical references, she is clear that her work is always for the moment – “I’m really into designing everything to feel very, very present, like ‘this is the only time this could happen’,” she says. And nothing could feel more of-the-moment than the Academy awards ceremony, which takes place in Hollywood on Sunday amid a fractured political and social landscape, where the relationship between gender and power is in dangerous flux. In this climate, it feels likely we will see at least some actors express themselves – and a subtle defiance – via that quietly subversive “so Simone Rocha” look.Explore more on these topicsLondon fashion weekFashion weeksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Everyone knows he’s not Mr Charisma; could he be Mr Competent? Huh – after six months of bad optics, that wasn’t flying either.On Tuesday, it turned out that he is incredibly good at surprise escalation. Before noon, we were in a world where the prime minister was about to ride two horses all the way to the US – the horse that supported Ukraine, and the horse that was happy to see a “peace deal” devised by Putin and bloviated by Trump.Starmer slashes aid to fund major increase in defence spendingRead moreAfter noon, when Starmer addressed the Commons, wherever we were, we weren’t there any more. “The historical load we must carry to fulfil our duty is not as light as it once was,” he said, and this is politics in old money, insofar as it makes no sense at all. History itself doesn’t get any heavier – recall the old proverb about a pound of feathers versus a pound of lead. Unless, of course, you mean history as recent as last week, andDonald Trump’s refashioning of Volodymyr Zelenskyy as the real dictator; in which case, why not just say: “the load of last week has been considerably heavier, since last week happened”?Unarguably, though, Starmer made some arguments that resulted in concrete decisions: and that, alone, was incredibly surprising. Some of them were obvious – he was a young man when the Berlin Wall came down, he reminded the house and, later, the nation: he thought he was looking at eternal peace in Europe. The sight of Russian tanks rolling into cities was something bigger than another round of bad news in a bleak few years: it was the end of an era. “Instability in Europe will always wash up on our shores. Tyrants like Putin will only respond to strength. We must stand by Ukraine, because if we do not achieve a lasting peace, the threats to our security will only grow.” OK, 2022 called: it wants its arguments back; also its bubble tea.The difference this time was the follow-through.Defence spending will rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, and 3% in the next parliament. This will come out of the aid budget, which can plug the gaps to get defence to 2.5 – although charities are already staggered by the trade off – but can’t get it to 3%.Various journalists raised this in the press conference later in the day, and whatever you think of that “tough choice” – Ed Davey doubtless spoke for many when he said that it should come from frozen Russian assets and taxing super-wealth rather than the most ravaged countries on earth – it was stunningly unexpected, again, to hear a Labour politician say what they should have been saying since forever. In so many words: you people can’t have it both ways. You can’t demand tax cuts and social justice. You can’t have security on thin air. You can’t keep demanding contradictory things, just because you have a mic and a commanding voice. It was so refreshing to hear that case made bluntly – that to spend nothing at all cannot be the primary purpose of government – I may have embellished it a bit.Sky’s Beth Rigby didn’t ask an austerity business-as-usual question. She landed two other points. First, was Trump, afterhis casual destruction of USAid, the real reason this money was coming from the aid budget? Was Starmer performing Churchillian independence of mind, while getting his ideas from the hooligan’s playbook? Starmer’s answer was actually quite good, and I don’t say that lightly: “I’ve been arguing for some time that European countries needed to do more. Yes, it’s true, President Trump thinks we should do more, and I agree with him.” Strictly speaking, it did not answer the question, but it was still deft: it could flatter a dumb adversary, which Trump certainly is, into thinking he’d won, without surrendering anything real, in terms of values.The best exchange by far was with Chris Hope from GB News. Defence spending up by yay much in 2027, more still in the next parliament: these were all promises in the Reform manifesto. In a blokey, mischievous, slightly needling voice, he asked: “Are you Nigel Farage in disguise?” Hope hadn’t read the room. “Nigel Farage didn’t even turn up to the debate in parliament today,” Starmer replied, impatiently. “Nigel Farage is fawning over Putin. That is not patriotism. What I’ve done is take the duty of prime minister seriously.” Is this actually the beginning of something where we don’t have to pore over polls and say: “Reform are doing well, ergo Reform must be making sense, ergo we must all be more like Reform?” Too early to say; we can but hope.Rigby’s other point was a little chilling: “You sound like a prime minister on a war footing. Should viewers be alarmed?” And Starmer didn’t really need to answer that, as his two speeches had said enough: I surprised you, didn’t I? Of course you should be alarmed.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchKeir StarmerDefence policyHouse of CommonsForeign policyAidcommentShareReuse this content"

Don’t let it get away!Lucy ManganTue 25 Feb 2025 09.51 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 12.00 ESTShareThe One That Got Away is a rare double delight – something not just better than you were expecting, but better than it needs to be. It is the English-language remake of the Welsh drama Cleddau, by Catherine Tregenna, in which two detectives with a shared past are forced into partnership once more when a new crime has echoes of a historical murder they worked on together. Is it a copycat, or did they put away the wrong man? Could there be another explanation? And when are the two detectives with a shared past going to have sex?So far, so classic premise. If, as I do, you believe it is a classic for a reason, you will already be happy to spend six hours in TOTGA’s warm embrace. If you do not, then you will miss a smartly plotted thriller, set in a Cambrian seaside town, that captures the warm intimacy and chilly bleakness of small-town life. You will also miss a drama that provides an astute portrait of complicated adults with complicated relationships that holds the attention no less than the twisty narrative.The two detectives are DI Ffion Lloyd (Elen Rhys, who featured inthe bilingual drama Craith/Hidden) and DS Rick Sheldon (Richard Harrington, perhaps best known forY Gwyll/Hinterland). Fifteen years ago, they put away a man called Paul Harvey (Ian Puleston-Davies) for drugging and murdering two nurses. The town was shattered. Lloyd left; Sheldon stayed, got married and watched the place put itself back together.The first episode opens in the present day with the discovery of the body of another nurse, Abbi (Bethan McLean). She is found near the same heart-knot motif that accompanied the previous murders. Lloyd is recalled from her new job and before long she and Sheldon – soon revealed to have been “a cheater” – are working seamlessly professionally and awkwardly personally on the case. When I say “awkwardly”, I mean just that. I heartily thank whoever it was that decided the usual histrionics (furiously whispered, erotically charged arguments in corridors) could be forgone and replaced with the best efforts of two people old enough to know that they should save their energy for white-knuckling it through another rubbish bit of life.View image in fullscreenBethan McLean as Abbi.Photograph: Simon Ridgway/BBC/BacklightDiscarded pregnancy tests, sketches in a caravan, drugs flushed down a toilet and other clues amass. Suspects gather – including Abbi’s steroid-abusing boyfriend Darrell (Rick Yale), then her obsessed and unstable ex, Ryan (whose text messages telling her to come to the woods were among the last to be read on her phone). Storylines layer – then are promptly ripped apart at the end of each episode by a cliffhanger, provided by mysterious tattooed men in woods or something equally irresistible.Lloyd is staying with her parents. Her sister, Lisa (Hannah Daniel), is a frequent visitor. The resentment that Lloyd’s arrival brings (not helped by immediate recommendations for the treatment of her father, who has the beginnings of dementia, in the face of Lisa’s and their mother’s daily care) is precisely drawn; deep, dark feelings have long been festering. “When you come home,” says Lisa to Lloyd, “life feels smaller.” The family dynamics feel painfully real, not least because they do not affect the abiding love the Lloyds have for each other at their cores.Meanwhile, hormones, doubts, frustrations, anger, regret and yearning are zipping their way around the wife-husband-ex triangle. When circumstances conspire to take Sheldon’s watchful wife (and Abbi’s colleague), Helen (Rhian Blythe), out of the picture, they then switch back with equal ferocity around the husband-ex loop. Another rarity, I must note, is the length of time for which you cannot say with certainty which way Lloyd and Sheldon will fall. To manage to instil any credible doubt in the will-they-won’t-they trope in this day and age is an achievement that deserves its own special award.In short, The One That Got Away is a great psychological drama attached to a cracking crime thriller. Or a cracking crime thriller attached to a great psychological drama; I am not sure. Either way, it’s a supremely satisfying treat. Don’t – I think I am contractually obliged to say this – let it get away.The One That Got Away airs on BBC Four and is available on BBC iPlayerExplore more on these topicsTV crime dramaTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

As an avid climber who’s tried countless training tools over the past eight years, I have a good idea of what works and what doesn’t – because I’ve spent a lot of money finding out the hard way.But first I need to tackle the subject of climbing footwear: if there’s one thing you can’t go bouldering without, it’s a decent pair of climbing shoes.The best climbing shoes to wear boulderingView image in fullscreenBuying your own climbing shoes may save you money if you’re renting them regularly.Photograph: takoburito/Getty Images/iStockphotoI’ve owned plenty of climbing shoes over the years, but I sought help from an expert here:Imi Bagnall-Smithis a professional route setter and coach atCatalyst Climbing, a London-based team offering coaching for all levels. Climbing shoes can vary widely, and I’ve not tried on nearly as many as Bagnall-Smith. Crucially, through working with her clients, she has been able to see the types of shoes that work best for new climbers.Budget climbing shoe:Simond Klimb unisexView image in fullscreen£54.99 at DecathlonClimbing shoes aren’t cheap. “Nowadays, very few – if any – of the specialist climbing brands offer shoes for less than £100,” says Bagnall-Smith. “For a low-budget first pair of shoes, I’d look to Decathlon’s Simond.”I’ve owned a pair of Simonds for years, so I have to agree. At only £55, the Simond climbing shoe lacks the premium features of pricier options, such as elasticised tension systems or specialised rubber for heel and toe hooking, but it’s still a good starting point. It’s comfortable and easy to adjust, with soles coated in industry-standard XS Grip rubber to keep your feet secure on the wall.If you’re a beginner, though, renting shoes is a good starting point. “Most people will do this for a month or two,” says Bagnall-Smith. “However, once you start climbing more regularly, it can be nicer to have your own pair of shoes that fit your foot shape well, and have only been worn by your feet.”Buying a pair is particularly worth it once you start climbing regularly, because you know you’ll save money in the long run (renting shoes is £4 a go at my gym).Mid-priced climbing shoe:La Sportiva Tarantula BoulderView image in fullscreenMen’s£99 at La Sportiva£99 at Go OutdoorsWomen’s£99 at La Sportiva£90 at Cotswold Outdoor“If you can afford it, a beginner model from renowned climbing brands Scarpa or La Sportiva would be a great investment,” says Bagnall-Smith. The La Sportiva Tarantula Boulder, for example, has been designed with beginner boulderers in mind, featuring a neutral shape to fit all foot types.After something cheaper? Bagnall-Smith recommends theScarpa Reflex VS(£85): “A flat, beginner-oriented model with two Velcro straps for better fit adjustment. The rubber is sticky but durable, and they will help you transition from rentals to your own shoes.“I’d recommend trying them on and choosing whichever fits best. While climbing shoes aren’t always comfortable, a better fit makes a huge difference.”Premium climbing shoe:Scarpa VeloceView image in fullscreenMen’s£140 at Go OutdoorsWomen’s£140 at Go OutdoorsLooking for the ultimate beginner climbing shoe? These are the ones, according to Bagnall-Smith. “Whenever I’m recommending climbing shoes to a newer indoor climber, there’s one pair I pick every time: the Scarpa Veloce,” she says. “At £140, they’re slightly more expensive than other beginner shoes, but the quality is high. They make standing on indoor holds and structures feel more secure.”Bagnall-Smith describes them as “almost like a sticky, squishy, rubber sock, with the grippiest rubber of any beginner model I’ve tried.” And because of the soft S72 rubber, they’re more comfortable than other shoes at this price. “They don’t cause the same pressure points or dig in very much, so I find it much easier to wear them for a whole session,” she says. These shoes are also vegan-friendly, ideal for those wanting to avoid animal-based materials and glues.Essential bouldering equipmentView image in fullscreenApplying chalk can help build your confidence.Photograph: Trevor Williams/Getty ImagesClimbingchalk:Moon Dust loose chalkView image in fullscreen£8 for 300g at TisoMost climbers will “chalk up” before every boulder. The main purpose is to increase the friction between your skin and the climbing holds through sweat absorption, though you could argue the psychological boost is equally important. Before trying a boulder that’s at my physical limit, I want to do everything I can to improve my chances. The careful application of chalk builds my confidence and makes me push that much harder on an attempt. Call it a placebo, but it works for me – and for everyone else I climb with.Moon Dust is a mid-priced chalk, but it more than holds its own against pricier versions. I’ve tried many chalk brands over the years, and find the grittier texture of Moon Dust helps it to stay on my hands that bit longer. Compared with finer-powder chalks, it’s less prone to exploding all over the gym like a smoke grenade when you accidentally kick over your chalk bag.Chalkbag:Organic Climbing lunch bagView image in fullscreen£38.50 at Ellis BrighamWhile nothing is stopping you from dipping your hands straight into the chalk packet as you make your way around the gym, a chalk bag – or boulder bucket – is a much more elegant solution. The lunch bag from Organic Climbing is a popular choice due to its modest price, sturdy construction and fetching patterns, the latter being unique to each bag. It has everything you need from a bouldering bucket, with a Velcro seal, two elastic brush holders and a zippered back pocket to store your phone and keys. Oh, and it holds loads of chalk, which is fairly important.Holdbrush:Metolius M-16 brushView image in fullscreen£4.94 at SportsShoesOver time, chalk and burned shoe rubber build up on the holds of the gym wall, reducing that all-important friction between you and the plastic. Giving them a quick clean with a good brush can make all the difference when tackling a tricky boulder, especially if it’s a popular (and therefore dirtier) climb.The M-16 was originally designed as a maintenance tool for assault rifles, but it also turns out to be effective at cleaning climbing holds – a much better use for a brush. The brush’s large end is better for dusting off small to medium climbing holds, while the smaller brush works well for scrubbing tiny crimps and foot edges.Fingertape:Beta tape 2.5cm x 10mView image in fullscreen£6 at TisoFinger tape is primarily used for support after an injury, but it has many other uses when climbing. It’s common practice to wrap tape over any cuts and blisters, for example, because a plaster won’t stay in place when pulling on holds. Crack climbers use this kind of tape to cover their entire hands, almost like a glove, although this specialist type of climbing is rarely replicated in gyms.Boulderingpad:Organic Climbing Simple padView image in fullscreen£230 at Blacks£250 at Go OutdoorsReady for real rock in the great outdoors? Then you’ll need something to land on that’s not the ground. There’s no golden rule for buying a crash pad; they vary, and every climber has their preference. Some bouldering pads are wider than others, some have denser foam – some even have little carpets for wiping muck off your shoes. Ultimately, any will be better than no pad at all. If you don’t know where to start and want something reliable, you can’t go wrong with the Organic Climbing Simple pad. It looks pretty, folds in half to transport, and it’s built to last.Moistureabsorbers:SmellWell freshener insertsView image in fullscreen£9.95 at VibramClimbing shoes are inherently disgusting. When you take them off after a long session on the wall, you leave behind a potent brew of sweat and skin that will fester for days unless you take immediate corrective action. The first step is to limit bacterial growth by drying out the shoes with a moisture absorber. SmellWell’s freshener inserts are just the right size to pop inside your climbing shoes. By the time you get home, they should have soaked up the worst of the damage, drying out your shoes and suffusing them with a pleasing natural scent.Shoefresheners:Boot BananasView image in fullscreen£15 at Go Outdoors£16.50 at AmazonOnce your shoes are almost dry, it’s time to pop in a pair of Boot Bananas. These brightly coloured shoe fresheners carry an invigorating lavender fragrance that overpowers all but the most heinous of foot odours. They also have antimicrobial properties that can keep bacteria at bay, prolonging your shoes’ lifespan.The outer fabric and inner charcoal act as additional moisture absorbers, but the effect is limited, so don’t rely on this alone. Dry out the shoes first, either with the moisture absorbers above or a hairdryer. You’ll know when your Boot Bananas need to be replaced because they slowly turn brown – or “ripen” – over time. It’s an intentional feature – nothing to be worried about.Shoecleaner:Shoe ChalkView image in fullscreen£4.32 at Banana FingersCleaning climbing shoes is a controversial topic. Naturally, you don’t want to wreck their structural integrity by leaving them to soak in a bucket or – even worse – throwing them in the wash. Shoe chalk has been designed specifically to clean out the inside of climbing shoes, flushing out the grime while leaving the outer materials untouched.Climbing training aidsView image in fullscreenBands are ideal for warming up.Resistancebands:Lattice Training resistance bandsView image in fullscreen£12.50 for five at Lattice TrainingBands are versatile training tools, allowing you to perform effective non-impact warmups to prevent injuries while improving your strength and mobility. Bands can also be used to bridge the gap if you can’t yet perform pull-ups; looped around the bar and your feet, the band offsets your body weight so that you can gradually build enough strength to perform the exercise unassisted.Yogamat:Lattice Training flex matView image in fullscreen£55 at Lattice TrainingAs you ascend the grades, flexibility becomes increasingly important. Lattice Training’s flex yoga mat is designed for climbers. Its laser-etched scales and angle markers let you measure your body’s exact limitations in various poses, so you can easily track progress. The non-slip cork surface and rubber base are major plus points.Fingerstrengthtraining:Beastmaker 1000 SeriesView image in fullscreen£95 at Beastmaker£87 at AmazonSooner or later you’ll hit a plateau that sees you “stuck” at a certain grade for longer than you’d like. This may be the moment to start climbing-specific finger training, AKA hangboarding. Do you need to hangboard? No. But it’s the best-known way to consistently and progressively train your finger strength on small edges while avoiding injury.The Beastmaker 1000 Series is one of the more accessible hangboards because of the two large handles on the top row. Set at shoulder width, they’re ideal for practising pull-ups, lock-offs and one-arm hangs before getting to grips with the smaller edges on the board. Beastmaker has an accompanying book and app, so you can follow along with the programme to incrementally increase the difficulty of your routine.Extensorbands:The Hand BandView image in fullscreen£12.99 at AmazonAlthough climbing relies heavily on the forearm’s flexor muscles, the extensor muscles play an important part in your overall grip strength. The stronger your extensors are, the better supported your fingers are while climbing. That’s where a set of extensor bands comes in. The beauty of these is that you can use them anywhere; stick some in your pocket and take them out whenever you’re bored.Don’t bother with …High-resistancegriptrainersThe closed-hand strength that these grippers help to build isn’t that transferable to climbing, where open-hand grip strength is king. A handheld grip trainer routine won’t improve your climbing, with thepossibleexception of pulling on pinch holds. This is a lesson I learned the hard way. That said, some climbers find low-resistance grippers useful for warming up their fingers.Extremely undersized climbing shoesSome climbers believe that, for optimum performance, you need shoes so small that they’re actually painful to wear. It’s bad advice. “Climbing shoes are designed to be worn with a fairly tight fit that hugs the feet closely, so you may have to downsize from your street shoe size (usually 1-2 EU sizes),” says Bagnall-Smith. But that doesn’t mean downsizing to the point where you’re in pain and feeling the need to take them off after every single boulder. You just want to make sure that your feet aren’t sliding around, and that the shoes hold firm when performing high-tension manoeuvres, such as smearing and heel-hooking.Bagnall-Smith also recommends going in person to try on as many shoes as possible. “Usually the staff can give helpful guidance on sizing, and foot shape can play a huge role in how shoes fit,” she says. “Sometimes you might need to try on a few before you find one that fits just right.”On a personal note, I once watched a man spend two minutes putting on a single shoe at the gym. The grunts of pain and bulging neck veins were something to behold. Frankly, if the act of pulling on your shoes is more strenuous than the boulders you climb once they’re on, you may need bigger shoes.Ankle weights, wrist weights and weighted vestsAdding weight to your body will obviously make it more difficult to pull yourself up the wall. In theory, this will result in greater strength gains and better climbing. In reality, however, adding weights may actively prevent you from improving your technique on the wall while also increasing the risk of injury, especially if you’re really piling on the kilos.Instead of adding weight to make climbing harder, you should focus on efficient body movement to make climbing easier. The exception is in off-the-wall training, where adding weights to a vest or harness when doing pull-ups or max-limit hangs can be advantageous.Explore more on these topicsFitnessThe FilterHealth & wellbeingHobbiesbest ofShareReuse this content"

The vinyl-carver sparking a craze for cutting records at homeUsing a diamond needle, lathe-cutters can turn blank vinyl discs into your very own record – with a pressing run of however many or few you fancy. We report on a booming businessDaniel Dylan WrayTue 25 Feb 2025 10.20 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 10.23 ESTShareIf you want to buy a bespoke, brand-new machine to cut your own vinyl records at home, there seems to be just one man who can help you. Ulrich Sourisseau’sworkshop is in a disused railway station in a remote part of the Black Forest in Germany, and he is in extremely high demand. He’s selective about who he sells his machines to, and if he does agree to make you a bit of kit, he’s a little old-school. “He’s cash-only, so I had to travel there with €7,000 on me,” recalls Jon Downing, who bought one back in 2017.Downing then began running his own micro record label in Sheffield, Do It Thissen (that’s “do it yourself” in Yorkshire dialect), specialising in music from his home region. It was a retirement project “to keep me out of mischief and give something back to the local scene,” he says, but Downing has since put out 75 records, from the wonky weirdo punk ofDearthwormsto the psychedelic krautpop ofSister Wives, which he personally cut in his shed at the bottom of the garden.View image in fullscreen‘It keeps me out of mischief’ … Jon Downing of Do It Thissen records at his lathe.Photograph: Jon DowningThe lathe-cutting machine he picked up in Germany produces records one at a time using a diamond needle. They are cut in real time on to blank vinyl discs from a digital source. And this service, and the record labels using it, are booming. “When I wrote our business plan seven years ago I did loads of research and I found maybe two or three other lathe-cutting services,” says Tasha Trigger, who co-runsLathe to the Grave. “And now they’re 10 a penny.”The enigmatic Sourisseau in Germany may be the only place to buy a freshly minted machine, but with more people refurbishing and selling older models, records are becoming more readily affordable in small batches from an increasing number of sources. “No project is too small for us,” Trigger says. This means that people are getting even the most niche things put on to record now, using them as gifts, mementos, or preserving family memories by pressing them into grooves. “We’ve done one-off records of everything from a baby’s first words pressed to vinyl, to a gender-reveal one where they got their doctor to send us an email with the gender of the baby, as they had a choice of two songs for boy and girl.”As well as serving smaller record labels, many lathe-cutters also sell direct to artists, who cannot afford to go to a large pressing plant that requires a minimum order. “Not everybody can afford 300 copies,” Trigger says. “So if we sell somebody 20 records, and they can sell them all on tour and make their money back, while getting coverage, then that’s our job done. Then they’re not going to sit around with 200 spare copies holding up their bed.”Graham Duff, known for writing TV shows such as Ideal, starring Johnny Vegas, also curates his own label,Heaven’s Lathe, in collaboration with lathe cutters Bladud Files! It allows him all the fun and creativity of running a record label but without the stress, risk or workload that would usually go with it. They only cut 100 copies each of the records they release, which have included music by Wire’s Graham Lewis, Throbbing Gristle’s Cosey Fanni Tutti, and even one of Lee “Scratch” Perry’s final recordings.View image in fullscreenInto the groove … Lathe to the Grave’s cutting stylus.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The Guardian“For all of us involved it’s a side project,” Duff says. “But it’s something precious. You can make a really high quality product, but you’re not having to have a massive outlay. And lead times are much shorter – you could be waiting a year at bigger manufacturing plants, so this creates a much shorter route from having an idea to recording it and getting it out there.”It’s a win-win for artists, too, who can release a physical record stripped of the usual expectations and obligations. “There’s no pressure on the artist,” says Duff. “There’s no cost, it’s completely up to them what they want to release, and they retain all rights.” He gives the example of Adi Newton from electronic experimentalists Clock DVA, who lathe-cut a piece of piano music. “You’re opening up channels for people to explore.”Demand is growing. Trigger is in talks with Sourisseau about acquiring a third machine so they can increase production next year – they currently run two machines for 70 hours a week – and it has enabled her and her partner to quit their other jobs. “It’s been incredible for us to be able to do this full-time,” she says. “But ultimately, we want artists to support themselves and know that there are other options out there: it’s not just streaming or nothing.”Explore more on these topicsVinylExperimental musicPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Does a fly ache when its wings are pulled off? Is an ant happy when it finds a food source? If so, they may be sentient beings, which means they can “feel”, a bit or a lot, like we do.Invertebrate sentience is becoming an ever livelier topic of debate and with new science we are getting new insights. But Dr Andrew Crump at the Royal Veterinary College, who helped ensure that new UK laws recognising animal sentience were amended to include large cephalopod molluscs and decapod crustaceans – octopuses, lobsters, crabs to you and me – says this is not at all straightforward.Nervous systems are hugely complex, and identifying consciousness and sentience – and not just automatic pain reflexes – is hard. Are responses or reactions you see from an animal – be it a wolf or a wolf ant – feelings or just automatic reflexes? Crump and his colleaguesfound that bees, for example, were not simple stimulus-response robots, but reacted to stimuli in sophisticated, context-dependent ways. They were found to learn colour cues for their decisions on feeding – choosing painful overheated sugars they previously avoided when non-heated options had a low sugar concentration. So they made trade-offs by processing in the brain then modifying their behaviour.In fact, new research has shown that many responses in the larger invertebrates were complex, long-lasting, and pretty consistent with criteria for pain that had been produced initially for vertebrates such as rats. Octopuses, for example, can perform amazing feats of learning to avoid painful environments and choose painkilling environments. All this establishes and quantifies “feelings” in beings that are very different from us.The work of Crump and other scientists meant that the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act 2022 recognised for the first time in UK law (vertebrate sentience was previously covered by EU regulation) that certain invertebrates can “feel”, requiring modifications to their treatment in areas such as farming and research.But what does this mean for the many trillions of smaller invertebrates? Nothing yet.We are never going to stop all human impact on invertebrates; it is an impossible task given that we are 8 billion destructive, extractive bulls in the china shop of their ecosystems and have for centuries relied on the protein from eating wild invertebrates around the globe. But new industrial bug farming – rearing creatures such as prawns, bees and black soldier flies to be used as protein for humans and farm animals – needs attention. A huge new industrial livestock system is growing in developed countries. Are they rearing and slaughtering the animals humanely?We have created laws to protect other beings such as cows and chickens. Why not give the smaller ones some protection too? Clearly it is time for a broader law on the sentience of all invertebrates. No one can really know how a bee feels when it is starving. Or how a butterfly senses heat. But setting criteria or markers to measure “feelings” has worked for octopuses, so hopefully it will for the extraordinarily diverse smaller invertebrates.Experts are now building up the evidence, taking it far further than our amateur, human experience can guess at. A new paper in the journal Science describes how these markers have been found in insects, indicating that there could be conscious experiences, ie “feelings”. And it is not just about pain – researchers are also attempting to develop such markers for joy. Ideally, new laws would lead to genuine improvements in farmed invertebrate welfare in the UK and abroad and should ensure animal sentience is accounted for throughout policy and decision making.Yet, however far the science gets us, we could use the precautionary principle: we could assume it is possible that invertebrates have feelings, however differently they may be crafted by the millions of years of evolution they went through before we arrived.As Tolstoy said: “If you feel pain, you are alive. If you feel other people’s pain, you are a human being.” Just replace the word “people’s” with “beings’” so it isallothers’ pain. We should always ensure, at the very least, that we have the highest welfare approaches in rearing and slaughter for these fantastic animals. I suspect, for most of us, it feels like the right thing to do.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But a practical solution has been found.Not wearing high heels?Several injections of Botox – thebotulinum toxinused to treat facial wrinkles – directly into the foot.Is this for real?Once a professional celebrity secret, stiletto Botox is becoming mainstream, thanks to social media.What does the Botox do?It stops certain muscles contracting and makes your foot go a bit numb. No more pain!But the cause of the pain is still there. It’s like recommending aspirin to someone whose head is clamped in abenchvice.In addition to the Botox, dermal fillers are injected into the balls of the feet to provide more cushioned support.Thatreallysounds like a lot.It certainly costs a lot.

However …Q&A: why are more people using Botox, and what are the risks?Read moreHowever what?There are the usual risks– allergic reactions, bruising, infection.OK. Anything else?Apparently, the injections hurt quite a bit because feet are sensitive. And the effects are temporary, so you will probably need to repeat the procedure every three or four months.Great. I can’t wait.It should probably also be said that nobody knows the full long-term effects of this kind of repeated treatment, especially when combined with unrelieved stiletto-wearing.I think it might be cheaper to hire someone to carry me around on their shoulders.You may even be able to start a TikTok trend.Do say:“Who’s ready to dance all night and all day tomorrow?”Don’t say:“Thanks to the procedure, I’ve been able to keep my head clamped in this vice all week!”Explore more on these topicsLife and stylePass notesBeautyWomenHigh heelsWomen's shoesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

According toPaddingtonin Peru’s director, Hugh Grant wrote much of it himself.“Hugh came up with the idea that Phoenix was imminently about to be released,” Dougal Wilson told Entertainment Weekly. “And of course, his thoughts immediately turned to the theatre, his natural home, and in front of him is presented his possible cast for his new production. The whole thing just seemed quite ridiculous and funny. He was very, very up for it and wrote the idea of the bears becoming involved in this new production, which – I would love to see that.”Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy review – giant laughs for Hugh Grant but weepie sequel is strangely dazedRead moreIf this seems familiar, it might be because a similar story has been told about thenew Bridget Jones movie. According to Grant, as much as he loved the film’s script, he didn’t see room for his character Daniel Cleaver. But producers were adamant. “They wanted him in it, and in the end, they’d done something I wasn’t crazy about,” he told Vanity Fair. So Hugh Grant went away and wrote his own scenes, which were subsequently “infused” into film.In this current climate, where the biggest news in Hollywood is a lawsuit between a director and an actress accused of trampling his film to meet her own needs, the sort of input thatHugh Grantadded to both Paddington and Bridget Jones could easily be seen as interference. But this is hard to argue when, as with both Paddington and Bridget Jones, he does seem to be responsible for the best bits.View image in fullscreenBest bits … Hugh Grant with Renée Zellweger in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy.Photograph: Universal Pictures/APNo more Mr Nice Guy: how Hugh Grant transformed himself into an edgy national treasureRead moreIn fact, were it not forHeretic– which he did not write, but reportedly added a few lines and “grace notes” of his own – there would be a very strong case for Hugh Grant being the world’s best writer for Hugh Grant.This shouldn’t necessarily come as a surprise. Early in his career, Grant supplemented his acting income by writing radio advertisements, and once wrote and performed in a sketch comedy group called The Jockeys of Norfolk. If you’ve seen Grant on a talk show or heard him on a podcast, he clearly talks and thinks like a writer. And so the real question is this: why on earth hasn’t he written a film yet?If it was ever going to happen, now is the time. Grant has happily crossed over from the repetitive romcoms that pigeonholed him for so long, and now finds himself in the form of his career. He’s able to stretch and warp the persona he created 30 years ago to fit whatever genre he chooses to work in. Heretic might have got him the best reviews of his career. The bit parts he takes in other films all uniformly add value to the project. He could breeze into most studios with a script under his arm and not instantly be laughed out of the room, which puts him at a huge advantage to most writers.Hugh Grant: ‘I can barely get to the end of a tweet without getting bored now’GuardianAnd he already writes. His rewrites on Paddington and Bridget Jones might be uncredited, but they’re proof of his ability. Without wanting to sound like a teacher, if he could apply himself to writing, or even co-writing, something longer form – something that understands his voice and point of view, and melds it to a decent plot – then there’s every chance it would be a big success. According to his IMDb page, Hugh Grant doesn’t have any upcoming projects. Wouldn’t it be nice if that was because he was squirrelled away writing his own?Explore more on these topicsFilmHugh GrantPaddingtonPaddington 2Bridget Jones: Mad About the BoyComedy filmscommentShareReuse this content"

Vital aid work will be hit as we spend more on defence, but we must deal with the world as it isTue 25 Feb 2025 13.42 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 14.19 ESTShareThere are moments in history when everything turns, but the extent of change is not perceived until later when the fog has cleared. These are hinge points that require clear leadership and bold action. In the late 1940s, myLabourpredecessor and hero Ernie Bevin, alongside Clement Attlee, saw through the fog when they led Britain into Nato and the UN, and secured the development of Britain’s nuclear deterrent. In the 1960s, Harold Wilson saw through the paranoia of the cold war, refusing Lyndon Johnson’s request to send British troops to Vietnam. In the 1990s, Tony Blair understood that unless we stopped the president of Serbia, Slobodan Milošević, there would be no peace in the Balkans.Three years into Vladimir Putin’s brutal war, this is again a hinge point for Britain. Keir Starmer’s commitment to dramatically raise defence spending in both this and the next parliament shows his leadership through the fog. Putin’s Russia is a threat not only to Ukraine and its neighbours, but to all of Europe, including the UK. Over successive administrations, our closest ally, the US, has turned increasingly towards the Indo-Pacific, and it is understandably calling for Nato’s European members to shoulder more of the burden for our continent’s security. Around the world, the threats are multiplying: from traditional warfare to hybrid threats and cyber-attacks.The first duty and foundation of this government’s plan for change is our national security. Seven months ago, the public gave us this responsibility, and we hold it with a profound sense of duty. Under the Conservatives, the foundations of our defence were weakened. The UK has not reached adefence spending level of 2.5% of GDP since Labour was last in government. And it falls to a Labour government to restore those foundations once again. We will deliver the biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the cold war because we are the party of defence. So we will hit our 2.5% promise in 2027 and, subject to economic conditions, go further, with defence spending rising to 3% during the next parliament. This is a pledge to safeguard our future – and act as a pillar of security on our continent – in a world plagued by more active conflicts than at any time since the second world war.Starmer announces big cut to UK aid budget to boost defence spendingRead moreTo make this commitment, and stick within our fiscal rules, we have had to make the extremely difficult decision to lower our spending on international development. As the prime minister said, we do not pretend any of this is easy. This is a hard choice that no government – let alone a Labour government – makes lightly. I am proud of our record on international development. It helps address global challenges from health to migration, contributes to prosperity, and supports the world’s most vulnerable people. It grows both our soft power and our geopolitical clout, while improving lives. For all of those reasons, this government remains committed to reverting spending on overseas aid to 0.7% of gross national income when the fiscal conditions allow.But we are a government of pragmatists not ideologues – and we have had to balance the compassion of our internationalism with the necessity of our national security.As we reduce the overseas aid budget, we will protect the most vital programmes in the world’s worst conflict zones ofUkraine, Gaza and Sudan. But there can be no hiding from the fact that many programmes doing vital work will have to be put on hold. The work of making further tough choices about programmes will proceed at pace over the weeks and months ahead, but our core priorities will remain the same. My vision for a reformed Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office fit for this more contested and dangerous world, in which diplomacy is more important than ever, remains paramount. We are working closely with the Treasury to ensure our diplomatic, intelligence and development footprint will align with our priorities. In a tough fiscal environment, all our spending must be laser-focused on delivering the maximum possible impacts for our national security and growth, equipping the FCDO to deliver the government’s plan for change internationally.At the height of the cold war, defence spending fluctuated between about 4% and 7% of GDP. At this moment of fiscal and geopolitical flux, not meeting the moment on defence would mean leaving Britain ill-prepared for a more dangerous world, potentially requiring even tougher choices down the line.I have written previously about this government’s foreign policy beingfounded on progressive realism. Being clear about our values, but treating the world as it is, not as we would wish it to be. These are the principles that guide our choices through these dangerous times. We will always do what is necessary to keep the public safe.David Lammy is British foreign secretaryDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Is that just a fancy word for bad parenting?Tue 25 Feb 2025 08.53 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 10.29 ESTShareIf only Elon Musk could impregnate humans at the same rate he’s giving them the ick. Alas, polls show the efficiency tsar’s USapproval rating dwindlingtowards levels he has enjoyed for quite some timeamong the UK public. And as a country that lived through the Boris Johnson era, I think we have to warn the Americans that if a government figurecan’t or won’t answerthe basic question “how many kids do you have?”, then he’s probably going to turn out to be a disappointment. And it mightevenhave been a warning sign. If the WhatsApp group of his exes is bigger than Mumsnet and 10 times as pissed off, then it’s just possible you could be dealing with a guy you’re going to end up feeling betrayed by.Is Musk that guy? Who among us can say, certainly considering the sheer number and ferocity of the lawyers Mister Free Speech employs? I do know Elon is something called a “pronatalist”, but I increasingly wonder whether that’s just a fancy new word for a very old form of shittiness. Consider the spectacle of his ex, Grimes, coming on to the social media platform Musk owns and outright begging him to get in touch for his input concerning a “medical crisis” for one of their shared children. “I’m not giving any details but he won’t respond to texts call or emails and has skipped every meeting and our child will suffer lifelong impairment if he doesn’t respond asap, so I need him to fucking respond and if I have to apply public pressure then I guess that’s where we are at.” These posts were either deleted or are now inaccessible, while one user suggested she had been “shadowbanned”. Silly Grimes. If she had put a rape threat or some antisemitism in her APB, it would have stayed up.Or as Ashley St Clair, mother of Elon’s (maybe) most recent child put it in an (also now deleted)X post last week: “Elon, we have been trying to communicate for the past several days and you have not responded. When are you going to reply to us instead of publicly responding to smears from an individual who just posted photos of me in underwear at 15 years old?”Aha. Think I’m starting to get a handle on “pronatalism”. Gotta admit, I’d had my suspicions, ever since Elonportentously announced: “Instead of teaching fear of pregnancy, we should teach fear of childlessness.” You’ll notice that either way, the situation involves fear for women. Fear of taking on the responsibility when you aren’t ready. Fear of not populating the Earth. Fear that when you really need him to engage with the boring/terrifying realities of parenthood, he’s going to be dicking around on a conservative conference stage with a chainsaw. Literally shouting: “CHAINSAW!”Because that, regrettably, was where Elon could be found, wearing sunglasses indoors, at around the time the Grimes message was sent. The power tool had been handed to our power tool by the Argentinian president – the one who looks like some mid-2000s Kasabian manager who can’t even get the girls that the band don’t want, and once soiled himself at 6am in someone else’s room at the Groucho.Anyway, it’s unclear which of Grimes’s children with Musk has the alleged urgent medical issue. She reportedly has three, including X Æ A-Xii (X). You’ll recognise X (which Grimes is far from thrilled about). He’s the one Musktook to hang outwith reporters and Donald Trump in the Oval Office, and I’d assumed he was the one currently being tried out for the successor role. Kind of a Musk Jong-un. Although in many ways, Kim Ju-ae, the North Korean leader’s daughter and current apparent favourite could be little X’s closest thing to a peer group. Their dads both root hard for Russia, and both kids have to watch a lot of rocket launches.Let’s not leave the baby-making debate to Musk and Vance – the left has a stake in this too | Gaby HinsliffRead moreAs for the wider impact of these increasingly icky glimpses into Musk’s private world, it is beginning to feel like the Doge boss has flicked the public’s “weirdo” switch. None of us wishes to call this too soon, but it does seem as though the world likes Elon less the more they see of him. Given his lack of conventional charm, he is one of those who should have realised silence would be the most intriguing and awe-inspiring statement of all. Instead … CHAINSAW!Meanwhile, St Clair is now pushing for sole custody of the baby alleged to be his. Motherhood can be quite crystallising, of course. Before it happens, you’ve got a load of free and easy ideas, you want to have a guy’s “rocket babies”. And then you do, and you send him a photo of you and your shared newborn in the delivery room, and he texts back a clipped, “All well?” Oof. Other messages she alleges are from Musk (and which areincluded in her court filings) explain he can’t visit her and the child because: “I’m #2 after Trump for assassination … This is not the time for sentiment at the expense of safety … Only the paranoid survive.” Mm. Perhaps I must adopt this as my excuse to get out of any parenting I don’t want to do this year. “Guys, I’m so sorry, someone else is going to have to care about your jabs and your dentist and your, like, entire LIFE, because only the paranoid survive. I pay for it, don’t I? Then what’s the difference?”There is a difference though, isn’t there? I would love to believe this guy is going to be able to effect some era-defining revolution in governance that makes people have better lives. But a lot of stuff begins at home – and if Musk doesn’t chainsaw the US’s way to playing happy families, we might just have to accept that there were one or two red flags on the home front.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This is the paradoxical condition that occurs from time to time when the ruling party and the official opposition are forced by circumstance to have the same policy, while compelled by traditional enmity to resent the convergence.The pressure on Keir Starmer toraise defence spendingto 2.5% of gross domestic product has been building steadily in recent months, and independently of Tory demands that he do it.The case was already compelling last year. A violent storm was raging on Europe’s eastern frontiers and the cost of Britain’s commitment to protectUkraineagainst Russian aggression was mounting. It was clear that higher defence spending would be the necessary insurance premium to cover Europe against Vladimir Putin’s insatiable malevolence.That requirement became a matter of national emergency whenDonald Trumpreturned to the White House, sent the thrust of US policy on Ukraine into reverse and left the US’s Nato allies feeling abandoned and exposed.Trump’s endorsement of a Kremlin agenda – his characterisation of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,as a dictatorand the demand that assistance already given be repaid in surrender of land and mineral resources – signalled the advent of a new epoch on global affairs. US foreign policy is now modelled on a mafia extortion racket. Protection is procured with tribute. Territory and any lucrative commerce attached to it is carved up between bosses. The more powerful among them takes the bigger share.This way of doing international deals is perfectly aligned with the post-Soviet model of Russian statecraft that is a hybrid of bloodthirsty imperialism and gangster kleptocracy. It promises a slide back into the kind of ruthless competition for supremacy inEuropethat western democracies spent decades after the second world war trying to make obsolete.It is an existential crisis for the edifice of multilateral trade, mutual legal obligations and international institutions that, when the cold war ended, made it possible for countries such as Britain to spend less on guns and more on everything else.Now, somewhat belatedly, Starmer has recognised that the flow of resources must go the other way. Defence spending will rise to 2.5% of GDP (2.6% if security service budgets are in the mix) by 2027, with 3% as the eventual target. The money will come initially from the overseas aid budget – a symbolic and practical reorientation of Britain’s posture from soft to hard power.The prime minister was at pains to say how unhappy he was raiding funds that support international development, pleading the absence of easy money and the unprecedented gravity of the hour. The somewhat fanciful consolation on offer is a growth dividend, with military investment doubling as a new industrial strategy, creating jobs and stimulating economic activity.This is unlikely to be the last time that national security is cited as a reason for shifting resources away from things thatLabourMPs would much rather be funding. But their disapproval is not much of an obstacle for now because the reorientation of budget priorities enjoys cross-party support.Shortly before Tuesday’s announcement, Kemi Badenoch hadmade a speechcalling on the government to implement something on very similar lines. Starmer didn’t yield to Tory demands but the timing of the two interventions, just a few hours apart, isn’t coincidental. Both were timed to preface the prime minister’s trip to Washington later this week.Starmer is not given to impulsive acts. His preferred mode of government is methodical to a degree that infuriates colleagues who see it as a symptom of political flat-footedness. He had not wanted to commit to higher military spending before publication of a strategic defence review. His argument was that it was better to set a budget only after you know what it is you have to buy.That question has been settled by Trump. Britain needs to procure status as one of Nato’s big spenders. Extra money pledged for defence is the admission fee levied by the White House for Europeans wanting to join the discussion about Ukraine’s future. Starmer’s announcement is a calling card and, he hopes, a boost to his credentials with a man who seesNatoas a scam for siphoning Pentagon treasure into European pockets.That part of the discussion is not new. It is a gripe voiced by previous administrations, Democrats as well as Republicans. But only the incumbent president couples it with generalised contempt for European allies and glowing admiration for the tyrant who menaces them.Under those circumstances, the decision to ramp up defence spending makes sense both as a manoeuvre to help steer Trump away from betraying Europe completely, and as planning for the scenario where he does. It is consistent with Starmer’s modus operandi since first becoming Labour leader. He prefers, wherever possible, to defer a difficult choice, pending collection of all the data, surveilling a problem from every angle. Then, when it is time for making his mind up, usually in the heat of some crisis, he acts with a fixity of purpose that contains no trace of the prior equivocation.It is decision-making at a pace that isn’t calibrated to the frantic spin-cycle of the Westminster news machine. It feels sometimes as if the prime minister belongs to a different age, as if he is stubbornly conducting himself in the staid, analogue way of politics, only periodically dropping into the breathless, inflamed digital era to deliver some stilted pronouncement on grave matters of state.The verdict this time is that Britain is transitioning to a wartime economy. If there was a lingering question about what this Labour government was for – what Starmer’s ministry would ultimately beabout– this is the answer. It is a gruelling mission of rearmament and renewed national focus on security, in a dangerous world where the US is an unreliable source of protection and its president can’t be counted as a friend.This is a tough prospectus for a country that is craving economic respite. British society is not primed for the call to yet more collective sacrifice. Good times have been promised and deferred so often that confidence in any politician’s timetable for their return is gone.The national reserve of blitz spirit has been depleted by too many peacetime invocations over the years. This time, sadly, the martial language is no metaphor. That doesn’t give Starmer a great deal more leeway. His inscrutability is a barrier to persuasion. He doesn’t match many people’s archetype of a charismatic wartime leader. But he is also capable of wielding the authority of his office with purposeful, old-fashioned solidity. There are worse traits a prime minister could have – and much worse leaders on display – in this frightening new era.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Spheres of influence are back in vogue. It’s not isolationism, it’s transactional mercantilism. But with Australia heavily invested in its US relationship we need to calmly undertake a net assessment: to weigh up what’s at stake while looking to engage with our region more fully.We should have seen this comingUS globalism has been soured by the effects of catastrophic wars in the Middle East since 2001, coupled with the 2008 global financial crisis, a drug scourge, a surge of immigration, a sense of being taken advantage of and an undermining of faith in government. These echo in Australian society.China’s rapid growth and adversarial mercantilism helped. Russia’s barbarous invasion of Ukraine added to the mix. Trump has supercharged the disruption with his sidelining of allies and favouring of autocrats. That leaves us at an inflection point.For middle powers such as Australia, the rules-based order has been convenient, helping to enable global trade and enhanced prosperity. But it’s also been flimsy and is now in doubt.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe2017 foreign policy white paper, issued shortly after Trump came to office last time, was effectively our“Plan B”. In the face of a US transactional retreat from ideational leadership, the white paper talked up the alliance but mainly bolstered other connections to offset growing US disengagement. We emphasised the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean); the Pacific Islands Forum (Pif); the Indian Ocean Rim Association (Iora) and others.The2024 national defence strategywas written with China’s adventurist mercantilism and military expansion in mind. But these two documents now need a significant rethink. A net assessment is in order, carefully re-examining Australian interests and regional obligations, and the best way to approachour exceptional friend, the US.Ties beyond the regionWe came closer to European partners with our involvement in the war in Afghanistan, and because they too are concerned about reverberations at both ends of the Eurasian landmass.The Quadalso helped tie in the US, alongside Japan, India and Australia, working on regional economic, technical and human security projects.Meanwhile, theFive Eyes intelligence-sharing arrangements, spawned in the second world war, prompted parallel defence, border security, policing and intelligence ties.Albanese ‘confident’ US would come to Australia’s defence in event of attackRead moreToday the Europeans, Quad and Five Eyes connections may have a newfound utility – for engaging with equally shocked erstwhile US allies and partners including friends in Asean, the Pif and Iora.Anzus and a boutique defence forceTake the Anzus alliance: it doesn’t include an HQ, a commander, forces assigned or a mutual defence guarantee. It’s an 800-word essay. To be sure, the security ties are now wide-ranging but, if the treatment of ourstrategic cousinsin Canada is anything to go by, this pact offers no assurance. What mitigates this is the convenience of Australia as asuitable piece of real estate, for facilities at Pine Gap (intelligence), Tindal (air force), Darwin (marines) and Perth (navy and submarines).Australia’s one-punchboutique defence forceand limited volunteer emergency services are structured for the unipolar moment and to make not much more thanniche contributionsfar afield. This was for a more benign time.And Aukus?The Aukus agreement for sharing advanced technology has been described as awaste of moneythat, with Trump’s return, leaves Australia vulnerable to being dragged into another war. Yet Trump hasn’t started wars and evidently seeks to avoid conflict over Taiwan, perhaps even making adeal with China.So far Aukus retains broad bipartisan support in Australia and the US,including with Trumpand the USsubmarine industrial base is being re-energised. While challenging, therefore, theconcerns are still manageable.A way forwardInstead ofconscription, we could consider introducing a voluntary butincentivised national and community service scheme– covering the armed forces and cyber force, along with state emergency, police, fire and national park services.

Society is unspooling before our eyesTue 25 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTShareEverything was going so well in my local Co-op. I’d gone in for vape juice, which they often run out of. I could see my preferred brand and I was having a comradely moment with the assistant, who is only too used to my crestfallen face when I have to make do with blueberry flavour. Then, right next to me, a man started to slither through the adjacent service hatch. The first I made of it was that the friction of his body against the counter was pulling his trousers down. I was close enough to see the whites of his pants, which were not that white. I thought: “That young man should really wear a belt next time he tries to hijack the till-cockpit of a Co-op.” Then: “NO WAY! That young man is hijacking the Co-op!”He was wearing a face bandana, so he had at least got that far with his accessorising, and he yelled at the lady to get out from behind the tills, then let his two friends in. It was a classic in-through-the-trapdoor, open-the-drawbridge manoeuvre. The manager was on the phone to the police, saying in neutral tones: “Robbery in progress, robbers in the building,” as they piled cigarettes into three giant bags-for-life, which they had definitely stolen from their mums in advance. The planning was meticulous. We watched for a few seconds, fascinated. I asked the lady if she thought we should hide and she made a noncommittal noise that I have spent ages since deciphering. It was something in the realm of “they’re just kids, they’re probably not armed”; she is probably not paid enough to defend the cigarettes.At least three shoppers hadn’t even noticed what was happening. I decided to go round telling everyone: “Look, robbery in progress, robbers in the building,” because I am, first and foremost, anewspaperwoman. One guy just looked up from the ice-cream momentarily and went back to his selection. Fresh people kept coming in to the shop. It’s amazing how fast an atmosphere can be determined, yet how little it interrupts anyone’s plans. “Weird vibe. Ah, heist in progress. But I still need hummus.”The trio escaped before the police arrived. I offered to stay as a witness, and they said: “No, we have security cameras.” I wanted to point out that cameras will give you nothing but three young men with their faces covered, whereas, with my prose, you’ll have them apprehended in no time.‘Some steal to order’: on the frontline of UK shoplifting epidemicRead moreBut what did I usefully notice? Three young men with their faces covered – and a whole lot of vibes. The staff seemed as if they had got to a point of such pure resignation that it was almost religious. Not bored, not fretful, just absolutely and completely Zen.In retrospect, I wish I had left ice-cream man to his own devices and spent my time asking how often this happened, to bring them to this state of inner peace. Shoplifting is out of control, in prevalence and brass-neckery, according tofigures released last month. In the year to September 2024, shoplifting offences reported by police in England and Wales rose by 23%, to nearly 500,000. That is more incidents than in any year since records began, in 2003.The sheer ubiquity freezes everyone’s will to act, but it’s still incredibly, disproportionately shocking to watch. It’s not that I particularly care about the Co-op, nor even because the sight of scofflaws openly scoffing, right there in broad daylight, is remarkable – like seeing the sky go green.Rather, it is the sight of society unspooling. The cigarette to minimum wage ratio is just too huge. The value of everything – Calpol, wine, dog food – is too tantalising. The old norms, such as it’s better not to steal than to steal, have given way. I’m not saying the bandits have a point, just that banditry is where we are.As the thieves ran out of the shop, I said: “I guess some vape juice is out of the question?” and the woman replied: “Yeah, sorry, this is a crime scene.” Afterwards, my kid said: “You should have just stolen some. It sounds really easy.”Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As prices rise and consumer sentiment slumps, he may come to regret his election promisesTue 25 Feb 2025 11.32 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 21.30 ESTShareEach new morn, new widows howl, new orphans cry andDonald Trumppasses a wild executive order. To liberally paraphrase Macbeth, every day seems to bring some new reason to scream into the void. The good news, however, is that even diehard Trumpers seem to be getting sick of all the chaos. A month into Trump’s second act, there are signs that the honeymoon is over and a backlash may be brewing. For certain Republican voters, regret may be setting in.First, the polling. A Harvard CAPS/Harris survey published on Mondaygave Trump a 52% approval rating. Meanwhile,three national pollsshowa decline in supportfor the president, with most Americans saying he hasn’t done enough to lower prices and has overstepped his presidential powers.A CNN pollpublished on Thursday found that 47% of Americans approve of Trump’s performance while 52% disapprove – and the numbers are trending downwards.There are also signs of growing disillusionment at town halls across the country.Various outletshave reported recently that Republicans holding community events arefacing hostile crowds, angry about the mass firing of government workers that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is carrying out. Disgruntled voters are also venting online: social media is full ofviral posts from Trumperswho have been caught in Musk’s bloodbath or whose family members have been fired. These posts haven’t garnered much sympathy, I should add. Rather, there have been a lot of references to the Leopards Eating People’s Faces partymeme.Is Trump in trouble? Judging by the number of headlines centred on the president’s problems – along with theplummeting popularityrates of his mate Musk – a lot of people sure hope so. Some Democrats are already rubbing their hands together in glee and prophesying that the Trump ship is about to go down. On Sunday, for example, the Democratic strategist James Carville, who helped Bill Clinton win in 1992,told Mediaitethat he reckons the Trump White House will suffer a “massive collapse” in “less than 30 days”.While this is certainly a tantalising prospect – and one that has had a lot of airtime onliberal cable news– I wouldn’t get too excited. These days, being a “Democratic strategist” tends to mean that everything you say will immediately be proved dramatically wrong. In fact, it’s probably best not to get too excited by any of the chatter around the Trump slump. As we all know, the 78-year-old president is the ultimate comeback kid. A few middling poll numbers and angry town halls are nothing for a guy who has shrugged off being foundliable for sexual abuseand who was charged with 88 felony counts across four criminal cases.Trump is certainly taking all this bad press in his stride – by which I mean he has been busy posting on social media that he is the best president the world has ever seen and everyone loves him. On Friday, Trumpwrote on Truth Socialthat he has “the best polling numbers I’ve ever had”. He added: “The Democrats, run by broken down losers like James Carville, whose [sic] weak of mind and body, are going crazy, and just don’t know what to do. They have lost their confidence and spirit – They have lost their minds!”Trump isn’t entirely wrong. Along with many other people, Iamlosing my mind – at the constant stream of inanity, cruelty and straight-up illegal nonsense coming out of Washington. One of the latest examples is Trump referring to himselfas a “king”and boasting that he might stay in the Oval Officeafter his second term endsin 2028. There is a reason so many people are hyping up reports that Trump is losing popularity: I think it’s what the extremely online call “copium” and what others call “desperately clutching at straws”.Still, here is a straw for us all to clutch: while Trump may have an uncanny ability to bounce back from scandals and bad press, he is not a king and he is certainly not a god. He is still a mere mortal – and he is digging himself into a hole out of which even he may not be able to clamber. Consumer sentiment has slumped while pricescontinue to rise. Trump campaigned relentlessly on the cost of living and made a big (and unrealistic) promise tobring down food priceson day one of his term. Now, it’s clear he has no realistic plan to lower the cost of groceries; eventually, even his most devoted followers are going to figure out that you can’t eat the culture wars. To riff on Macbeth again: all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten the astronomical price of eggs.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not really. Boards shouldn’t be sentimental about chief executivesNils PratleyGetting rid of Hein Schumacher may not follow the usual FTSE 100 script, but boards should be free to make clinical judgments if there’s a better optionTue 25 Feb 2025 13.17 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 13.59 ESTShareMost removals of chief executives from FTSE 100 companies follow the same script. Financial results disappoint; the share price falls; improvement is promised but doesn’t materialise; the shares fall further; a beleaguered board, harassed by the shareholders, finally pulls the plug. The process tends to take ages.The exit of Hein Schumacher from Unileveris nothing like that.First, he’s been in the job for little more than 18 months. Second, the numbers for 2024 were OK, even if the revenue line for the fourth quarter was weak-ish. Third, the share price hasn’t been crashing – it’s up 10% since Schumacher’s appointment. Nor does there appear to have been a quarrel over strategy, even ifthe choice of Amsterdamfor the primary listing ofthe soon-to-be-demerged Magnum and Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream divisionwill not have been universally popular.Instead, if the official script is taken at face value, this an unusual case of the board simply deciding that the chief financial officer could do a better job. The clue was in chair Ian Meakins’ praise for the new boss, Fernando Fernandez: “The board has been impressed with Fernando’s decisive and results-oriented approach and his ability to drive change at speed.” Translation: Schumacher wasn’t driving fast enough.The prompt may have been the factor suspected by Barclays’ analysts: the experienced Fernandez, a former boss of Unilever’s Dove-to-Vaseline personal care division, would have been “in high demand” from US rivals offering fat pay packets. So, if the board was less than 100% convinced by Schumacher’s ability to find the accelerator, this was a moment to switch.Precipitous? Brutal? Not really. Chief executives aren’t paid the big bucks – up to €17.4m (£14.4m) this year in Schumacher’s case – to feel comfortable in their posts. There has to be a sense of jeopardy. Boards are allowed to make a clinical judgment that a better appointment is available. It’s what they are supposed to do.Schumacher’s short reign included his productivity-boosting “growth action plan”, the announcement of 7,500 job cuts, the ice-cream demerger, and a shake-up in senior ranks. None of those were minor tweaks, but there is also a fair argument that the reset wasn’t fully convincing to the outside world.The rise in the share price under Schumacher still left the rating short of peers’, which played to the perennial grumble about Unilever. It is a company blessed with well-invested famous brands that never quite manages to punch its financial weight. Meakins’ line that “there is much further to go to deliver best-in-class results” was merely a statement of the obvious.Andthe pet complaint from this columnabout Schumacher was that, for all his supposed straight-talking, he was overly fond of yawn-inducing babble about “strategic cells”, “critical platforms” and “end-to-end responsibilities”. Fernandez’s version of blunt-speaking may be an improvement. As a near-40-year company veteran, he may also be better placed to sing a version of Unilever’s “social purpose” refrain while being ruthlessly commercially minded.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead – and oddly – it is Nelson Peltz, the hard-nosed activist in the boardroom, who has some explaining to do. It rather looks as if he was beguiled by the idea that only an outsider such as Schumacher could deliver shock treatment to Unilever. It’s not always so. The new chief executive still has to deliver, of course, but changing drivers at this stage looks a reasonable call.Explore more on these topicsUnileverNils Pratley on financeCorporate governancecommentShareReuse this content"

Some are forced on governments by circumstance. Others are self‑imposed. Labour’sdecisionto cut the aid budget to “pay” for increased defence spending is firmly in the latter category. It is also wrong – forcing the world’s poor to pay for Britain’s safety. This is a false economy. Cutting aid will make the world more unstable, not less. The very crises that fuel conflict – poverty, failed states, climate disasters and mass displacement – will only worsen with less development funding. Labour’s logic is self‑defeating: diverting money from aid to defence does not buy security; it undermines it.The numbers tell the story. Despite government attempts to inflate theamountsinvolved, the extra£5bn‑£6bnfor defence is tiny relative to Britain’s GDP. The UK could easily absorb this throughborrowing– especially in a global financial system wheresterlingis heavily traded – or, if the government prefers, through a modest wealth tax. Yet Sir Keir Starmer has chosen to frame this as a zero-sum game, where aid must give way to security. Why? Because this is not about economic necessity – it’s about political positioning. Labour wants to prove that it can be fiscally disciplined even when the numbers don’t demand it. It wants to neutraliseTory attacks, even when the real battle is over priorities, not affordability.It is also a move that aligns with Donald Trump’s worldview. The US president wants to close down theUS government’s main overseas aid agency, treating it as an expensive indulgence rather than a pillar of foreign policy. Sir Keir is set to go to Washington this week. A UK prime minister that echoes Mr Trump’s “America first” instincts on defence and aid may find the meeting more congenial. If so, Sir Keir may be taking the idea that “the meek shall inherit the earth” a little too literally.Labour doesn’t just believe in fiscal discipline, it believes that it must believe in fiscal discipline and it constructs a justification for that belief. The problem is this: by accepting Conservative trade‑offs, Labour locks itself into an orthodoxy that it may later need to break. In a volatile world, Britain – outside the EU – must boost high-value exports and cut reliance on fragile supply chains. Even under Joe Biden, the UK was kept out of theUS-EU Trade and Technology Council, which strengthened transatlantic industrial policy. Yet when does Downing Street admit Britain’s real limit is productive capacity – not budget deficits?Britain’s fiscal constraint is artificial, but its resource constraints are real. Energy, food and manufacturing are matters of national security, not just market functions. Without investment, dependence on key imports makes Britain vulnerable to supply-chain shocks and price inflation. That should make the announcements by Labour’sEd MilibandandSteve Reedmatter. If every pound spent requires a cut elsewhere, neither would have had much to say.Sir Keir often presents himself as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue – claiming to be adapting to circumstances rather than adhering to dogma. But such pragmatism is itself a belief system, one that treats capitalism’s rules as unchangeable, markets as beyond politics, and history as a one‑way street where past mistakes justify permanent, crippling caution. In doing so, he isn’t just rejecting alternatives – he’s rewriting history to suggest they were never an option to begin with.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Bilateral visits cannot disguise the underlying crisisTue 25 Feb 2025 13.26 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 13.47 ESTShareThe rumblings prompted by Donald Trump’s re-election soon gathered force. First came tariffs and threats of territorial annexation; then the greater shocks of JD Vance’s Valentine’s Daymassacre of European valuesand Mr Trump’s enthusiastic amplification of Kremlin lines on Ukraine.On Monday came another seismic moment. For more than a decade, the UN security council has been largelyparalysedby the split between the five permanent members – Russia and China on one side; the US, France and Britain on the other. This time, when the US brought a resolution calling for an end to the war in Ukraine on the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion, it did not criticise Moscow, demand its withdrawal or back Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The result was that China and Russia backed the resolution – while the UK and France, having failed to temper it, abstained.Earlier, even Beijing hadchosen to abstainrather than reject a UN general assembly resolution condemning Moscow as the aggressor in Ukraine. It was passed overwhelmingly, with the backing of 93 states. Yet the US joined Russia in voting against it – along with Belarus, North Korea, Syria and a handful of others. “These are not our friends,” the Republican senator John Curtiswroteon X.The post-1945 order is beyond repair while Mr Trump occupies the White House. Emmanuel Macron’s charm and deftness papered over the problems somewhat when he became the first European leader to meet the US president since his re-election. (Sir Keir Starmer, not noted for his nimbleness or charisma, is likely to find the task somewhat harder this week.) The French president was adroit inflattering Mr Trumpeven as he told the truth. But it is not surprising that he failed to make any real progress in closing the gap. These are not cracks in the transatlantic relationship, but a chasm.A committed Atlanticist such as Friedrich Merz, on course to shortly become the German chancellor, is compelled to urge independence from the US because “the Americans, at any case the Americans in this administration, do not care much about the fate of Europe”. Hewarnedthat European leaders might not be able to talk about Nato in its current form by June. The problem is not only what Mr Trump may do but what he may not. Nato is built on the conviction that countries will stand by the commitments they make. That confidence cannot exist while Mr Trump is president.When Sir Keir told MPs on Tuesday that “Here we are, in a world where everything has changed”, he was commenting on Russian aggression, but everyone understood the real shift underlying his remarks. To note, as he did, that the US-British alliance has survived countless external challenges was not quite a vote of confidence. It tacitly acknowledged that the threat this time is internal.The ground is rocking beneath Europe’s feet. It must brace itself for further shocks. In place of the post-second world war order, Mr Trump envisages a world where alliances are no more than empty words and great powers bluff and bully their way through. Bilateral meetings have their purpose – they may offer minimal respite and buy a little time – but it will require common will to defend the interests of European states. The Polish prime minister,Donald Tusk, suggested that European leaders would be meeting in London at the weekend to discuss security. Their best hope of standing firm is by standing together.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters fromAusten LynchandPeter BrookerTue 25 Feb 2025 12.32 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 12.36 ESTShareJulian Coman’s article on “the much misunderstood” Blue Labour says Maurice Glasman’s project fell out of favour because it advocated “restrictions on the import of cheaper migrant labour” (An exiled group within Labour is making a comeback – it could hold the key to repelling Farage, 21 February).The truth is that,interviewed by Progress magazine in April 2011, Glasman advocated opening Labour up to supporters of the far-right English Defence League (EDL).Interviewed in July 2011 by the Daily Telegraph’s Mary Riddell, he doubled down. Asked whether he would support a total ban on immigration, even just for a temporary period, he replied: “Yes. I would add that we should be more generous and friendly in receiving those [few] who are needed. To be more generous we have to draw the line.” In response to a further question on whether he supported Iain Duncan Smith’s call for British jobs for British workers, he responded: “Completely. The people who live here are the highest priority. We’ve got to listen and be with them. They’re in the right place – it’s us who are not.”I was going to close by stating that far from “repelling” Faragism, this is more like pandering to it. But that would be unfair to Nigel Farage: he has at least refused to associate with Tommy Robinson, the former leader of the EDL.Jim DenhamBirminghamMaurice Glasman claims that BlueLabourbegan as a recognition of the sadness that beset the party after the crisis of 2008, though Julian Coman is right that the movement emphasises how the party should seek to harness the blue-collar vote.There are any number of genuine nuggets to be mined from Glasman’s ideas, not the least of which is the proposal for the establishment of a network of regional banks with a remit to invest exclusively in their own areas to grow and sustain regional small- to medium-term enterprises and to set up low-cost personal loans.His notions of mutuality, reciprocity and pluralism chime withhis idea that“the fundamental role of Labour politics is to resist the imperative of capital to dominate society”.That Blue Labour’s stance on immigration is not acceptable to much of the Labour party is also an accurate assessment. However, though Glasman opposes immigration and has been an active supporter of Brexit, the ideas he propounds don’t always support such views. Glasman’s concept of elections not expressing the will of the people, but merely making a choice, where “the only rule is that you have to do it again”, suggests that Brexit would have to come under fresh scrutiny.Nuggets abound, but Labour should be aware that iron pyrite, though hard, is also brittle and unforgiving. Real gold, on the other hand, is malleable and far more giving a material to work with.Austen LynchGarstang, LancashireJulian Coman should gird his loins and read Reform UK’s 2024manifesto pledgeson the NHS. They include “eradicating NHS waiting lists within two years”. The ability to conjure up large numbers of doctors, nurses, equipment, hospital beds, new super-efficient managers etc, pretty well instantly, without large-scale immigration, would be amazing to see.Peter BrookerWest Wickham, LondonDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

And there is no such thing as a bad win by four goals. But equally, the context is unavoidable. This is aSouthamptonside who are doomed, who are letting in 2.41 goals per game, who have lost 14 of their past 17 league games and who have nothing to play for this season beyond trying to scrape together the three points that would take them above Derby’s record low of 11.The Premier League’s unique selling point is supposed to be that anybody can beat anybody, but it’s hard to square that with this Southampton. “I’m frustrated,” said Ivan Juric, who pointed out his team had defended well for 20 minutes. “It’s a really tough situation.”Ismaïla Sarr strikes twice in Crystal Palace goal-fest as Aston Villa implodeRead more“We are in our worst moment in terms of results,” said Enzo Maresca, “but we are third, one point from third. That shows how good we have been. Now it’s a matter of trying to finish in the best way.” But a straightforward win is unlikely to have done much to assuage the irritation of some fans.Perhaps 150 had demonstrated on Fulham Road against the ownership before kick-off, attacking Todd Boehly and Clearlake and demanding success. “We’re not Arsenal,” blazed one hand-written poster, while others chanted the names of Roman ­Abramovich and José ­Mourinho. “The fans have to trust us,” said Maresca. “We are heading in the right direction.”Yet results are only part of the issue.Had they beaten Evertonthree days before Christmas, ­Chelsea would have gone top. Since then, they had won just two of 10 games before Southampton came to Stamford Bridge. The protest, though, felt far bigger than form. This is about the way football is going, the disconnect between fans and club, the sense that a club that was once integral to and representative of its community is now just an investment vehicle, the players assets to be traded as required.It’s true that discontent would probably be less visible wereChelseaengaged in a battle for the title, but it doesn’t take many poor results to expose the sense of commercial soullessness just below the surface.The downturn over the past couple of months is in part down to problems of team building when so many ­players have come in without a readily discernible underlying plan. Injuries clearly are part of it. Wesley Fofana, Roméo Lavia and Nicolas Jackson represent the spine of the side, and losing them has created knock-on issues elsewhere.Without Jackson and Marc Guiu, Chelsea don’t have a natural No 9, which at a time when they are also without the width offered by Noni Madueke because of a thigh injury and Mykhailo Mudryk after his positive drugs test, has forced a complete rethink of the forward line.View image in fullscreenMarc Cucurella celebrates with Cole Palmer and Christopher Nkunku after scoring Chelsea’s fourth goal.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersPedro Neto, naturally a wide player, has had to be drafted in as a central forward, while Christopher Nkunku, a clever and inventive inside-forward in his goalscoring days at RB Leipzig, has been repurposed as a wide player on the left. There has been a certain amount of frustration – among fans at least – about his occasionally erratic movement, but he is being asked to perform a role that does not come naturally to him and that, given how Marc Cucurella likes to invert, is essential.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He officially joined a week before Mauricio Pochettino was appointed manager, scored three in five pre-season games and then was injured before the ­campaign began for real.Since then, Chelsea have signed 25 players; if Nkunku feels this is not quite the club he was sold, he can hardly be blamed. Still, however uncomfortable he at times looks on the touchline, his goalscoring instincts remain sharp as he demonstrated after 24 minutes, stealing in front of Will Smallbone and braving contact with a flailing Aaron Ramsdale to nod in Tosin Adarabioyo’s header.It was then with a more typical run infield that he set up the second for Neto. Not for the first time this season, Southampton had given their opponents a helping hand, James Bree squandering possession. Levi Colwill headed a third and Cucurella made it four with a late counter, but the sense was that they could have got almost any number had they needed to.Their problem is there’s not much credit to be gained in pushing on an open door, and few doors have ever been as open as this Southampton.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaSouthamptonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Having found a way back into the game at the start of the second half thanks to an equaliser from Morgan Rogers after he had seen another goal disallowed for the narrowest of offsides, Villa were blown away as Jean‑Philippe Mateta and Sarr’s second on the Senegal forward’s 27th birthday sealed only a third league win of the campaign at Selhurst Park for Palace.Chelsea return to top four after Nkunku and Neto sink sorry SouthamptonRead moreThe substitute Eddie Nketiah added a fourth in stoppage time to register his first Premier League goal for Palace since joining from Arsenal in the summer. But it was the imperious Wharton, a member of England’s Euro 2024 squad, that stole the show in front of Gareth Southgate’s successor Thomas Tuchel on his first start for nearly four months, after surgery on a groin injury.“He was a little bit rusty in the beginning but then you could see his quality as he adjusted so quickly to the pace of the Premier League again,” said Glasner. “He played excellent and we’re so pleased to have him back.”A measure of Emery’s respect for Palace was that he opted to switch to a back three for their trip to south London. But having come off the bench to inspiretheir victory against Chelseaon Saturday, there was nothing Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio could do this time after being introduced late on.“We have not been consistent enough,” admitted Emery, whose side have kept only three clean sheets all season. “Now we have to manage the frustration that we have today and move on.”The last time Wharton started a Premier League game, at the end of October, Palace had yet to register a victory in eight attempts. In his absence, Glasner has overseen a steady climb up the table thanks to impressive away form that has yielded four straight victories thanks to their ability to hit teams on the break.View image in fullscreenJean-Philippe Mateta scores past Robin Olsen for Palace’s second goal.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersWatching both managers prowling the touchline in their black puffer jackets was almost more entertaining than events on the pitch in the opening half-hour as Emery reacted to every misplaced pass. He had his head in his hands when Youri Tielemans glanced a cross from Andrés García wide of the far post before Jacob Ramsey saw a goal disallowed for offside.The breakthrough came at the other end on the half-hour mark when Villa failed to clear a corner and Sarr almost got on the end of a cross from Eberechi Eze. The ball came out to Wharton and he picked out the unmarked Chris Richards, whose header was parried straight into the path of the gleeful Sarr.The goal seemed to lift a collective weight from the Palace players’ shoulders, with Ezri Konsa having to throw himself in front of a goal-bound Eze shot before Emi Martínez parried Sarr’s brilliant volley from another Eze cross. Rogers thought he had equalised on the stroke of half-time but, to Emery’s clear disgust, Watkins’ knee was adjudged to have been offside when he was played through in the buildup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It could have been even worse for the visitors had Eze controlled another sumptuous through ball from Wharton. That prompted Emery to turn to Rashford and Asensio, even if it was a surprise to see Watkins make way.But it was Palace who underlined their dominance when Sarr rounded off his birthday celebrations by volleying home Daniel Muñoz’s cross to the delight of the home supporters before Nketiah finally broke his duck in injury time by tapping in Tyrick Mitchell’s cross.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueCrystal PalaceAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

So when he deflected a question after this third successivePremier Leaguewin – the first time Brighton have managed such a feat since 2023 – he did so with a knowing smirk.“Let’s wait for the next games,” Hürzeler said. “Then we can talk about this. I’m not a big fan to emphasise one victory or one loss too much. We have to work hard and go game by game and see what happens.”Chelsea v Southampton, Crystal Palace v Aston Villa, and more: football – liveRead moreWith league fixtures against ­Fulham, Manchester City and Aston Villa up next, perhaps he is wise not to allow his thoughts to drift too far into the future. In this battle between two clubs now with identical ­tallies, just a solitary point off fifth spot, ­Hürzeler concluded that his side was “the lucky winner” on the eve of his 32nd birthday.That was, perhaps, a slightly harsh assessment. IfBournemouthedged possession and perhaps enjoyed the best of the action in the middle of the park, it was Brighton who made their chances count.On his return from injury, Danny Welbeck proved the match-winner 15 minutes from time, restoring the hosts’ advantage just two minutes after entering the fray following a stunning Justin Kluivert strike that had cancelled out João Pedro’s fortunate early penalty.Andoni Iraola was left to rue his side failing to take advantage of a dominance that grew as the match wore on. “It’s difficult,” he said. “In the second half we played as good, if not better, than Brighton. We had more corners, more crosses, more time in their half. But in the end, when you lose, you have to make these things count and they have been the better in the box. That is what counts in football.”After an 11-match unbeaten league run to the end of January, ­Bournemouth have now lost three of their past five matches. But they remain seventh, above Brighton on goal difference.The hosts received an early boost here courtesy of a penalty that could either be deemed harsh on the helpless Kepa Arrizabalaga or simply the natural outcome of João Pedro’s attacking nous. Played in sweetly by a defence-splitting Diego Gómez pass, the Brazilian waited for the goalkeeper to charge off his line, poked the ball in the opposite direction without the slightest intention of ever regaining it, and happily ­clattered straight into Kepa.View image in fullscreenBournemouth’s Justin Kluivert celebrates scoring a spectacular goal.Photograph: Steven Paston/PAOnce Michael Oliver had pointed to the spot, the decision was never likely to be overturned and João Pedro duly converted. “I think the forward is very smart,” was Iraola’s verdict. “He buys the penalty.”The hosts might well have doubled their advantage just before half-time with a volley from the in-form Kaoru Mitoma. The Japanese winger did brilliantly to strike Tariq Lamptey’s cross so sweetly, given the ball was slightly behind him, but his shot hit a post.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionBournemouth responded to ­Iraola’s demands for an increase in intensity and just after the hour this had the desired effect. Kluivert ­levelled with one of the cleanest strikes he will place on a ball. Having picked it up on the left, the Dutchman drove infield, cut inside his defender and fired into the far top corner, rendering Bart Verbruggen’s full-stretch dive futile.Increasingly, it was the visitors who gained the ascendancy and only an excellent point-blank Verbruggen save stopped Alex Scott, on as a substitute, finding the net from close range.But then came Brighton’s sucker punch. With his first involvement after coming off the bench, ­Welbeck latched on to Georginio Rutter’s through ball and slotted neatly past the onrushing Kepa. His gently struck shot seemed to take an age, rolling towards the far post, where it flicked the inside of the post and nestled into the net, providing the injury-troubled striker his first goal since October.Evanilson came on for his first Bournemouth appearance since fracturing a bone in his foot at the start of January and was almost ­presented a late tap-in from a couple of yards, only for Verbruggen to palm Luis ­Sinisterra’s cross through the ­Brazilian’s legs.“The first half was good; we deserved to lead,” Hürzeler said. “The second half we suffered. It was not the most beautiful game for us, but very effective.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrighton & Hove AlbionBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Talibancontinues its brutal clampdownon women’s rights back in Afghanistan and Trott outlined the position his players find themselves in.“They know the difference between right and wrong,” said Trott, drawing a distinction between a team that play their cricket in exile under the previous Afghan flag and the regime at home. “They are under no illusions about where they have come from and they’re very courageous. You see that in their cricket and that’s the one thing I’ve not tried to change at all. They know who they are playing for and representing.”Jos Buttler admits stakes high for England and his captaincy against AfghanistanRead moreIt is not the first time England have met Afghanistan since western forces withdrew from the country in 2021, creating a power vacuum into which the Taliban returned. In the most recent, during the 2023 World Cup, Jos Buttler’s men were spun outfor a 69-run humblingin Delhi. Rashid Khan and Mohammad Nabi, whohave since publicly denouncedthe country’s ban on medical education for women, were the match‑winners.As things worsen in the country, as basic human rights for women and girls continue to be stripped away, calls for cricket to expel Afghanistan have grown. After all, the AfghanistanCricketBoard (ACB) enjoys the perks of being a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) but is also barred from making any provision for the women’s game by the Taliban.Back in the UK, this culminated in nearly 200 MPs, led by Labour’s Tonia Antoniazzi,writing to the England and Wales Cricket Boardon 7 January to ask it to consider boycotting this Champions Trophy fixture. The ECB resisted, citing the need for collective action.They were backed by the British government, which called on the ICC to enforce its own rules. But due to the geopolitics at play here, the notion of the sport penalising the ACB appears to be a depressing nonstarter. On Tuesday afternoon, on the eve of the Champions Trophy match, protestors were due to gather at Lord’s in the face of the inaction.Just a day after that letter was sent to the ECB a far more significant development took place in Dubai when India’s foreign minister, Vikram Misri, met with his Afghan equivalent, Amir Khan Muttaqi, for talks; the first tentative discussions in what,according to recent reports, could soon mean a Taliban-run Afghan embassy restored in New Delhi. India, with China hovering, is looking to deepen its influence in the region.Those talksreportedly revolved around humanitarian assistance and future development projects, as war-torn Afghanistan attempts to rebuild its infrastructure. But “ways to strengthen cooperation in sports, particularly cricket” were also on the agenda. Along with some recent, awkward photo opportunities with the team, this rather undermines the notion that the Taliban cares little about its men’s national team.View image in fullscreenJos Buttler (right) and Tom Banton take a breather during an England net session in Lahore.Photograph: Matthew Lewis-ICC/ICC/Getty ImagesThe ICC’s position ultimately depends on that of India. As the cameras kept reminding us when panning to the VIP box during India’s win against Pakistan in Dubai on Sunday, the ICC’s notionally independent chair is Jay Shah, son of India’s home minister, Amit Shah. He took the role in December, fresh from six years running a board that is heavily intertwined with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party by way of personnel and outlook.One of the things said about the ACB during all this – including by the British prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer – is that by not running a women’s programme, it is in breach of its obligations as an ICC full member. The ECB is understood to have sought clarification from the ICC’s legal team, with sources suggesting the issue has exposed more of a grey area in governance than may appear from the outside.The ICC’s criteria do state that in order to become a full member, a country must have an established women’s cricket programme, with the ACB granted dispensation to step up in 2017 on the proviso it would address this shortcoming in time.But now it is part of the club – and unlike for those countries with associate status – sources suggest there is no mechanism by which this can be monitored, or any action taken.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would still be the ACB’s money, just on hold.Another proposal is to divert part of the ICC’s development fund towards the women’s players who fled the country – the majority to Australia – and train female coaches and administrators. The ECB, when confirming this week’s match would go ahead, also called for the ICC to consider recognising an Afghanistan Women’s Refugee Team.But so far, beyond CA’s support of the Afghan women who made it to Australia and the ECB donating £100,000 to a refugee cricketer fund set up by the MCC Foundation, the situation appears to be going nowhere. These are small steps. Indeed, only last year, when Shah was chair of the Asian Cricket Council that distributes revenues from the biennial Asia Cup, Afghanistan’s split of that particular potwas increased.Given the men’s team is based in the United Arab Emirates – Trott has never set foot in Afghanistan – one of the arguments put forward by their allies at the top table is that their cost base is already extraordinarily high. The cynics in the room also suspect there are full members who do not want scrutiny of their own women’s affairs; that to penalise Afghanistan would be to set what they view as a dangerous precedent.“Every time we play the Afghanistan men’s team this issue will keep coming up,” said Richard Gould, the ECB chief executive who is currently in Lahore. “And that has got to be better than the alternative, where they are pushed out, cricket dies a death in Afghanistan, and we never have to worry about it again because it’s not in our field.”From playing in refugee camps to competing with the world’s best, the rise of Afghanistan’s men is one of cricket’s great stories. But right now, with half of its population barred from doing the same, the sport’s shortcomings are being exposed.Explore more on these topicsICC Champions TrophyAfghanistan cricket teamEngland cricket teamCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Earlier in the match, Miami defender Tomás Avilés received a red card for denying a goalscoring opportunity, having dragged down NYC FC forward Alonso Martinez from behind as he was in on the goalkeeper. Avilés scored Miami’s first goal off another Messi assist earlier in the match.Messi’s teammate Luis Suárez also received a similar fine for putting his hands on the back of the neck of NYC FC defender Birk Risa at half-time.The fine continues a notable week for Messi and referees in the United States. Earlier in the week, the referee in charge of Inter Miami’s Concacaf Champions League opener against Sporting KC was disciplined by the confederation after asking for the Argentinian’s shirt after the game.

Ryan Sessegnon scored in the opening minute of the match and Rodrigo Muniz fell just short of replicating the feat after the break to boost their European hopes, while the hosts blew the chance to move eight points clear of the drop zone.Vítor Pereira’s side were worthy of more but they set their own downfall by not paying sufficient attention after kick-offs and being wasteful in front of goal, apart from João Gomes’s consolation.Chelsea v Southampton, Crystal Palace v Aston Villa, and more: football – liveRead moreWolves had 18 shots but only five hit the target, while Fulham were efficient when opportunities arose to move two points off fifth and a potential Champions League spot.Pereira, the Wolves head coach, said: “Today I am frustrated because after three days playing again, starting the first half conceding a very easy goal. Our level of concentration and focus was not at the right level. When you start the second half in the same way, it is very difficult.“In the second half I felt the team was tired, the movement and pressing was not what we are used to. When they started with the subs, they have a lot of solutions in the squad and for us it is not the case.”In response to Fulham’s weekend home defeat, Marco Silva made five changes to his side. One of those was a firstPremier Leaguestart in more than two years for Sessegnon.If there were any concerns about the wing‑back being rusty, they were allayed in the first minute. Two other fresh players combined as Muniz did well to hold up the ball on the halfway line before finding Andreas Pereira. The forward slid a pass through for Sessegnon to run on to in space on the left wing; he saw José Sá coming, but slotted into the far corner for his first goal since October 2022.“He’s a lovely boy and the last two, three years, they were really tough for him,” Silva said of Sessegnon.View image in fullscreenRodrigo Muniz fires in Fulham’s winner.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/Reuters“A player that started at 16 years old in high level and I think all of us that we are here and probably everybody that loves football in this country, recognising that moment that he’s going to have an amazing career because he was a top, top, top talent and sometimes football is not always like that. Let’s hope the future is going to be bright for him again.”It was a frustrating start for Wolves after the positivity of their win against Bournemouth. Molineux was effectively silenced and needed something from the home team to enliven the mood, and Matheus Cunha is more often than not the man to provide it. Fulham knew this and paid him close attention but, after winning a free‑kick from Issa Diop, the Brazilian then left the defender in a spin as the home fans sensed their team were on top.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The midfielder thrashed home from close range, before running off to celebrate and urged the Wolves faithful to up the decibels. The noise grew but the hosts failed to use the momentum to their advantage.Wolves, it transpires, start halves of football slowly. A whopping 62 seconds after the break, Fulham were back ahead. Adama Traoré played the ball between the home defence and Muniz made a clever run to reach the pass first and dink the ball over Sá, to leave everyone in gold seeking hair to pull out.From that point on possession was dominated by Wolves. They were happy to knock it side-to-side in search of a fissure that might become a crack but the Fulham defence were disciplined, forcing them out wide and Cunha could not provide the same spark as earlier. Questions were posed by crosses into the box but without an obvious Wolves aerial threat, until Jørgen Strand Larsen came off the bench, the three Fulham centre-backs were happy to deal with what came their way.Silva was able to send out some of those rested players to close out the match. It felt like a missed opportunity for Wolves as they began a crucial run of fixtures. In their next four games Everton and West Ham visit Molineux, mixed with trips to two teams in the relegation zone, Southampton and Ipswich. They have the chance to make amends but have increased the pressure on themselves.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWolverhampton WanderersFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A number of potential investors have already been sounded out before the formal appointment of Oakvale, which will take place on Wednesday.Ben Stokes to skip the Hundred in order to focus on England’s Ashes tourRead moreMiddlesex have been a member-owned club since being founded in Islington in 1864 before moving to Lord’s 13 years later. But the traditional ownership model of English cricket is under increasing ­pressure, amid rising financial costs of recruiting ­players in a sport dominated by global Twenty20 leagues, and increased interest from overseas investors.Durham, Hampshire and Northamptonshire are the only privately-owned county clubs at present, but that appears destined to change. Yorkshire appointed Oakwell Sports Advisory last year to help them with demutualisation – the ­process through which a club converts from being member-owned to being owned by shareholders. This was paused during the Hundred auction – while this month Leicestershire appointed Pinto Capital with a view to selling a stake.Leicestershire are understood to have had approaches from a dozen interested parties, with Indian businesses in particular attracted by the thought of investing in a city where more than 30% of the population has Indian heritage. There has also been interest from Saudi Arabia.The unexpectedly high sale prices in the Hundred auction,which raised £520m for the sportwith the eight franchises valued at more than £975m, has sparked renewed ­interest in English cricket from investors who missed out or declined to bid.Quick GuideSmith signs for HundredShowSteve Smith is joining Welsh Fire as the Hundred's retained players and new signings were announced on Tuesday. Smith said in a statement from the England and Wales Cricket Board: \"I'm delighted to be joining Welsh Fire later this summer.\"I was due to be involved with the Hundred at the beginning of the competition so it's great to finally be able to make it to Wales. I've watched The Hundred from afar and I can't wait to be involved. It looks a lot of fun and obviously the cricket is world class, with talent at every team.\"I'm looking forward to trying out a new format and hopefully playing my part for [the head coach] Mike Hussey and the rest of the boys.\"Also among the new signings are Smith's compatriots Meg Lanning (Oval Invincibles), Megan Schutt (Birmingham Phoenix) and Marcus Stoinis (Trent Rockets), New Zealand's Trent Boult (Birmingham Phoenix) and Afghanistan's Rashid Khan (Oval Invincibles).England players retained include Jos Buttler (Manchester Originals), Joe Root (Trent Rockets), Harry Brook, Adil Rashid (both Northern Superchargers), Nat Sciver-Brunt (Trent Rockets) and Sophie Ecclestone (Manchester Originals).It is the first time teams have been able to sign one men's and one women's player directly, rather than having to do do through the Hundred Draft.The retentions and signings saw 148 places confirmed across the squads, with 68 left to fill.The draft takes place on  12 March, with a final chance to make squad additions coming in May at the Wildcard Draft, where teams can add two final men's and women's players, rewarding standout performers in domestic cricket.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Lord’s-based Hundred franchise London Spirit fetched the highest price in the auction, with a consortium including the India-born chief executives of Google and Microsoft valuing the team at £295m, and Middlesex’s long association with the home of cricket makes the club particularly attractive to overseas investors.As long-term tenants of MaryleboneCricketClub the possibility of the MCC buying into Middlesex has been mooted on numerous occasions, although as both are member-owned clubs the process would be more complex. Securing private investment from the likes of the Google/Microsoft ­consortium should theoretically be more straightforward, although it would still require the endorsement of Middlesex’s 7,000 members. Under club rules at least half of the membership would be required to vote for a demutuali­sation ballot to be valid, with a 75% majority needed for the motion to go private to be passed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The club’s financial position has improved as a result of cost-cutting in recent years and they posted their first profit since 2016 last year, which has enabled them to make the surprise signing of New Zealand batter Kane Williamson as their overseas player this summer.Middlesex’s long-term future at Lord’s remains uncertain, however, with just 12 months left on their lease. While they will continue to play at the ground, access is an increasing problem, which will increase further if the Hundred expands and the club require an additional venue.Middlesex declined to comment but sources at the club said that demutualisation is not a short-term proposal.Explore more on these topicsMiddlesexCricketSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Maintenance crews were working to remove large pieces of debris from the shore, and the department advised beachgoers to avoid visible fire debris and stay out of the ocean water where advisories were posted.The department of public health lifted theocean water quality rain advisorylast week for all Los Angeles county beaches except those affected by fire. Beaches fromLas Flores beach to Santa Monica state beachwere still under advisory warnings.Just days after the fires began, winds carried ash and charred debris up to 100 miles (161km) offshore. Since then, wind and waves have spread the charred material along the county’s coastline.“The fires burn also through vegetations that normally will help stabilize soil,” said Tania Pineda-Enriquez, water-quality data and policy specialist at Heal the Bay, an environmental advocacy group. “Without this natural barrier, all the ash and soil will be washed out into the waterways.”Beachgoers can still hang around the sand areas but should avoid water contact, especially near storm drains, creeks and rivers, since ocean water-quality testing results are still pending, according to the department of public health.Initial sediment testing at Will Rogers state beach and Topanga Beach shows that the charred silt and sediment are not hazardous to people or the environment, the department of beaches and harbors said.More testing is being conducted this week. The dark sediment, made up of fine ash mixed with sand, will not be removed to prevent further shoreline erosion and habitat destruction.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Delegates are due to meet at Cop16, the UN’s biodiversity conference, to discuss global targets to stop nature loss by 2030.The additional meeting in Rome was called after talks were suspended in confusion in the Colombian city of Cali in November when they overran and delegates left to catch flights home.The failure of the conference to conclude with clear outcomes left some describing global nature targets as “unfunded words on paper”.Q&AWhat is Cop16 and why is it reconvening?ShowEvery two years, representatives from around the world meet to discuss UN targets to halt nature loss by 2030. The gathering is formally known as the conference of the parties of the UN convention on biological diversity – shortened in this case to Cop16, as it is the 16th meeting.The last gathering was in Cali, Colombia, last November, but themeeting ended in chaoswith key issues left unresolved. From 25 to 27 February in Rome, parties will gather for an additional meeting to finish those negotiations, and tackle the most divisive issue: money.The main topics being discussed include who will pay for conservation and how to distribute the money. Delegates are also set to agree on a monitoring framework, so countries can be held to account on their progress on meeting thebiodiversity targetsfor this decade.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A challenging international climateSince then, international environmental diplomacy has had further setbacks. November’s climate talks in Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, ended in what developing countries described asbetrayal and failure.In December, nationsfailed to reach agreementon how to curb plastic pollution. In the European Union, a longtime leader on nature commitments,a number of countries have scaled backtheir ambitions or watered down environmental laws.In January, Donald Trump was inaugurated, and vowed towithdraw the US from the Paris agreementa second time. Although the US is not part of the UN’s convention on biological diversity (CBD), afreeze on spending by USAid and other agenciesis creating disruption in developing nations and among conservation projects.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump campaigning last year, with Kristi Noem, then state governor and now homeland security secretary. He is again withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement.Photograph: APAndreas Bjelland Eriksen, Norway’s climate and environment minister, who plans to attend the talks, says: “We see a more challenging international climate for many reasons, which requires even more political engagement to be able to land some of the difficult discussions.”However, only a few ministers are expected to attend, including representatives from Canada, Madagascar, France and Germany. The UK is not sending a minister, and is considering not sending its nature envoy, but a government official claimed it would “be there with a real kind of leadership hat on, as always”.“We can use the privileged fact that we’re English speakers, that we’ve got an amazing science base, we’ve got the City of London. We can kind of run it in that way,” the official said at a briefing before the conference.A lack of confirmed attenders in the months leading up to the conference has raised concerns about whether the meeting would reach the necessary quorum – of about two-thirds of countries attending – to make any of its decisions valid. A British government official confirmed there had been concerns about this not being reached, with “additional checks going on to make sure that people do intend to come”.The Rome gathering is a smaller, additionalCop16meeting, and countries would not have planned for it in their annual budgets. Some delegations might consider sending a diplomat from Rome. Sources suggest that more than 150 countries out of 196 have now registered their intention to attend.Dealing with fury over financeThe question of money – where it is coming from and how much – will dominate the three days of talks in the Italian capital as delegates thrash out the thorniest part of the UN Cop16 biodiversity agreement.A number of countrieswere angryat the way the talks had been dragged out in Cali and the fact that the crucial issue of finance was left undecided.View image in fullscreenA Greenpeace protest at the Cop16 summit in Cali last October. The activist’s sign, referring to pledges of finance, reads: ‘Keep your promise: $20bn by 2025.’Photograph: Luis Acosta/AFP/GettyHanging over the meetings is developed countries’ failure to produce funding for biodiversity protections in poorer countries.As of 2022 – the latest year for which data is available and before the Cop15 deal was signed – wealthy countries that signed the accord provided$10.95bn (£8.9bn) in biodiversity funding. This is far short of their pledge at Cop15 to deliver $20bn by 2025. No major funding announcements are expected in Rome.Brian O’Donnell, director of the environmental group Campaign for Nature, says the question of how to mobilise resources needs to be resolved. “I feel like it’s taking all the oxygen out of the room.”In Cali, developing countries – especially theAfrica Groupand Brazil – demanded a new mechanism to distribute biodiversity finance. They say the current fund – which sits within theGlobal Environment Facility (GEF), the UN’s main source of finance for biodiversity – is too difficult to access and is controlled by wealthy nations.This was a red line for many countries in Cali. O’Donnell says there have been discussions and consultations on the question of a new fund in recent weeks. “I don’t know if there’s been movement per se, but I think there’s been a desire to find an outcome,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Global wildlife populations have plunged by an average of 73% between 1970 and 2020, according to themost recent assessment, with global heatingexpected to blast throughthe 1.5C (2.7F) target to at least 2.5C.The thorniest issues may still be on the table, but some significant decisions were reached during the two weeks of talks in Cali. This included a global levy onproducts made using genetic data from natureand formal incorporation of Indigenous communities in the official decision-making of the UN biodiversity process, described as a “watershed moment” for their representation.Governments failed at Cop16 to sign off on how this decade’s targets would be monitored, however. It is understood that most countries agreed on the draft monitoring framework but were unable to sign off on it after they ran out of time, so this will also be on the agenda in Rome.View image in fullscreenCoral bleaching at Western Australia’s Ningaloo reef.

In an interview recorded before the gathering, she said parties would be meeting in Rome with a “spirit of consensus”.The world has not yet met a UN target on halting the destruction of nature, and the targets being discussed now will be assessed in 2030. Although Rome will be a smaller meeting, with fewer delegates and no civil society present, it is seen as crucial if global biodiversity targets are to be met.The world needs $700bn a year to restore nature.

Merlin tells the trees: “Myself, I am fearful, anxious about you, lest the woodmen should come, forest hewing, to dig your roots and pollute your seed so that an apple might never grow on you again.”Another,Yr Oianau(Lamentations), from the same era, features Merlin sympathising with a piglet: “Och, little piglet, oh little white sow, do not sleep a morning sleep, do not dig in the woods in caseRhydderch Hael[a king and Merlin’s foe] comes with his trained hounds.”The project was a joint venture between Cardiff University, theUniversity of Wales Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies, and Swansea University.The researchers have been combing through manuscripts in the National Library of Wales, in Aberystwyth, and also in the 15th-centuryRed Book of Hergestat Jesus College, Oxford.They also discovered more about the importance of Merlin’s sister, Gwenddydd. Callander said: “Gwenddydd is a really important figure in Welsh Merlin poetry. She supports Merlin and also appears to be a prophet in her own right.“We found hundreds of lines of poetry in her voice in dialogue with her brother. Merlin describes her as ‘fair Gwenddydd, summit of dignity’ and ‘refuge of songs’. One of the important aspects of the project is to throw light on this lost female voice from medievalWales.”Callander said it was surprising that early Merlin poems had been largely neglected. “These Welsh-language texts had not been edited or translated in full, meaning much material has been missed out.”He described Merlin as an ancient Briton of the “Old North” of northern England and southern Scotland, presented as having lived in the sixth century. “The Welsh claimed Merlin as their own, a prophet and poet to glorify their victories and lament their defeats.”One significant find is a new ending toGwasgargerdd Fyrddin (Separation Song). Previously it was thought that the poem ended on a happy note, with victory for the Britons. The new ending presents a more tragic Merlin, devastated by grief at the loss of the lord he served.The research team also explored the relationship between the Welsh Merlin poems and the broader Arthurian tradition, popularised throughout Europe by Geoffrey of Monmouth, who brought the figures of Arthur and Merlin together.Callander said these early poems about Merlin had not been fully explored by modern scholars partly because of Geoffrey of Monmouth – and also because there are so few people trained to read these medieval Welsh texts.The website is livein beta form. The finished version will be published by the end of the year and the poems are being made available in Welsh and English.Explore more on these topicsWalesPoetryHeritageCardiff UniversitySwansea UniversityUniversity of Wales Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic StudiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Looming just beneath the veneer of muddy roads and fresh mountain snow is the reality of worsening drought.What had been thedriest start to a rainy season in historyfor most of southern California – with just a fraction of an inch of rain falling from early October through late January – is now looking to return to a weeks-long dry pattern, according to current projections from the National Weather Service. No additional significant rains or snows are in the forecast forat least the next two weeks, andpossibly longer.Current snowpackin the southern Sierra mountain range in California is well below average for the beginning of March, echoing a pattern amongthe entire “lower basin” of the Colorado River catchment, including most of the state of Arizona – plus the desert cities of Las Vegas and southern California, which pipe in water from the river over a complex system of aqueducts and canals. Mountain snows during the winter months are crucially important to the healthy flow of the Colorado during the spring and summer months, and this year, they haven’t come. The snowpack across the multi-state regioncurrently sits at just 25% of normal. Annual snowpack in the region typically peaks around 1 March before the spring melt season begins.With the south-west under the influence ofa La Niña weather pattern, which typically results in drier winters across the southern United States, that means time is running out for the approximately 40 million people who depend on water from the Colorado River.“We are near a tipping point on the Colorado,” said Greg Pierce, an urban planner who directs the UCLAWaterResources Group.This year’s drought on the Colorado River isn’t new: the current episode of unusual dryness began in 2000, according todata from the US Geological Survey, and has been worsened by the rising temperatures associated with increasing global greenhouse gas emissions. The drought has kicked off a tense period of renegotiating decades-old agreements that govern the river’s usage between states, tribes, cities and landowners that reached a head last fall during the final days of the Biden administration.Pierce said it seemed the difficult lessons that “rivers have hard limits” and climate change is going to reduce the river’s predictable flow – combined with historic low water levels – had finally gotten through to key stakeholders.Initial compromises have resulted ina reversal of declines at key reservoirs along the Colorado, a sign that efforts were paying off.Pierce said states were “seemingly close to a long-term deal last fall” which would have brought significant federal investment in water management and conservation across the south-west in exchange for binding near-term commitments to reduce water withdrawals from the river. Such a deal may even have been enough to push the zero-hour on the river decades into the future.However, the Trump administration’s early actions – like purging the government of federal employees working on climate – have given pause to those who study the Colorado River and advocate for conservation efforts.“I am concerned that we may go backwards and not follow through on the cuts that had begun to be made,” Pierce said. “A lot of parties involved may take the Trump anti-scientific approach as a means to delay the inevitable. Which will just make the inevitable harder.”Billions of dollars in aid had been earmarked for Colorado River basin states to help mitigate drought under the Inflation Reduction Act, the signature climate bill passed by President Joe Biden.A day-one Trump executive order has blocked that funding indefinitely.“My biggest fear,” said Lisa Dilling, a climate scientist and a former professor at University of Colorado Boulder, “is that people will be indiscriminately fired and we will thus lose decades of technical and practical knowledge for delivering essential water across the US west”.“With over 40 million people dependent on water from the Colorado River, I would hope that the federal administration retains and supports the highly skilled and experienced civil servant scientists and engineers that know how to run the system effectively.”Meanwhile, drought continues to intensify across the south-west US.Over the past month extreme drought – the third-highest scale – has expanded in California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Nevada, according to theUS Drought Monitor. Las Vegas has received less than a quarter of normal rainfall during its wintertime peak. This month’s rains ended a 214-day stretch without any precipitation there.Southern Arizona, arguably the hardest hit by the current drought, missed out on meaningful rains altogether in February. The Phoenix area has received less than 5% of normal rains since last summer, andmissed a 50-year dry spell record by a single day. Impacts on farmers and ranchers across Arizonahave been severe.In Los Angeles, extreme drought remains even after the ample recent rains left the city stillmore than 3in short since last summer.While most of southern California has received less than half its normal rainfall, northern California’sreservoirs are full, and February brought nearly3ft of additional snowpackfor the high peaks of the Sierras. Given increasing hydrological inequity across the south-west US, there’s no certainty how long that water will last.Explore more on these topicsDroughtCaliforniaArizonaNevadaWaterWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

People aware of the discussions say officials are discussing a range of changes to the plans, which would exempt certain sectors from the opt-out system and would give preferential access to British AI companies.Why are creatives fighting UK government AI proposals on copyright?Read moreOne said: “Ministers would very much like to find something everyone can work with. Abandoning the plans altogether is not seen as an option as it would put British AI companies at a disadvantage, but there are ways to protect certain sectors which are particularly important, and to make sure big US technology giants are not getting all the benefit.”A government spokesperson said: “No decisions will be taken until we are absolutely confident we have a practical plan that delivers each of our objectives, including increased control for rights holders to help them easily license their content, enabling lawful access to material to train world-leading AI models in the UK, and building greater transparency over material being used.”The plan to grant an exemption to UK copyright rules for AI companies looking to train their models was announced earlier this year as part of a cross-government push to boost the British AI industry.The AI models powering systems such as ChatGPT use vast amounts of data taken from the internet and learn to spot patterns in it. This allows them to produce comprehensible text, plausible images and convincing audio.It has prompted an angry response from British artists, however, withPaul McCartney sayingAI “could just take over”. Elton John, one of Labour’s most prominent backers at the last election,said this weekendthe plans would “destroy the UK’s leadership” in the music industry.More than 1,000 musicians, including Kate Bush, Damon Albarn and Annie Lennox,released a silent albumon Tuesday in protest against the plans.Faced with a concerted backlash from some of the country’s most famous celebrities, officials are looking for ways to offer them extra protections. One could be to allow creative industries to opt in to the new system, while offering AI companies the use of mass media such as journalism for free unless those companies opted out.Another would be to allow British AI companies to benefit from an opt-out system, while forcing their US counterparts to secure consent before accessing copyrighted material.It’s grand theft AI and UK ministers are behind it. Oppose this robbery of people’s creativity | Andrew Lloyd Webber and Alastair WebberRead moreMinisters say they are keen to protect British creative producers in their final plans, which will be announced later this year.Speaking to reporters during a trade mission to Delhi, the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said creators have “got to be able to earn a decent living … [that is] absolutely something we have to embed for the future”.He added that ministers had got to get the balance right on copyright and were listening to the concerns of creative industries.“We absolutely believe the creative industries are essential to the UK in both economic and cultural terms and we want to build on that strength,” he said.Others, however, are sceptical about any concessions the government could offer without abandoning its plans altogether.One music industry insider consulted on the proposals said: “Officials have repeatedly promised to offer ‘guardrails’ to protect the creative industries, but they have not said exactly how they would work.“The idea of tearing up copyright law for some sectors but not for others is frankly a nonsense.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingIntellectual propertynewsShareReuse this content"

Upton is also disputing it. The doctor complained to the board about Peggie’s behaviour, claiming it amounted to bullying, after an altercation in the women’s changing room in Victoria hospital, Kirkcaldy, in December 2023.Peggie told a hearing earlier this month that she had felt “embarrassed and intimidated” when Upton started to get changed alongside her.Upton’s complaint also alleged that on another occasion Peggie left a seriously ill patient when the doctor appeared in the cubicle, a claim that Peggie denies. The tribunal has been adjourned until July.In Holyrood on Tuesday afternoon, the social justice secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, said the Scottish government was considering the letter from the EHRC, which has also raised concerns over forthcoming guidance for NHSScotlandthat will recommend trans staff be allowed to use their “preferred facilities”.Responding to a question from the Scottish Conservative shadow equalities minister, Tess White, Somerville said: “This government stands firmly behind the separate and single-sex exemptions provided in the 2010 act. Members will be aware this allows for trans people to be excluded when this is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.”However, referring to reporting in the Herald thatNHSFife may have broken the law by not carrying out the required equality impact assessment on its changing room policy, White said: “We still don’t know how many public bodies are acting unlawfully when it comes to single-sex spaces. This is exactly what we warned about when Nicola Sturgeon was pursuing her flawed gender self-ID plans.”No woman should be forced to change her clothes in front of a male colleague | Sonia SodhaRead moreBefore the Scottish Labour conference last weekend, the party’s leader, Anas Sarwar, said he regretted his party’s support for gender recognition reforms, which remain permanently stalledafter a challengefrom the previous UK government.Sarwar called for clearer guidance on single-sex provision in the Scottish public sector, but the first minister, John Swinney, has said current guidance is “crystal clear”.Lawyers and campaigners are watching the Peggie tribunal closely given how little case law exists on the question of workplace changing rooms.In England, a group of nurses are suing County Durham and Darlington NHS foundation trust for sexual harassment and sex discrimination because of a policy that allows trans women to use their women’s changing rooms.Explore more on these topicsScotlandGenderTransgenderScottish politicsWomenNHSNursingnewsShareReuse this content"

But he appeared willing to break Lords rules by offering access to ministers and other peers during discussions with the fake developers concerning sponsorship of a commercial event in parliament run by his son, a deal that cost £25,000.“It’s great being aLabourpeer at the moment because we’ve got our mates who now have senior jobs, which is wonderful,” Lord Evans said.He said the way to reach Rayner was not “directly” but through a more junior housing minister to get “the lower ranks, so to speak, on side”.0:25Lord Evans speaks to undercover reporters and his son about invites for the main event, 19 DecemberThe undercover reporters posed as representatives of property investors who wanted to turn old department stores into homes. Legislation introduced by the Conservative government simplified the planning rules on such conversions, and there are tax breaks for such a change of use. The reporters told the peerthey wanted to ensure the Labour government retained these rules.An online meeting with Lord Evans took place six days before Christmas. It followed weeks of messages and two earlier Zoom calls with his son,Richard Evans, about the sponsorship.During these earlier discussions, Richard, 56, proposed creating opportunities, alongside the event, to meet ministers in parliament. He made it clear the payment of £25,000 to his company for the sponsorship had to happen first.He stated on several occasions that his father had done nothing wrong. He also suggested in one online meeting: “There’s nothing untoward about [the proposal]. It’s basically thinking creatively.”Over a series of calls he implied several times that the deal could be viewed the wrong way, at one point saying he could not write anything down as his proposal “looks dodgy”.The House of Lords event at the heart of the discussions is one of at least four run by his son through a company in which Lord Evans holds a third of the shares. All four of the events were or are due to be hosted by the peer, and parliamentarians are advertised as attending. Two have already taken place.Rules ban peers from exploiting their membership of the Lords. While there are grey zones in the rules, peers must follow key principles, including a requirement to act as parliamentarians on their “personal honour”.There are also rules barring peers from hosting for-profit events in parliament.Dr Jonathan Rose, a political integrity expert at De Montfort University who reviewed the evidence, said the Guardian’s findings warranted investigation as he believed Lord Evans’ involvement with the venture appeared to be a breach of these rules.He said Lord Evans’ offers of access seemed “corrupt” as in his view it would be an inappropriate “abuse of power, by virtue of him being a member of the House of Lords, for the benefit of his son, and his own benefit”. Lord Evans is a one-third shareholder in his son’s company. There is no suggestion of illegality.Do you have information about this story?

He said: “To my knowledge, I have not broken any House of Lords rules and I have NOT taken any personal benefits.”He added: “I would NOT and I do NOT accept payments for hosting any House of Lords events.” He said he had never approached Rayner to speak at any event.Richard said the venture was not “profit-driven” but a “commitment to strengthening the construction industry”.The investigation is part of a wider series by the Guardian, calledthe Lords debate, examining the workings of the upper chamber and its members. It is being published against the backdrop of moves by the Labour government to raise standards and reduce the size of the House of Lords.While Lord Evans has not received any payments in connection with the events, the revelation that a member of the Lords is involved with what appears to amount to a cash-for-access venture raises questions about standards in parliament.‘We are looking for a sponsor’Parliament’s Cholmondeley Room, a marquee on the terrace overlooking the Thames, was busy when the Guardian’s undercover reporter arrived.Promoting the November lunch, Richard, who uses the title “the honourable”, had keenly advertised on LinkedIn the “AI in Construction” event as “the opportunity for everyone to network at the highest level”. He called for readers to “sponsor this powerful event now!” and shared a document filled with pictures of parliament and details of sponsorship opportunities, including a platinum level, for £25,000.Printed alongside was: “The Lord David Charles Evans of Watford is fully onboard supporting this initiative. Ministers and members of the House of Lords invited shall be confirmed shortly.”To find out more about Lord Evans’ involvement in the events, one of the undercover reporters, posing as a marketing adviser to a group of property investors, paid £600 for access to the November lunch. The ticket was described as a complimentary part of membership of Affinity, a network to enable collaboration.Over drinks before lunch, the reporter suggested to Lord Evans that a client could be interested in sponsoring future events. Lord Evans said they should speak to his son, and immediately made an introduction.As the lunch wrapped up, Richard got up to promote “our next House of Lords event” in March 2025. “We are looking for a sponsor, hint hint, to make these amazing events happen, without mentioning names,” he said.He finished: “But seriously, this is about collaboration, bringing great people together and doing business.”The next day, Richard emailed the undercover reporter to propose a meeting.‘There’s nothing untoward about it, it’s basically thinking creatively’Speaking over Zoom from a cafe in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, where he lives, Richard asked what the reporter’s client would be looking for from an event. Within three minutes, Richard referred to a company that had already agreed to sponsor three events in parliament at £25,000 each.Richard was eager to show his father’s involvement and suggested he needed a steer for the event so he could answer the question “when Dad says ‘what minister do you want me to get?’”.He added: “If I look at housing, then we would – I mean, the ideal scenario is to get Angela Rayner there.”Later in the meeting, he said: “Before the event we start introducing […], there’s nothing untoward about it. It’s basically thinking creatively.”0:38Richard speaking with undercover reporter, 6 DecemberRichard made a proposal to hold a separate meeting in a Lords committee room, to which he would invite ministers and the property developer. He suggested a debate on housing. “My father would come. He would make a speech because he gets really upset about it all.”Richard said his father was keen to propose to Rayner an idea to create a £5bn investment fund for housebuilding. Richard suggested the property developer could join forces with Lord Evans, and he explained how his father was hoping to pitch his plan to Rayner.“My dad – his first step with Rachel Reeves and Rachel Reeves would introduce to Angela Rayner. He’s focused on getting a meeting with Angela Rayner’s office because he wants to pitch his idea,” he said.Richard also suggested Roy Kennedy, the Lords chief whip, may assist in getting Rayner to attend the meeting. He said: “Roy Kennedy has promised to introduce Angela Rayner. So if we had Angela Rayner – sorry, if we had Roy Kennedy, who could speak as the key speaker. And if he could convince her to come to that committee room meeting just to pop in, then we start the ball rolling. You know, it’s a bit like dating, you know?”A spokesperson for Kennedy told the Guardian: “At no point did Roy agree to any of this – in fact, he was never asked.”Richard was clear that these proposedintroductions to senior government figures in committee room meetings would come after a sponsorship deal for the bigger eventwas signed and payment made– a platinum sponsorship, as he wrote directly to the reporter later that afternoon.‘Can you imagine if the press got hold of that?’Two weeks before Christmas, Richard suggested in a WhatsApp message a catchup call. In an email, the undercover reporter said his client wanted a meeting with Richard and his father. Richard replied that the meeting would be “firstly with just me for several reasons”. He followed up with a voice memo.“I have to be incredibly sensitive, the subjects we’re talking about, because we’re moving from sponsoring an event to arranging a committee room,” he said. “Can you imagine if the press got hold of that? It’s got nothing to do with my father anyway, in the sense of me organising it all. He will not come on a call if we’re going to be talking about sponsorship and money.”1:50Voice memo from Richard to an undercover reporter, 16 December – audioLater, Richard told the reporter he had spoken to his father. According to Richard, Lord Evans said he had lined up Richard Harrington, a peer and former Conservative minister, to speak at the wider March event.‘It looks dodgy’In a video call on 17 December to discuss meeting Lord Evans, Richard said his father had outlined a route to Rayner to discuss his £5bn housing fund proposal, and he repeated his earlier suggestion to include the sponsor in these discussions.He said: “He’s gone through Roy Kennedy and he’s also going through Richard Harrington. He’s going through – and he will get there in the end because that is politics.”Richard suggested he and his father could work to try to get Matthew Pennycook MP, a housing and planning minister, to the March event. “We will try to get him there,” he said. “I’ll talk to Dad again.”He warned they had to be careful. They needed to keep the sponsorship of the main event separate from the committee room meeting, he said. Lord Evans later told the Guardian he was only involved in organising a speaker for the main event.Richard continued: “I think that we should stick to – without getting ourselves into deep water. One is we’re delivering an event.“And from that, it’s going to lead on to committee room meetings. That’s it. I cannot put that in writing. Like if you do this, you will get that. It’s really – you know, it looks dodgy.”But first, “we want to come to an agreement now and we want to sort out payment now, now, right, before Christmas,” he added.1:02Richard speaking with an undercover reporter on 17 December about who to invite to the main eventFollowing their discussion, Richard confirmed by WhatsApp after a question from the reporter that the price of the sponsorship was £25,000 plus VAT. At the reporter’s request, he organised an online meeting with his father, to be held two days later.Confirming this in a voice message, Richard said: “My dad doesn’t gain financially at all from this and he’s just helping me out and helping me achieve my mission to provide a platform.”‘Our mates who now have senior jobs’Six days before Christmas, the second undercover reporter, posing as the frontman of the property investors, dialled in to speak with Lord Evans from the back of a taxi.According to his son, Lord Evans had been nervous before the meeting: “He thinks it could be the Guardian.”But once on the call, Lord Evans spoke openly about what he could offer in terms of access to parliamentarians and ministers. As the undercover reporter explained that they were seeking the opportunity to “have our voice heard” to ensure planning and VAT rules were not changed, Lord Evans took notes.“This will give you the opportunity to say exactly that,” Lord Evans said. “Because, I mean, as you know, it’s Richard’s event. I host it on the political side.”Then, Lord Evans spoke about his support for the government’s objective to build more homes, and said he had been proposing to the Cabinet Office that it create a fund to encourage foreign investment to build social housing.He added: “I’m very, very happy to support you. And I can introduce you. We’ll have some senior people there, including Richard Harrington, who’s doing a report, you may know, on housing and has worked on it, and I’m seeing him in early January to talk about it.”He continued: “We’ll invite the housing minister and some friends on the – in the ministerial – I mean, it’s great being a Labour peer at the moment, because we’ve got our mates who now have senior jobs, which is wonderful.”2:02Lord Evans on 19 December talking about his views on housing and offering to make introductionsWhen asked if any potential competitors would be invited to the event, Lord Evans said: “Richard has the financial side.”Richard then said: “They’re not going to get into our network even if they were there. Because that’s not the way it works.”He added: “We invoice now and would appreciate payment by return.” Later in the call, he said work could start as soon as payment was received. “I’m the one that’s going to get the people there and make it happen. And obviously Dad’s helping, but he’s from a political angle, I’m the commercial angle. So we just happen to unite.”1:05Richard Evans and an undercover reporter discuss invoicing for sponsorship, 19 DecemberOn the subject of Rayner, the reporter posing as the marketing consultant said he had told the property investors they would not be meeting her the next day.Lord Evans agreed Rayner was a key person and said: “And I think the route is through the housing minister rather than going directly with her. Get the lower ranks, so to speak, on side, which I’m sure they are because they all know what we’re up against.”He continued: “It’s well publicised and we’re – the ideas I’ve got will overcome that. And when I – when we meet in January, early February, I’ll explain it to you properly.” Lord Evans later extended the invitation for this lunch to both undercover reporters, and wished them a good Christmas.Richard Evans is not bound by the House of Lords rules, and when approached for comment he told the Guardian that “a variety of people” would be invited to the committee room “‘concept’” to “facilitate the exchange of ideas with housebuilders”. He said the Affinity events in parliament were “educative”, with 90% of attenders on gifted places.He said the £25,000 sponsorship deal “extends beyond covering the cost of event delivery – it includes ongoing marketing support for our sponsors”.He added: “Ministers are invited to speak briefly (typically six to 10 minutes) to update guests on a latest government news at these educational events, before returning to their busy schedules.”Lord Evans said he was not involved in cash for access. He said he was “NOT involved in the commercial side of the event and only interested in the political objective of building more social housing”. He said his conversations with the undercover reporters were about organising a speaker for the March event.He said he had “totally forgotten” he had shares in the company and had never taken any money from it.0:54Undercover reporters call Rayner ‘key’ and Lord Evans explains ‘the route’ to her, 19 DecemberA Labour spokesperson said: “Neither Angela Rayner nor Matthew Pennycook were aware of the activities of these individuals or involved with them in any way.”The next day the reporters pulled out of the deal. Richard has continued to seek sponsors for more events in the Lords.Weeks after speaking to the undercover reporters, Lord Harrington was advertised as the speaker at the March event. However, on Monday, when contacted by the Guardian, he pulled out.He said: “I was personally asked by Lord Evans to speak at an event on foreign direct investment.”He added: “Given the information that has been presented, I will no longer be attending the event.”A new brochure promoting the event has also been published on LinkedIn. It no longer features any reference to Lord Evans.Explore more on these topicsHouse of LordsThe Lords debateLabourAngela RaynernewsShareReuse this content"

Carey denied seeing a report about Smyth’s actions.The former archbishop resigned as a priest in December after an investigation into the C of E’s handling of a separate sexual abuse case, but he could still be banned from ministry for life.After the Makin review was published in November, the C of E’s national safeguarding team said clergy named in the report could face action if they posed an immediate safeguarding risk, or were responsible for failures of leadership, moral accountability or reputation risk to the church.The maximum penalty faced by the 10 clergy is a life prohibition from church ministry. A new C of E disciplinary measure that allows priests to be “defrocked”, or stripped of their holy orders, was given final approval by the general synod, the church’s ruling body, this month but is yet to come into effect.Paul Butler, who was bishop of Durham until a year ago, also faces disciplinary proceedings, along with Rev Sue Colman, who is married to Sir Jamie Colman, heir to the mustard dynasty. The Colmans were named in a damning report as financial backers of Smyth.The other priests named are Andrew Cornes, Roger Combes, Tim Hastie-Smith, Hugh Palmer, Paul Perkin, Nick Stott and John Woolmer.All cases are outside a 12-month time limit for complaints, so the national safeguarding team will apply for “out of time” disciplinary proceedings.The team has not said how long the process is likely to take, other than it hopes it will be weeks, rather than months or years.The independent review, conducted by Keith Makin, concluded that Smyth, thought to be the most prolific serial abuser associated with the church, might have been brought to justice had Welby formally reported allegations to police in 2013.Smyth died aged 77 in Cape Town in 2018 while under investigation by Hampshire police, andso never faced justice.Alexander Kubeyinje, the C of E’s national director of safeguarding, said: “We know this will never undo the harm caused but the church is committed to taking very seriously its response to the findings of the review as well as responding to its recommendations.”Since Welby’s resignation, Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York, and currently de facto leader of the church, has faced calls to resign over alleged failures regarding other claims of abuse and misconduct.A group of victims and survivors of Smyth’s abuse said disclosures of Smyth’s abuse were made to “the very highest levels of the C of E”; however, “none of the bishops and archbishops who were involved in that failure will face any sanctions …“Almost all of those who are to be subject to disciplinary processes are now retired. None of us are aware of the reasons why [disciplinary action] should be sought for these 10, but not for others criticised in the Makin review. It is unclear, for example, why Archbishop Justin Welby, who resigned over his ‘personal and moral’ failings is excluded.”Explore more on these topicsAnglicanismChristianityReligionRape and sexual assaultChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

He had not been charged with any offences.The group involved in the alleged sting said it had removed the livestreamed video.In a post online, it said: “Can we please respect his family and allow them to grieve. We did what we had to do and expose a pred, but unfortunately we have no control of what they decide to do following a sting.”The group told the Guardian it had been operating since September 2022 and claimed to have caught more than 150 individuals who went on to be convicted and sentenced.The group, which is made up of 10 people, said they would typically contact police when they had confirmed the identity of an alleged suspect, shortly before they went live online.An inquest will be held into the man’s death in due course.In a statement, Avon and Somerset police said: “The death is being treated as non-suspicious and his next of kin are being offered support during this difficult time. Our thoughts and sympathies remain with them.“A mandatory referral has been made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) following previous police contact.” The force added: “We would ask people not to speculate during this time and to respect the family’s privacy.”An IOPC spokesperson said: “We can confirm we have received a referral from Avon and Somerset police in connection with a man’s death on Saturday evening.

This would enable the airport to be used for 100,000 more flights a year.‘The flying bum’: can a UK firm making huge airships finally get off the ground?Read moreThe chancellor, Rachel Reeves, gave her backing for Heathrow’s third runway projectin a speech on growth last month.The CAA said it had considered the implications of a third runway atHeathrow airporton its fellow London hub.It argued: “Gatwick’s airline and passenger base is significantly different from that using Heathrow and we remain of the view that there are likely to be benefits to consumers in expanding capacity in Gatwick, including in relation to meeting the demands of passengers in the choice of destinations, enhanced competitive pressure on airlines and the greater resilience of airport infrastructure.”A third runway at Heathrow islikely to cost far more than the last estimate of £14bnand would cause more noise, pollution and disruption – as it involves demolishing hundreds of homes, lowering the M25 for the new runway to cross, rerouting rivers and building parking for nearly 50,000 cars.By comparison, the Gatwick expansion would be much simpler. The current relief runway would be shifted 12 metres to the north but the project would stay within the airport’s existing footprint. The cost is estimated at a more modest £2.2bn because it makes better use of existing infrastructure.The CAA’s comments came as part of its final proposals to accept new commitments from Gatwick for the four years from the start of the next financial year. This includes a price cap that limits how much the airport can charge airlines.Under the proposal, the maximum increase in the cap for the first two years would be the consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation minus 1%, and CPI for the final two years.Gatwick also plans to change service quality targets and rebates with a focus on areas of operation that “have been problematic in recent years”, the CAA said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We learned a great deal about the Trump ground game and will have ongoing discussions on other areas. We only have one more chance left to save the west and we can do great things together.”The flight, recorded on Farage’s register of interests, was the first time Cottrell has funded Reform since the election. His mother, Fiona Cottrell, gave the party £500,000 last year.Cottrell has no official role at Reform but has turned up at many of its press conferences and at its Mayfair fundraiser last month, as well as accompanying Farage during the election campaign.Known as “Posh George”, Cottrell was a volunteer for Farage in 2016 before his arrest in the US on money-laundering charges and ultimate guilty plea to one count of wire fraud in a case unrelated to his work at Ukip, Farage’s party at the time. The crime was committed in 2014, before Cottrell worked for either the anti-EU party or Farage.Cottrell served eight months after aplea agreement that reducedhis possible prison sentence from a maximum of 20 years, according to court documents at the time.The latest register of interests shows that Farage also benefited from a £27,600 trip to the US in January to mark the inauguration of Trump as US president, funded by crypto and aviation fuel investor Christopher Harborne.However, Farage has since admitted he did not “make the cut” for the inauguration ceremony itself, unlike Boris Johnson. The Reform leader has also since been criticised by Musk, who questioned whether he was the right person to lead the UK party, after a disagreement about Farage’s decision to distance Reform from the far-right activist Tommy Robinson.Farage has now made at least eight trips to the US since he was elected as MP for Clacton-on-Sea.

He also had fractured ribs and bruising.The trial at Leicester crown court heard the two defendants were part of a group of five teenagers who encountered Kohli in the park on 1 September.The girl standing trial had allegedly pointed out Kohli to the group and accused him of previously trying to hit one of the boy’s friends with a stick.It is alleged that three of the teenagers ran off, but the boy – wearing a balaclava – accosted Kohli, pushed him and then attacked him while he was kneeling on the ground. The teenage girl stayed and recorded parts of the attack on her phone, with the footage showing the boy using a black slider sandal he had removed from his foot to slap Kohli in the face while she laughed.Harpreet Sandhu KC, for the prosecution, said: “When [Kohli] was on his knees, he was not in a position to threaten anyone. There was nothing for [the boy] to fear from an 80-year-old man who was on his knees. It was just pure violence.“They used racist taunts towards Kohli. [The boy] did not just push Mr Kohli over, but he subjected him to an intense attack.”Shortly afterwards, Kohli tried to make a phone call to his grandson for help, but was unable to contact him. He was next filmed walking towards the exit of the park and shouting, and then filmed lying on the ground.The court heard that a CCTV camera recorded the boy saying that Kohli had “whacked his head off a log”, while the girl could be heard saying: “I know, I saw that. It goes doosh.”One witness, who saw the pair walking away from the park, said he heard the boy say they had “beaten up some guy” and there was “a dead guy on the floor”. Other witnesses in the park said they heard the pair “bragging”, including hearing the girl say she had slapped Kohli.The pair later alleged that Kohli had threatened the girl with a knife, and this had triggered the violence. Sandhu said: “It was not in Kohli’s habit to carry a knife. No knife was recovered from the clothing he was wearing, and no knife was recovered from the park.”Sandhu said the boy later told a friend “he could not stop kicking” Kohli, and told another: “I’ve killed an 80-year-old man or put him in intensive care.” He was arrested the following day from his home address where he was found hiding in a bush after telling his mother he was going on the run.The jury were shown copies of a letter the boy allegedly wrote while in custody in October, referring to the incident, in which he said his girlfriend had “broken up with me and I was struggling with that so I kinda just needed anger etc releasing”.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandLeicesternewsShareReuse this content"

The anaesthetists are in an awkward position of having to anaesthetise the patients before surgery with consultants under suspicion.”There have been calls tosuspend some surgeons while police investigate. The source added: “I think the reason they have been allowed to continue, is that the trust does not want to show they have made any mistakes.”Earlier this month, the Guardian revealed that Sussex police were examiningpossible corporate and individual manslaughter charges. The force is reviewing 90 deaths and more than 100 cases of serious harm with the help of a team of independent surgeons.One of the consultants who continues to operate at the trust is a neurosurgeon who last week had his practising privileges withdrawn at a local Nuffield private hospital. A spokesperson said this was “due to a failure to engage in medical assurance governance processes”.There is also internal concern in UHS at the inexperience of the current surgeons operating at the hospital. Only five of the 12 surgeons on the rota for emergency surgery are on theGeneral Medical Council’s specialist register, inclusion on which is requirement for a consultant’s post.The source said: “If you have one or two surgeons who are not on the register you can cope, but having a majority not on the register is unheard of because of the level of training and expertise required.”One of the emergency surgeons who is not on the register was responsible for a“never event” in 2016when a medical specimen bag and the removed part of a bowel was left inside a patient after hernia operation.UHS has been subject to a series ofdamning inspection reports, had the highest number of patients waiting a year and a half for carein England, and was last monthranked among the five worst trusts in England.A source close to the investigation said: “The number of deaths the police are looking at has increased to 90, which is why they are struggling to cope and have asked the Home Office for extra help.”A police email about the investigation seen by the Guardian said: “Sussex police are currently exploring funding avenues through the Home Office which would help to expand the investigative team.”Sussex police refused to comment on the figure, or reveal a breakdown of how the deaths were divided between alleged mistakes in the neurosurgery and general surgery departments. A spokesperson said: “This is an active and ongoing investigation and we will not be providing specific details around case numbers at this time.”They added: “The medical experts will report on their findings and their evaluation will be considered alongside information obtained from our police inquiries to determine whether cases will be taken forward in the investigation, and if so which ones. Those that do not currently meet a criminal threshold will be withdrawn, and this will be communicated to patients and families directly by the investigation team.”How to get in touchKatie Urch, UHS’s chief medical officer, said the trust’s surgeons were “highly skilled clinicians who are trained and qualified to perform complex, life-saving procedures every day”.She added: “Our teams are subject to rigorous scrutiny, and we actively encourage colleagues to speak up and take action if they believe we could ever do more to protect and care for our patients.“While every treatment and operation carries some level of risk, our teams are dedicated to delivering the safest and highest-quality care. We are committed to being open, listening and continually learning from every experience to keep improving the care we provide.”Explore more on these topicsHospitalsNHSBrightonHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Aslef blames MTR for the dispute.The operator, which will be succeeded by Tokyo Metro and Go-Ahead in May, had offered drivers a 4.5% pay increase, in line with other pay deals agreed by train drivers.The Elizabeth line is the cross-London mass transit line, whichopened in May 2022, and carries about 800,000 passengers a day.Industrial unrest has persisted in some places on the rail network despite theresolution last summerof the major nationwide disputes that had brought two years of disruption.Threatened strikeson the London Underground network in November were called off after a pay deal was reached.The RMT union has beenstaging regular strikesby train managers on Avanti West Coast intercity services on most Sundays, action that is scheduled to last until the end of May. The most recent three weeks of strikes , however,were called off earlier this monthto allow for “intensive negotiations” in a dispute over rest-day working.Explore more on these topicsRail transportLondonTransportRail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

He insisted he had been simply “parodying” online leftwingers.Krah’s resignation followed pressure by other far-right parties, including Marine Le Pen’s Rassemblement National, Italy’s Lega and the Danish People’s party.The controversy sparked by his remarks – as well as by the arrest of one of his adviserson suspicion of spyingfor China – led to him being suspended from the European election campaign by the AfD leadership.It also prompted the AfD’s expulsion from the now defunct Identity and Democracy group in the European parliament, with Le Pen saying it was necessary to create “acordon sanitaire” between the AfD and other parties.The AfD, working with far-right parties from seven other EU countries,founded a new parliamentary group, Europe of Sovereign Nations, in the European parliament.At the time Krah said on X: “I recognise that truthful and nuanced statements made by me are being misused as a pretext to damage our party.”View image in fullscreenMatthias Helferich at the 21st conference of the Alternative für Deutschland party, in Marl, Germany, on 24 February 2024.Photograph: Thomas Banneyer/Dpa Picture Alliance via AlamyKrah and Helferich are now part of the AfD’s newly elected parliamentary group after its inaugural meeting on Tuesday at which it was decided not to exclude the two MPs any longer.The decision was announced on the sidelines of the gathering in the Bundestag. The new group also includes allies of Björn Höcke, the figurehead of the party’s most extreme flank, known as Der Flügel. The former history teacher has beenconvicted of using the banned Nazi slogan “Alles für Deutschland”(Everything for Germany) in campaign speeches.After their admission, Krah and Helferich can only be removed from the group with a two-thirds majority.Krah, who is popular with young male voters and won the most votes in his constituency in Saxony, is now poised to sit in parliament alongside co-leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla.The two were jubilant after the anti-Islam, anti-immigration AfD more than doubled its voter support to more than 20% on Sunday, making it thesecond largest group in the German parliament,with 152 seats.The reinstatement of Krah and Helferich led to renewed calls for an attempt to ban the AfD, which was last debated in parliament at the end of January.Carmen Wegge, of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), said she would continue the cross-party campaign that has the support of more than 100 MPs, even though it is not thought to have much chance of succeeding.“The AfD poses the greatest danger to our democracy,” she told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung newspaper.“This is clearly shown by the fact that the AfD parliamentary group has now reinstated Mr Helferich (and admitted Krah), having considered him too far-right in their previous legislative state. They are consciously deciding to put their most openly rightwing extremist faces in the front row,” she added.Helferich said he welcomed his inclusion in the parliamentary group and would now do “patriotic-parliamentary work” for the AfD in the Bundestag. As a member of the parliamentary cultural committee, he said he hoped to be able to “answer the left-wing cultural struggle with right-wing cultural policy”.Explore more on these topicsGermanyAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)The far rightEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Official internationally mediated negotiations on how to implement the second stage – which would involve a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territory – were supposed to begin weeks ago, but have been repeatedly postponed as the fragile truce has lurched from crisis to crisis.An extension of stage one would involve further hostage releases in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees, but Israeli officials are sceptical of the idea’s workability.InGaza, Palestinian medics said that six infants had died from hypothermia in the last two weeks, amid plunging temperatures. Dr Ahmed al-Farah, head of the paediatric department at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, told the Associated Press that it received the body of a two-month-old girl on Tuesday.“I unbuttoned her clothes and patted her, but there was no breath or heartbeat,” said the girl’s father, Yusuf al-Shinbat. “Yesterday, I was playing with her, bathing her and scenting her. She was a (beautiful) child like the moon.”Farah said another two infants were treated for frostbite at the hospital. One was discharged later, while the other was in intensive care. The body of one “was completely blue and his temperature was very low”, the doctor said.Dr Saeed Salah, of the Patient’s Friends hospital in Gaza City, said five infants aged one month or younger had died from the cold over the last two weeks, including a one-month-old who died on Monday. He said another child had been placed on a ventilator. Salah said the infants all sheltered in camps and schools-turned-shelters in northern Gaza. “There is no fuel, no electricity, no gas, no means of heating, and they and the family were exposed to extreme cold,” he said.The ceasefire is at an impasse before the scheduled release of four Israeli bodies on Thursday, after Israel decided to postpone freeing 600 Palestinians last weekend. That decision appears to have been prompted by a film released byHamason Saturday in which two hostages were forced to watch the release of other captives. The video, together with handover ceremonies in which the hostages have been paraded around by the militant group, have infuriated public opinion in Israel.Hamas has said it will not engage with any negotiations until the 600 Palestinians whose release was delayed are freed, putting mediators under pressure to resolve the latest dispute before the next release of hostage bodies on Thursday and the expiration of stage one two days later. The group had previously said it was open to a short extension of phase one in order to keep aid flowing to the territory and talks on stage two alive.Egypt, a key mediator between the sides, has also refused to discuss an extension of the first phase unless phase two talks begin at the same time, AP reported on Tuesday, citing two officials.Steve Witkoff: from property developer to global spotlight as Trump’s tough-talking troubleshooterRead moreSteve Witkoff, the Trump administration’s Middle East envoy, is returning to the region on Wednesday. In an interview with CNN over the weekend, he said he was aiming for an extension of stage one to ensure there would be time to negotiate stage two.In stage two of the deal, of uncertain duration, Israel is supposed to completely withdraw its forces from Gaza, in effect ending the war, and talks on future governance of the strip should begin. Reconstruction is due to begin in stage three, but the sides remain far apart on Gaza’s future.Hamas has said it is willing to give up control of the Gaza Strip to other Palestinians, but its leadership refuses to go into exile. Israel maintains that it will not allow Hamas or the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority to administer the territory when the war ends.On Sunday, Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel was prepared to return to hostilities in Gaza “at any moment” and vowed to complete the war’s objectives “whether through negotiation or by other means”.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaHamasBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

He has no problem with it,” Trump added.But at a press conference on Tuesday, Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, referred to an earlier statement that such a move would be unacceptable to Moscow.“There is a position on this matter that was expressed by Russian foreign minister [Sergei] Lavrov. I have nothing to add to this and nothing to comment on,” Peskov said.Aftertalks with the US in Riyadh last week, Lavrov said the presence of European peacekeepers in Ukraine would be “unacceptable”.The latest divergence weakens Trump’s push for a swift peace deal, despite intensified diplomatic efforts, including last week’s talks and a noticeable thaw in rhetoric between Washington and Moscow.The Kremlin’s rejection of western forces in Ukraine could pose a major early test for Trump’s team in handling a public rebuke from Moscow, and also exposes Washington’s limited influence over Putin’s willingness to make concessions.It also raises questions about whether European leaders will move forward with solidifying their plans for a peacekeeping force, as Putin makes it clear that he will not accept the presence of European troops in Ukraine as part of any settlement.What might a European military force in Ukraine look like?Read moreWhile Ukraine has signalled openness to territorial compromises, potentially ceding some of its land lost since 2014, Volodymyr Zelenskyy is unlikely to sign any agreement without tangible security guarantees from the west, most notably the presence of European troops on the ground.Speaking in front of Russian officials on Monday, Putin tempered expectations about negotiations reaching a quick conclusion, saying he had only broadly discussed the issue of resolution of the conflict in Ukraine with Trump.“But it was not discussed in detail,” Putin said. “We only agreed that we would move toward this. And in this case, of course, we are not refusing the participation of European countries [in talks].”The Kremlin has dismissed the idea of a simple ceasefire, arguing that Ukraine could use the pause to rearm.Putin has instead insisted on addressing what he calls the “root causes” of the conflict, citing Ukraine’s Nato membership ambitions and what he describes as an anti-Russian government in Kyiv.The Russian leader remains committed to limiting the size and power of Kyiv’s military, prohibiting foreign weapons on Ukrainian soil, ensuring Ukraine’s permanent neutrality, and maintaining influence over its political future, according to two people familiar with Kremlin thinking.The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter freely, said Putin viewed the peace talks as an opportunity to reshape Europe’s security order, with one key condition for normalising relations with the US being the withdrawal of Nato forces from eastern Europe.Kremlin officials have also emphasised in public that they are unwilling to make territorial concessions, insisting on full control over the four Ukrainian regions Moscow claimed in 2022 – some of which it has yet to fully occupy.Thomas Graham, a former White House adviser on Russia who recently travelled to Moscow, where he met Russian officials, said: “It’s quite clear from the Russian standpoint that president Putin wants to control Ukraine and all of Ukraine. That he wants control over Ukraine’s geopolitical orientation, to a limited extent its domestic politics.”Graham added: “That his vision of a future Ukraine that’s beyond Russia’s physical control is along the lines of the relationship that Belarus has with Russia at this point … How you reconcile those two diverging visions, I think, is quite difficult. That will be the sticking point. And I think the Russians are in a position now where they realise that there will be a problem.”Factchecking Donald Trump’s claims about the war in UkraineRead moreFor now, Putin is likely to keep the dialogue going.Trump was accused of handing Putin a symbolic victory when the two had a telephone call earlier this month, breaking the western unity that had sought to isolate Moscow since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.The US administration has also echoed some Russian narratives, suggesting that Ukraine bears responsibility for a war that actually began with Russia’s invasion.“To address pressing issues, Russia and the US must trust each other,” Putin said on Monday, signalling his openness to future talks with Washington.Meanwhile, Moscow remains committed to its military campaign, believing that battlefield gains will only strengthen its position at the negotiating table.While earlier this year there were indications that Russia’s advance in eastern Ukraine was slowing, the past week has shown a renewed push by Moscow. According to Deep State, a Ukrainian open-source research group, Russian forces have captured nearly 90 sq km of territory – their largest weekly gain since December.Ukraine at the same time confronting the grim but realistic question of how long it can sustain the fight if Trump decides to cut off US military support.“With every town and city captured, Russia’s position will only harden,” said the source familiar with Moscow’s thinking. “Moscow has time on its side,” the source added.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaTrump administrationEmmanuel MacronDonald TrumpVladimir PutinUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The Bucharest court of appeal approved his extradition request on Sunday.An official at Romania’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the legal case was still ongoing, confirmed to The Associated Press that Amra was handed over to French authorities for extradition on Tuesday at an airport near Bucharest, where he arrived in handcuffs, flanked by armed police officers.Upon arrival inFrance, he was taken to the main Paris courthouse, the Paris prosecutor’s office said. He will be ordered to carry out the sentence he escaped last year, for burglary, and also face charges in other cases, including murder, attempted murder and escaping from custody.The high-profile search for Amra began last May when armed assailants ambushed a prison convoy in Normandy,killing two guards and seriously wounding three others in the process of aiding his escape.Amra fled after being sentenced for burglary in the Normandy town of Évreux. He was also under investigation for an attempted organised homicide and a kidnapping that resulted in death, French prosecutors said.The international police organisation Interpol issued a notice for his arrest, while French investigators alerted counterparts in other countries after they suspected Amra had left France.After Amra’s arrest on Saturday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, hailed his capture as a “formidable success” and praised European colleagues who had ended the long cross-border hunt.Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau has said that Amra had connections with Marseille’s organised crime syndicates and was suspected of heading a drug trafficking network.As of Monday night, 25 people had been detained in multiple countries suspected of some role in his escape or in the aftermath, the Paris prosecutor said.Explore more on these topicsFranceRomaniaEuropeOrganised crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities at Santiago international airport said terminals had switched to emergency power to keep flights operating as usual.Explore more on these topicsChileAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The photographer who showed Britain – and space – in colourFrom ghost trains to backstreet weddings, from demolition sites to ‘alien’s eye views’ of Leeds, groundbreaking photographer Peter Mitchell captures our changing world with his trusty ‘Blad’ – and once even tried to leave itDave SimpsonTue 25 Feb 2025 11.08 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 11.12 ESTShareThe Quarry Hill flats in Leeds were once the largest social housing complex in the UK. A utopian vision of homes for 3,000 people. Built in the 1930s, they were modelled on theKarl-Marx-Hofin Vienna and La Cité de la Muette in Paris. However, after just 40 years, the buildings were crumbling and largely deserted. Over the course of five years in the 1970s, Peter Mitchelldocumented their demolition, from smashed windows and wrecked apartments to abandoned wardrobes and solitary shoes. Finally, when all that was left standing was a lone arch, he tried to photograph the wrecking crew standing in front of it, but couldn’t get the arch in.“So,” Mitchell remembers, “the foreman said, ‘We do have a crane.’ I can’t stand heights but they lowered the crane down so I could stand on it, then lifted me up to quickly get the shot. I was swaying about a bit and all but one of them came out blurred – but I got the picture.”'These aren’t astronomy,' they said. 'They look like they were taken with a Kodak seaside camera'Mitchell laughs gently at the memory. Now 82, he is one of the 20th century’s most important early colour photographers and social historians. He has been called “a narrator of how we were, a chaser of a disappearing world”. Yet he insists he just photographs “things that take my eye. Sometimes, I’d see something and think, ‘I’ll come back when it’s not raining.’ Then I’d go back and it had been knocked down.”View image in fullscreen‘Chaser of a disappearing world’ … Quarry Hill Flats, 1978.Photograph: Peter MitchellWe’re talking ahead of his new London exhibition Nothing Lasts Forever, which he thinks will be his last, but we meet in the ornate tiled cafe ofLeedsArt Gallery, which hosted the exhibition last year and first showed his photos in 1975, when it was the City Art Gallery. He remembers that the new curator Sheila Ross wasn’t hugely impressed by his silkscreen prints. “But then she said, ‘I like your photos.’”Mitchell’s work exudes warmth and empathy. Although he’s known for shots of what he calls “dying buildings”, some of his most powerful images capture people in the workplace and the dignity of their labour. From the early 1970s to the 2010s, he photographed fairground showman Francis Gavan alongside his gradually more weatherbeaten ghost train ride, which thrilled/terrified generations of schoolchildren (including myself) on Woodhouse Moor, then Pottery Fields – before suddenly both were gone.“He built it himself and was proud of it,” Mitchell remembers. “I think eventually the authorities deemed it unsafe.” After Gavan died, his family came to see Mitchell’s photos, and the ghost train’s giant skull is now in his cellar. “Which would be quite a shock for anyone going down there.”Mitchell has always been fascinated by “the glory of the wreckage”. Born in Eccles, near Manchester, he was relocated to Catford in London during the second world war and fondly remembers playing in air-raid shelters and bombed-out buildings. In his teens he held on to childhood things most people leave behind – toys, Airfix model kits, diaries – and he still has them to this day.View image in fullscreen‘He was very proud of it’ … Francis Gavan, Ghost Train Ride, Woodhouse Moor, Leeds, Spring 1986.Photograph: Peter MitchellAfter leaving school at 16, he trained as a cartographic draughtsman for the civil service but felt unfulfilled, so eight years later enrolled to study typography and graphic design at Hornsey College of Art, where a visiting Italian photographer inspired him to pick up a camera. “But I had always believed,” he says, “a photograph could be as powerful as a painting.”Mitchell came to Leeds in 1972 to visit a friend, fell in love with the Victorian architecture and never left, renting a place in Chapeltown for £2.50 a week and working as a van driver while he became established. On his first day in the city he visited Beckett Street cemetery. “There were lots of gravestones for babies who’d died from cholera,” he says. “I did a lot of photography that first day.”He made a major impact with his groundbreaking 1979 exhibition A New Refutation of the Space Viking 4 Mission – the first colour exhibition by a British photographer in a British gallery, namely Impressions in York. It was inspired by the 1976 Viking probes to Mars, althoughMitchell gave it a twist, imagining that an alien craft had landed on Earth, in Leeds to be precise, and begun to take photos.View image in fullscreenAs if taken by an alien … Bullus Dye Works, Leeds, from A New Refutation of the Viking 4 Space Mission.Photograph: Peter Mitchell“I knew a student who’d written to Nasa asking what qualities you needed to become a spaceman and received a reply,” he explains. “So I wrote to Nasa myself and received a humorous letter. ‘Dear Mr Mitchell. We understand you want to go to Mars. If you give us a couple of million, we can get you up there. But if you just want a picture, we can send you one for nothing.’”They sent him more than one, in fact, and Mitchell enlarged these Martian landscapes and exhibited them alongside his own images of decaying Leeds, adorned with map coordinates as if from a space mission. “A public school in the countryside borrowed the collection for a project on the solar system,” he grins. “They said, ‘These aren’t astronomy at all. They look like they were taken with a Kodak seaside camera.’”In fact, they were taken with the same 1950s Hasselblad camera (“the Blad”) that Mitchell has carried with him for over half a century. Every photo taken by the Blad, it seems, has a story.Take his striking shot of a biker gang in front of a motorcycle mural that adorned the side of a Leeds house. “I just happened by,” he says. “Two girls were leaning against an old Porsche, a bit of a wreck really. One guy was sitting on his bike and another bloke behind him was threatening somebody. I didn’t want to interrupt, so I said, ‘I’ll just take a picture.’” Later, Porsche offered him £300 to publish the photo in their magazine. “I said they could have it for nothing as long as they sent me a copy. They did and alongside my picture was a bigger one of the very same car, roaring around the tracks – as it once had been.”From Leeds to London: portraits of English cities in the 1970s – in picturesRead moreThe Blad has also documented decades of social change, including the impact of multiculturalism on the city. A photograph of Caribbean sound system Sir Yank’s Heavy Disco was taken during the annual carnival, in the days when DJs would pile loudspeakers in front gardens and run power cables out of every window looking out. “The day before the carnival, we’d always get a letter,” grins Mitchell. “It said, ‘Do not give them any electricity – because it’s dangerous.’” Sir Yank (“the boss of Yorkshire sounds”) ran a nearby record shop selling Jamaican imports, so Mitchell photographed that as well.Another shot, called How Many Aunties?, captures the colourful chaos at an Asian wedding that took place in the backstreets near his house. “I went to put the rubbish out,” says Mitchell, “and saw cars draw up. A Sikh chap was trying to take a photo but couldn’t get everyone in and all the women were drifting back inside. I ran up my steps, grabbed the camera from the kitchen, and told them, ‘I’ll take it!’”View image in fullscreen‘I’ll take it!’ … How Many Aunties? Back Hares Mount, Leeds, 1978.Photograph: Peter MitchellOccasionally, he shot interiors, such as Concorde Wallpaper, snapped on a bedroom wall. He glimpsed it through a window and politely asked to photograph it. “It’s a bad shot really, a bit blurred,” he says. “But it became really popular. A few years ago, a nice illustrator gave me a big piece of that same wallpaper in exchange for a large copy of my photo. She’d seen it somewhere, gone inside and prised it off.”Throughout it all, he has remained in Chapeltown, in the same house. Last year it was burgled four times, but recently a silver Audi pulled up and a man got out and expressed an interest in buying the place. “Then he went, ‘Do you still live here? I used to jump off that wall when I was a kid.’ He couldn’t believe it had been the same person in the house all this time.”What if a Mars rover landed in Leeds? Peter Mitchell’s best photographRead moreMeanwhile the city changes around him. Mitchell is dismayed whenever Victoriana is replaced by some big bit of boring plastic, but he still gets a childlike thrill from discovering a hidden gem, such as the century-old butcher’s shop he came across recently with “beautiful green tiling”.Although he doesn’t walk the streets with the Blad as much as he used to, he still likes to get around and does “little bits of photography” when he can. “The Blad’s almost too heavy for me to use now,” he says. “But someone’s knitted me a woollen replica. When I go to the exhibition, I’m going to carry that.”Nothing Lasts Forever is atthe Photographers’ Gallery, London, 7 March to 15 June.

Development on Monolith’sWonder Womangame will also halt, following the shuttering. “Our hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities,” the spokesperson said.The decision to close the studios reflects wider challenges in the video game industry as gamers cut back on new purchases and instead opt for proven titles amid inflation squeezing discretionary spending budgets. Last month the company announced the departure of David Haddad, the former chief of the interactive entertainment unit, after a 12-year tenure.Warner Bros joins the ranks of other major players such as Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony that closed offices last year in a bid to reduce costs.The media giant will structure its development studios and investments to focus on core franchises such as Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC and Game of Thrones, mirroring CEO David Zaslav’s comments in November about focusing on four “really powerful” games.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was laterreferredto as “closer to The Hunger Games … than Coachella”.Its founder, Billy McFarland, described byVanity Fairas “the poster boy for millennial scamming”, was convicted of fraud and sentenced to six years in prison. He was later released after less than four years. A New York court also awarded $7,220 each to 277 attendees.“I’m sure many people think I’m crazy for doing this again,” McFarland said in a statement. “But I feel I’d be crazy not to do it again. After years of reflection and now thoughtful planning, the new team and I have amazing plans for Fyre 2. The adventure seekers who trust the vision and take the leap will help make history.”The sequel is set to take place on Isla Mujeres in Quintana Roo,Mexico, with tickets going for $1,400 and up to $1.1m. When speaking about the highest-priced package, McFarland has said: “You will be on a boat, have the luxury yachts that we partner with who will be docked and parked outside the island.”A minimum of $500,000 will go towards the money still owed by McFarland, estimated to be close to $26m.Theofficial sitepromises “an electrifying celebration of music, arts, cuisine, comedy, fashion, gaming, sports and treasure hunting” with “unforgettable performances, immersive experiences, and an atmosphere that redefines creativity and culture”.No lineup has yet been confirmed but McFarland has said it will include “artists across electronic, hip-hop, pop and rock” in aninterviewwith the Today show.He will not handle the details this time, with partners taking over the festival’s management. He said the festival “really isn’t about the past, and it’s not really about me. It’s about taking the vision, which is strong”.The first Fyre created a social media storm anda number of documentaries. “We were a little naive in thinking for the first time we could do this ourselves,” McFarland said toRolling Stoneat the time. He added: “We were overwhelmed and just didn’t have the foresight to solve all these problems.”This week, McFarland also said: “Since 2016 Fyre has been the most talked about music festival in the world. Obviously, a lot of that has been negative, but I think that most people, once they kind of get under the hood and study the plans and see the team behind Fyre 2, they see the upside … And if it’s done well, I think Fyre has a chance to be this annual festival that really takes over the festival industry.”Explore more on these topicsFestivalsMexiconewsShareReuse this content"

But it took a decade and a half for Baker to make a serious breakthrough;Tangerine, shot on iPhones, was the story of a trans sex worker (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez), and won Baker some high-profile awards. His follow-up,The Florida Project,another account of marginalised Americans became a fixture on the awards circuit, bagging co-star Willem Dafoe an Oscar nom for best supporting actor. His next film,Red Rocket, premiered in competition at Cannes.The state of the race:Anora was serious awards-bait straight out of the trap,winning the Palme d’Orat Cannes after its world premiere. It went on to be a major player on the awards circuit, with five Golden Globes noms (winning none) and six Oscar noms, as well as scads of critics society wins. For most of the last few months, it looked as if it might be squeezed by The Brutalist on the one side for highbrow artsiness, and Emilia Pérez on the other, which cornered progressive/marginalised sympathies. But with the latter’s implosion, Anora has surged on all fronts – including in Baker’s personal contest with Brady Corbet. Crucially, given the overlap with Oscar voters, Baker took the Directors Guild of America award for best feature; it’s not an absolute given, but the connection with the best director Oscar is well established. Baker can be quietly confident.What the Guardian said:“An amazing, full-throttle tragicomedy of romance, denial and betrayal.”Read the full review.Why he should win, and why he might not:Along with Corbet, Baker represents a new generation of American directors; last year, the only American on the directors list was Martin Scorsese, and he’s definitely old school. The Academy, you sense, is restless for change and Baker looks well qualified to provide it, with his contemporary stories that are issue-led and sexy/romantic at the same time. It also helps that he unearthed a stellar lead performer in Mikey Madison, who is putting a serious dent in Demi Moore’s chances of taking the best actress Oscar. Baker now seems the frontrunner, his cred from European festival juries working for him (instead of against, as it often has in the past). Are there any major obstacles? The only cloud on the horizon is questions over thedubious politics of some of its Russian cast, including best supporting actor nominee Yura Borisov; but it seems a remote possibility as to whether it will affect Baker’s chances.Further reading:‘I find myself getting in a little too deep’: Sean Baker on his Palme d’Or-winning lapdance filmHow to watch AnoraAus: in cinemas, buy/rent on digital platformsUK: in cinemas, buy/rent on digital platformsUS: in cinemas, buy/rent on digital platformsBrady Corbet for The BrutalistView image in fullscreenBrady Corbet has already won a best director award for The Brutalist at the Baftas.Photograph: Stuart Wilson/BAFTA/Getty Images for BAFTATrack record:Corbet had a decent career as an actor, starting out as an 11-year-old; he appeared in Mysterious Skin, 24, and Martha Marcy May Marlene. He launched himself as a director with the prescientChildhood of a Leader, which explored the roots of fascism, and followed it up with the chilling fableVox Lux, about a musician undergoing a breakdown (casting Natalie Portman in the lead role showed the industry Corbet was on his way). The Brutalist, Corbet’s third feature, is a step up again: massive in scope, an Oscar winner on board as the star, and the kind of high-minded themes only a few directors could approach with any hope of success.The state of the race:Like Anora, The Brutalist was awards catnip right from the start, winning the best director award at Venice, and as the US awards season got under way, it looked like it was in the driving seat. But as the race has gone on, it seems to have subtly lost ground – partly due to its punishing three-hour run time, and partly due to the sense that, in cutting corners withAI-assisted voices, it may not be able to claim the artistic integrity it was striving for. Having been beaten to the DGA award by Baker but adding the best director Bafta to the Golden Globe, Corbet’s chances feel in the balance. (It can’t have hurt his penniless-artist credibility by sayinghe’s earned “nothing” from the film.) It wouldn’t be a surprise if he won best director, but neither if he didn’t.What the Guardian said:“This is a film with thrilling directness and storytelling force, a movie that fills its widescreen and three-and-a-half-hour running time with absolute certainty and ease, as well as glorious amplitude, clarity and even simplicity.”Read the full review.Why he should win, and why he might not:Few mainstream directors are operating with the kind of thematic ambition that Corbet has shown, and the Academy ought to want to reward someone who, like it or not, has become one of the leaders of American cinema. Corbet’s transformation from interesting-but-fringe actor to major director has been a fascinating shift, and there’s no doubt that he’s using the opportunity to make films about things that really matter in America: two of them are about fascism and the other about the psychic trauma of gun violence. If his campaign can get enough voters to connect with this, then he should be home and dry. It comes down, perhaps, to whether the Oscar voters will opt for The Brutalist’s high drama or Anora’s exuberance as to which director will carry off the award.Further reading:The Brutalist director Brady Corbet: ‘If you’re not daring to suck, you’re not doing much’How to watch The BrutalistAus: in cinemasUK: in cinemasUS: in cinemasJames Mangold for A Complete UnknownView image in fullscreenJames Mangold at this year’s Baftas.Photograph: John Phillips/BAFTA/Getty Images for BAFTATrack record:Mangold has been on a longer journey than most: he emerged from the mid-90s indie subworld with a couple of fashionable films, the second of which, Cop Land, boasted an improbably heavyweight cast including Sylvester Stallone, Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro. His next film,Girl, Interrupted, was the one that put Angelina Jolie on the map. In the 00s, though, he seemed to stall somehow; the films he made –Walk the Line,3.10 to Yuma,Knight and Day,The Wolverine– were still high profile and mostly successful, but somehow missing a directorial personality. That changed when he got aboard the grittyLogan, a follow-up to The Wolverine. Mangold, oddly, was hot again, and moved on toFord v FerrariandIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny– neither film though exactly screaming auteurism. But he found his mojo with the Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown which, coupled with the hottest young actor of the moment, Timothée Chalamet, has given Mangold his first best director Oscar nom.The state of the race:Nobody was really talking about A Complete Unknown as the campaign got under way, partly because it skipped the autumn festivals and instead went straight to a theatrical release very late in the window, just before Christmas. But glowing reviews have helped it, as well asChalamet’s perky media profile, meaning that Mangold could well be in the mix. The lion’s share of the awards attention, though, has been going to the actors; Mangold is really only an outside bet.What the Guardian said:“Interestingly the story, despite the classic music-biopic tropes that Mangold did so much to popularise, does not conform to the classic rise-fall-learning-experience-comeback format. It’s all rise, but troubled and unclear.”Read the full review.Why he should win, and why he might not:A director with as many top-notch credits as Mangold has certainly earned his corn, and at some point the Academy will want to reward that. (Though, as history records, it took the likes of Martin Scorsese six goes before getting his directing Oscar, so maybe Mangold hasn’t yet been through the mill enough.) Nevertheless, there’san air of zeitgeist-catching around the film, refocusing attention on Dylan and satisfactorily conjuring up his rebel spirit – and Mangold is benefiting from that. Perhaps not working so much in his favour is a certain absence of authorial presence in his work; pretty much everything he’s done from the 00s onwards has been putatively commercial in intent; it’s hard to inject much personality into an Indiana Jones or Marvel movie. Mangold’s much admired versatility might actually work against his awards chances.Further reading:‘It’s full of things that didn’t happen – but it feels right!’ Inside the making of Bob Dylan film A Complete Unknown‘The hair, the voice, the casual cruelty – they nailed it!’ Bob Dylan experts rate A Complete UnknownHow to watch A Complete UnknownAus: in cinemasUK: in cinemasUS: in cinemasJacques Audiard for Emilia PérezView image in fullscreenAudiard with his Bafta for best film not in the English language.Photograph: Kate Green/Getty ImagesTrack record:With a porkpie hat permanently perched atop his head, Audiard is one of France’s most recognisable film directors, as well as one of its most renowned. The son of a film director himself, he exploded into international consciousness with his second feature, A Self-Made Hero, in 1996; starring Mathieu Kassovitz as a fake wartime resistance fighter, it won best screenplay at Cannes. Subsequent films –Read My Lips,The Beat That My Heart Skipped,A Prophet– solidified his reputation as a film-maker of intense, brilliantly modulated crime dramas; he subsequently applied similar levels of emotional and storytelling force to an odd-couple love story (Rust and Bone) and the immigrant experience (Dheepan), winning a long overdue Palme d’Or at Cannes in 2015 for the latter. He crossed over to English-language film-making withThe Sisters Brothers, a western starring John C Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix but Audiard, with only a limited command of English, soon headed back to France. Emilia Pérez, a trans gangster musical, is something else again: a typically bold reconfiguration of his style around a film it’s simply impossible to imagine an Anglo-American director of similar stature taking on.Oscars nominations 2025: the full listRead moreThe state of the race:With Netflix behind it, and the progressive vote apparently cornered, Emilia Pérez roared into awards season after the leading cast collectively picked up the best actress prize at Cannes (as well as the third place jury prize for the film itself). Its confrontational confidence appeared well placed as it picked up four Golden Globes (including best picture – musical or comedy) andemerged, even more impressively, with 13 Oscar nominations. But a few days later it all fell apart when the contents of star Karla Sofía Gascón’s social-media feed became apparent. Audiard, despite his heavyweight back catalogue, was perhaps not a favourite for best director, as he’s hitherto not managed to make huge inroads into the Anglo-American film audience, but had the film’s momentum continued, he might have been pulled along with it. But now it looks very unlikely.What the Guardian said:“Anglo-progressives and US liberals might worry about whether or not certain stories are ‘theirs to tell’. But that’s not a scruple that worries French auteur Jacques Audiard who, with amazing boldness and sweep, launches into this slightly bizarre yet watchable musical melodrama of crime and gender, set in Mexico. It plays like a thriller by Amat Escalante with music and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda, and a touch of Almodóvar.”Read the full review.Why he should win, and why he might not:Non-British European directors don’t really flourish at the Oscars; only two – Roman Polanski and Michel Hazanavicius – have won the best director Oscar this century. Audiard’s appearance in the Oscars race at all would have seemed improbable six months ago, but it shouldn’t be an issue for such an exceptional film-maker. (His only previous appearance was for a best foreign language film nomination in 2010, for A Prophet.) Moreover, Audiard isn’t some kind of heritage-oriented conservative – his blazingly unusual films are thoroughly contemporary and, while an outlier in his oeuvre, Emilia Pérez is not massively out of character. What may go against him is his seeming bafflement in the face of protest and disquiet; apologies and hurt feelings are just not part of the lexicon of auteurs of his status, andhis attempt to patch up relationswith annoyed Mexicans,as well as Gascón, have the feel of someone doing it at gunpoint. Oscar voters, you suspect, don’t take to someone who, deep down, doesn’t appear to care if they are upset.Further reading:The rise and fall of Emilia Pérez: how did it all go so wrong for the Oscar-nominated film and its star?How to watch Emilia PérezAus: in cinemasUK: streaming on NetflixUS: in cinemas, streaming on NetflixCoralie Fargeat for The SubstanceView image in fullscreenCoralie Fargeat is the only woman nominated for best director at the Oscars.Photograph: Ian West/PATrack record:The Substance is Fargeat’s second feature, and like several of the above, won a significant award on its first appearance: best screenplay at Cannes. Flying the flag for horror – and specifically body horror – she created what in retrospect looks like a rehearsal for the film in her 2014 short,Reality+, about a brain implant that allows users to see themselves with their dream bodies. She made her feature debut in 2017 withRevenge, part of a newly radical strand of French genre film-making along with Julia Ducournau (whose body horror Titane won the Palme d’Or in 2021). Revenge, a rape-revenge thriller, did well on the cult circuit, but The Substance took things up more than a notch, with its super-contemporary themes of body anxiety and astute deployment of Demi Moore in the lead role.The state of the race:The second French director in the best director list is also the only female; as such, she stands out from the crowd. But given this award, probably more than any of the otherOscars, is a kind of career reward, Fargeat’s slim back catalogue means she’s right at the back of the betting. Moore is pulling most of what awards action there is her way; it’s hard to see Fargeat making much of a dent here.What the Guardian said:“This is a cheerfully silly and outrageously indulgent piece of gonzo body-horror comedy, lacking in subtlety, body-positivity or positivity of any sort. Roger Corman would have loved it. It’s flawed and overlong but there’s a genius bit of casting in Demi Moore who is a very good sport about the whole thing.”Read the full review.Why she should win, and why she might not:Fargeat may be the outlier, but she represents the cutting edge: female-driven body horror that has a lot to say about the modern world. Whether this will round up enough votes to give her the Oscar is another question; there are plenty of people rooting for what would be only thefourth womanto win the award in its entire history. Fargeat may also benefit from the perception of a casting masterstroke, up there with Quentin Tarantino and John Travolta; industry voters will know what it took to get Moore into her film. That said, genre films, and particularly horror, tend to struggle in the final awards straight. For Fargeat to win would be a major shock.Further reading:‘Before Ozempic we had amphetamines.

It was not my intention to watch a play. They were doing One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. I saw my brother Dino who was playing Big Chief, the Native American guy. I knew Dino from elsewhere in the jail, but not for this.I got involved. I found a fascination for Shakespeare that I really didn’t expect. I didn’t think I’d understand the language. And I didn’t at first. But it fascinated me enough to research and study it: I loved becoming able to translate that so that others could feel the intensity of it.After being restricted to just watching for a year, I went on to play so many roles. I played a nobleman’s ghost who comes back to hauntRichard III. That was a fun role; minimal lines, but a ton of expression. Twelve Angry Men was another good one.The most poignant role in my life, though, would be Oedipus Rex. Because Oedipus ran from a prediction and then right into the consequences of that prediction. That was kind of parallel to my life, because I realised that I had been running away from and straight back into the same issues. I learned that about myself while doingSophocles.There’s a freedom that comes with being on stage. As a prisoner locked in a six-by-nine, or a Black man in society, your liberty is limited to certain things.View image in fullscreen‘I went to Greece in my imagination’ … Clarence Maclin in Sing Sing.Photograph: Phyllis Kwedar/Courtesy of BlackBear FilmsThe connection that I got from the stage came from not only playing those characters but also researching how they lived. Those were the times that I realised that I wasn’t even in prison any more. I was freer than the guards. I went to Greece in my imagination. I went everywhere. I was freer than most men on the planet because I was able to go anywhere I wanted to, become anyone I wanted. All of these lives that might parallel some things in my own life – or might not. Maybe something completely different, you know?Most nights, it was my peers, my brothers, coming to see me. But on the last night of every production, we invited playwrights, directors, producers from Broadway. Politicians would come, and Harry Belafonte came, which thrilled my mother.Something that related to a current event or issue was always laid down somewhere in the play. So we began working on the messages that we wanted to send to the other side of the wall through art – including our own playBreakin’ the Mummy’s Code, which provides the structure for the movie Sing Sing and in which I play a version of myself.The RTA company changed as new people came and others went home or got transferred to other prisons. But the core stayed the same and we created a steering committee who were elected by the group and were charged with the day-to-day functions and keeping the integrity of the programme up to standard. Fortunately, I never got transferred.When I came home in 2012, I had six more classes to get my bachelor’s. I was working and I was going to school at night to complete my degree in behavioural science. All while I was still on parole.Sing Sing on stage: the Oscar-nominated drama hits New YorkRead moreThen I had to either graduate with the guys that I was going to college with on the outside or return to Sing Sing and walk the stage with RTA. I chose to go back. The six classes weren’t really the struggle. That’s the moral root – we want to keep brothers hopeful on the inside that change is possible. The Oscar stuff [Sing Sing is nominated for three Academy Awards) is hopeful on a personal level, of course, and people inside get to see that we can reach the highest echelons if we so choose. But it’s easy to just treat it as this trendy thing, to be the “ex-offender turned good”. It’s not as easy as that.Now after theOscarsI’ve got another movie I’m going to start shooting in April. But the stage is where you go to get replenished. This is where you go to sharpen your sword as an actor and get the tool right. And get that feeling of an ensemble sharing the pressure of the next scene. You don’t get that with the screen, you can’t get it. That little camera lens is really not big enough.As told to Lindesay IrvineSing Sing is in cinemas worldwide and Clarence Maclin is nominated for best adapted screenplay at the 2025 Academy Awards on 3 March.Explore more on these topicsTheatreThe play that changed my lifeSophoclesRichard IIIUS prisonsOscarsAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The masked musician, Diplodocus, has transformed this crowded pub in soggy south London into a mystical underworld, one entrancing chord at a time.This is Albion Dungeon fest, a sellout, weekend-long event, and the first of its kind in the UK. Emerging in the 90s as an offshoot of black metal,dungeon synthreplaced guitars with keyboards to make it less moshing, more magic. Its mystical sound has aesthetics to match, channelling the atmosphere of JRR Tolkien books, the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons and a darkly quaint reimagining of the medieval era.Much like a wizard’s beard, the story of dungeon synth is long and tangled, and in a bid to unravel it, author Jordan Whiteman painstakingly investigated the genre. It resulted inDark Dungeon Music: The Unlikely Story of Dungeon Synth, published earlier this year, which Whiteman is promoting at the festival. “This genre began in people’s bedrooms with a keyboard and a tape deck,” he says, “and that, for the first 10, 20 years, was what it was – it was never intended to become anything more”.This fringe genre has fascinating origins, rooted in Norway’s black metal scene. Mortiis, real nameHåvard Ellefsen, who gave a Q&A on his biography at the festival, is generally considered a pioneer. After leaving his band Emperor in the early 90s, he wove together black metal’s morbid sentiments, the facial prosthetics inspired by heavy metal rockers and imagery from fantasy novels to construct his own solo project, describing it as “dark dungeon music”.View image in fullscreenDepressive Silence performing at Albion Dungeon fest.Photograph: Duncan McCallThe second figure credited with dungeon synth’s conception is the highly controversial musician Varg Vikernes. Vikernes, a neo-Nazi who was convicted in 1994 for the murder of a former bandmate among other crimes, created two ambient albums while behind bars under the moniker Burzum (meaning darkness in The Lord of the Rings’ evil Black Speech language). He was released in 2009 and has since beensentenced for inciting racial hatred.Whiteman says nazism “and abhorrent ideologies” are unfortunately still a notable part of black metal’s legacy. “I’m grateful that the dungeon synth fans are largely hostile to ideology creeping into the music,” he says, noting that such views reject one of dungeon synth’s “primary tenets”, as it “breaks the whole escapist function of the music”.Though its popularity hasn’t exactly exploded, Whiteman says he’s noticed dungeon synth events cropping up more frequently in his native US, with fans evidently drawn to its fantastical theatrics. At the festival, held at the New Cross Inn in south London, the German duoDepressive Silence– stalwarts of the 90s dungeon synth scene – wear dark cloaks while dramatically swinging metal incense burners to the imposing thump of drums. Others don chains or spiky leather armour, and you’re already familiar with the dinosaur.View image in fullscreenAtlantean Sword at Albion Dungeon fest.Photograph: Duncan McCallUK-based actAtlantean Sword– who doesn’t give his real name – performs at the festival in his usual garb: a menacing skull helmet plus a huge sword. “Dungeon synth is still, at its core, ambient music, so the theatrics make it more engaging for the audience,” he says, adding that the music is intended to put the listener on a “hero’s journey”, providing them with a fantasy escape. “I’m trying to capture nostalgic feelings related to high fantasy films, books, video games and fantasy art, and incorporate those feelings into the music,” he says, naming Conan the Barbarian, Frank Frazetta paintings, Warhammer and the 1989 arcade game Golden Axe as sources of inspiration.Atlantean Sword is relatively new on the scene – he released his debut album in late 2023 – but even he has seen the genre’s popularity “increase exponentially”, describing the festival’s sellout status as “mind-blowing” and a mention of the festival on Radio 1 as “wild”. But he maintains that a key element is “mystery and obscurity. Dungeon synth is, in its truest form, underground music. I’m not sure what will happen if the music is pulled too far out of the dungeon and into the harsh light of day.”From my position in the crowd, the atmosphere feels too unique to become mainstream. I might be flanked by scary-looking metallers, but they’re disarmingly well-behaved; listening intently, reacting courteously. One man, so moved by the swelling synths, passionately reaches up, stretches his fingers skyward and tightly curls his hand into a fist, as if to clutch the sound waves tightly.View image in fullscreenAnother festival performer, Putrid Marsh.Photograph: Duncan McCallI catch up with one superfan, Cecil, who beams as he speaks. “Even though the community is very male-dominated and can look pretty intimidating, it is, by and large, really sweet,” he says. “If anything, you’ll find a dungeon synth crowd to be a little shy. We’re people who nerd out over alternative music and don’t always feel comfortable in mainstream culture.”Meanwhile, for Cecil, the genre’s association with Vikernes is something to remain aware of. “I’ve not had any bad interactions personally. The people I’ve met are always welcoming, excited to share their music and their knowledge. But if you pay attention to what tattoos and patches some people have, it’s obvious those interactions are possible – especially if, like me, you’re a visibly queer person.”For the vast majority, however, dungeon synth is a form of liberation – acting as, in Cecil’s words, “a shared fantasy space” where oddballs and misfits can find solace from the not-so-magical mainstream. “It might be a little cringe, but we’re all embracing that atmosphere of mysticism, possibility and nostalgia together,” he says. “It’s music that can take you to the depths of a cursed forest or make you feel like the hero of your own quest.” Putting forward something of a dungeon dweller’s manifesto, Cecil emphasises what lies at the genre’s core. That, in the face of an alienating modern world, all that’s left, he says, is to “reject society, escape to the dungeons!”Explore more on these topicsExperimental musicElectronic musicMetalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In a similar riffable vein, Eleanor Maidment, author ofPulse, makes a base of chorizo and red peppers, then adds beans and poaches some eggs in them. Cured meat is, of course, always a good idea, too: “Baked beans are quite sweet, so savoury things work really well with them,” Maidment says. “Fry onions and bacon, then add the beans and a splash of Worcestershire sauce, say.”It’s also helpful to think of your tin as beans in tomato sauce, rather than as a standalone dish, advises the Guardian’s ownFelicity Cloake. “Each tin is the start of any number of quick, tomato-based bean dishes,” she says, although a good start would be frying chopped onion, perhaps some ginger or diced carrot and celery, then stirring in spices or dried herbs: “Curry powder or an Indian spice blend of your choice, oregano and garlic for an Italian vibe [and especially good with mozzarella], or smoked paprika and crumbled chorizo for a Spanish feel … You get the idea.” Add the beans, bring to a simmer, stir in some frozen spinach and top with an egg, thick yoghurt and/or crumbled cheese: “Once you start seeing them as a stew, rather than a topping, a world of beany possibilities will open up.”You could expand your horizons further still with Ed Grace’s Tuscan twist. “Everyone knows how good baked beans and sausages are together,” says the chef atTrulloin London, “and when they’re cooked with wine and sage, too, they turn into a simple yet delicious dinner.” For two, he browns six good-quality sausages until golden. “Turn down the heat, add two finely sliced garlic cloves, three sage leaves and half a tablespoon of fennel seeds, and cook for three minutes more.” Pour in 75ml white wine and, once that’s evaporated, add a tin of baked beans, 500g spinach and a ladleful of chicken stock (or water). “Cook for about five minutes, until the spinach has wilted and the sauce has thickened, then finish with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.” Also looking to sunnier climes, Maidment might bolster baked beans with tomato puree, olive oil, garlic and fresh herbs, or she’d go in with some chipotle paste: “Stuff those into tacos with avocado and grated cheese”.If it’s baked beans you’re after, download the new Feast app: lots of bean recipes there. Scan or clickherefor your free trial.And if time is of the essence, other easy updates Erdal has in her arsenal include simply adding a knob of butter (“Thatalwaysworks”), mixing up the beans (“Bung in half a tin of drained butter beans, too”), or accessorising beans on toast with crumbled feta, chopped spring onion and parsley: “That’s how I make them a justifiable meal, anyway.”Got a culinary dilemma?

As he swerved, his truck barrel-rolled down a ravine,into the creek beneath Interstate 94.It was 20 December 2023, and Reum, a boiler-man, was 27. He was flung between his seat and the ceiling, losing consciousness as the airbags activated and the windows shattered around him. He remembers coming to and finding he was wet, it was dark and “not miserably cold, but it’s winter,” he says, “so it’s probably 30F [-1C]”. He knew he didn’t have any food or water in the car, but wasn’t too concerned. Someone must have seen him swerve, he thought.Unable to free himself from the truck, he sounded the horn, but it was silent, as was the vehicle’s onboard emergency call system. He searched for his phone and called out to Siri, both to no avail. He then began yelling for help. “In my mind, I’m doing everything I’m supposed to do in a situation like that,” says Reum, a fan of TV survival shows such asMan Vs WildandNaked and Afraid. “There’s a lot of small things I’ve picked up and my mind’s just scrolling through them, trying to find what I need to do to survive. I probably do that for the better part of an hour.”No one came that night.View image in fullscreenMatthew Reum on his first visit to the site since his accident.Photograph: Jamie Kelter Davis/The GuardianAt first, no one even knew Reum was missing. Since graduating from high school in 2014, he had worked at power plants, refineries and steel mills, often taking jobs out of state and staying away for months at a time. “Most holidays, I would either spend working, because you get great money, or I would be out travelling and enjoying life,” he says. The year before, he had gone camping by himself for Christmas. “I’ve always liked being outdoors, just that sense of peace and calm.”He was off work for the holidays when he crashed, so colleagues didn’t notice his absence, and friends and family knew he had planned to attend a funeral in Missouri before heading to Colorado for a ski trip.“No one knew where I was,” he says in his book about the ordeal,Still Standing. “No one would think to come looking.”I notice I’m not really able to feel part of my left leg any more. I’m thinking, this is just a horrible dreamAs it dawned on him that help might not arrive imminently, or at all, he also became more aware of his injuries. “My face is cut up, and I’ve got window glass all over me,” he says. “My right hand is already starting to swell – I don’t know if that’s sprained or broken, I just know that it’s hurting, but I’m also trying not to let it get the best of me.”The truck had landed engine first, the engine hood crumpling inwards, obstructing his view out of the windscreen. His legs were trapped, with the steering column and dashboard pushed towards his lap. “There is stuff digging into my shin – I can’t tell what, but I can wiggle my toes on my right foot,” he says. “I notice I’m not really able to feel part of my left leg any more. I’m thinking, this is just a horrible dream. My brain is still in disbelief.”Despite his predicament, Reum focused on keeping clean and hydrated. “I figured if I stayed on top of those, I’d be able to survive until someone found me.” On the second day, it rained. “My truck had a sunroof, which had shattered during the wreck, but there was a sunscreen that I realised I could fold to direct the rain.” At first, he drank the rainwater by cupping it in his hands, “and that is the worst water I have ever tasted. It’s everything that’s been washed off the highway: diesel and rubber from car tires, and dirt and mud and animal matter. It tasted like death.” He changed tack, using a spare pair of sweatpants as an improvised filter, then giving himself a sponge bath.View image in fullscreenA drainpipe positioned directly above Reum’s truck was his only source of water.Photograph: Jamie Kelter Davis/The GuardianOn the back seat, there was a toolkit. “I start pulling and yanking at all the bits of the dash that have broken off, tearing it off and throwing it outside my truck. If it had a nut or bolt on it, I was trying to take it apart – not just to get out of there but to give myself a little bit more room. It was also giving me a sense of accomplishment, helping my mental and emotional state just to have these little victories.”But for every triumph, there were failures that left him feeling defeated. He could hear hundreds of cars driving across the bridge above him, but wasn’t able to alert them. He considered amputating his own legs, to escape the truck. “A lot of my lowest points coincided with when I didn’t have any water, which can wreak havoc on your brain. It felt like I made more progress and was more hopeful when it rained.”As the days passed, “there was definitely a sense of panic”, he says, “but I’ve not had the best circumstances growing up – a lot of the time, that panic and emotion have to be put on the backburner while I figure out what to do”. In his book, he writes about how he was diagnosed with Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) as a teenager, a condition common among those who spent their childhoods in eastern bloc orphanages, as Reum did before he was adopted from Kaliningrad, Russia, when he was three.View image in fullscreenReum’s destroyed truck is recovered from the ravine.Reum was also diagnosed with ADHD as a child and seemed to be “perpetually grounded”. When he was 13, he was sent to a strict Christian boarding school in Missouri, a place he describes as “both a prison and a sanctuary … It was there I discovered my resilience, capacity for growth, and underlying spirit of survival”. While most of his peers only stayed at the school for a year, Reum remained for four, and had little contact with his parents. So, he says, being trapped in the wreckage of the truck “isn’t the first hard thing I’ve been through”.On Christmas Day, five days into his ordeal, Reum began to hallucinate. He thought the truck was surrounded by small critters he might catch and eat for sustenance. “I decided to do something really different for the holidays,” he wrote in his journal, “I’m camping in my truck … indefinitely.” Initially, he says, he used the journal as a way to keep track of his mental health, and as time went on, he wrote goodbyes to friends and family, along with his own obituary. By the time he was discovered, he thought, he might not be identifiable. “I wanted people to know how hard I’d fought to get out of this horrible situation and how I’d hung on until the last possible moment,” he says in his memoir.Two local fishermen, Mario Garcia and his son-in-law Nivardo De La Torre, were out scouting for fishing holes when they happened upon the truck. This was six days after Reum swerved, and he was asleep.View image in fullscreen‘I’m hard-headed, stubborn’ … Reum in February 2025.Photograph: Jamie Kelter Davis/The GuardianA makeshift curtain was pulled over the truck window, and Reum woke to see a head sticking through. “I don’t know if I’m still hallucinating or if it’s real, and neither one of us can really believe what’s going on or what we’re seeing,” he says. De La Torre called 911 and flagged down emergency responders, who cut Reum out of the wreckage and airlifted him to Memorial hospital in South Bend. “Some of the firefighters didn’t see me making it; they thought I might die on the flight there,” says Reum, “so I’m glad I showed them wrong.”He remained at the hospital for about three weeks. “They ran every test on me – I had about 18 X-rays – and they were pumping me full of medication and nutrients trying to get me in a stable state.” He had shattered the bones in his right hand and torn tendons, which needed surgery. His right leg was bruised and, “in my own efforts to get out, I had worn through the skin to the bone, and two bones were actually fractured”. Gangrene had set in in his left leg, and doctors were worried about the spread of infection. The decision was made to amputate the leg, below the knee at first. But, after it became clear the remaining tissue was not responding to treatment, a second amputation was made above the knee. Reum says he told the doctors to do what they needed to do. “It didn’t bother me because I thought I was going to have to do it myself!”During his six days in the wreck, Reum had lost 23lb (10kg), so a big part of his hospital rehab involved eating as much as he could. He had physical therapy and occupational therapy three times a day, using a walker or a wheelchair. “I didn’t have a prosthetic at that point, so it was teaching me to do life on one leg.”View image in fullscreenReum taking part in a 5km charity fundraiser marathon walk at Thanksgiving 2024.A prosthetic was fitted in April last year,but it’s not perfect – he can’t climb a ladder, and snow is challenging. He has more surgeries scheduled for this year – another revision on his hand, as well as spinal cord surgery, because something in his spine is pushing against his sciatic nerve, causing it to swell. His amputated leg will also be shortened, to better align his knees, and a titanium rod put through his femur so a new prosthetic can be connected more comfortably.There is anincreased mortality rate among amputeesso Reum is determined to stay as active as possible. He rarely uses a wheelchair, goes to the gym five or six times a week and has invested in a running prosthetic – he says that sunrise runs always lifted his spirits prior to the accident. He’s been slower to address the impact on his mental health. “Everybody said: ‘You need to talk to a therapist, you probably have PTSD.’ But I’m hard-headed, stubborn; I don’t like doing things unless I want to do them.” At the start of this year though, he began therapy.Reum stayed in touch with Garcia and De La Torre, whom he credits with saving his life, and is keen to share his story as he continues his recovery. “We go through these horrific tragedies and our brains adapt to overcome and become stronger,” he says. His book is dedicated to his grandfather, and to an uncle who lost a leg to cancer, who “taught me we are not defined by our limbs”. He has been unable to return to work since the accident, but he graduated in May with an associate of applied science (two-year) degree at Ivy Tech Community College.His experience, he says, often resonates with others who have been through significant trauma. “That feeling of being given a new lease on life is highly prevalent for a lot of people who have been through life or death situations. I’m not immune to depression or anxiety or any of that now, but it’s definitely easier for me to handle – just knowing what I’ve gone through, and the fact that I’ve made it.”Still Standing: The Seven Miracles of Matthew Reumby Erika Celeste and Matthew Reum is available now.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Apple has long maintained it will never create a means to bypass its cryptographic protections, arguing that privacy is a fundamental right and that no government would be able to preserve a monopoly on an encryption backdoor. Malicious actors will, inevitably, gain access.Apple hit a strong backhand return last week by entirely eliminating the encryption feature the government had taken issue with, Advanced Data Protection, from the UK market. My colleague Rachel Hallreports: “UK users will no longer have access to the advanced data protection (ADP) tool, which uses end-to-end encryption to allow only account holders to view items such as photos or documents they have stored online in the iCloud storage service.”Security has long been a major selling point for Apple, an image carefully crafted with billboards across the world reading: “Privacy. That’s iPhone.” The company took the US government to court in 2016 when asked to break its own encryption on an iPhone owned by an American mass shooter. (It won.)Apple said last week it was disappointed it had been “forced” to rescind advanced data protection. UK users will now be more vulnerable to data breaches from bad actors, and other threats to customer privacy, the company argued in a press release.Annulling advanced data protection does not represent a reputational loss for Apple, however. The security downgrade volleys the debate into Starmer’s court. The change will also mean that all data is accessible by Apple, which can share it with law enforcement if they have a warrant. The government’s request for a workaround is rendered moot. Starmer’s government got what it claimed to want: access to iCloud data by law enforcement, albeit encumbered by the requirement of a warrant. It did not obtain its own encryption bypass point, though.Apple seems to be betting that, faced with weakened security for any iPhone owner in the UK, Starmer’s forehand will not be strong enough to maintain his demand for a backdoor.Musk, nearly normalized, faces a modicum of Republican pushbackView image in fullscreenElon Musk speaks in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington DC, on 11 February.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersOver the weekend,Elon Muskemailed every single employee of the US federal government: “Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.” If they didn’t answer by midnight last night, he said he would fire them. The email reads like a phishing attempt. He pulled the same stunt during his takeover of X, née Twitter.Musk’s clear-cutting of US bureaucracy has hit few roadblocks. He seemed to act and tweet unfettered. Even before last week’s order, about 20,000 federal workers have been fired, and the White House claims 75,000 more have accepted buyouts. Looking at our phones and learning about new, dire results of his vendetta against government services has become anticipated in the way that once astonishing mass shootings, lies by Trump, or Covid deaths had. Slate’s tech podcast asked the question on many Americans’ minds a few weeks ago: “Is Elon Musk Unstoppable?” The implied answer was yes.In a surprising response to his email, however, some Republican agency leaders told their employees to ignore it.My colleague Ed Pilkingtonreports: “Kash Patel, a devout Trump loyalist fresh off confirmation as director of the FBI, advised his employees not to heed the warning: ‘FBI personnel may have received an email from OPM requesting information. The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures. When and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses.’”The US state department, headed by the Trump appointee Marco Rubio, directed its staff not to respond to Musk’s message, as did the Departments of Energy and Homeland Security. Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s director of the office of national intelligence who was likewise only recently confirmed, told her staff to let it lie, perthe New York Times. The US attorney John Durham, a top federal prosecutor in New York, also told his staff not to touch the email. Durham was once tasked by Trump with reviewing the origins of the FBI’s inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. He is no liberal crusader.The Department of Defense similarly instructed its employees mildly but forcefully to disregard the ultimatum: “The Department of Defense is responsible for reviewing the performance of its personnel and will conduct any review in accordance with its own procedures.”Musk responded with frustration on X, writing that any Pentagon worker who did not share his view of things should find a job somewhere else.Democrats appear to have erected few substantive roadblocks to Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”. It may beRepublicanswithin government who rein him. Don’t hold your breath, though; the wait for the emergence of a powerful contingent of anti-Trump Republicans has been ongoing since 2015. Case in point, lest you fantasize that the deep state is going full resistance against Musk: Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s worm- and conspiracy theory-addled health secretary, wrote to the 80,000 staff members at the Department of Health and Human Services on Sunday: “This is a legitimate email. Please read and respond per the instructions.” The Social Security Administration issued similar instructions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sunday night, an email informed employees they should “pause” their responses.Ultimately, the only one who may bring Musk to a halt will be Trump, and that may leave hopeful resisters waiting a long time. Musk’s bullet point email came in a response to a Saturday post from Trump telling the world he thought the billionaire should go even harder at slashing the government, in which he wrote: “Elon is doing a great job, but I would like to see him get more aggressive.”Tech’s Trump investments bear sweet, juicy fruit alreadyView image in fullscreenTrump greets Musk as he arrives to attend a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas, on 19 November 2024.Photograph: Brandon Bell/Getty ImagesMy colleagues Dara Kerr and Johana Bhuiyan report:Just one month into Donald Trump’s presidency, the millions that US tech companies invested in currying favor with him seemed to pay off, as the new administration issued a flurry of directives that relaxed regulations and dropped lawsuits previously aimed at holding the industry to account. Crypto, AI and social media companies, many of which made donations to Trump, are all expecting to benefit. Perhaps the biggest beneficiary? Elon Musk, of course.Over the past week, federal agencies under the president’s authority dropped legal fights against Musk’s rocket company as well as the US’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange. The White House also issued a “deregulatory initiative” aimed at loosening tech-sector regulation by empowering Musk’s Doge.On Friday, Coinbase said the Securities and Exchange Commission had communicated plans to dismiss its lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange. The same day, the justice department announced that it was dropping its discrimination case against Musk’s SpaceX.Trump is also cutting regulatory safeguards on artificial intelligence, which Silicon Valley CEOs have long said are overly burdensome. The body charged with testing the safety of cutting-edge AI models is bracing for layoffs after probationary employees received notice Wednesday. Two weeks ago, the White House rolled back an executive order by Joe Biden meant to ensure AI safety.What’s behind all Trump’s pro-tech moves, and why does an inquiry by the US’s federal trade commission into “big tech censorship” read like a mafia-esque threat?Read the full story.The wider TechScapeApple announces $500bn in US investments over next four yearsMore than 150,000 Canadians sign petition to revoke Musk’s citizenshipHackers steal $1.5bn from crypto exchange in ‘biggest digital heist ever’Microsoft unveils chip it says could bring quantum computing within yearsMark Zuckerberg’s charity guts DEI after assuring staff it would continueUnder the influence: Beast Games and the YouTube-ification of televisionSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review: still the superphone to beatElon Musk’s mass government cuts could make private companies millionsParents are desperate to protect kids on social media.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Over the centuries, winemakers have come up with all sorts of systems and terminology to talk up the quality of their wines. One of the best known and still most widely used rankings singles out time as the most important factor: the basic thinking behind classifying a rioja reserva or gran reserva as in some way special is that the longer a wine has spent ageing in barrel and bottle before it is released, the more refined it will be.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For the Germans, preoccupied with ripeness in what was, pre-climate crisis, a difficult place to ripen grapes consistently, it made more sense to build a vinous hierarchy based on sugar rather than oak, in which the higher the levels of sugar in the grape must at harvest, the better the wine should be, from the lowest and lightest, kabinett, to the intensely sweet and concentrated late-harvested, “dry-berries” of trockenbeerenauslese.More recently, however, the global zeitgeist (including in Germany and the Rioja region) has settled on the notion that place is what really counts. The general idea is that quality (or, at least, price) increases as the area where the grapes are grown becomes smaller, from single country to single region to single village, single estate and, finally, the most popular, single vineyard. It’s a way of thinking that is inspired by the wines and wine culture of arguably the most influential region in the contemporary wine world, Burgundy, which has a long established system that zeroes in from AOC bourgogne, with its grapes sourced from across the eastern French region, to the 33 officially top-ranked vineyard plots known as “grands crus”.The rampant spread of the “single vineyard” wine is not without its issues. Too many producers use the term to add lustre to ordinary wines from vineyards with little to commend them or that are so vast in size (extending more than 1,000 hectares) they make a nonsense of the idea. The rise of the single vineyard has also undermined, to some extent, the ancient art of blending: there is a reason producers in places such as Champagne, Barolo and South Australia traditionally chose to mix parcels of grapes from different growing conditions all around their region: it helped them to make a consistent, in more than a few cases, a more complex and frankly better wine.But as someone who has come to cherish wine’s ability to act as a kind of virtual form of travel, I have enjoyed seeing the wave of single vineyard bottlings emerging from all over the world. There’s a great deal of (admittedly slightly trainspotterish) pleasure to be had in finding out how a place “tastes” and in comparing the sometimes enormous differences between wines produced from neighbouring vineyards. And for all that the term is not always a guarantee of quality, some vineyards really do seem to have a talent, or a set of conditions, for producing distinctively delicious wines – wines that just couldn’t come from anywhere else.Six wines that know their placeView image in fullscreenFino Valdespino Inocente Sherry, Jerez, Spain NV(£11.95, 37.5cl,leaandsandeman.co.uk)The source materials for sherry are as important as any wine, and the single vineyard used to provide the grapes for this fine fino play a key role in shaping its richly satisfying, savoury, baked apple and sourdough tang.Leyda Single Vineyard Garuma Sauvignon Blanc, Leyda Valley, Chile 2023(from £11,Tesco;greatwinesdirect.co.uk)Bristling with lime and fresh spring veg greenness, this arresting sauvignon blanc, from a single vineyard just a stone’s throw from the cool of the Pacific Ocean, is consistently one of Chile’s best and most invigorating dry whites.Royal Tokaji on the QT Bin 35 Single Vineyard Old Vine Furmint Szent Tamás, Tokaj, Hungary 2023(£19.99,Waitrose)The great Hungarian wine region was one of the earliest to map and classify its best vineyards and Szent Tamás is one of the highest-rated, and source of this gloriously rich, complex dry whites with its typically electrifying, febrile acidity.Michelini i Mufatto Certezas Semillon, Mendoza Argentina 2021(£39.30,corneyandbarrow.com)After years in the doldrums, the semillon grape is having a moment in Argentina, and this example, from a 133-year-old vineyard, with its subtle grip, herbs, stone fruit and saline edge, is astonishing: a simultaneously substantial and graceful dry white.Domaine de Mourchon Séguret Tradition, Côtes du Rhône Villages, France 2022(£18.99,laithwaites.co.uk)An exemplary Southern Rhône blend of grenache, syrah and carignan, this gloriously deep-flavoured, lusciously dark-berry fruited but lithe and spicy red takes you right back to the idyllic sun-dappled vineyard where it came from.Vineyard Collection Oak Valley Swartland Cinsault, Swartland, South Africa 2022(£14.99,virginwines.co.uk)South African winemakers have transformed the previously much-maligned cinsault variety, producing wines that shimmer with pretty red fruits and subtle earthy tones, sourced, in this case, from just three rows of old vines in a hillside vineyard.Explore more on these topicsFoodDavid Williams on wineWineFrench food and drinkSpanish food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Pair the right label with the right person at the right moment, and you hit the jackpot.At thisMilan fashion week, Gucci’s numbers were never quite going to add up. Despite having the illustrious, high-value brand name, there is a big fat zero where the designer should be. Sales fell 24% in the last quarter of 2024, and designer Sabato de Sarno exited the brand a fortnight ago. The departure was expected, but the timing spoke of a brand rattled by the failure of recent collections to connect with shoppers.View image in fullscreenShift dresses with daringly high hemlines brought a dash of Jackie Kennedy.Photograph: REX/ShutterstockThe new collection, a group effort by the leaderless design team presented with chin-up fanfare, a live orchestra and trays of champagne, was a statement about what Gucci has been, and can be again with the right creative leader. This was a solid greatest hits package, harking back to the brand at its most glamorous – the 1960s, and its sexiest – the 1990s.Luxe faux fur coats over pencil skirts paid homage to the days when Sophia Loren was a beloved customer at the Gucci store in Rome; shift dresses with oversized buttons and daringly high hemlines brought a dash of Jackie Kennedy. Menswear channelled the same period, with boxy car coats worn over turtlenecks in the beatnik-meets-cockney spirit of Michael Caine in his The Italian Job era. Horse-bit hardware and bamboo handles, details as Gucci as a double G logo, showed up on belts and bags. Tom Ford’s 1990s handwriting was here too, in tissue-thin slip dresses plunging low to the navel and the base of the spine, and a sheer lace skirt with the briefest of black knickers visible beneath.The design team, who took a joint bow at the end of the show in matching green Gucci sweatshirts, had fun with the colour palette. A poison green pencil skirt winked under a violet coat, while a blood-red blouse brought a pale pink skirt suit to life.De Sarno’s Gucci was a loafer-led vision of quiet luxury. But the brand’s fans, who had gotten used to being endlessly entertained by the exuberant Instagram-bait maximalism of his predecessor, Alessandro Michele, were unexcited.View image in fullscreenThe design team had fun with a vivid colour palette.Photograph: Alessandro Bremec/ipa-agency.net/REX/ShutterstockRumours abound about Gucci’s next move. Having rolled the dice on an unknown name from within the design studio with the appointment of de Sarno, owners Kering are thought to be looking for a star designer to restore status.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Only then can he dart it with the correct amount of sedative. Luckily, he says, polar bears are “quite good anaesthetic patients”.Ølberg is a vet working with the Norwegian Polar Institute, the body responsible for the monitoring of polar bears in Svalbard, an archipelago that lies between mainlandNorwayand the north pole. Every year he and his colleagues track the bears by helicopter, collect blood, fat and hair samples from them and fit electronic tracking collars.Once he has darted them, the helicopter crew must move away from the bear to avoid more distress. “We see when they start to walk a little bit unsteadily, swaying from one side to the other, that the drugs are having an effect and then the bear will lay down,” says Ølberg. “This means that the dart has landed in a good place. If you just hit the fat, then you probably won’t have any effect at all. That animal will be quite awake.”People started to see these changes in the 1990s, but what has really changed is that now you have many more bad ice yearsJon AarsThe aim of the annual monitoring programme is not just to understand more about the general biology of the bears but also to assess the impact of any threats to their population. In the 1960s, when the programme began, the greatest threat was hunting.The number of bears was falling dramatically until, in 1973, they were given protection when Canada, Denmark, Norway, the US and the Soviet Union signed theagreement on the conservation of polar bears. The hunting stopped and the bear population grew – and is still thriving today. Now, the biggestthreat is climate breakdownand the impact it will have in the years ahead.View image in fullscreenA polar bear filmed with a motion detection camera in Svalbard 2023.Photograph: Fabrice Schnoller/Barba“We have seen really significant changes to the sea ice,” says Jon Aars, senior scientist at the Norwegian Polar Institute, who has been following the bears for more than 20 years. “People started to see these changes in the 1990s, and of course you can still have good and bad ice years, but what has really changed is that now you have many, many more bad ice years.”Aars keeps up with the fortunes of his bears “by text message”. Their collars send him information at regular intervals on things such as body temperature, whether they have been swimming and where they have travelled.The samples the team take from the anesthetised bears can also tell him what the bears are eating, for example. “We see that they eat more land-based food than they used to,” he says. “Things like reindeer and birds.”That is because the retreating sea ice has made a difference to where the bears go to find food.About 300of the Barents Sea polar bear population stays in Svalbard year round and hunt on ice close to the islands. “When ice melts, they are forced on land,” says Aars. “These bears are now on land much more than they were 20 to 30 years ago.”View image in fullscreenMelting ice means the polar bears in Svalbard now spend much more time on land than they did 20 years ago.Photograph: Arterra/Universal Images/GettyThe rest of the bear population follows the sea ice when it retreats in the summer north east to Franz Josef Land, a Russian archipelago in the Barents Sea, to hunt. Rather than then return south to Svalbard to make dens in the winter, as they once would, scientists believe the retreating sea ice around the Norwegian archipelago means the bears are more often staying to create maternity dens in the Russian Arctic.“The challenge will be if, in several years’ time, the conditions in Franz Josef are like those now in Svalbard,” says Aars. “We do see in several other polar bear populations that we are already at a stage where the warmer climate and loss of sea ice have had quite a significant impact on individuals and populations. We’re not there yet, but we know that these bears are depending on that ice.”Meanwhile, Aars will continue to do his best for a species he knows down to the individual bear in some cases. “There are some female bears that I have captured 10 times and I know their names, which areas they move in and when they are due to give birth. It’s a privilege to do the work I do [getting close to the sedated bears], but for me it is much more exciting to be out there and to be able to see a bear free, to watch it passing by.”Explore more on these topicsNorwaySeascape: the state of our oceansMarine lifePolar regionsClimate crisisEndangered habitatsWildlifeEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some economists havespeculatedthat these terminations, which could affect nearly 300,000 workers, will be the biggest job cuts in US history.Most of the workers cut were inprobationary periodsand lacked job protections that come with longer terms of employment. In social media spaces, especially ther/fednewssubreddit, these workers described scenes of confusion and feelings of anger directed at Musk, an unelected billionaire dubbed a “special government employee” by the White House. Last week, unions for federal workerssuedthe Trump administration for unlawfully using probationary periods to cut staff.These people protected US forests and lands. Their jobs have now vanished due to TrumpRead moreThe mass firings appear far from over: this weekend, Musk demanded that all remaining workers detail their day-to-day duties in bullet points or face dismissal. (Several federal agenciestoldtheir employees not to respond to Musk’s email, and unions and advocacy groupsmovedto prevent retaliation against employees who did not comply.)Three recently terminated probationary workers told the Guardian about the effects on their lives and job prospects, and how the consequences will “trickle down” to all Americans. They requested anonymity due to fears of retaliation and the fact that they are currently looking for new jobs.‘Do I need to think about becoming a political refugee?’Scientist who works on food sustainability issues in the north-east USI was the third person hired in our unit, almost three years ago, to look at issues of access and fairness when it comes to food. Our probationary period for government scientists is three years. I was 10 weeks away from the end of this period; one of my colleagues who was also fired was only six weeks out.I went on maternity leave in August. When Trump was elected, I knew it would mess with my job. Specifically, I thought it would mess with telework, which I did half the time after I returned from maternity leave. I was concerned that I wouldn’t be able to have the time to breastfeed my baby at home or to manage the postpartum separation anxiety I’ve experienced. I decided to take a deferred resignation, because then I’d get severance.There’s a lot of good work that the world won’t even know to miss, because we won’t get to do itSix days after my resignation, when I was into the off-boarding process, my boss told me I was going to get a termination letter. It was a huge, emotional process to resign – I feel like I was basically bullied by Trump into doing so – but at least it was my decision to make. Now, I was getting fired. It’s been an insane rollercoaster of emotions.Government workers are real people with families who dedicated their lives and expertise to service. It feels like we’re being treated as grifters or terrorists, when we’re not. A lot of us have given up options for much higher incomes in order to do the work that we thought was going to help the world. This is a huge, huge loss for science, because now government researchers are going to shift into the private sector. There’s a lot of good work that the world won’t even know to miss, because we won’t get to do it.Now I’m wondering, do I need to think about becoming a political refugee? I have a big network in Europe and Canada, though I’d like to stay in the US. It’s hard these days to know what’s catastrophizing and what’s good planning. I think people are really hesitant to go to the worst-case scenario, but we know from history that things can get really bad. Some people see it coming, and some people don’t.It’s also been really, really disappointing and enraging for me to see the lack of effective resistance to Trump and Musk from Congress. There’s a lot of talk on the left about how this is all bad, but nothing’s really getting done. I understand the numbers, the majorities and minorities, but I just think this is not the time to be playing nice with the fascists.‘I’m exploring legal options’Cultural resource specialist for the National ResourcesConservation Services (NRCS), an agency of the US Department ofAgriculture, in North DakotaI’m an archaeologist. Anytime the NRCS wants to provide support to private landowners such as ranchers or famers, they are legally required to have someone like me to do on-the-ground surveys and excavations of the site.I started on 30 December. I was let go on 13 February. I’d moved from California to North Dakota, and believe it or not I was given relocation expenses to help pay for my move. I came here with my wife and two dogs, and we spent a good amount of money to do so. I sold my Camry and bought a Subaru because I thought I needed a car that could handle the snow up here; now I have a new SUV and a car payment.They told me that if I didn’t work for the federal government for more than a year, I’d have to pay back those expenses. I don’t know if they’re going to come after me for that now.View image in fullscreenLabor union activists rally in support of federal workers during a protest on Capitol Hill in Washington DC on 11 February.Photograph: Craig Hudson/ReutersIt would be one thing if they’d sent me a personalized letter saying something like: “Your position is being cut.” Instead, I got this generic form letter that still said “template” in the document title. It told me I was being fired for performance-based reasons, but my boss and I were like, I haven’t even worked here long enough to get a performance review. How can they say that?I guess there’s camaraderie among the people who got cut, but more than that everyone just talks about how stupid it is. Are they really making the government more efficient if they’re getting rid of all these people who do things that are required by law? I get the impression that Musk’s treating this like he would a private company such as Twitter, where he fired a lot of people. He’s acting like a CEO, but it’s not his company. It’s the federal government.Everyone who knows the day-to-day of how to take care of this place is goneI’m exploring legal options with employment lawyers, who indicated I’ll have to go through a bigger class-action type thing. There are a couple of class-action lawsuits going around that I’ve submitted my information to. I’m also applying to jobs, and I have a couple of interviews set up. One is for a job that’s in this area, another is out of state. If something good comes up, I would take it and move. That wouldn’t be too hard – I’ve been here for such a short time that I haven’t even unpacked everything yet.‘I didn’t go into this because I wanted to make six figures’Educator at a national forest in OregonI’ve worked for the forest in one way or another since 2019, first as an intern and then in a seasonal position. I got my permanent position in July of last year. During Trump’s first week, they asked for a list of names of everyone who had been hired in the last year. That put me on edge.One day, I saw a bunch of people at the USDA posting on the subreddit for federal employees about getting fired. I was going to text my supervisor to ask: “Am I getting fired?” and then she called me to say that she didn’t have any details but it was probably going to happen. The next day, Valentine’s Day, she called with her definitive list. That was a Friday. It was not a good weekend.It’s overwhelming to know that all the work I put in during the past five years is completely wasted. I have a two-year-old, and my husband and I wanted to have another, but now we don’t know about that. Working in the natural resources field, I don’t know what positions are going to be available, and I’m not sure where my career will go. Do I just give up and go into accounting or something? It’s so uncertain.I feel like we’re being attacked. There have always been people who are anti-government, but now I feel like people see all government employees as villains. I really cared about the work I did, and I didn’t go into this because I wanted to make six figures. The forest or park services have always been very bipartisan, and it’s not something you can easily throw away.We do a lot of school field trips – those won’t happen any more without us. Kids, especially those who come from poorer communities, won’t have the opportunity to come out here and see the natural world. The forest is going to be in disarray, the bathrooms won’t be cleaned, anyone who comes here will have a terrible experience. Without people maintaining the forest, the wildlife will have a worse habitat. All of these things trickle down. The people who fired us are higher-ups who don’t work in the field; everyone who knows the day-to-day of how to take care of this place is gone.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpElon MuskAgricultureUS domestic policyArchaeologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His son doesn’t know if his future is on the farm‘Pepe’ Jijón loves his life in the Ecuadorian cloud forest, but for his son Jose, the excitement of New York city callsOwen RacerTue 25 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 09.03 ESTShareOn an October day, Jose Jijon rang up a customer’s $35 bag of coffee at a Brooklyn, New York, cafe. The transaction was one of many as shoppers poured in and out of SeyCoffee, one of the country’s most renowned roasteries.There was no way the patron who browsed the coffee varieties – each identified by producer, location and altitude of the farm – could know the smiling young cashier wearing the Johnny Cash T-shirt was the heir apparent to the coffee farm whose beans they had just purchased.In 2024, Jose’s father, José Ignacio “Pepe” Jijón, won the mostnotable produceraward from Sprudge, a global coffee community, for the beans from his Finca Soledad (“Solitude Farm” in Spanish). The coffee farm sits atop an ascending switchback road overlooking Ecuador’s Intag valley, about 90 miles north of the capital, Quito. The remote Andean region is a rare cloud forest ecosystem of high altitude, year-round clouds and epiphytes – non-parasitic plants that grow on other plants, such as ferns and orchids. This setting produces the complex acidity, balanced floral notes and dark berry hints that characterize the farm’s much-coveted coffee.The year 2023 was also busy for Jose, who has dual Ecuador-US citizenship. He left Finca Soledad to work at Sey in New York, his “city of dreams”.View image in fullscreenPepe Jijón originally planned to make an environmental stand planting trees in the Andes. Only after Intag valley locals offered their advice did Finca Soledad become a coffee farm.Photograph: Owen RacerIt’s not yet clear what Jose’s exact dreams are, though; he’s 19 and figuring that out. But his future may take him away from Finca Soledad and what seemed to be a preordained path in the family business.Around the world, farmers’ would-be heirs have long been drawn to possibilities beyond agriculture. Pepe recently read the US farmer-writer Wendell Berry’s 1977 book The Unsettling of America: Culture andAgriculture. Berry wrote of this phenomenon: “Few of the farmers’ children will be able to afford to stay on the farm – perhaps even fewer will wish to do so, for it will cost too much, require too much work and worry, and it is hardly a fashionable ambition.”Multiple factors threaten the viability of coffee farming:climate change, competition fromlarge-scale coffee corporationsthat drive down prices with lower-quality offerings and low farm wages, and consumer expectations that coffee should be cheap.In Ecuador’s coffee industry, where the average age of a producer is about 60, the generations positioned to take over are weighing such factors and seeing what life in cities elsewhere – in their home country or abroad – may hold. At precisely the moment that specialty coffee consumption is reachingdecade highsand coffee prices are settingrecords, many smallholder farms that supply60% to 80%of the world’s coffee may struggle to survive a dual crisis of sustainability that’s not just about environmental change but also the lack of successors.Must a son follow the father?Jose speaks matter-of-factly about the challenges of coffee farming.“In the rural parts of Ecuador, being a coffee producer is seen as a job that’s destined to be extremely harsh and not well paid,” he said. He fears burnout would push him away from the land that’s given his family a livelihood.He’s seen the challenges first-hand. As profitable as Finca Soledad is now, it wasn’t always fruitful. When Jose was a boy, his father and his grandfather, then an Ecuadorian diplomat, endured failed forays into sugar cane, commodity coffee and bananas that earned them $2 for every $100 they spent. They were losing money on their joint endeavor and farming more acres than they could manage, but these were some of the best times Pepe remembers. Just four years ago, Finca Soledad was nearly bankrupt.View image in fullscreenWhen Sey roastery’s founder and coffee buyer visited Pepe Jijón at Finca Soledad in 2023, Jose mentioned he was interested in moving to New York City. Within the year, he was in Brooklyn as the roastery’s first-ever intern.Photograph: Owen RacerJose and his older sister Kassandra, who moved to California, are versatile coffee professionals who have worked on both the production and barista sides of the business. Both want to stay involved in Finca Soledad and the coffee industry as their careers, but neither sees their future resting solely on the farm.Jose knows his interests will change over time, and he’s entertaining many options. Some days, he’s interested in fashion or technology; other days, business school. Regardless, he wants to change the narrative of Ecuadorian coffee farming. And he might do that – precisely by subverting expectations and not taking over Finca Soledad. In the male-dominated and ageing coffee sector, producers’ children are pushed to inherit the business and its responsibilities.Pepe hopes his 2024 decision – which Jose encouraged – to purchase a second farm, Finca San Pedro, in Ecuador’s prominent Loja coffee region, will do the quiet work for him.“San Pedro needs a lot of energy right now,” Pepe said. “And I think Jose would enjoy that a lot because it’s something he would be a part of from the beginning.” Regardless, he continued: “I live on borrowed time, I’ve had so much good life that everything that happens to me now is a gift.”Pepe, 50, achieved fame as an explorer in a mountain-climbing career before repeating such success in coffee by taking risks. He wants the same freedom of choice for Jose, whose aspirations meander from going to college in New York or taking on a part-time role at Finca Soledad. Pepe’s not pressing Jose to become the coffee farm’s contingency plan and generally abstains from persuasion.Instead, he’s enjoying the high, more concerned with conservation and producing the best coffee possible. “My coffee venture, it’s more than enough for me to feed my family and continue making this a greener planet,” Pepe said. Rather than extracting everything he can from the land, he intends to reserve more than 250 unplanted acres of land and live a life of “seclusion and trees” at Finca Soledad.There, nature’s freedom is intoxicating. Thick clouds seep into the valley at dawn and push against the Pepe’s bamboo home. There are no mirrors, clocks or televisions in the house, but ceramics for leisurely coffee sipping, hammocks and Jimi Hendrix records. It’s a mellow, no-shoes place that reflects Pepe himself (Lance Schnorenberg, Sey’s co-founder, described him as a “vibes guy”). He tends to walk around Finca Soledad with his arms spread wide in wonder. He sees coffee as “medicine for the soul” and, when produced ethically, “a tool for revolution”.View image in fullscreenPepe Jijón, left, once had to pay his son, right, $10 to taste-test coffee. He now turns to Jose, 19, to ask what flavor notes he’s noticing.Photograph: Owen RacerHowever laidback, Pepe does hope that his son will participate in the business – in some way. Raised on the farm, Jose said that coffee “brought me and my dad together” along with other commonalities: abstaining from politics, a preference for nature-based spirituality over religion and a fondness for American rock.But decisions about family businesses don’t always have unifying effects, even among the Jijóns. Pepe and his own father once had competing visions of what the farm could be. Pepe’s father wanted to center production for profit. Pepe wanted quality and conservancy, so his father wanted to sell the land. Pepe couldn’t fathom selling what had become his escape after a motorcycle accident tanked his climbing career. Eventually, Pepe’s father left Finca Soledad.Having endured one father-son disagreement over the farm’s purpose, Pepe sought to share his devotion with Jose. At first, he couldn’t get his son to interact with coffee without paying him. Absent any epiphany, Jose’s relationship with coffee evolved. He witnessed FincaSoledad achieve global reach during the Covid-19 pandemic, and his interest grew while experiencing the brewing, roasting and tasting side in the US.Now, when the pair are “cupping” coffee, identifying flavor notes and indicators of their processing, Pepe asks Jose what he tastes. In early 2024, the then18-year-old was perched in one of Soledad’scedrotrees, meticulously pruning its branches. Pepe guided each strike of the blade from below.At coffee events, the back-and-forth banter between Jose and Pepe shows the kind of entrenched friendship for which many fathers and sons long. While at the Specialty Coffee Expo in Chicago in April, Pepe joked that Jose was taking over Finca Soledad, implying his son should be the subject of fans’ selfies. However, sitting on his porch high above the Intag River, Pepe said regardless of his opinions on city life and formal education (two options that appeal more to Jose than him), he accepts the farm’s unknown fate and that his son’s path may diverge from his own.A tough transformationMultigenerational coffee farms are shuttering all around the Intag valley. The small region of about 17,000 people has seen 1,000 coffee farms dwindle to about 100 mostly because of mining activities, said Ena Galletti, the president of Ecuador’s specialty coffee association. Coffee farmers have left to pick oranges in Spain and work for $50 a day in Intag’s illegal mines.“If they can’t live good lives, why would we expect them to stay? It’s a huge problem,” Sey’s Schnorenberg said. “The future of what Pepe is hinges on this getting talked about.”Finca Soledad is showing a way forward in how it deals with labor issues. “When I think of Soledad, it’s more of idealist terms, more of like what specialty coffee could look like,” said Schnorenberg, who has visited and worked with hundreds of coffee farms.The farm’s rich soil and cool climate – which Schnorenberg says are ideal conditions unavailable to many other producers – produce prized specialty coffee, which in turn allows the farm’s small workforce to be paid nearly three times as much as coffee farm workers earn in neighboring Colombia.Galletti said: “We’re having a lot of difficulty trying to do generational transition. [Coffee farming is] hard work and little money; that’s what [many young workers] have in their head. But that’s because they’ve been trying to work in commercial coffee,” sold in bulk and often produced at the expense of fair wages and quality.View image in fullscreenPepe Jijón’s Finca Soledad coffee drew obsessive fans who crowded the Specialty Coffee Association’s expo in Chicago to sample drinks brewed by his kids, Kassandra, middle, and Jose, left.Photograph: Owen RacerA former producer herself, Galletti encourages coffee farmers to focus on beans that meet the industry’s highest standards. “We have managed to find not a solution but a mitigating strategy, which is working towards finer specialty coffees,” she said. “We have to make this transition” to provide laborers better quality of life, staunch the flow of workers out of the industry, and protect an increasingly endangered and incredibly biodiverse region.Still, Finca Soledad’s transition to specialty coffee was tough. Twelve years in, hard labor sequestered in the Andes wasn’t paying off, and Pepe had a family of four. But thanks to boosts from the “beautiful vessel” of social media and the pandemic, Soledad’s products are now in high demand. Ben Morrow, co-owner of the Netherlands-based Manhattan Coffee Roasters, said of FincaSoledad’s award-winning coffee: “I want all of it, forever, [but] because of his popularity, I can’t get enough.” When he can get it, it sells out in days.Just as Soledad’s 2024 coffee – which Schnorenberg described as “lightning in a bottle” – reached buyers, a historic four-month drought during Ecuador’s rainy season nearly depleted the farm’s upcoming harvest. Jose has returned to Soledad and will help his father tend drought-stricken plants, automate tasks and document successful methods of past harvests.Given all coffee has done for his young life – including trips to coffee events in Copenhagen and Taiwan last year – Jose doesn’t see himself going too far from the nature conservancy mission that epitomizes Finca Soledad. Increasingly worried about the intergenerational threat to coffee, he plans to spend the year visiting rural schools in Ecuador to teach kids about coffee.“I want to show kids you can have an incredible life being a coffee producer. Even if I can get one kid to try and start coffee, it will be worth it,” Jose said. “Coffee producing is a dying profession. These farmers, who are now 60 years old, at some point will stop. What happens then? That’s a ticking bomb.”Come 2026, Jose hopes to be back in New York, next time to study.“I don’t want to just live behind my dad’s shadow all my life, I don’t want to be a groupie to my dad,” Jose explained. “I want to be better than my dad, and he’s always told me that too.”Explore more on these topicsEcuadorCoffeeAgricultureFarmingSmall businessAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 1940, the boywas installed as the 14th Dalai Lama.At once, they were catapulted to being the leading family in the country, swapping their farmhouse for a mansion in the city of Lhasa, where Gyalo attended a private school for the children of aristocrats. In 1942, aged 14, he was sent to Nanjing,China.This led to his meeting the president of what was still the Republic of China,Chiang Kai-shek, who regarded the young Tibetan as the ideal person to liaise between himself and the Dalai Lama as soon as the latter came of age.It was a policy of the nationalists – no less than of the communists – that Tibet should be reunited with the motherland. In his 2015 autobiography,The Noodle Maker of Kalimpong, Thondup recounted howhe had been a frequent houseguest of the president and his wife, who came to treat him “as a son”.Not long after the communists came to power in 1949, theymoved troops into Tibet. Thondup – who had by now separated from a Tibetan wifeand married the daughter of a high-ranking officer in the nationalist navy – soon fled to Kalimpong, West Bengal, where there was already a large community of Tibetan exiles. During the winter of 1949-50, theDalai Lama left Lhasafor southern Tibet, with a view to possibly seeking asylum in India.It was at this time that Thondup first came into contact with theCIA. Concerned at the loss of China to the communists, the US state department was keen to build relationships with the Dalai Lama’s government.Thondup, who had emerged as de facto leader of the Tibetan émigrés, was approached by the CIA. Although never anti-Chinese, Thondup was, as might be expected, staunchly anti-communist. As the situation inTibetdeteriorated, the US decided to arm a resistance movement.Thondup was charged with identifying six candidates who were exfiltratedto a CIA base on Okinawa, Japan, for training in intelligence gathering and sabotage. To their surprise, their translator was theeldest brotherof Thondup and the Dalai Lama, who had acquired the name ofTaktser Rinpocheand a position as abbot of an important monastery through another reincarnation. Having fled the Chinese and renounced his religious vocation, he too had become a CIA asset.The agents that Thondup recruited impressed the Americans sufficiently for them to mount a full-scale operation in Tibet. Training was switched from Okinawa to a secret base at Camp Hale, Colorado, where 250 agents – most of them ex-monks and all recruited by Thondup – received training.When the Dalai Lama fled Lhasa for India in March 1959, he established contact with some of them. As a result, though the fact was kept secret for decades, the US president, Dwight D Eisenhower, and, through him, the Indian prime minister,Jawaharlal Nehru, were kept aware of the Dalai Lama’s movements almost from the start.US support for the Tibetan resistance continued throughout the early 60s, but tailed off as it became clear that the Chinese would not easily be dislodged. The agents did some sabotage, including blowing up an armoury and damaging some convoys, but the main effect was to harden Chinese resolve. For his part, Thondup spent the next decade or so pursuing various business interests, including a noodle factory.View image in fullscreenXi Zhongxun, China's vice-premier and father of president Xi Jinping, with Gyalo Thondup in Beijing, 1987.Photograph: China/ReutersHe also had a direct role in the Tibetan government in exile. In 1959, 1961 and 1965 he promoted resolutions relating to Tibet by the general assembly of the United Nations in the course of handling its foreign affairs, and in the early 90s he became the chairman of the Kashag (cabinet). In between he established a base in Hong Kong, in addition to a residence in Kalimpong.His apparent success caused considerable envy and questioning within the exile community. He was a key figure in the sale in the early 60sof about $2mworth of gold that had been sent from Tibet in 1950and had been held in safekeeping for the Dalai Lama by the maharajah of Sikkim. Investments were made in various Indian enterprises, none of them successful, with the result thatan inventory taken four years later showed their value had fallen to just a third.When news of this reached the Tibetan community in exile, several people involved in the debacle, chief among them Thondup, came under suspicion. But despite the rumblings of discontent, he retained the confidence of the Dalai Lama and became his chief envoy, first to the Indian government and then to the Chinese government.In 1979, after the death ofMao Zedongand in the wake ofDeng Xiaoping’s opening of China, Thondup visited the Chinese premier for a discussion about a possible return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet. Partly as a result of this meeting, several fact-finding missions from the Tibetan government in exile visited Tibet with a view to the Dalai Lama himself doing so in 1985.However, the news of conditions in Tibet brought back by the delegates was so shocking that the Dalai Lama cancelled the prospective trip. Intermittent discussions with the Chinese government, again facilitated by Thondup, continued until the early 90s when he himself withdrew on the grounds that no progress had been made, a situation that still obtains.Born in the small settlement of Taktser, eastern Tibet, Gyalo was the third of seven surviving children, and second son, of Choekyong Tsering and his wife Diki, and spent his early years living and working on the family farm. The older brother that he went on to meet again through the CIA went by the name of Thubten Jigme Norbu until recognised by the 13th Dalai Lama as the reincarnation of the lama Taktser Rinpoche.After a life closely connected to that of the Dalai Lama, Gyalo retired to Kalimpong, yet remained a controversial figure within the Tibetan community in exile. He consolidated that reputation with his autobiography, in which he responded combatively to the allegations of wrongdoing in relation to the Dalai Lama’s gold.His second wife, Diki Dolkar, and their daughter, Yangzom Dolma, predeceased him. He is survived by two sons, Ngawang Tanpa and Khedroob Thondup, two brothers, the Dalai Lama and Tendzin Choegyal, and a sister, Jetsun Pema.Gyalo Thondup, businessman and political envoy, born 5 November 1928; died 8 February 2025Explore more on these topicsTibetDalai LamaChinaCIAReligionobituariesShareReuse this content"

But as profits plummet, bookshops are being replaced by kebab shopsBySaqib ManzoorSupported byAbout this contentTue 25 Feb 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 03.32 ESTShareInside one of the oldest bookshops in Delhi’s Urdu Bazaar, Rafiq Ahmad, a film critic and writer, is scrutinising the bookshelves for material to help with his next project. Ahmad often travels from Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh to Delhi’s famed Urdu Bazaar in search of the books he needs.“I know this is the place where I can find any Urdu book from any era. Whenever I have to write anything, I come here for material. Currently, I am looking for books about Dilip Kumar, the renowned Bollywood actor,” Ahmad says.Once known as a literary hub for book lovers, poets, writers and calligraphers, the Urdu market, nestled among the old and narrow lanes of India’s capital, is silently mourning its own slow death.About 40 years ago, there were 60 shops that sold Urdu novels and poetry books. Now, only half a dozen survive. The rest have been transformed into eateries, clothing shops and guesthouses. The smell of sizzling kebabs and biryani has triumphed over the scent of ancient books.Urdu Bazaar, also known as Kitab Ghar or Kitab Mandir, was established in 1920 in the walled city of Delhi and became a hub of Urdu printing, publishing and poetry.View image in fullscreenBookshop owner Moin-Ud-Din and Rafiq Ahmad, who travels to the bazaar from Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh to find research material for his projects.Photograph: Danyal HassanMoin-Ud-Din, 45, owner of Kutub Khana Anjuman-e-Taraqqi-e-Urdu, sits in his shop brushing the dust off a poetry book and reminiscing about his childhood, when the lanes were filled with bookshops, readers and poets.“I was born here beside these books,” he says. “I started assisting my father when I was in seventh standard [grade]. But witnessing my cradle crumble shatters my heart.”He is the third generation of his family to look after the bookshop, which his grandfather, Munshi Niyaz Ud-Din, established in 1939.For Moin-Ud-Din, the decline of Urdu Bazaar began during the partition of the country in 1947, and intensified in the 1980s and 1990s when fast-food restaurants and the digital revolution arrived. Instead of shelves bursting with a rich variety of Urdu Books, food, trendy clothes andmiswaqs(teeth-cleaning twigs) began to appear, and the scholars and poets were replaced with food vloggers and fashion fans.“Most of the booksellers who owned shops here went to Pakistan. Only a few remained here and, later on, many found profit in selling fast food and transformed bookshops into food hubs,” Moin-Ud-Din says.It was once a bookshop frequented by reputed writers, now it is a hotel selling kebabs and chickenAhmad Nabeel, shopkeeperMany of the bookshops that continue to exist have placed prayer rugs and dates outside to widen their appeal.“I have been here for seven years. I didn’t know anything about Urdu but my passion for Urdu brought me here,” Mohammad Alauddin, a bookseller at Zulfiqar Book Depot, says. His son-in-law owned the shop, but after his death, Alauddin took over. He too believes that people found selling kebabs more profitable than books.“Most of the famous, oldest shops – Nazeeria, Quran Ghar, Central Book Depot, Kutub Khana Rasheediya – have become hotels and guesthouses. Since Jama Masjid is here, the sale of food is always high,” Alauddin says, referring to the 400-year-old mosque that sits opposite the bazaar.Inside the dimly lit Kutub Khana Aziziya bookshop, Ahmad Nabeel is engrossed in writing daily notes. Established in 1937, the shop was looked after by his grandfather and father until it was Nabeel’s turn.He believes it is the new generation’s lack of interest in Urdu literature that has led to the bazaar’s demise. “Previously, parents taught their kids the Urdu language, but now people are inclined towards English,” Nabeel says. “They are mostly into English literature.”Back in the bazaar’s heyday, each shop employed about 10 members of staff; now just one or two are needed.View image in fullscreenWith the nearby 400-year-old Jama Masjid drawing tourists and worshippers, food shops can more readily find customers than bookshops do, say owners.Photograph: Danyal HassanNabeel points to the adjacent shop that once harboured the famous Kutub Khana Rasheediya. “It was once a bookshop often frequented by reputed writers but then it became a clothes shop and now it is a hotel selling kebabs and chicken,” he says.Khalid Mubashir, an assistant professor of Urdu at Jamia Millia Islamia university, believes ebooks and the digital world have affected the sale of Urdu books.“Firstly, the stamina of reading has reduced owing to an increasing 30-40 second ‘reel culture’. Secondly, everything is available and accessible on the internet in the form of ebooks and PDFs. This will be like this in future. I don’t think such space will be revived again,” Mubashir says.Mohammad Ghalib, 63, is the last surviving calligrapher in the Urdu Bazaar. He has calligraphed academic books and other weighty tomes but, as business dried up, Ghalib turned to writing wedding cards and short titles.View image in fullscreenCalligrapher Mohammed Ghalib demonstrates his skill.Photograph: Stuart Freedman/In Pictures/Getty ImagesGhalib recalls the bygone era of Urdu Bazaar: “There were around 14katibs– calligraphers – here. Some of them died, and some left the profession since they found no profit in it.“Technology took over the art of calligraphy and handwritten books,” he says, moving his hand over an example of ornate script.The lost mansions of Chettinad: festival showcases opulent homes turned heritage hotelsRead moreAway from the crowd, on the narrow and dimly-lit Chooriwalan bylane, Shah Wali Ullah library, established in 1994, determinedly promotes Urdu literature and gives space to young poets and writers.The library holds about 21,000 books, including a 100-year-old Qur’an; Ghalib’s Diwan-e-Ghalib, complete with his personal seal and signature; an illustrated Ramayana in Persian; and Diwan-i Zafar, a volume of Bahadur Shah Zafar’s poetry, printed and sealed by the royal press in the Red Fort in 1885.“Students from different universities and people from Iran, Japan, Thailand and Europe visit our library and are interested to see these old manuscripts,” says Sikander Mirza Changezi, co-founder of the library. Changezi believes the coming generation will preserve and revive such spaces.Meanwhile, Moin-Ud-Din is determined to keep his bookshop open. “I too could have switched to an eatery or clothes shop, but I want to carry on the legacy of my grandfather.“This place was established by scholars who didn’t want to earn from it but contribute to society and religion.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsiaDelhiBest bookshopsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, some of Gaza’s most senior doctors have spoken of the violence and abuse they say they facedMore than 160 Gazan medics held in Israeli prisons amid reports of tortureByAnnie Kelly, Hoda Osman and Farah JalladSupported byAbout this contentTue 25 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 11.04 ESTShareDr Issam Abu Ajwa was in the middle of performing emergency surgery on a patient with a severe abdominal injury at al-Ahli Arab hospital in centralGazawhen thesoldiers came for him.“I asked them what they were doing coming into the operating theatre,” he says.“One of the soldiers pointed at me and said: ‘Are you Dr Issam Abu Ajwa?’ I said: ‘Yes, that’s me.’ And then the beating began.”Still in his surgeons’ scrubs, the 63-year-old Abu Ajwa says he was dragged from the operating room before beinghandcuffed, blindfolded and stripped.He was then put in a military truck with other doctors, nurses and medicalstaff and driven away from the hospital. Less than 24 hours later he was in a detention facility in Israel, beginning what he describes as months of brutal and constant violence and abuse.“There were no rules,” he says.During interrogations, he says he was tortured and beaten. “They would throw me on the ground. One would hit me on the head while the other opened my ear and poured water inside,” he says.“There was a bathroom [in the interrogation room] … [they] would take a toilet brush and tell me ‘today we are going to brush your teeth.’ I was tied up, blindfolded and three or four of them held my face, pinned it down and kept scrubbing.”Abu Ajwa says they broke his teeth: “They have no humanity.”Under international law,healthcare workers like Abu Ajwa should be protected from attacks by warring parties and be allowed to continue providing medical care to all who need it.Quote of a definition of war crimes (‘Intentionally directing attacks against hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are treated’) next to a line drawing of a seated figure looking sadYet by the time the January ceasefirecame into effect, more than1,000 medical staff across Gazahad been killedand many hospitals bombed to rubble – attacks which a UN Human Rights Council commissionconcluded amounted to war crimes.Hundreds moremedical staffwho survived the airstrikes and ground assaults were arrested, illegally transferred across the border and disappeared into Israeli prisons, including dozens of doctors.Map of Gaza showing location of hospitals and airstrikesAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO),297 doctors, nurses, paramedics and other healthcare workersfrom Gaza were detained by Israel during the war.Palestinian medical NGO Healthcare Workers Watch says it believes the number is slightly higher and that it has verified that 339 healthcare workers from Gaza have been detained by the Israeli military, with at least 160 still inside Israeli prison facilities.In interviews with the Guardian andtheArab Reporters for Investigative Journalism(ARIJ), eight of Gaza’s most senior doctors have given harrowing testimonies of the torture, beatings, starvation and humiliation they say they suffered during months of detention.All of those interviewed say they were targeted because they were doctors. Most were arrested inside hospitals as they worked; others were taken from ambulances or detained at checkpoints after being identified as healthcare workers. All those doctors interviewed were detained underIsrael’s Unlawful Combatants Law, which grants the Israeli military sweeping powers to detain anyone from Gaza they say might pose a security threat.They stripped me naked, put a blindfold over my eyes and handcuffed my feet. The beatings started from this first momentDr Mohammed Abu SelmiaSome, including Abu Ajwa, believe they were singled out for extreme violence by prison guards and interrogators because they were doctors.“One of the senior interrogators had given instructions that because I was a senior consultant surgeon they should work hard to make sure that I lost [the use of my hands] and became unable to perform surgery,” he says.He says hewas handcuffed for 24 hours a day and interrogators used planks with chains to restrain his hands for hours at a time. “They said they wanted to make sure I could never return to work.”None of the senior doctors interviewed say they were given an explanation for their detention. All were released without charge after months of imprisonment.TheUN Human Rights Officesaid the mass detention of healthcare workers has had a catastrophic impact on civilians, denying injured and sick patients – as well as junior medical staff – access to the decades of medical skills of senior medics and has beena clear contributing factorin the almost total collapse of Gaza’s healthcare system.“Israel must immediately release all those held arbitrarily, including medical staff, and end all practices that amount to enforced disappearances, torture and other ill-treatment,” the UN said in a statement given to the Guardian. “Those responsible for crimes under international law must be held to account.”View image in fullscreenDr Mohammed Abu Selmia: ‘I was immediately detained … as if they were waiting for me’Dr Mohammed Abu Selmia, director of al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza, wasarrested at a checkpointwhile travelling with a convoy of patients in ambulances after the Israeli army told him to evacuate the hospital in November 2023.“When I told them my name, they pointed their weapons at me and their laser [sights] at my head and chest and I was immediately detained … as if they were waiting for me, as if they had seized a big prize,” he says.“They beat me with rifle butts and chairs,” he says. “After that, they poured sand over my head and shoved dirt into my mouth.“I was on the floor on my knees with a blindfold and they were beating me … after this I was put in a vehicle, myself and many others piled on top of each other in a humiliating and degrading way,” he says. “Everyone was screaming, everyone was crying out ‘we don’t know where we’re going.’ The beating was constant.”All of the doctors interviewed by the Guardian and ARIJ reported the same pattern of identification, detention, transfer to Israel and incarceration, and thenbeing moved multiple times between Israeli-run prisons during their captivity.It was not just the beatings [but] the way they treated us like we were not human. In Nafha prison, they kept telling us to howl like dogsDr Bassam MiqdadIn these facilities they say they were subjected to terrifying and inhumane treatment including being constantly beaten and kept in stress positions for hours at a time and having loud music played constantly to prevent them from sleeping.“Frankly, no matter how much I talk about what I experienced in detention, it is only a fraction of what truly happened,” says Abu Selmia.“I am talking about being clubbed, being beaten with rifle butts and being attacked by dogs. There was little to no food, no personal hygiene, no soap inside the cells, no water, no toilet, no toilet paper … I saw people who were dying there.“Every day is a humiliation, every day is degradation. There you are just a number, you are not a hospital director or a human being. I was beaten so badly I couldn’t use my legs or walk. No day passes without torture.”View image in fullscreenDr Mahmoud Abu Shehada. ‘We were stripped naked, it was cold, and they deliberately sprayed us with cold water,’ he saysIn their testimonies, the doctors say they were also denied food and water, with some forced to eat toothpaste for lack of anything else. They said they were not allowed to wash or change their clothes, sometimes for months at a time.Dr Mahmoud Abu Shehada, head of orthopaedic surgery at Nasser hospital, was arrested at work on 16 February 2024. “All the medical staff were told to leave. We [were] lined up between the administration building and the old Nasser building,” he says.“We were subjected to severe beatings from Friday afternoon to the early hours of Saturday morning. It was a brutal night of assault and abuse. We were stripped naked; it was cold, and they deliberately sprayed us with cold water.”Abu Shehada spent around three months in different detention centres, where he says he suffered “daily humiliations and torture” before being transferred to Israel’s desert Negev prison.“In Negev prison, the detainees were suffering from skin diseases, scabies and severe infections with pus and discharge on the skin,” he says.“After a while the infection spread to us. Weakness and fatigue took over to the point where many of us could barely stand.”Dr Bassam Miqdad, head of orthopaedic surgery at the European hospital in Gaza, was detained after being stopped at a military checkpoint and spent seven months in Israeli prisons.“There were Israeli nurses and doctors there but they wouldn’t even look at you,” he says. “I saw people with broken limbs and the guards would pull them around. They would ask, ‘where does it hurt?’ and then beat you on that injury.”Miqdad said he found it very difficult to recount the violence and humiliation he says he was subjected to in Israeli prisons.“It was not just the beatings [but] the way they treated us like we were not human,” he says. “In Nafha prison, they kept telling us to howl like dogs.”View image in fullscreenDr Bassam Miqdad: ‘I saw people with broken limbs and the guards would pull them around’Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a British-Palestinian associate professor of surgery, who volunteered as a doctor in Gaza during the early stages of the war, says the psychological impact of the “performative” nature of the humiliation and torture of senior medical staff in prisons is “beyond devastating”.“These are some of the most revered, most respected and senior members of their communities,” he says. “It is nothing short of a deliberate attempt to subjugate and violate the whole of Gazan society.”To date, two of Gaza’s most senior doctors have died in Israeli detention. Dr Iyad al-Rantisi, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Kamal Adwan hospital, died at Shikma prison.Dr Adnan al-Bursh, head of the orthopaedic department at al-Shifa hospital, died shortly after being transferred to Ofer prison in April 2024, with former detainees claiming that he died from torture and had suffered severe sexual violence in the hours before his death.Reports of torture, violence and psychological abuse of healthcare workers have been verified by the UN and published in reports by organisations such asHWW,Human Rights WatchandPhysicians for Human Rights Israel.In a HWW report from October 2024,healthcare workers who had been locked inside Israeli detention facilities gave testimonies of being electrocuted, hung by their arms from ceilings, being sexually assaulted and having their genitals mutilated.A doctor told the Guardian and ARIJ that he witnessed sexual assaults while in Israeli detention and tried to help treat a healthcare worker who had been raped by prison guards.“A prisoner … had a baton inserted into him,” said Dr Khaled Serr, a surgeon at Nasser hospital, who was detained in Israeli prisons for more than six months before being released without charge.“The assault was so violent that it caused severe muscle tears in his rectum. Even after his release, he continues to suffer. We performed multiple surgeries on him, but they have not been successful.”Three photos: one of smashed medical equipment; one of two tanks amid rubble; and one of a row of detainees, some with their hands tied behind their backs, in front of an Israeli soldier holding a light panel, illuminating them. Behind them hundreds of men are sitting in a large pit with at least 18 Israeli soldiers guarding them.Courtesy of Nir Debori/Channel 12, Muhannad al-Muqayed, Getty ImagesProf Nick Maynard, a senior surgical consultant at Oxford hospitals who worked in hospitals in Gaza during the war, said the arbitrary detention of hundreds of medical staff in Israeli prisons set a “chilling” precedent.“We have just witnessed a war in which hundreds of medical staff, including some of Gaza’s most experienced medical staff, are dragged away from their patients and thrown in prisons for months at a time and tortured with impunity in breach of the Geneva conventions and other humanitarian laws,” he says.“It is a deliberate attempt to terrorise, hollow out and disable an already depleted and traumatised healthcare workforce. It will have inevitably led to the deaths of many civilians,” the professor says.Before/after aerial shot of a hospital and the buildings around it, showing damage and areas bulldozedSatellite images from 9-20 December 2023 reveal earth berms erected to hinder movement to the hospital and provide cover for soldiers, roadblocks and military activities around it, which in effect prevented anyone from accessing the medical facility, or delivering medicine and food.Israel has defended its attacks on Gaza’s healthcare system by claiming hospitals were being used by Hamas as military command or operationcentres.Under international law, healthcare facilities can lose their protected status and become military targets if they are used for acts “harmful to the enemy”.The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said: “If these allegations were verified, this would raise serious concerns that Palestinian armed groups were using the presence of civilians to intentionally shield themselves from attack, which would amount to a war crime.A definition of a war crime (Cruel treatment and torture and outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment’) next to a line drawing of a topless man with his hands bound behind his back“However, insufficient information has so far been made available to substantiate these allegations, which have remained vague and broad, and in some cases appear contradicted by publicly available information.The Guardian put all the doctors’ allegations relating to their detention to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), which did not respond to the individual cases but provided a general statement in which it said it was “operating to restore security to the citizens of Israel, to bring home the hostages, and to achieve the objectives of the war while operating by international law.“During the fighting in the Gaza Strip, suspects of terrorist activities were arrested. The relevant suspects have been taken for further detention and questioning in Israel. Those who are not involved in terrorist activity are released back to the Gaza Strip as soon as possible.”The IDF says that it provides each detainee with clothing, a mattress, regular food and drink, and that they have access to medical care. It said that handcuffing of detainees occurs in accordance with IDF policies. It was aware of incidents where people had died in detention and that investigations were conducted for each of these deaths.“The IDF acts in accordance with Israeli and international law in order to protect the rights of the detainees held in the detention and questioning facilities,” it said.View image in fullscreenDr Hussam Abu Safiya. ‘We are deeply worried about his fate as he was already injured [when he was detained],’ says his sonFor the families of those doctors who have disappeared into detention, the absence of information about their loved ones is a daily agony.In December, the Israeli authorities faced international condemnation for the arrest of paediatricianHussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan hospital in Gaza’s Jabaliya refugee camp, who was last seen in Israeli drone footage in his white coat walking through the rubble of his hospital towards a line of Israeli tanks. His family say he was held in thenotorious Sde Teiman detention camp.

That was a mistake’Tim JonzeShe topped the charts, dropped the F-bomb on US TV, was ghosted by Jim Morrison and planned to spike Richard Nixon’s tea with LSD. Now 85, the legendary singer tells allTue 25 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 05.51 ESTShareRock’n’roll might not be advertised as being good for your health, but it’s worked out all right for Grace Slick. The former Jefferson Airplane singer is talking me through a life story that spans psychedelic drugs, free love, alcoholism, house fires and a high speed car crash. And yet, even at the age of 85, she sounds as perky, full of mischief and hilariously coarse as any interviewee I can remember.“Rock’n’roll people are spoiled brats,” she says at one point with a throaty cackle. “We don’t know anything about anything except having fun, how much money we can spend and who we can screw.”Slick may have done all of these things but she also helped to define the sound of the 60s. Does any other track sum up the trippy Summer of Love quite like her song White Rabbit, a hypnotic two and a half minutes stuffed with references to pills and mushrooms? That song cleverly evaded censors, taking hallucinogenic drug references into the homes of millions, but then Slick has always had a thing for breaking the rules. She was the first person to drop the F-bomb on US television, for instance, when the band performed their song We Can Be Together on the Dick Cavett show, complete with its rallying call “Up against the wall, motherfucker”.Yet the woman born Grace Barnett Wing has no idea where this rebellious streak came from. Her father was an investment banker, her mother looked after the home, and her upbringing in Illinois and then around parts of California was nothing out of the ordinary. She even attended Finch College, which she describes as a finishing school for young women in New York. A stable life had been mapped out for her. But there was something about that stifled 1950s way of living that just never appealed. “Don’t offend anybody, dress a certain way, get married, have children, stay at home and cook pies,” she snorts with disdain. “A whole bunch of women I knew at that time thought: ‘Don’t think so!’”It was a report in the San Francisco Chronicle that changed everything for Slick. She had been modelling clothes and wondering how to escape a normal life when she read about a band called Jefferson Airplane who were making waves in the city. Whatever it was that was going on, she wanted a part of it. And so, with her first husband, Jerry Slick, she formed a band called the Great Society. They soon got a gig supporting Airplane, and when that band’s singer Signe Toly Anderson left, they came calling for Slick to replace her.View image in fullscreen‘I was veryfriendlywith that band’ … Jefferson Airplane in 1968.Photograph: APWho wouldn’t have wanted Slick to front their band? That voice – deep, powerful, utterly captivating – still sounds like the unravelling of an era, when peace-loving hippy platitudes spun off towards something darker and more foreboding. Slick also brought stage presence to the group and, of course, two era-defining songs. Somebody to Love, a Great Society track written by her brother-in-law Darby, was transformed by Jefferson Airplane into a terrifying psych-rock stomper. As for White Rabbit, well, it was rock’n’roll, but not as anyone had heard it before. Slick grew up listening to classical music rather than Elvis, and her strange, Spanish-sounding march emerged from a love of Ravel’s Boléro.The lyrics, based on Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, shocked parents across the US. And they were supposed to – after all, they were writtenaboutthem and their slack parenting. “People kept saying: ‘Why do you young people use these chemicals now?’” she says. “Well, didn’t you notice the stories you were reading to us? Alice takes at least five different drugs in that book. Even Snow White was knocked out by some kind of chemical!”Today, Slick is speaking from her home in Malibu, Los Angeles. When the California wildfires broke out in January, she was all packed up and ready to leave for a hotel that had been booked, but it didn’t come to that. Still, Slick is no stranger to fires. In 2018, the Woolsey fire reached the outskirts of her property. At her previous home, a fire started by welders working on a gate nearby in 1993 was not so merciful – it destroyed her property and all Slick’s possessions, including her music memorabilia. The only thing left after the blaze, she says, was a ceramic white rabbit. They seem to have followed her around. Fans still send them. She paints them, too, these days. She remembers one riotous gig in the 1970s when a fan put a live rabbit on stage.“We were worried because what do you do?” she says. “We actually took it home. I remember it had one ear that wasn’t working, it didn’t stick up like rabbit’s ears do. And, oddly enough, he liked marijuana seeds. So not only were we loaded, but the rabbit was loaded too!”What happened to the rabbit?“We might have given him to one of the members of the band who had a child … I don’t know. We didn’tkill himor anything.”Slick’s stories are often quite like the lyrics in White Rabbit – populated by all kinds of weird and wonderful characters and events. In her 1998 autobiography she recalls an encounter with the Doors’ Jim Morrison in which he was on all fours howling like a dog.View image in fullscreen‘Don’t offend anybody, dress a certain way, get married, have children, stay at home and cook pies. Don’t think so!’ Slick performing in 1970.Photograph: Robert Altman/Getty Images“No, it was more like a wolf,” she corrects me, as if that makes it perfectly understandable. “He was howling at the moon. But that was not unusual for Jim.”It must have made an impression on Slick because, sometime later while on tour with the Doors, she found herself building up the courage to knock on Morrison’s hotel door. What followed was a session of smearing strawberries all over the room and a sexual encounter Slick describes as “like making love to a floating art form with eyes”. That might sound almost spiritual if not for her added acknowledgment: “He was a well-built boy … his cock was slightly larger than average.”“I was kind of disappointed he never called back,” says Slick today with a laugh. “But, apparently I wasn’t his style.” She reminisces about the Morrison she knew. “You could talk to him, but it wasn’t a conversation. You’d say something about amplifiers and he would reply with something about the colours that happen on a car if you don’t put primer on it. You’d go, ‘How the hell did he come up with that?’”The Morrison ghosting aside, Slick doesn’t have many regrets from this period. The band performed at the Monterey pop festival, a “wet” Woodstock (in which their evening set was so delayed they didn’t emerge on stage until the following morning after a night spent taking cocaine) and Altamont. They also performed a rooftop gig in New York two months before the Beatles had the same idea of doing it in London – and for extra bonus points, had it filmed by Jean-Luc Godard. “The city had never seen anything like that,” Slick recalls. “Everybody leaning out of their windows to see what was going on. The cops finally came and shut us down, but we knew that was going to happen. We got several songs in before they got there.”Did she get a kick out of being naughty?“I don’t know if naughty is the word,” she says, before adding with another guffaw: “Illegalis probably a better term.”Had her plan to spike Richard Nixon’s tea ever come to fruition, it certainly would have been illegal. In 1970 she received an invitation to meet the president at the White House – she knew his daughter Tricia from her time at Finch – and arrived with about 600 micrograms of LSD in her pocket. Nixon never got to experience the fourth dimension. At the door, security were alerted to the fact that the respectable-sounding Ms Barnett Wing was actually Grace Slick, a radical rock’n’roller and security risk, and she was barred from the event.Slick could be reckless, and when she began drinking heavily in the 70s the bad behaviour soured into something bleaker. She would heckle fans and, during one tour of Germany, ended up sticking her fingers up the nose of an audience member. Off stage, she would get behind the wheel of a car while inebriated. Once in 1971 she found herself caught up in a road race with the band’s lead guitarist Jorma Kaukonen, and hit a concrete wall at 80mph. “Very stupid of me,” she says. “That road was known as ‘deadly Doyle Drive’ for a reason. There was grease on it. And when you hit that grease, you start sliding.”View image in fullscreen‘I was trying to make it up to the band because I’d been this wild drunk’ … Slick in 1980.Photograph: Roger Ressmeyer/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesSlick was fortunate. The concrete wall ended up more damaged than she did. “I was lucky,” she says.Slick was seeing Kaukonen for some time – and if you look into the great loves of her life, they almost all seem to have one thing in common: being in her band. Jerry Slick, Jack Casady, Spencer Dryden, Paul Kantner. As she puts it herself: “Yeah, I was veryfriendlywith that band.”She lets out another snort of laughter. “I learned that phrase from another guy I lived with for a while. He referred to women you could sleep with as being ‘friendly’ and I thought: ‘Well that’s a sweet way of putting it.’ So I was ‘friendly’ with everybody in the band except Marty [Balin]. But, if he had come on to me, I would have gone for Marty, too.”She had a child with Kantner, a daughter they named China. Slick was determined to be an “alternative mum”, taking her on tour, showing her the world, and it worked out.“She is just an amazing person,” says Slick proudly. “We’ve had our ups and downs, but she has kept on working on herself.” China had a successful career acting in television and films but these days is a non-denominational chaplain, working in hospitals with people who are dying or in distress. “She also has a real nasty sense of humour,” says Slick, perhaps even more proudly. Like mother, like daughter, I guess.There were other things Slick shared with her daughter, such as a fondness for alcohol. When Slick entered rehab in the late 1990s, China would visit her. Then she surprised the staff by checking herself in, too. They have both been sober ever since. “I was a periodic drunk which means I didn’t drink every day,” says Slick. “I wouldn’t have any for a month and then I would get loaded on a weekend and get arrested and all that kind of stuff.” She has described her various arrests as TUIs – talking under the influence. Once she even waved an unloaded gun at a cop. “I had to go to rehab to learn, look, you can’t do this any more because you turn into an asshole.”There were plenty of sober times as well. In the 1980s, after Jefferson Airplane had mutated into Jefferson Starship and then simply Starship, she scored several No 1 hits in the US with 1985’s We Built This City, Sara, and 1987’s Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now. Although still in her mid-to-late 40s, these hits made her, at the time, the oldest female chart topper in history (a record held until Cher’s Believe in 1998). Slick didn’t particularly like this fact. She felt uncomfortable up on stage singing in her 40s – to her, rock’n’roll was a young person’s game. And shehatedthe songs, which were no longer the creative product of the band members themselves but written by external hit-makers for them to perform.“I thought they were ridiculous,” she says. “There isn’t a city built on rock’n’roll! Los Angeles was built on oil and oranges and the movie business.” The lyrics were written by Elton John’s longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin. “He’s British, and London obviously isn’t built on rock’n’roll. Stupid song. But our producer said, ‘Yeah, but it’s a hit.’ And he was right.” She starts listing some of the later songs of her career, mocking the lyrics and then delivering a long snoring noise. But if she hated the songs so much, why sing them?View image in fullscreenGrace Slick today.“I kind of had to because I was trying to make it up to the band,” she says. “I’d been this wild, crazy-ass drunk. So to make up for it I was sober all through the 80s … which was a mistake.” Another cackle of laughter.Since the mid-90s, Slick has turned to painting – mainly commercial works inspired by the counterculture through which she lived. On her website there are prints to buy of a topless Morrison, a hookah-smoking caterpillar and a trippy version of Monterey complete with white rabbit attenders. Does she paint every day?“No, I will paint for a couple of months straight, all day, all night. Then I stop for a while to regenerate. Now, I am writing a lot of lyrics instead. I can’t stop. It’s a habit that’s harder to break than alcohol.”She reads me a recent one: “I put the glory on you like a paper doll / You took it and wore it with no problem at all / So you took my heart and I took the fall / It took me years to see my mistake / The Prince Charming story was all a fake / You were just in it for all you could take / Paper doll.”Slick plans to record some punk songs in a band she recently formed with her son-in-law. “He’s right up my alley because he’s as gross as I am,” she laughs. “We thought, nobody ever talks about bodily functions, so we’re doing a song called Yankin’ Boogers and Blowin’ Gas (Everybody’s got a Nose and an Ass). And there’s another one called Hernias and Hot Flashes.”She’s cackling again, aware that being an 85-year-old punk singer is probably another rule she’s about to break. “Yeah,” she says, “it’ll be interesting to see what kind of repercussions I get from that.”Explore more on these topicsMusicArtPaintingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The main source of this information is on the open web, which contains a vast array of data from the contents of Wikipedia to newspaper articles andonline book archives.Creative professionals and industries including authors, artists and newspaper publishers are demanding compensation for the use of their work to build those models – and for the practice to stop until they have granted permission. They also argue that their work is being taken off them for free in order to build AI tools that create works in direct competition with their own.What are the UK government proposals?The government’s preferred option in a consultation is toallow AI companies to train the models on copyrighted workby giving them an exception for “text and data mining”. However, under the proposals creatives would be able to opt out of the mining process through what ministers are calling a “rights reservation” system. The opt-out proposal has met with scepticism from opponents of the government consultation, who say there is no evidence of a “water-tight” rights reservation process in any country.The government says that AI firms like OpenAI already allow news publishers to block web crawlers from accessing their content.The consultation also proposes measures that require transparency from AI developers on what content they have used to train their models.The proposals are similar to those in the EU AI Act, which also includes an opt-out option. However, the act’s provisions havecome in for criticismfrom an architect of EU copyright law.What do the creative industries say about the proposals?Critics of the consultation, such as Beeban Kidron, a crossbench peer in the House of Lords and a film-maker, say that copyright lawdoes not need changingbecause it already does what it sets out to do: to stop someone’s work being used without permission.They also argue that the opt-out option is unfair because it puts a burden on artists who might not realise such a provision exists and could also be difficult to implement for emerging artists. They also claim it is unworkable because keeping track of the distribution of their content across the internet is impossible.According to the government, creative industries areworth £126bn to the UK economyand employ 2.4 million people.What do tech firms say?OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has admitted that it would be“impossible” to train AI models without using copyrighted material. AI companies’ defence of using copyrighted material leans on the US legal doctrine of “fair use”, which allows use of content in certain circumstances without seeking the owner’s permission.TechUK, a trade body representing tech firms, says current “uncertainty” over AI and copyright law is holding back development and use of the technology – including in the creative industries. The UK government also argues that copyright law is now “not tenable”, a situation reflected by a proliferation oflegal disputesover the issue.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Intellectual propertyComputingChatGPTKate BushexplainersShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Howard AmosAt the rural orphanage where I volunteered, the place resembled a Dickensian workhouse. The staff’s main tools were antipsychotics and violence. The experience gave me a window into Putin’s RussiaByHoward AmosTue 25 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 06.33 ESTShareIn the summer of 2007, I joined a group of 30 Russian and English students to work on a month-long summer camp at a state orphanage for mentally and physically disabled children in the Pskov region, south of St Petersburg. We lived in a house nearby, or in tents pitched in the garden. Every day, we walked up to the orphanage to put on developmental activities, sporting events, solve puzzles, play games, stage shows and go on camping trips.I volunteered at the orphanage, in the village of Belskoye Ustye, for almost a decade, but it was the first visit that made the biggest impression. I had seen nothing like it. My closest reference point was probably workhouses or orphanages from a Charles Dickens novel. I vividly remember the smells – cooked food, unwashed bodies, chlorine and urine – and how the children crowded you, grabbing hands and clothes, pinching, pulling hair, jostling and asking questions. Dressed in an odd collection of what seemed to be adult castoffs, the kids spent most of their waking hours in rooms furnished with just a few scuffed tables and chairs, a bookcase and television. At night, and for long periods during the day, cast-iron metal grilles across corridors were locked, confining the older teenagers to their dormitories at one end.Childrenvulnerable to self-harm were tied up.The children at the orphanage ranged from young girls aged five or six with their hair in bunches, to muscled teenage boys who would hang around outside and smoke. As well as learning disabilities, many of them had other conditions, which – we were told – ranged from cerebral palsy to autism. Some had difficulty walking, a few did not speak, and there were a couple of wheelchair users. Their extreme isolation and patchy education meant that, in their heads, illusion mixed with reality. They had an odd, sometimes surprising, collection of skills and knowledge. There were some who could sing, dance or weave.For me, as a British student, the orphanage was where Russia started. It was a life-changing experience, and I returned for summer camp several years in a row. I lived near the orphanage for a year before moving to Moscow in 2010 to become a journalist. As a reporter in the Russian capital, I covered everything from inflation data to oil pipeline corruption, illegal logging, opposition rallies and political assassinations. But I often found myself turning to the people and places I knew in Pskov to answer questions from friends and editors about life in Russia.View image in fullscreenInside the Belskoye Ustye orphanage.Photograph: Howard AmosOn a map, the region nestles like a kidney below St Petersburg, with its western edge alongside Estonia, Latvia and Belarus. Then, as now, Pskov was a prism that reflected unfamiliar and uncomfortable truths. Pskov is one of the poorest regions of Russia, with little industry or agriculture. It often tops national ratings of depopulation, death rates, disease and poverty.AfterVladimir Putinlaunched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, my Russian wife and I joined hundreds of thousands of Russians who left the country at short notice. We spent almost two years living in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia. Even watching from a distance, the horror and shame we felt at Russia’s actions was intense. Since the start of the fighting, most observers of Russia have, understandably, found it almost impossible to see much further than the terrible, daily violence in Ukraine. Looking for answers, I found myself returning to the towns, villages and hamlets of Pskov.The children who ended up in Belskoye Ustye came from all corners of the Pskov region. While they were referred to as “orphans”, the disturbing fact was that they were actually what was known as “social orphans” – in other words most had living relatives. Either they had been removed from their homes by social services or they’d been abandoned, perhaps at birth, their poverty-stricken parents persuaded they would have a better life in a well-provisioned state institution. Often the children would tell you about mothers and fathers intending to come and take them home, but visits from relatives were very rare.Everything about the orphanage was highly regulated, from strict daily timetables to the hierarchies among staff and children. And the more time I spent there, the more these power structures revealed themselves. When it came to keeping order, violence underpinned everything.The first few years I went there, lots of children had disabilities that were not serious enough – according to the official classifications – for them to have been placed in this “type” of orphanage. Likely shunted down the system as a result of bad behaviour, these teenagers, physically stronger and intellectually more able than most of the others, controlled everything and everyone. The hierarchy was best – and most frustratingly – illustrated by some of the games we tried to play. When kicking around a football, for example, the weaker children would simply pass to the stronger children, no matter which side they were on.I never saw any of the staff physically harm the children, apart from the occasional cuff or flick on the head. But they were careful in front of volunteers, and there was no mistaking what lurked under the surface. How could it be otherwise when so many children spent so many hours crammed into a relatively small space? I came to understand that, rather than inflicting violence themselves, the staff manipulated the older and stronger children to keep order. When Ksenia, an 11-year-old girl, bit one of the care workers, an older girl punched her so hard in the face that a dentist had to extract the remains of her front teeth. For years afterwards, a warning to those who knew, Ksenia went around with a black hole in her smile.View image in fullscreenA resident at the orphanage in 2007.Photograph: Howard AmosOther forms of violence were less obvious, but no less powerful. Misbehaving children, those who ran away or who were difficult to control, were sent to the regional psychiatric hospital, Bogdanovo, a place that inspired a mixture of horror and curiosity. Even more sinister was the concoction of pills taken by most children, who queued up after mealtimes outside the nurse’s office. Each child would get a small plastic cup with their pills and, while we had no idea what they were taking (nor did they), we did see the results. Some would sleep for long periods, others continued to function, albeit in slow motion. I remember one young boy, Sasha, usually hyperactive, who, when sedated, would take an age to do a basic drawing, the drool slipping out of his mouth and dripping on to the paper.Among the treatments prescribed in Belskoye Ustye was the antipsychotic drug Aminazin (Chlorpromazine in the west), which was discovered in the 1950s and remains widely used. It’s difficult to know whether the children were given appropriate amounts of Aminazin, or whether it was overused as a means of control. Adults who have been prescribed Aminazin in Russian psychiatric institutions describe how it turns the whole world grey, draining your will to live and making you want to cry. In the 1970s it was one of the drugs Soviet doctors used on imprisoned dissidents subjected to punitive psychiatry.There were televisions in almost every room in the orphanage, and they were left on most of the time. Some of the children absorbed messages about Putin’s might, Russia’s greatness and nostalgia for the Soviet past – but what they really enjoyed were soap operas. Favourites included the American series Santa Barbara, the Brazilian hit The Cloneand Mexico’s The Rich Also Cry. Plot twists were a constant topic of discussion not just in the orphanage but also among locals. The soap opera of the moment was a Russian series, Karmelita: Gypsy Passion, about the love lives and disputes of a group of travellers. The effect on the orphanage children when the Karmelitatheme music came on was instantaneous and dramatic: they would rush for their chairs, some beginning to rock violently.The children’s rocking was one of the most disturbing sights I saw in the orphanage. Standing or sitting, the kids would rhythmically move their upper body backward and forward. Lying in bed at night, they would rock side to side, as if in a cradle. Some rocked so fast that sweat formed on their brows and ran into their eyes. Others only did it when they watched television or listened to the radio. Instinctively, I understood it as a sign of severe emotional deprivation; a comfort mechanism to assuage upset or anger. But it was also a way to pass the time. At discos, groups of kids would cluster around the speakers and rock back and forth in a distressing, zombie dance routine.The children were all assigned a diagnosis according to Russia’s complex system of classification of intellectual disability. When I first visited, only a small number received any education. However, in the late 2000s, a school was opened amid pressure from charities. During term time, teachers would be bussed in every morning from the nearest town to conduct lessons – a professional challenge for which few, if any, were properly trained.One evening in June 2010 a member of the orphanage staff called me to say that Sasha, the hyperactive boy, had drowned in a pond a dozen metres from the orphanage’s walls. Just 11 years old, Sasha was one of the most likable in his group. Usually dressed in a tweed jacket and floppy sun hat, he insisted on putting everything in his mouth, and could be wickedly mischievous. Nobody knows how he ended up in the water that afternoon: perhaps he had been particularly heavily sedated. A few of the children were suddenly missing near the pond. When the care workers realised what was happening it was already too late. Several of them jumped into the muddy pond, desperately feeling with their feet for bodies. In total, three children were pulled out. One girl was in shock, but breathing. Another girl had to be resuscitated. Sasha was dead.In the Orthodox tradition, burials take place within three days of death. So, three days later, I found myself among a small group of people standing outside the Belskoye Ustye cemetery next to the ruins of the Church of the Holy Ascension. I had been in two minds about whether to attend, unsure about whether I would be intruding. But I needn’t have worried. In fact, I had taught regular classes for Sasha’s group and realised I probably knew him better than many of the others in attendance.View image in fullscreenVolunteers at the orphanage walk in front of the nearby Church of the Holy Ascension.Photograph: Howard AmosIt was an unbearably sad occasion, and the bleakest part was how mourners conducted themselves. All told, there were about 30 people there: no family members, just an assorted mix of orphanage staff and charity workers. The older men who held the most senior positions in the orphanage were visibly bored, eager to draw a line under the embarrassing affair. A couple of the care workers who had worked with Sasha were upset, their faces stained by tears. But nobody laid a comforting hand on anyone’s shoulder; there were no hugs. Everyone was at work. There were no speeches: no one knew enough about Sasha to be able to talk about his personality. Afterwards there was a criminal investigation, and the care workers in charge on the day were fired, but the orphanage routines resumed quickly.Entertaining the kids required concentration and ingenuity. The children were fascinated by the volunteers, with their unfamiliar, outlandish clothes, mobile phones and stories of faraway places. Most kids did not understand the idea of different countries, or different languages, and all the volunteers were referred to as “Muscovites”.One of the tragedies of institutional life is that it is almost impossible to form deep attachments – staff are hired and fired, and even other residents can be there one day and gone the next. All the children were accustomed to these fleeting relationships. Of course, volunteers were part of this problem. But many also became convinced of the need to do something –anything– to help break the vicious cycle of institutionalisation. The unrealised potential of the children seemed so clear. Taking part in summer camp could be revelatory – it was for me – and there were volunteers who went on to found charities or children’s villages, become speech therapists or teachers. For some, it became an obsession and a life’s mission – before the inevitable burnout, and accompanying guilt.The more time I spent at Belskoye Ustye, the more I learned. But much remained shrouded in silence, particularly for outsiders. One year, a volunteer friend and I learned that a girl who had been in the group of kids with whom we had worked was pregnant.The orphanage’s contradictions became starker over time. I learned that the monthly cost of looking after a child was a huge amount for rural Pskov – far, far higher than any benefits you could access as the parent of a child with learning disabilities. In addition, the orphanage employed almost twice the number of staff – from care workers and cleaners to accountants, drivers and cooks – as it had children, yet each child was starved of individual attention. In perhaps one of the saddest examples, all the children with birthdays in a given month were given a joint party on the same day.Often the reaction of inexperienced volunteers to encountering the orphanage was bafflement: why hadn’t this place been shut down and the kids transferred to family-based care? It seemed so obvious. This was also my reaction. I still believe any change needs to be focused on this goal, but I now also understand how powerful are the forces shoring up the status quo. When I worked at Belskoye Ustye, it was clear how important the orphanage was to the battered local economy. A friend from Baranovo recounted how his nightwatchman shifts in the 1990s had been a financial lifeline for himself and his wife. There were lots of women living in Belskoye Ustye and the surrounding villages who worked there as cleaners and care workers. Monthly salaries were a rare commodity in a place where public facilities – schools, libraries and post offices – had been shut down, farming was in the doldrums, and most people survived on state pensions or benefits. There were also other unofficial perks: it was not uncommon, for example, to see orphanage children helping staff who lived nearby with gardening, or other household chores.View image in fullscreenA concert put on by residents of the orphanage in 2010 to mark the 65th anniversary of the end of the second world war.Photograph: Howard AmosThe orphanage is part of a huge system of state institutions all over Russia. Most of those who grew up in Belskoye Ustye when I first volunteered there were far too institutionalised – illiterate, unable to cook or take care of themselves – to have any chance of living independently, or even quasi-independently. When they turned 18, they were dispatched to places known as “adult institutions” where they would spend the rest of their lives.There was no farewell ceremony for children when they left the orphanage. Everything was designed to minimise disruption and – as leaving was a moment when feelings were liable to run high – it was carefully managed. In the case of Vera, a young woman whose last days at the orphanage I witnessed, she understood she would soon be on her way to a new home – she was unexpectedly taken shopping in the local town, returning with a holdall of new clothes. But the exact day of departure was not settled until the last moment and, like most of the staff and children, I never got to say goodbye. One day when I turned up for a class, she was simply gone. She’d been whisked away early that morning, and driven the two hours to an adult institution. Just like after Sasha’s death, the hole created by Vera’s departure quickly closed: her favourite clothes redistributed among the other children; her name removed from the dormitory door.Among volunteers, it was common to make the orphanage administration into bogeymen. But this was usually unfair. Over the years, I got to know some of the men and women who ran the orphanage, and I slowly realised that they looked at things very differently to volunteers like me. For them, the priority was keeping the children alive: fed, clothed and warm in winter. As civil servants, they were skilled in keeping their bosses in Pskov on side, and finding resources to maintain buildings, run buses, service boilers and ensure food on plates. While most of them were not, in my experience, unkind, they seemed to have little knowledge about the complex needs of those with severe learning disabilities. The director of the orphanage when I first arrived was a jocular man with a mouthful of gold teeth who had a background in the metals industry. A few years later, he was replaced by a bustling and efficient woman from St Petersburg whose career up until then had been in the hospitality sector.Most of the orphanage staff were deeply wary of me and other volunteers. At best, volunteers were quietly tolerated; at worst, staff waged a low-intensity campaign of obstruction. Their hostility was easy to understand: most volunteers were inexperienced, condescending, quick to judge, and inclined to righteousness. We spent only a few hours a day with the children and saw only a part of the picture. However, this hostility could manifest itself in dangerous ways. The orphanage rumour mill could be set abuzz with the “news” that one or another volunteer was a paedophile, or planning to steal children to harvest their organs.The presence of foreigners always aroused particular interest and suspicion. One year the local head of the FSB dispatched a state TV crew with a list of pre-approved questions to our summer camp. Later the same day, two police officers turned up to find out who exactly was volunteering. We took it as a warning.At the same time, the orphanage staff had impossible jobs. The system made it so. They had no way to provide the children with what they needed; not even close. Many had no formal training in how to work with young people with learning disabilities, and as the children were almost always kept in groups, it meant almost all their time and energy was spent on discipline.The staff closest to the children were the care workers who supervised groups (mostly containing between five and 15 children). These women – they were almost all women – worked a 24-hour shift one day in three. They were the closest thing the children had to parents and sometimes formed close attachments (there were some cases when these women adopted children from the orphanage). But others maintained a distance. I witnessed once or twice how local care workers on their days off would hurry past “their group” if they encountered them in the village, barely saying hello.Most were indifferent, disengaged and burnt out by a job they couldn’t afford to leave, but they were generally not unkind. Against all the odds, there were always a few who were young enough, resilient enough or gifted with enough intuition to be able to inject empathy and fun into their work. Inevitably, they were adored by volunteers and children alike.Over more than a decade of travelling to the orphanage and working for a children’s charity in Moscow, my attitude slowly evolved. Like most of the other volunteers, I was naive at first. When one British social-care expert, a friend of a friend, told me he believed categorically that any cooperation with orphanages was morally wrong, it brought me up short, embarrassed at how I was out of my depth. Family-based care, he argued, was the solution, and any venture – be it a summer camp or a children’s village – was only entrenching a system that needed to be destroyed. I told myself his position was a terrible abandonment of the tens of thousands already trapped within that system, as well as a misunderstanding of how reform comes about. But it was hard to dispute the logic.I tended to see summer camp as a sort of carnival in which rules could be broken, timetables upended and traditions tested – a breath of fresh air for the children; a glimpse of different ways of thinking for staff; and a potentially momentous experience for volunteers. But the longer it went on, the more it became a part of the furniture; just another addendum to the system it was supposed to subvert.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Howard AmosIn the first few years when I volunteered at the Belskoye Ustye orphanage, little money had trickled down despite Russia’s oil-fuelled economic boom of the 2000s. But this gradually changed as the state got wealthier, standards of living rose in major cities, and a culture of charities, donations and volunteering became more mainstream. An enterprising and ambitious director – the one who had come from the hospitality sector – did much to unlock funding. Gradually, the children got new clothes, the orphanage buildings were repaired, the iron grilles on corridors were taken down, the once-pervasive smell of urine faded, and welcome additions such as wheelchair lifts and a kitchen for the teenagers were installed. Kids were allowed to choose their own haircuts, and given a bit more personal space. A few years ago, the charity that organised the summer camp even won a grant from Uefa to build an AstroTurf football pitch on the floodplain below the orphanage.The business of voluntourism: do western do-gooders actually do harm?Read moreThese days, the dormitories are smaller, and the children very rarely display the once-ubiquitous rocking behaviour. Violence is less common. Some of the children are still sent to adult institutions when they turn 18, but this is the exception rather than the rule. Instead, the director has overseen the construction of two houses in a nearby village where older children are transferred. Here, they can attend workshops to learn skills such as carpentry, or are given manual jobs in the orphanage kitchens, or as cleaners. They spend the rest of their time looking after enormous vegetable gardens, cooking, cleaning and, of course, watching television.At the same time, the money has done nothing to change the essence of the orphanage, which is still a part of a largely unreformed system of hundreds of such institutions all over Russia. The children are still alone, deprived of the individual attention that they all need and deserve. If one of them were to die, his or her funeral would be better funded, perhaps better attended, but just as heartbreaking as that of Sasha on that sunny afternoon.This is an edited extract from Russia Starts Here: Real Lives in the Ruins of Empire, published by Bloomsbury on 27 February.Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.RussiaStarts Hereby Howard Amos (Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, £20).

Since the second world war, the UK and the US have considered themselves the closest allies, working together for shared values, with any resentments, differences of opinion or cross words kept to private channels.But nowDonald Trumpis back and he seems keen to throw the usual world order of alliances and enmities into chaos. Keir Starmer’s first meeting with the US president comes at a crucial juncture for Europe, with the future of Ukraine in the balance. “The stakes at the moment could not be higher,” says the Guardian’s diplomatic editor,Patrick Wintour.He tells Michael Safi what advice Starmer should be receiving from his advisers, including to keep things simple and not to be boring. And what Starmer will be trying to achieve, especially in terms of clarifying Trump’s recent outpourings around Ukraine. “I think the key thing to find out is where does this man lie ideologically,” Patrick says. But if Trump has no allies, only transactional relationships, how much can Starmer hope to achieve during this meeting?Composite: PA/Getty imagesExplore more on these topicsForeign policyToday in FocusUS foreign policyKeir StarmerDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politics"

More than 100 femicides were documented in 2024.This month, Emrich Effanga, a hairstylist in the southern town of Uyo, was strangled, allegedly by her boyfriend, an usher in their church. Just weeks before, Mutiat Sholola died, allegedly afterher husband stabbed herin the head and attacked her with hot oil in Owode Egba, a few hours outside Lagos. Both men have been arrested.“Apparently as the trend is globally, home is also the most dangerous place for Nigerian women and girls,” said Ololade Ajayi, the founder of DOHS. “Perpetrators operate with impunity because there’s hardly appropriate consequences for this crime.”Home is the most dangerous place for women, says global femicide reportRead moreWomen’s rights groups and activists blame misogynistic content online for the violence, saying lax legislation and prosecution in Africa’s most populous country has provided an enabling environment.Some such as Chioma Agwuegbo, the executive director of the Abuja-based TechHerNG, which focuses on digital inclusion and gender equality, say available data is far from an accurate picture.“Unfortunately, whatever numbers are quoted by civil society organisations are a microcosm of the violence women and girls are experiencing because of poor inter-agency documentation and a lack of trust in the system,” she said. “Government agencies launched dashboards with aplomb and fanfare, so where are the numbers? The femicide numbers we see are only the cases that have made it online – we are actually in a state of emergency.”DOHS Cares, which is organising a protest march at a court trial of another victim, submitted a draft bill to parliament to tackle femicide last year.“It has been largely ignored,” said Ajayi.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It remains unclear how many of the perpetrators in those cases have been prosecuted.“That committee didn’t meet more than twice,” said Agwuegbo, who set up the movement after Vera Uwaila Omozuwa, a 22-year-old student, wasraped and killedin her church in Benin City a few months earlier. “What’s craziest is the [alleged] rapists/murderers [in the Omozuwa case] were caught and remanded … During the jailbreak in Edo state [in October 2020], the men were among those who escaped.”Explore more on these topicsNigeriaFemicideViolence against women and girlsAfricaWomennewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities at Santiago international airport said terminals had switched to emergency power to keep flights operating as usual.Explore more on these topicsChileAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

An NSF spokesman declined comment on reports that hundreds more layoffs were possible and that the agency’s budget could be slashed by billions.US scientists feeling ‘stress and fear’ as sweeping Trump orders hit fundingRead moreThe ex-officials want Congress to provide at least $16bn authorized for the NSF in fiscal year 2025, according to a letter seen by Reuters addressed to Trump, John Thune, the Senate majority leader, and Mike Johnson, speaker of the US House of Representatives.“China is making significant strategic investments in basic and applied research and positioning the country to outpace us in critical areas that could determine the outcome of future conflicts,” the letter said. “This is a race that we cannot afford to lose.”The former officials singled out support for the NSF’s Technology, Innovation and Partnerships Directorate (TIP) established in 2022, which they see as crucial to transforming research into practical applications vital to US military capabilities and economic strength.Twenty-one people, or more than 20% of TIP staff, were fired last week, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Nearly 20% more are vulnerable temporary federal employees, said another source, who was not authorized to speak publicly.China led the world in just three of 64 critical technologies between 2003 and 2007, the letter said, citing the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. As of 2023, it leads in 57 of those technologies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

He said that on 22 February the cargo ship was detected stopping “very close” to the Penghu cable, off the coast of the city of Tainan. Coastguard vessels were sent to the site at about 2.30am on Tuesday, which noticed that the cargo ship had dropped anchor. It started to move north-west about half an hour before Chunghwa Telecom reported the cable had been cut, the spokesperson said.The vessel did not respond to attempts by the authorities to communicate with it by speaker and radio, the coastguard told the Guardian.It was then intercepted and escorted back to Anping port shortly after midday. Footage provided by the coastguard shows several officers boarding the cargo ship.The ship is registered under a Togolese flag, but Taiwan’s coastguard said that was probably a flag of convenience and all eight crew onboard were Chinese nationals. Ownership of the cargo ship is unclear – tracking and registration data shows at least three different ship names associated with the vessel’s maritime identification number. The coastguard said the vessel was “China-funded” but did not elaborate.Taiwan has drawn up a list of more than 50 ships for close monitoring, which it believes are sailing under flags of convenience, including from Togo, but are owned by Chinese companies. The list, first reported by theFinancial Timesand since confirmed by the Guardian, includes boats that have lingered in or near Taiwan’s territorial waters for significant amounts of time.Chunghwa said a back-up cable had come online and communication was not affected.It is the latestundersea cable to be damagedaround Taiwan in recent years. In January, the Taiwanese authorities investigated a Chinese-owned, Cameroon-registered vessel, Shunxing 39, which was suspected of dragging its anchor and damaging a cable north-east of the island that ran to the US.Taiwan’s coastguard had ordered the vessel to return to Taiwanese waters for investigation but was unable to board due to rough weather. The Shunxing 39 then sailed to South Korea.In February 2023, damage to two cables near the outlying Matsu islands, close to the Chinese mainland,left residents without internet access for weeks. Two Chinese ships were blamed for cutting the cables in two incidents almost a week apart. However, the government stopped short of calling it a deliberate act on behalf of Beijing.Explore more on these topicsTaiwanChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Throughout his career he took on projects like the election guide, which he has written as handbooks since 1990 and would now give to the National Library.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To date, the song has racked up more than 60m digital streams and 1bn views across all platforms.Zambotto told Guardian Australia when he got the Eurovision news he initially thought it was a prank. “I was like ‘Where’s Ashton Kutcher?’, he said, adding: “I love music and singing – to be representing a country for doing what I love? There’s no better feeling.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe 29-year-old grew up in the small town of Manjimup, Western Australia, on a self-sustained, off-grid property built from recycled materials with no running water, electricity or phone reception.“It was very isolated, away from society,” he says. “So I learned how to think and be creative in a very individual way. When it came to me going to school, I was introduced into society a lot more and I felt quite like an outsider. Over the years, I learned to be comfortable with who I am, and I learned that people really appreciated it.”As Go-Jo, Zambotto has cultivated a massive fanbase online, posting high-energy clips of himself busking and interacting with members of the public. Mrs Hollywood’s success was fuelled by clips of him inviting passersby to join him for an impromptu guitar solo.For Eurovision, Go-Jo will perform a new song titled Milkshake Man, written in collaboration with Australian pop band Sheppard, in which he invites the audience to “Come and take a sip from my special cup / I’ve heard that you could use a little pick-me-up. / What can get you high when you’re oh so sad? / It’s the milk from the milkshake man.” He goes on to boast about his flavours, which include chocolate, vanilla, creme brulee and “a caramel banana you have got to see”.Zambotto hopes Milkshake Man will be a “motivational push” for audiences: “Through the lyrics and the story of the song, I hope to inspire people to feel like the most colourful version of themselves and feel confident.” As he sings, “The shake is not a drink it’s a state of mind / it’s the secrets of the power you were born to find.”Paul Clarke, Australia’s creative director for this year’s Eurovision contest, which will be held in Basel, Switzerland in May, described Zambotto as having “a unique connection with audiences”, adding: “We know he’ll get a lot of love from the Eurovision community.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Bucharest court of appeal approved his extradition request on Sunday.An official at Romania’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the legal case was still ongoing, confirmed to The Associated Press that Amra was handed over to French authorities for extradition on Tuesday at an airport near Bucharest, where he arrived in handcuffs, flanked by armed police officers.Upon arrival inFrance, he was taken to the main Paris courthouse, the Paris prosecutor’s office said. He will be ordered to carry out the sentence he escaped last year, for burglary, and also face charges in other cases, including murder, attempted murder and escaping from custody.The high-profile search for Amra began last May when armed assailants ambushed a prison convoy in Normandy,killing two guards and seriously wounding three others in the process of aiding his escape.Amra fled after being sentenced for burglary in the Normandy town of Évreux. He was also under investigation for an attempted organised homicide and a kidnapping that resulted in death, French prosecutors said.The international police organisation Interpol issued a notice for his arrest, while French investigators alerted counterparts in other countries after they suspected Amra had left France.After Amra’s arrest on Saturday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, hailed his capture as a “formidable success” and praised European colleagues who had ended the long cross-border hunt.Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau has said that Amra had connections with Marseille’s organised crime syndicates and was suspected of heading a drug trafficking network.As of Monday night, 25 people had been detained in multiple countries suspected of some role in his escape or in the aftermath, the Paris prosecutor said.Explore more on these topicsFranceRomaniaEuropeOrganised crimenewsShareReuse this content"

He insisted he had been simply “parodying” online leftwingers.Krah’s resignation followed pressure by other far-right parties, including Marine Le Pen’s Rassemblement National, Italy’s Lega and the Danish People’s party.The controversy sparked by his remarks – as well as by the arrest of one of his adviserson suspicion of spyingfor China – led to him being suspended from the European election campaign by the AfD leadership.It also prompted the AfD’s expulsion from the now defunct Identity and Democracy group in the European parliament, with Le Pen saying it was necessary to create “acordon sanitaire” between the AfD and other parties.The AfD, working with far-right parties from seven other EU countries,founded a new parliamentary group, Europe of Sovereign Nations, in the European parliament.At the time Krah said on X: “I recognise that truthful and nuanced statements made by me are being misused as a pretext to damage our party.”View image in fullscreenMatthias Helferich at the 21st conference of the Alternative für Deutschland party, in Marl, Germany, on 24 February 2024.Photograph: Thomas Banneyer/Dpa Picture Alliance via AlamyKrah and Helferich are now part of the AfD’s newly elected parliamentary group after its inaugural meeting on Tuesday at which it was decided not to exclude the two MPs any longer.The decision was announced on the sidelines of the gathering in the Bundestag. The new group also includes allies of Björn Höcke, the figurehead of the party’s most extreme flank, known as Der Flügel. The former history teacher has beenconvicted of using the banned Nazi slogan “Alles für Deutschland”(Everything for Germany) in campaign speeches.After their admission, Krah and Helferich can only be removed from the group with a two-thirds majority.Krah, who is popular with young male voters and won the most votes in his constituency in Saxony, is now poised to sit in parliament alongside co-leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla.The two were jubilant after the anti-Islam, anti-immigration AfD more than doubled its voter support to more than 20% on Sunday, making it thesecond largest group in the German parliament,with 152 seats.The reinstatement of Krah and Helferich led to renewed calls for an attempt to ban the AfD, which was last debated in parliament at the end of January.Carmen Wegge, of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), said she would continue the cross-party campaign that has the support of more than 100 MPs, even though it is not thought to have much chance of succeeding.“The AfD poses the greatest danger to our democracy,” she told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung newspaper.“This is clearly shown by the fact that the AfD parliamentary group has now reinstated Mr Helferich (and admitted Krah), having considered him too far-right in their previous legislative state. They are consciously deciding to put their most openly rightwing extremist faces in the front row,” she added.Helferich said he welcomed his inclusion in the parliamentary group and would now do “patriotic-parliamentary work” for the AfD in the Bundestag. As a member of the parliamentary cultural committee, he said he hoped to be able to “answer the left-wing cultural struggle with right-wing cultural policy”.Explore more on these topicsGermanyAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)The far rightEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A constitutional reform to ease the so-called “debt brake” that limits new state borrowing to 0.35% of GDP –seen by some as the only way of allowing for consistently increased military spending– is far more controversial.Merz, who before the election signalled his willingness to consider reforming the debt brake in view of military spending needs, appeared on Tuesday to dismiss it as an imminent possibility, saying: “A reform of the debt brake in the near future is out of the question.”The thorny issue was explosive enoughto bring down Scholz’s “traffic light” coalition, and the parliament resulting from Sunday’s election is also expected to be hostile due to a huge expansion of far-left and far-right factions who have said they would obstruct a relaxation of the debt brake if the intention was to fund the military.Together, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and far-left Linke party will have more than a third of seats – enough to form a so-called “blocking minority”.On Tuesday one of Merz’s close allies said the conservatives had little choice but to seek alternatives to boost defence spending. “Very fast decisions are needed, quite specifically on security and foreign policy,” Thorsten Frei, parliamentary leader of the CDU/CSU faction, told DLF, pointing to “highly dynamic foreign policy changes”.The SPD, Greens and market-liberal FDP have indicated they would give Merz support while the current Bundestag still has a decision-making mandate. The Linke party said it would vote against moves to create a new fund but has hinted it might be open to negotiation on other issues if Merz were to listen to some of its concerns over issues like housing and the cost of living.But the would-be chancellor faces a race against time. “We now have four weeks to think about it,” he said on Monday, referring to the cut-off date of 25 March.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This amounts to the smallest coalition that the centrists have ever been able to form. Formerly referred to as a “GroKo”, short for grand coalition, some are suggesting it should have a more fitting name, like Cola Zero or Baby Grand.Questions over the debt brake are likely to plague it.The current defence minister, Boris Pistorius, who is likely to be part of a new government in another role, has pushed for the reform, saying that in light of Germany’s new challenges it is “almost unavoidable”.Britta Haßelmann, co-leader of the Greens’ parliamentary group, has also said the reforms are necessary. “We urgently need future investments in both domestic and foreign security, for climate protection and to support the economy,” she told German radio.But Merz faces some internal resistance. Hendrik Wüst, leader of the most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, has said the new government needs to first set out its plans for spending cuts before decisions about taking on new debt.The AfD, which won more than 20% in the vote and is against German support of Ukraine, has made its position typically clear. Its co-leader Alice Weidel warned Merz would be committing “voter fraud” if he altered spending rules in the existing parliament.She posted on X: “This is politics against the will of the voters!”Scholz and Merz met for coffee in the chancellery on Tuesday to discuss details over the transition of power, including how Scholz plans to represent both his and Merz’s positions at international gatherings, including Sunday’s defence meeting in London.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The meeting had been aimed at consoling a man from Cameroon who lost his wife and child in the desert between Tunisia and Libya in July 2023 after being returned there by Tunisian authorities.“It wasn’t pleasant news when I discovered that my phone had been attacked,” Ferrari told the Guardian. “When I learned that Luca had been spied on, I knew that I too could be a target. I believe it’s quite clear that government agencies are behind it. Unfortunately, for many years now, solidarity has almost become a crime.”Ferrari had been in close telephone contact with the pope and had met him on numerous other occasions, potentially including during the period when he was allegedly being targeted.Francis also wrote the preface to Ferrari’s book.The pontiff, who is now in a critical condition in hospital battling pneumonia and other ailments, spoke about Ferrariduring an interview on Italian TV in January: “Father Mattia is a good guy, he works well,” the pope said. “I spoke to him on the phone.”Ferrari said: “Doing good for people, helping those in need, seems to have become a subversive act to be punished. It’s a serious matter, and I hope someone will shed light on what happened. We now demand transparency and truth.”Opposition leaders have renewed calls for Meloni – whose administration has denied that domestic intelligence services or the government were behind the alleged surveillance attacks – to address the issue in parliament. Last week, Lorenzo Fontana, the president of the Italian parliament, acting on behalf of the government, signed a document that invoked a rule allowing the government to refrain from responding to questions on the scandal, claiming that “all unclassified information has already been shared” and that any other details were under state secrecy rules.Francesco Cancellato, an investigative journalist, was also a spyware victim.“The story of activists and journalists being spied on is taking on increasingly disturbing elements,” said Elly Schlein, the leader of the centre-left Democratic party. “Mattia Ferrari, a priest active with Mediterranea was also spied on with software installed on his phone. The government, and in particular Giorgia Meloni, needs to stop running away and [must] urgently clarify who is spying on journalists and activists.”It is not clear who was behind the targeting of Ferrari. Casarini and Cancellato were notified by WhatsApp, which said the spyware used in the breach had been made by Paragon, an Israel-based company that has since suspended its relationship withItaly. Ninety people, including seven in Italy, were targeted in the breach. The Paragon-made spyware is intended for use on criminals.Yambio, meanwhile, was notified by Apple in November of “a mercenary spyware attack” although it did not specify which surveillance tool was used.The matter is being investigated by researchers at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which tracks the targeting of civil society.“This notification is concerning because it lands among the same group of people, but clearly indicates targeting with a different government-backed technology,” said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab. “One warning about a government-sponsored attack landing among a group of people who know each other is a blinking red light. A handful of them clearly indicates something serious is going on.”Explore more on these topicsSurveillanceVaticanCatholicismChristianityItalyReligionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Israeli forces have remained there ever since, despite protests by Syria’s new government and the UN, which monitors the demilitarised zone between the two countries.Israel’s air force also carried out hundreds of airstrikesagainst weapons depots, naval bases and Syrian military infrastructure in the weeks after the fall of the Assad regime in an attempt to prevent the weaponry from falling into rebel hands. Israeli airstrikes in Syria had mostly stopped since the new year.Hours before the Israeli bombings on Tuesday, Syria condemned Israel’s invasion of the buffer zone and called for it to withdraw its forces from Syrian territory. The statement was issued at the end of a national dialogue conference which gathered hundreds of Syrian activists and leaders to plan the country’s post-Assad political transition.Besides verbal condemnations, the new Syrian government has not confronted Israeli forces in Syria. Battered by 14 years of civil war and still building the country’s new army, the Syrian military has little capacity for a fight with its heavily armed southern neighbour.Though Syria officially dissolved all military factions on 29 January, the new government has not yet managed to form a national army. In practice, disparate militias are still not entirely under state control, with the defence ministry working out how to absorb tens of thousands of rebel fighters.Prior to the fall of Assad, Israel bombed Syria periodically, though it usually did not publicly claim responsibility for the strikes. Most of Israel’s military activity in Syria was concentrated on Iranian forces and weapons transfers to Hezbollah in Lebanon.Hezbollah and Iranian-backed forces left Syria in the run-up to the fall of Assad. However, Israel also views Syria’s new rulers with suspicion, with Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, on Monday calling the new rulers of Syria a “jihadist, Islamist terror group”.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Official internationally mediated negotiations on how to implement the second stage – which would involve a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territory – were supposed to begin weeks ago, but have been repeatedly postponed as the fragile truce has lurched from crisis to crisis.An extension of stage one would involve further hostage releases in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees, but Israeli officials are sceptical of the idea’s workability.InGaza, Palestinian medics said that six infants had died from hypothermia in the last two weeks, amid plunging temperatures. Dr Ahmed al-Farah, head of the paediatric department at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, told the Associated Press that it received the body of a two-month-old girl on Tuesday.“I unbuttoned her clothes and patted her, but there was no breath or heartbeat,” said the girl’s father, Yusuf al-Shinbat. “Yesterday, I was playing with her, bathing her and scenting her. She was a (beautiful) child like the moon.”Farah said another two infants were treated for frostbite at the hospital. One was discharged later, while the other was in intensive care. The body of one “was completely blue and his temperature was very low”, the doctor said.Dr Saeed Salah, of the Patient’s Friends hospital in Gaza City, said five infants aged one month or younger had died from the cold over the last two weeks, including a one-month-old who died on Monday. He said another child had been placed on a ventilator. Salah said the infants all sheltered in camps and schools-turned-shelters in northern Gaza. “There is no fuel, no electricity, no gas, no means of heating, and they and the family were exposed to extreme cold,” he said.The ceasefire is at an impasse before the scheduled release of four Israeli bodies on Thursday, after Israel decided to postpone freeing 600 Palestinians last weekend. That decision appears to have been prompted by a film released byHamason Saturday in which two hostages were forced to watch the release of other captives. The video, together with handover ceremonies in which the hostages have been paraded around by the militant group, have infuriated public opinion in Israel.Hamas has said it will not engage with any negotiations until the 600 Palestinians whose release was delayed are freed, putting mediators under pressure to resolve the latest dispute before the next release of hostage bodies on Thursday and the expiration of stage one two days later. The group had previously said it was open to a short extension of phase one in order to keep aid flowing to the territory and talks on stage two alive.Egypt, a key mediator between the sides, has also refused to discuss an extension of the first phase unless phase two talks begin at the same time, AP reported on Tuesday, citing two officials.Steve Witkoff: from property developer to global spotlight as Trump’s tough-talking troubleshooterRead moreSteve Witkoff, the Trump administration’s Middle East envoy, is returning to the region on Wednesday. In an interview with CNN over the weekend, he said he was aiming for an extension of stage one to ensure there would be time to negotiate stage two.In stage two of the deal, of uncertain duration, Israel is supposed to completely withdraw its forces from Gaza, in effect ending the war, and talks on future governance of the strip should begin. Reconstruction is due to begin in stage three, but the sides remain far apart on Gaza’s future.Hamas has said it is willing to give up control of the Gaza Strip to other Palestinians, but its leadership refuses to go into exile. Israel maintains that it will not allow Hamas or the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority to administer the territory when the war ends.On Sunday, Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel was prepared to return to hostilities in Gaza “at any moment” and vowed to complete the war’s objectives “whether through negotiation or by other means”.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaHamasBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

There was little to no food, no personal hygiene, no soap inside the cells, no water, no toilet, no toilet paper … I saw people who were dying there … I was beaten so badly I couldn’t use my legs or walk. No day passes without torture.”Bar chart showing the numbers of different types of healthcare workers detainedIn a statement to the Guardian, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO’s director general, condemned the ongoing detention of medical personnel by Israel and said he was deeply concerned for their welfare.The UN’s human rights office (UN OHCHR) said Israel also must immediately release medical staff held arbitrarily and “end all practices that amount to enforced disappearances, torture and other ill-treatment”.UN OHCHRhas previously said “it is clear”that the detention of large numbers of healthcare workers by the Israeli military contributed to the collapse of the healthcare system in Gaza. Ajith Sunghay, head of office for the occupied Palestinian territory at UN OHCHR, said: “Those responsible for crimes under international law must be held to account.”Under the Geneva conventions,the set of international laws that police the conduct of warring parties, doctors should be protected, not targeted or attacked during conflict and must be allowed to carry on providing medical care to those who need it.Tedros said: “Health workers, facilities they work in, and patients they care for … must never be targets. In fact, under international humanitarian law, they should be actively protected.”Two of Gaza’s most senior doctors– Dr Iyad al-Rantisi, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Kamal Adwan hospital, and Dr Adnan al-Bursh, head of the orthopaedic department at al-Shifa hospital – are known to have died in detention.In the past, Israel has defended its military operations on Gaza’s healthcare system by claiming that hospitals were being used by Hamas as military command centres and that the healthcare workers who were detained were suspected.‘No rules’: Gaza’s doctors say they were tortured, beaten and humiliated in Israeli detentionRead moreUnder international law, healthcare facilities can lose their protected status and become military targets if they are used for acts that are “harmful to the enemy”.The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, has said that to date Israel has failed to substantiate these allegations.The Guardian put all the doctors’ allegations relating to their detention to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), which did not respond to the individual cases but provided a general statement in which it said it was “operating to restore security to the citizens of Israel, to bring home the hostages, and to achieve the objectives of the war while operating by international law.“During the fighting in the Gaza Strip, suspects of terrorist activities were arrested. The relevant suspects have been taken for further detention and questioning in Israel. Those who are not involved in terrorist activity are released back to the Gaza Strip as soon as possible.”The IDF said it provides each detainee with suitable clothing, a mattress, regular food and drink and that they have access to medical care. It also said that handcuffing of detainees occurs in accordance with IDF policies. It said it was aware of incidents where detainees had died in detention and that investigations are conducted for each of these deaths.“The IDF acts in accordance with Israeli and international law in order to protect the rights of the detainees held in the detention and questioning facilities,” it said.The doctors’ accounts are similar to those by other former Palestinian detainees of their time in Israeli detention,who describe systemic abuseand torture.Earlier this month, an Israeli soldier wassentenced to seven months in prisonfor the abuse of detainees, the first conviction of its kind in Israel.This article was amended on 25 February 2025 to correct a mistake in referring to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UN OHCHR), also known as the UN Human Rights Office.

While those teams often agree on changes needed, disagreements between them have also held up key policy initiatives.However, NHSE personnel will bear the brunt of job losses, which will be “significant” in scale, it is understood. Some teams will be merged, including the two organisations’ respective communications teams, amid much closer joint working.A Whitehall source said: “In future, NHS England will still play a crucial role but it will have a smaller and leaner role. It will be a smaller role than what it’s currently doing, which is a lot, but which involves a lot of duplication.“Historically there have been too many disagreements [between the overlapping teams of officials] and duplication of tasks and roles and responsibilities.”In an example of the tension that can occur, Streeting’s desire to publish a new plan to tackle the long waits patients can face for urgent and emergency care, such as A&E treatment and getting an ambulance, has been delayed after NHS England raised doubts about whether such a plan was needed and what genuinely new initiatives could be included, one senior official said.Streeting has already removed Richard Meddings, NHS England’s Conservative-appointed chair. He has chosen Dr Penny Dash – a doctor who shares his zeal to radically reform the NHS – to replace Meddings, in a move NHS insiders and health policy experts say will strengthen Streeting’s grip.Meddings was “disappointed” and “dismayed” when the minister told him he wanted him to quit a year before the end of his four-year tenure, he told the Sunday Times recently.Dash is the chair of the north-west London integrated care board – a regional grouping of NHS trusts and local councils. She is a “no-nonsense character who is happy to provide robust challenge to senior people in the NHS about the progress they are, or aren’t, making”, according to someone who has worked closely with her.One former DHSC special adviser said Pritchard’s resignation will give Streeting more power and “is another sign of power moving back to DHSC and ministers. With Meddings and Pritchard now gone, ministers are fully in control.” The layoffs will further weaken NHS England, they added.But Sarah Woolnough, the chief executive of the King’s Fund thinktank, issued a veiled warning to Streeting not to impinge too much on the freedom that NHS England was given as a result of then health secretary Andrew Lansley’s controversial shake-up of the service in 2012.“It is crucial that the two organisations continue to work well together but equally important that NHS leaders retain operational and clinical independence for the day-to-day running of the service,” she said.Pritchard explained her “hugely difficult decision for me to stand down” saying it was her belief that the NHS needed new leadership to implement the government’s forthcoming 10-year health plan.Streeting has denied he had asked Pritchard to step down. Speaking at an event at Apple’s headquarters in London, he said: “No, I have so much respect and time for Amanda Pritchard. I’ve loved working with Amanda Pritchard for nearly eight months now, since I became health and social care secretary. She’s given me wise counsel, she’s led the NHS from the front … over the last more than half a decade now.”However, NHS sources said that in recent meetings Streeting had encouraged her to consider her future, given the major reforms he was planning, and that as a result she concluded that she should go. In an unusual move, two Commons select committees last month criticised her alleged lack of drive and dynamism.A well-placed source said that the office of Christopher Wormald, the cabinet secretary – who until recently was the DHSC’s permanent secretary – had advised Streeting to “do it nicely” when announcing Pritchard’s exit, and “make it look like she was leaving on her own terms”.Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthWes StreetingPublic financenewsShareReuse this content"

These included 22 from members of the public, only two of which were included in the Guardian/BBC News investigation.Westwood chose not to participate in the inquiry, White said. His legal team said the vague nature of the allegations and ongoing police investigation had prevented him from defending himself.They said he “has never had any sexual interest in children under the age of 16”, had not acted in a “predatory and/or sexual manner” and “did not (and does not) present any risk to young women, at the BBC nor elsewhere”. He denied bullying and harassment, but said he had complained about “some of his colleagues’ poor attitude to work” which “contributed to a divisive atmosphere within some of the teams with which he worked”.Allegations from members of the publicWhite details allegations from members of the public which had not been reported to the BBC. Details of 18 of the 22 allegations have been fully redacted. Among those published include allegations that Westwood:“Hounded” a 17-year-old Black woman with phone calls and texts.Invited a girl who was 15 or 16 back to his home following an under-16 night, after she had added him on Blackberry to get information about the event.Contacted a woman who had shared her business card, and appeared agitated when she did not want to meet late at night.“Hurled” a can of drink at a woman who was serving in a club.Allegations reported to BBCA former BBC staff member told the corporation their son had witnessed Westwood propositioning a 15-year-old girl in a night club in around 2007. The BBC reported the complaint to the Metropolitan police, who took no action.A BBC employee said in 2022 that a guest on Radio 1 had described potential sexual assault by Westwood between 2004 and 2007. They said they had reported it to a more senior employee, but White found no evidence the complaint had been documented. Westwood’s lawyers said he was never spoken to about the incident.A student told the review about Westwood referring to her breasts during a 1Xtra DriveTime show in 2010, calling her “cuddly” and miming grabbing her breasts, which his lawyers say he strongly denies.A Sun journalist contacted Radio 1 in November 2012 saying they had been given tipoffs about Westwood and “inappropriate relations with young girls”. A senior figure flagged allegations made about Westwood on Twitter to HR and the corporate investigations team, which decided that no action would be taken without further evidence.White concluded that senior BBC staff did not think Westwood had had sexual contact with 15-year-old girls, but that the issue “ought to have been formally raised with him” and the online allegations should have been examined further.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The money, he added, would be taken directly from the overseas aid budget, whose level will be cut by nearly half to 0.3%.The last measure is a remarkable turn for a Labour government. Uncomfortably, it comes at a time when Donald Trump wants to shut down perhaps the entire $40bn US aid budget – and at a strokeeliminates a signature commitment from the Blair-Brown years. It was back in 2004, when Tony Blair was prime minister, that Labour first committed to increasing aid spending to 0.7% of GDP.Starmer’s cuts to UK aid budget are ‘cruel and shameful’, say expertsRead moreThe figure was eventually achieved under David Cameron in 2013, though it was cut to 0.5% during the pandemic. Now it is to be slashed again underLabour, amid a soft Trumpian observation by the prime minister to MPs that “in recent years, the development budget was redirected towards asylum”, though this may prove to be the hardest part of the aid budget to squeeze.Cutting aid was “not an announcement I am happy to make”, Starmer emphasised, though the manoeuvre was probably deemed to be the easiest way to promise an immediate cash injection into defence without raising more politically troubling questions over tax and borrowing.This year, 2024-25, the UK will spend £66.3bn on defence, according to the Ministry of Defence. According to estimates produced by the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, by 2027 the shift in spending to 2.5% of GDP would amount to a straight switch of £5.3bn from the aid budget to defence.Starmer, however, told MPs the increase would amount to £13.4bn extra for defence, slightly confusing the number crunchers at the thinktank. No document was released by Labour with details of the spending commitment – a notable contrast to last April when the then prime minister, Rishi Sunak,set out defence budgets year on year until 2030as an election loomed. Another clue, perhaps, the decision was taken quickly.“Our best guess,” wrote Ben Zaranko of the IFS, “is that it’s the extra spending relative to a world where defence spending stayed flat in cash terms. That is, we’ll be spending £13.4bn more in 2027-28 than if the defence budget were frozen between now and then.” It was in other words, a figure that can best be described as exaggerated, or as Zaranko put it: “It’s not a nonsense number. But …”Subsequent briefings showed that the IFS’s hunch was correct. The defence budget is expected to be £79.7bn in 2027-28 on current Treasury forecasts, defence sources indicated, £13.4bn more than the year’s £66.3bn.Nevertheless, even at the more accurate lower figure, an extra £5.3bn for defence in real terms should be a significant amount. But while overseas aid programmes may have to be axed, it is not obvious what extra capability in defence it will buy. Starmer did not have any suggestions for MPs, deferring that to the continuing strategic defence review, which will now merge into a national security strategy and finish by June.Defence, meanwhile, continues to struggle with overspending and unrealistic ambition. Service heads have been privately warning for months that political commitments, including Labour’s Nato-first strategy plus the multi-country Aukus nuclear-powered submarine programme and the Gcap combat air initiatives, cannot be afforded. There isa £16.9bn deficitof unfunded commitments in the MoD’s 10-year equipment plan, and defence insiders warn of a £3bn shortfall on next year’s budget.Nevertheless, though the prime minister’s announcement was budgetary, the realities of the moment are immediate and political. Starmer needs Trump’s help. A fissure has opened up between the US and Europe at bewildering speed this month, with Trump seemingly intent on imposing a peace on Ukraine in a private dialogue with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and insisting that European militaries police whatever agreement he tries to come up with.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Though there was no immediate comment from Trump, who has endlessly called for European nations to increase their defence budgets, his secretary of defence, Pete Hegseth, was upbeat after he was briefed on the news. “A strong step from an enduring partner,” the Pentagon chief said, and with so much at stake in Ukraine, the hope now is that goodwill from the notoriously unpredictable White House can last the week.100 days of Trump’s presidency, with Jonathan Freedland and guestsOn 30 April, join Jonathan Freedland, Kim Darroch, Devika Bhat and Leslie Vinjamuri as they look at Trump’s presidency on his 100th day in office, live at Conway Hall, London, and livestreamed globally.Book tickets hereor atguardian.liveExplore more on these topicsDefence policyKeir StarmerLabourDonald TrumpNatoAidPublic financeanalysisShareReuse this content"

The letter also denounced the widespread worker layoffs that Doge has put into effect.‘We’re being treated as grifters or terrorists’: US federal workers on the fear and chaos of their firingsRead moreThe mass resignation of engineers, data scientists and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president’s tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs.When news of the letter was first reported, Musk called the article “more fake news” in a post on X, though his tweets appeared to also confirm the resignations.“These were Dem political holdovers who refused to return to the office,” Musk wrote on his X platform. “They would have been fired had they not resigned.”Doge employee Katie Miller seemed to ridicule the staffers who resigned, saying: “These were full remote workers who hung Trans flags from their workplaces,” in a separate post on X.On Tuesday, it was reported that Amy Gleason was identified as the acting administrator of Doge.The staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service, an office established duringBarack Obama’s administration after the botched rollout of healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat’s signature healthcare law.Meanwhile, New York’s Democratic governor wants to hire federal workers fired by Doge.Kathy Hochulon Tuesday welcomed recently laid-off federal workers to apply for state jobs using an online portal.“The federal government might say: ‘You’re fired,’ but here inNew York, we say: ‘You’re hired.’ In fact, we love federal workers,” Hochul said in a videotaped statement.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpElon MuskNew YorkKathy HochulUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Under federal law, tipped workers can be paid as little as $2.13 an hour, a minimum thathas not changedsince 1991. Onlyseven states, Alaska, California, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, have banned the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers.Democrats have supported efforts to abolish taxes on tipped income, including last month when the Nevada Democratic senators Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosenreintroduceda bipartisan bill, No Tax on Tips, with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and other Republicans, that would abolish taxes on tipped income.“Just today, I got my paycheck for two weeks and it was only $94 so all of it basically went to my allocation, which are the taxes, so no tax on tips would be great,” said Sherie Cummings, who has worked for 25 years as a cocktail server at Mandalay Bay Casino and member of the Culinary Union, which represents 60,000 food and hospitality workers inNevada.The Democratic congressman Steven Horsford of Nevada has also backed the no tax on tips legislation, calling it a “step in the right direction, even if I would prefer to step further.”Horsford hasproposeda bill to provide further relief, reintroducing the Tipped Income Protection and Support Act on 13 February. The bill would abolish taxes on tips, eliminate the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers, and enact guardrails to ensure eliminating taxes on tips is not abused for tax avoidance purposes. Nevada’s other two Democratic congressional representatives, Dina Titus and Susie Lee, haveco-signedthe legislation.Horsford said his bill would eliminate the sub-minimum “ensuring hard-working Americans never earn poverty wages of $2.13 an hour. It also closes a loophole preventing wealthy parents from evading taxes on gifts to their relatives by claiming those gifts are tips.”The restaurant industry, including the National Restaurant Association,opposesHorsford’s bill while supporting abolishing taxes on tipped income.The push to eliminate taxes on tips has been criticized for failing to address the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers, and a lack of guardrails to prevent employers and the wealthy from taking advantage of a no-tax on-tips policy, such as employers expanding the number and types of jobs reliant on tips, according to arecent reportby the Economic Policy Institute.“The rest of the country needs to wake up and end the sub-minimum wage of $2 and change. Look at me. I’m suffering. I hardly get a paycheck making $17.79 an hour. Can you imagine everywhere else that has a way less hourly rate than that? They’re definitely suffering and hardly getting by,” said Diana Bond, a server in Las Vegas, Nevada and member of the Culinary Union.“We need to make sure that all hospitality workers are being treated fairly and getting an hourly rate that they can survive on. There are so many states that are less than $5 an hour, and I don’t know how it’s not illegal at this point. They’re crushing us, and they’re crushing our ability to survive and support and provide for our families.”Bond noted that her union’s success in gaining wage increases locally was a big help but despite making $17.79 an hour plus tips, she said the Internal Revenue Service’s tax tip compliance takes a lot of what she earns.“My paycheck should be around $1,500 biweekly. And I get less than $200 biweekly out of my paycheck,” she said. “Our tips are our wage, and to be heavily taxed like that is unfair, and it’s not right.”Trump and Republicans have yet to support efforts aimed at raising the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers.During Trump’s first term, his administration proposed a tip pooling rule that would have enabled employers to take tips from servers and share them with non-tipped workers, but didn’t require employers to distribute tips as long as they received minimum wage.The Trump administrationbacktrackedin a compromise in 2018, before Trump’s Department of Laborre-enactedthe rule in December 2020. The Biden administrationretractedit in early 2021 before it took effect.The union hasnotedwhile it supports ending taxes on tips, ending the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers along with it is critical to help workers.“Eliminating taxes on tips and ending the $2.13 sub-minimum wage, along with going after big corporations’ price gouging on food, gas, and housing must be part of an overall program to tackle the high cost of living for working families,” said the Culinary Union secretary-treasurer, Ted Pappageorge, in astatementon the reintroduction of the Tips Act.“It’s outrageous that many companies across the country still pay tipped workers as little as $2.13 an hour. The legislation that Congressman Horsford is championing will uplift millions of workers, including many in Nevada, by eliminating federal income taxes on tips and ending the sub-minimum wage.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessRestaurantsNevadaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s far below the expectations of economists, who projected a reading of 103, according to a survey by FactSet.The seven-point drop was the biggest month-to-month decline since August of 2021.Federal bill couples ending taxes on tips with banning sub-minimum wageRead moreMarkets on Wall Street immediately drooped. The S&P 500 fell 0.7%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.7%. The Nasdaq declined 1.4%.Respondents to the board’s survey expressed concern over inflation with a significant increase in mentions of trade and tariffs, the board said.The Conference Board’s report on Tuesday said that the measure of Americans’ short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.3 points, to 72.9. The Conference Board says a reading under 80 can signal a potential recession in the near future.The proportion of consumers expecting a recession over the next year jumped to a nine-month high, the board said.Consumers’ view of current conditions tumbled 3.4 points to a reading of 136.5 this month and views on current labor market conditions fell again.“Views of current labor market conditions weakened,” the group said on Tuesday. “Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a 10-month high.”Consumers appeared increasingly confident heading into the end of 2024 and spent generously during the holiday season. However, US retail sales dropped sharply in January, with cold weather taking some of the blame for a dent in vehicle sales at retail stores.Retail sales fell 0.9% last month from December, the commerce department reported last week. The decline, the biggest in a year, came after two months of healthy gains.The consumer confidence index measures both Americans’ assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months.Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of US economic activity and is closely watched by economists for signs about how the American consumer is feeling.Explore more on these topicsUS newsEconomicsInflationInternational tradeTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Failure to respond a second time will result in termination,” Musk said on Monday afternoon.Federal workers can ignore Elon Musk’s email ultimatum, US office of personnel says – liveRead moreEarlier in the dayDonald Trumphad spoken in support of the demand.“By asking the question, tell us what you did this week, what he’s doing is saying, are you actually working?” the president said. “They’re trying to find out who’s working for the government, are we paying other people that aren’t working, and … where’s the money going.”Musk on Saturday gave all the US government’s more than 2 million workers barely 48 hours to itemize their accomplishments in the past week in five bullet points. Ina post on X, Musk indicated that “failure to respond will be taken as a resignation”.The broad demand came after the OPM, one of the first offices Doge infiltrated following Trump’s inauguration, orchestrated the firings ofprobationary employeesand thoseworking on diversity initiatives, and offereddeferred buyoutsto workers across the government. This time, the ultimatum quickly ran into resistance, particularly in government offices that deal with law enforcement and national security matters.The FBI’s new director, Trump loyalist Kash Patel,asked agentsto “please pause any responses”, while at the homeland security department, employees were similarly informed that “no reporting action from you is needed at this time”. All employees at the Department of Defense, who now answer to the former Fox News host and Trump acolyte Pete Hegseth as defense secretary, were similarly ordered not to respond to the OPM’s missive.Employees in other federal departments were told to await further orders or to simply ignore Musk’s edict. Workers in the Social Security Administration and the health and human services department were told to comply with the email, and CNN reported that theDepartment of Transportationordered all its employees to respond to the Musk email by its deadline. That included air traffic controllers who are currently struggling with severe understaffing and a spate ofrecent accidents.Unions and advocacy groups who were already suing over the mass firing of probationary employees quickly added Musk’s demand to their lawsuit, requesting that a judge prevent any retaliation against employees.“This request, and the resulting confusion, is not just inappropriate – it is disruptive to essential government functions,” wrote Everett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the largest federal union and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, in a letter to the OPM’s acting director.He warned that the demand pulled “federal employees away from their critical duties without regard for the consequences. As just two examples, a VA surgeon’s attention belongs in the operating room and an air traffic controller’s attention on keeping the skies safe, not on dealing with this unclear and unlawful distraction.”From weather apps to taxes: the trickle-down effects of Trump’s federal worker firingsRead moreGovernment workers who spoke to the Guardian described the email as the latest in a string of disruptive messages from the OPM that have created a siege mentality in offices nationwide.“I’m a frontline supervisor and haven’t received any communication as to whether or how to evaluate this,” said a Department of Education employee, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation. At the US Forest Service, where thousands were dismissed last week, workers told the Guardian the email added new layers of fear and confusion, with no clear instructions on whether they needed to comply.“I am afraid that if I answer wrong I will get fired,” said a forest service scientist, speaking on condition of anonymity.James Jones, an AFGE member and federal employee, said he was on sick leave on Monday to take care of his son, but now had to decide whether to leave him and drive into his office to respond to the email.“It makes me angry, but I was expecting it,” said Jones, who described the email as “another shenanigan” but said he did not think there would be repercussions for not responding.Latisha Thompson, a federal worker and member of the AFGE, said the drumbeat of emails from OPM, including an attempt to coax federal workers toresign en masse, had undercut her productivity.“This kind of onslaught of intimidation and bullying via email has caused me and my colleagues a lot of distress,” she said.Lawmakers in Congress’s Republican majorities have mostly acquiesced over the past few weeks as Trump has appointed loyalists to key positions and attempted to dismantleentireagencies. But the latest salvo against federal workers prompted a rebuke from the Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski, who has a history of squabbles with Trump.“Our public workforce deserves to be treated with dignity and respect for the unheralded jobs they perform. The absurd weekend email to justify their existence wasn’t it,”she wrote on X.At least 20,000 federal workers have so far been fired by theTrump administration, most of them recent hires or transfers on probationary periods who lack employment protections. In addition, the White House claims that more than 75,000 employees have accepted its offer of deferred resignations.Gabrielle Canon and Michael Sainato contributed reporting100 days of Trump’s presidency, with Jonathan Freedland and guests.

By 2016, he was the proud owner of a Tesla, revelling in the thumbs up he would get from other drivers as he whizzed along Europe’s highways in the electric vehicle.But of late the sheen of owning a Tesla has begun to wear off. For years the brand has been synonymous with Elon Musk and his stance against the climate crisis. Recently, Schwede watched aghast as the Tesla CEOpoured hundreds of millionsinto backing Donald Trump as he made promises to ramp up domestic oil and gas production.“He was getting more and more weird,” said Schwede, an entrepreneur and digital strategist based in Switzerland. The final straw came when Musk made back-to-backfascist-style salutesduring Trump’s inauguration in January. “I felt nothing but utter disgust,” said Schwede. “And I no longer enjoyed sitting in my Tesla.”On Tuesday, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association showedsales of new Tesla cars almost halvedin Europe last month. The figures left analysts scrambling to assess how big a factor customers turning their backs on the brand because of Musk’s foray into far-right politics may be.The Texas-based carmaker sold 9,945 vehicles in Europe in January, down 45% from last year’s 18,161, the association said.View image in fullscreenA parody ‘Tesla – The Swasticar’ advert posted at a London bus stop.Photograph: People vs ElonNow, there are signs existingTeslaowners who have become disgruntled with Musk’s views are making their anger heard.Schwede contemplated selling his car, but after racking up more than 60,000 miles on it, there was little value left in it. So he came up with his own means of reclaiming his Tesla and the liberal ethos that had underpinned his purchase; he began donating 10 cents for every kilometre driven to a range of charities, countering Musk’s support of the far right with direct support tothose who help LGBTQ+ youthor fight hate and extremism. “It was something Elon wouldn’t like,” he said. “That’s my personal revenge.”It’s a hint of how some Tesla owners in Europe are fighting back, putting up their own – albeit small-scale – resistance as Musk wades into global politics, using his wealth to help secure Trump’s return to the White House and his sprawling influence to back far-right and anti-establishment parties across Europe.For Germany’s Patrik Schneider, the turning point came as he was heckled by a stranger at a petrol station, who pointed to his Tesla and called him a Trump supporter. Saddled with a long-term lease on the vehicle, he scrambled to find a way to address his relationship with a brand that – in his mind – had soured.“Of course, as a Tesla driver you were always the fool: the Green party voter, the world saviour, the CO2guy,” Schneider told Germany’s Capital.de media. “But now you’re in a category that’s no longer funny.”What he came up with was a line of “Anti-Elon stickers” for Tesla cars. In an echo ofan American initiative,he began selling the stickers online six months ago, taking orders for messages that range from “I bought this before Elon went crazy” to “Elon sucks”.As Musk waded more deeply into German politics,hosting the far-right AfD’s co-leader, Alice Weidel, in an interview on X andturning up at an AfD rallywhere he disparaged multiculturalism and lambasted the country’s focus on “past guilt”, demand for the stickers soared.View image in fullscreenThe far-right AfD’s Alice Weidel talks online to Elon Musk during her speech at an election campaign launch.Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/EPADemand has now climbed to as much as 2,000 stickers a day, with orders pouring in from across the German-speaking world but as far as Australia and South Korea. All of it was done without any advertising, said Schneider, adding wryly: “Elon Musk does that for us.”Others have called for the actions to go further. In Poland – where the Nazi German occupation led to the deaths of 6 million Poles, including 3 million Jews – the country’s tourism minister called on citizens to boycott Tesla after Musk’s surprise appearance at the AfD rally. “All I can say is that probably no normal Pole should buy a Tesla any more,” Sławomir Nitras recently told Polish broadcaster Tok FM. “A serious and strong response is necessary, including a consumer boycott.”In August, the German drugstore chain Rossmann saidit would no longer buy Tesla cars for its corporate fleet, citing Musk’s support for Trump, while the German energy company LichtBlick said on social media that it would be “pulling the plug” on the Tesla vehicles in its fleet, citing Musk’s backing of “a rightwing populist and extremist party”.The message was echoed recently by UK-based campaign group Led by Donkeys after theyprojected images of Musk’s salute on to the facade of the Tesla gigafactorynear Berlin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Tottenham, north London, a member of the activist group People vs Elon took a cardboard cutout of Musk’s salute into a Tesla dealership.In Sweden, the EV maker Polestar has sought to capitalise on the discontent. “We get a lot of people writing that they don’t like all this,” the company’s CEO, Michael Lohscheller,told Bloomberg, adding that he had directed sales staff to target disgruntled Tesla owners.After a Dutch pollsuggested31% of respondents who owned Teslas were considering selling them or had already done so, it remains to be seen what the impact will be on the company. Matthias Schmidt, a Germany-based automotive analyst, said “2025 will be one of the biggest tests for Tesla.”“With all respect, consumers tend to be like goldfish; they tend to forget things very quickly,” Schmidt added. “But Germany is potentially slightly different because of its history … The shift to him backing the AfD was potentially far more damaging in Germany than his move to back Trump.”View image in fullscreenElon Musk wields a chainsaw during his appearance at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in the US.Photograph: Carol Guzy/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockLast year, Tesla saw sales in Germanyplunge 41%– outpacing the overall 27% decline in EVs across the country – as rivals rolled out their own electric vehicles and governments rolled back subsidies.Figures for early 2025showthat Tesla sales fell sharply across several European markets. Registrations were down 63% on a year earlier in France, 59% in Germany, 44% in Sweden, 38% in Norway and 12% in the UK.While buyers could be reacting to Musk’s comments, other factors may also be at play as consumers await Tesla’s release of the updated Y model, said Schmidt.When contacted by the Guardian, Tesla did not reply to a request for comment. But late last month, Musk appeared to be upbeat during a call with investors, hinting that 2025 may be a tough year but that 2026 would be “epic” for the company.“Musk is kind of like a character that – like a cat – has nine lives,” said Schmidt. “And he’s almost used up those nine lives. And it will be interesting to see what happens now.”Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryTeslaElon MuskTechnology sectorThe far rightGermanySwedenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The main source of this information is on the open web, which contains a vast array of data from the contents of Wikipedia to newspaper articles andonline book archives.Creative professionals and industries including authors, artists and newspaper publishers are demanding compensation for the use of their work to build those models – and for the practice to stop until they have granted permission. They also argue that their work is being taken off them for free in order to build AI tools that create works in direct competition with their own.What are the UK government proposals?The government’s preferred option in a consultation is toallow AI companies to train the models on copyrighted workby giving them an exception for “text and data mining”. However, under the proposals creatives would be able to opt out of the mining process through what ministers are calling a “rights reservation” system. The opt-out proposal has met with scepticism from opponents of the government consultation, who say there is no evidence of a “water-tight” rights reservation process in any country.The government says that AI firms like OpenAI already allow news publishers to block web crawlers from accessing their content.The consultation also proposes measures that require transparency from AI developers on what content they have used to train their models.The proposals are similar to those in the EU AI Act, which also includes an opt-out option. However, the act’s provisions havecome in for criticismfrom an architect of EU copyright law.What do the creative industries say about the proposals?Critics of the consultation, such as Beeban Kidron, a crossbench peer in the House of Lords and a film-maker, say that copyright lawdoes not need changingbecause it already does what it sets out to do: to stop someone’s work being used without permission.They also argue that the opt-out option is unfair because it puts a burden on artists who might not realise such a provision exists and could also be difficult to implement for emerging artists. They also claim it is unworkable because keeping track of the distribution of their content across the internet is impossible.According to the government, creative industries areworth £126bn to the UK economyand employ 2.4 million people.What do tech firms say?OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has admitted that it would be“impossible” to train AI models without using copyrighted material. AI companies’ defence of using copyrighted material leans on the US legal doctrine of “fair use”, which allows use of content in certain circumstances without seeking the owner’s permission.TechUK, a trade body representing tech firms, says current “uncertainty” over AI and copyright law is holding back development and use of the technology – including in the creative industries. The UK government also argues that copyright law is now “not tenable”, a situation reflected by a proliferation oflegal disputesover the issue.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Intellectual propertyComputingChatGPTKate BushexplainersShareReuse this content"

The Phoenix Mercury – the onlyWNBAteam she played for – also confirmed her decision.“Mentally and physically, I’m just full,” Taurasitold Time. “That’s probably the best way I can describe it. I’m full and I’m happy.”With her taut hair bun and supreme confidence, Taurasi inspired a generation of players while racking up records and championships.Taurasi led UConn to three straight national titles from 2001-04 and kept on winning after the Mercury selected her with the No 1 overall pick of the 2004 WNBA draft.“It’s hard to put into words, it really is, what this means. When someone’s defined the game, when someone’s had such an impact on so many people and so many places. You can’t define it with a quote,” UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. “It’s a life that is a novel, it’s a movie, it’s a miniseries, it’s a saga. It’s the life of an extraordinary person who, I think, had as much to do with changing women’s basketball as anyone who’s ever played the game.”The 42-year-oldwon her sixth Olympic gold medalat the Paris Games and finishes her WNBA career with 10,646 points, nearly 3,000 more than second-place Tina Charles.In addition to her three WNBA championships with the Mercury, Taurasi won six Euroleague championships while playing year-round most of her career. She was the 2009 WNBA MVP and is one of four players to earn WNBA Finals MVP honors more than once (2009, 2014).View image in fullscreenDiana Taurasi made the all-WNBA first team 10 times and was on the first or second team a record 14 times.Photograph: Chris Coduto/Getty Images“Diana is the greatest to have ever played the game. I’ve been a fan of her my entire life, she is the ultimate leader and teammate,” Mercury owner Mat Ishbia said in a statement. “She’s had an incredible impact on our franchise, our community and the game of basketball. Her name is synonymous with the Phoenix Mercury and she will forever be part of our family.”Taurasi made the all-WNBA first team 10 times and was on the first or second team a record 14 times. She’s also an 11-time WNBA All-Star, four-time USABasketballfemale athlete of the year and was the 2004 WNBA rookie of the year.“In my opinion, what the greats have in common is, they transcend the sport and become synonymous with the sport,” Auriemma said. “For as long as people talk about college basketball, WNBA basketball, Olympic basketball, Diana is the greatest winner in the history of basketball, period. I’ve had the pleasure of being around her for a lot of those moments, and she’s the greatest teammate I’ve ever coached.”The Glendale, California, native holds numerous WNBA records, including playoff scoring, field goals, three-pointers and 30-point games. She also holds 16 Mercury records.For her career, Taurasi averaged 18.8 points, 4.2 assists and 3.9 rebounds. She averaged 14.9 points, 3.8 rebounds and 3.4 assists while leading the Mercury to the playoffs during her 20th season.“In her prime years, she was a whole last problem. I mean, she just scored at all three levels,” Las Vegas Aces coach Becky Hammon said. “Just nasty out there. Just had that nasty, which I love. Like, you love that as a as a competitor. So our league is going to miss her.”Explore more on these topicsBasketballWNBAUSA Olympic teamUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The amount of things that we’ve looked into, how to coach that play, the fundamentals ... I can’t tell you how many times we practice the snap. We practice the play because it’s not a play that was easy to practice in different ways. We figured out how to practice it. We work really, really hard and our guys are talented at this play. And so it’s insulting to say because we’re good at it, so it’s automatic.”Philadelphia have used the play successfully behind Jalen Hurts for the past three seasons in short-yardage situations, including during their victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in this year’s Super Bowl.Will the quarterback sneak turn Chiefs v Eagles into the rugby Super Bowl?Read morePackers general manager Brian Gutekunst confirmed on Tuesday his team had submitted a proposal to ban the play, in which teammates push Hurts to gain the yardage necessary for a first down or touchdown.“We really haven’t had very many discussions about it,” Gutekunst said. “I’m sure we will over the next few weeks as we head into the owner’s meetings. So I’m aware that we did, but really haven’t had many discussions about it.The Eagles beat the Packers in a wildcard playoff game earlier this year on their way to capturing the franchise’s second Super Bowl title.The NFL Competition Committee will review the proposal and NFL owners could vote on it when they meet next month in Florida. The play had been discussed previously but there was never a formal proposal to eliminate it.Several other teams have copied Philadelphia’s use of the play, including the Buffalo Bills. Pushing Josh Allen in short-yardage situations has worked out for Buffalo, except on a critical fourth down in the AFC championship game against Kansas City when there was also a controversial spot on the play.“[The Bills] failed at it and ultimately didn’t end up winning the game because of it,” Sirianni said. “Every week I watch every first-and-goal, red zone fail. And sometimes that first-and-goal starts at the [one-yard line], and you see the team not be able to get in because they’re not able to do that. And so I think that it’s a skill that our team has because of the players that we have and the way the coaches coach that. The fact that it’s a successful play for the Eagles, and you want to take that away, I think it’s a little unfair.”The Packers have struggled to both stop and convert on the play.“I know we’re not very successful against it,” Gutekunst said. “I know that. But to be honest, I have not put much thought into it. It’s been around for a while. We’ve used it in different fashions with our tight end, so, again, I think there will be a lot of discussions about it. I’ve kind of got to look at some of the information as far as injury rates, things like that to see. But we’ll see.”Packers president and CEO Mark Murphy called the tush push “bad for the game” in a message posted on the team’s website after the Packers were eliminated by the Eagles in the playoffs.“There is no skill involved and it is almost an automatic first down on plays of a yard or less,” Murphy wrote. “I would like to see the league prohibit pushing or aiding the run.”Atlanta Falcons coach Raheem Morris said on Tuesday he wouldn’t mind seeing the play outlawed. “I’ve never been a fan,” Morris said. “Never understood why it was allowed. I definitely will be one of the guys voting against it.”Bills coach Sean McDermott, who also is a member of the competition committee, on Monday mentioned player safety concerns.“The way that the techniques that are used with the play, to me, have been potentially contrary to the health and safety of the players,” McDermott said “You have to go back through, in fairness, to the injury data on the play, but I just think the optics of it I’m not in love with.”Sirianni disagreed with injuries being a concern. “I think that’s a little made up,” he said. “I can’t remember one injury we had on that play and we ran it more than anybody else.”Explore more on these topicsNFLGreen Bay PackersPhiladelphia EaglesUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The initial accusations include claims that Tucker exposed his genitals, brushed some of the therapists with his penis and left ejaculate on treatment tables. Two spas told the Banner they had banned Tucker from returning. One therapist who spoke to the Banner described Tucker’s alleged behavior as “really degrading”. Another said that “I can’t watch sports anymore. I see his face everywhere.”Green Bay Packers call for ban on ‘bad for the game’ tush-push playRead moreLeague officials have reportedly spoken with at least three of the women so far.Tucker has posted a statement on social media calling the allegations “unequivocally false”. His lawyers have also issued a statement denying the allegations. “Mr Tucker has never behaved inappropriately during any massage therapy session, and certainly never in the manner described … Any suggestion to the contrary is a fictitious and utterly baseless claim,” attorneys Thomas A Clare and Steven J Harrison told the Banner last month.DeCosta said he first became aware of the accusations when a Baltimore media outlet, presumably the Banner, was about to publish the allegations and that he met with Tucker. But he declined to provide details on Tuesday of that conversation.DeCosta said the team will wait for the results from the NFL investigation, and will consider the allegations against Tucker on a case-by-case basis.Tucker is considered by many to be the greatest kicker in NFL history, and holds the records for longest field-goal and career field-goal percentage. He has been named to the Pro Bowl seven times since he joined the Ravens as an undrafted free agent in 2012. The 35-year-old is one of the few kickers to become a well-known name, and is also known for his performances as an amateur opera singer.Explore more on these topicsBaltimore RavensNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

And there is no such thing as a bad win by four goals. But equally, the context is unavoidable. This is aSouthamptonside who are doomed, who are letting in 2.41 goals per game, who have lost 14 of their past 17 league games and who have nothing to play for this season beyond trying to scrape together the three points that would take them above Derby’s record low of 11.The Premier League’s unique selling point is supposed to be that anybody can beat anybody, but it’s hard to square that with this Southampton. “I’m frustrated,” said Ivan Juric, who pointed out his team had defended well for 20 minutes. “It’s a really tough situation.”Ismaïla Sarr strikes twice in Crystal Palace goal-fest as Aston Villa implodeRead more“We are in our worst moment in terms of results,” said Enzo Maresca, “but we are third, one point from third. That shows how good we have been. Now it’s a matter of trying to finish in the best way.” But a straightforward win is unlikely to have done much to assuage the irritation of some fans.Perhaps 150 had demonstrated on Fulham Road against the ownership before kick-off, attacking Todd Boehly and Clearlake and demanding success. “We’re not Arsenal,” blazed one hand-written poster, while others chanted the names of Roman ­Abramovich and José ­Mourinho. “The fans have to trust us,” said Maresca. “We are heading in the right direction.”Yet results are only part of the issue.Had they beaten Evertonthree days before Christmas, ­Chelsea would have gone top. Since then, they had won just two of 10 games before Southampton came to Stamford Bridge. The protest, though, felt far bigger than form. This is about the way football is going, the disconnect between fans and club, the sense that a club that was once integral to and representative of its community is now just an investment vehicle, the players assets to be traded as required.It’s true that discontent would probably be less visible wereChelseaengaged in a battle for the title, but it doesn’t take many poor results to expose the sense of commercial soullessness just below the surface.The downturn over the past couple of months is in part down to problems of team building when so many ­players have come in without a readily discernible underlying plan. Injuries clearly are part of it. Wesley Fofana, Roméo Lavia and Nicolas Jackson represent the spine of the side, and losing them has created knock-on issues elsewhere.Without Jackson and Marc Guiu, Chelsea don’t have a natural No 9, which at a time when they are also without the width offered by Noni Madueke because of a thigh injury and Mykhailo Mudryk after his positive drugs test, has forced a complete rethink of the forward line.View image in fullscreenMarc Cucurella celebrates with Cole Palmer and Christopher Nkunku after scoring Chelsea’s fourth goal.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersPedro Neto, naturally a wide player, has had to be drafted in as a central forward, while Christopher Nkunku, a clever and inventive inside-forward in his goalscoring days at RB Leipzig, has been repurposed as a wide player on the left. There has been a certain amount of frustration – among fans at least – about his occasionally erratic movement, but he is being asked to perform a role that does not come naturally to him and that, given how Marc Cucurella likes to invert, is essential.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He officially joined a week before Mauricio Pochettino was appointed manager, scored three in five pre-season games and then was injured before the ­campaign began for real.Since then, Chelsea have signed 25 players; if Nkunku feels this is not quite the club he was sold, he can hardly be blamed. Still, however uncomfortable he at times looks on the touchline, his goalscoring instincts remain sharp as he demonstrated after 24 minutes, stealing in front of Will Smallbone and braving contact with a flailing Aaron Ramsdale to nod in Tosin Adarabioyo’s header.It was then with a more typical run infield that he set up the second for Neto. Not for the first time this season, Southampton had given their opponents a helping hand, James Bree squandering possession. Levi Colwill headed a third and Cucurella made it four with a late counter, but the sense was that they could have got almost any number had they needed to.Their problem is there’s not much credit to be gained in pushing on an open door, and few doors have ever been as open as this Southampton.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaSouthamptonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

We spoke to some of those affected by the banTiana RandallTue 25 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 17.29 ESTShareOn 5 February 2025 – coinciding with Women and Girls in Sports Day – Donald Trump signed anexecutive orderbarring trans athletes from competing in women’s sports. The move marked yet anotheraggressive shiftof his legislative agenda, as he doubled down on anti-trans rhetoric, in which he has vowed to eliminate what he calls “transgender insanity”.The next day college sports’ main governing body, the NCAA, said only women assigned female at birthwould be able to participate under its umbrella. The organization oversees more than 500,000 athletes. Last year the NCAA’s president, Charlie Baker, said he knew of only 10 transgender athletes competing in the organization.For many transgender athletes who aspire to turn professional or qualify for events such as the Olympics, Trump’s executive order, and the NCAA’s ruling, pose a considerable obstacle, halting their ability to pursue their careers and participate in sports. We spoke to athletes who have competed in theNCAAabout how the ban has affected them.Taylor Rey Narvasa, former NCAA volleyball player at the University of Washington, and current member of the North American Gay Volleyball AssociationI was devastated. We all knew it was coming – it wasn’t necessarily a surprise – but there’s a difference between anticipatory grief and present grief. It made me feel awful, knowing my identity and existence are being debated every single day, with the rhetoric only intensifying.I’ve always been a strong advocate, openly documenting my transition on social media. I understand why many people would want to step away, but for me, it pushes me to be even more visible. I wore my trans pride sweater to a tournament in rural Washington yesterday because I refuse to be silent or make myself smaller. The goal of these attacks is to make trans people shrink themselves. That’s why I believe in taking up more space when I have the capacity. But I will say, my capacity has diminished – it wears on me. I have to be more intentional about where I invest my emotional energy, but at the end of the day, we’re just doing our best.Trump singled me out for ruining women’s sport. This is my response to him |  Austin KillipsRead moreI consider myself a strong person, but even for me, this is incredibly difficult. I can’t imagine what it’s like for kids today – children in elementary and middle school who just want to play their sport. I grew up in a conservative, predominantly white community, always searching for belonging, and sports gave me that. To strip that away from people is devastating.And the fact that this only targeted trans women – not trans men – was a red flag. The NCAA had governing bodies with rules in place, like requiring hormone treatment for a set period. Those regulations were working. But by banning trans athletes while alsocutting off access to healthcare, the goal is clearly to erase trans people from every angle. People dismiss it by saying, “It’s just sports.” But for so many, it’s their livelihood, their escape, their mental health. Being on a court with teammates who affirm you is life-saving for some.For me, volleyball saved my life. I wouldn’t be here without the chosen family I found in the sport, without having that space to exist without the weight of the outside world. But now, they’re stripping away access to both healthcare and sports. And no one is actuallyaddressing the real threats to women’s sports: lack of funding, lack of access, predatory coaches. This was never about protecting women.Meghan Alexandra Cortez, former NCAA swimmer at Ramapo College of New JerseyTrump did exactly what he said he would. I knew it was coming. It’s just unfortunate. I think it was [the NCAA president] who mentioned how many trans athletes there actually are – [around] 10. I happened to be one of them at the time because they were using last year’s data. I barely knew any other trans athletes. I’d heard of them, but I wasn’t in contact with anyone. There was no one going through this experience with me. You’re completely isolated.This outrage, from my experience, doesn’t exist. When you actually ask the swimmers – the ones directly impacted – nine times out of 10, no one cares. I didn’t start hormone therapy until the summer before my junior year. So when I was practicing in a women’s swimsuit, my body was becoming more feminine. That year was the hardest because I remembered how fast I was in high school and felt the difference. My speed and energy had changed as my biochemistry and body mass shifted. By my senior year, I was finally eligible to switch teams under the NCAA’s criteria – a year of hormones and a specific testosterone level, which varies by division and sport.I saw what happened to [NCAA swimmer] Lia Thomasand felt something unsettling. She didn’t deserve it – she was just trying to be herself. That weighed on me as I transitioned hormonally, and I worried my success wouldn’t be attributed to my hard work or athleticism, but simply to being trans.By my senior year, I knew something might happen. More people –like [swimmer] Riley Gainesand conservative media – were fear-mongering. At my first meet, I was nervous, but nothing happened. That reassured me until midseason. That’s when Iblew up in the media, all because of Riley Gaines and others upset that I broke a school record by 0.6 seconds.Competing again [after Trump’s order] hasn’t even crossed my mind – not just because of the social and legal barriers, but because I’ve reached a physical limit. Even if I could continue, I’d hesitate. It’s not my time. If anything, I’d wait three or four years before reconsidering. But honestly, it’s just not worth it. It’s not about letting them win or not taking a stand – I refuse to let them turn me into a spectacle for their messaging and propaganda.Yes, it’s unfortunate I can’t compete at this level any more. What hurts most is that other trans athletes won’t get that chance. That’s a choice I thought I’d have to make when I was considering coming out. I chose my sport, and for a while, it broke me – I thought I could never be who I wanted to be. When I realized I didn’t have to make that choice, I felt nothing but joy. My fondest memories of swimming are from the moments I could be myself while doing what I loved. Now, others won’t get to experience that.Mayumi Berry, former track athlete at Louisiana Tech University and The University of North TexasI stopped running because I got to a point where I was sick of being misgendered. I ran men’s track – full sets, hair, everything. Outside of track, I lived my life as a woman, but I couldn’t be myself any more. That’s when I started medically transitioning. To run on a women’s team as a trans woman, I remember the requirements – you had to have bottom surgery, your hormones had to be at a certain level, and you had to have transitioned for a certain amount of time by a certain age. At Louisiana Tech, there were several conflicts around my gender and expression. I received a death threat from two teammates. The school handled it well, but they never renewed my scholarship.People still think that even if you’re trans, the so-called male body is more powerful and capable of more harm. But we know hormones make your body less capable when transitioning from male to female. My entire track career, I daydreamed about going to the Olympics. I wouldn’t have won the Olympics, but I would have qualified if I had been able to run with people who looked like me. Every athlete dreams of being recognized, of being the best. And I could have been up there with the best if [the Trump administration] just let me compete. That’s part of why I didn’t want to run any more. I gave up on that dream. It’s fun to daydream about, but I’m not going to hurt myself wanting something I’ll never get.I was the only trans person in the NCAA who ran track that I ever met or saw – on the men’s or women’s side. There aren’t even enough numbers for people to protest. The track community wouldn’t care [about protesting in support of trans athletes]. The only people who would are the ones directly affected. Looking back, when I was getting so much hate, I think the dream of the Olympics kept me going. Just knowing I was born to be an athlete made it feel worth it.100 days of Trump’s presidency, with Jonathan Freedland and guests.

For a young Egyptian player of promise, this in itself is a transgressive act. The big clubs may be chaotic and corrupt but they pay well, have little need to sell and thus hold all the power. Egyptian football has been suspended afterthe Port Said disaster, and as the official quotes Basel a price of €3m, Salah sees his dream evaporating in front of him. “But I won’t be able to do anything,” he pleads. He’s only 19 years old. But already he realises that destiny is not something you make, but something you take.VEverything is pared down to its simplest form. Physically, there is no ounce that does not need to be there. He prefers resistance-band work to weights in the gym, which add unnecessary bulk and slow him down. And speed is still the thing: speed of thought, speed of foot, speed of escape, speed of freedom; the utter certainty that this ball will be his and not yours. There is still no safety, still no simplicity. Get a big injury, at the age of 32 with no contract, and oblivion awaits. What sort of person do we think steps off that bus? How hard do they run? How much do they need to make this time count?VIThe tales of Salah’s generosity are legion. Some probably need to be taken with a pinch of salt. But even if only a few are true, a picture emerges: £560,000 for the local hospital in Basyoun; £2.5m to the National Cancer Institute in Cairo; thousands of tonnes of food during the pandemic; an ambulance centre, oxygen cylinders, a water treatment plant, a girls’ school; a significant donation to the Egyptian Red Crescentas it tried to get humanitarian aid into Gaza. “I am calling on the world leaders to come together to prevent further slaughter of innocent souls,” Salah wrote in a rare unguarded moment on social media. “Humanity must prevail.”View image in fullscreenWith his contract up in June, Liverpool fans urge their owners to ‘give Mo his dough’.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesVIIThought exercise: what if his next contract comes from the Saudi Pro League? We know he cares passionately about developing football in the Middle East. We know the Saudis are paying better than anyone else at the moment. We know, too, that signing Salah to the Pro League will act as a PR coup for one of the worst regimes on Earth and make a lot of lives very tangibly better in the process. It’s fine to feel whatever you want to feel about this.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I do know how hard he worked to get into this position. Those hours on the bus. Those hours in the gym. The dexterity with which he escaped from the toxic politics of Egyptian football, a dexterity equal to any he has displayed on the pitch. This is his dwindling time, his last few years of true influence, his moment of maximum power. In a decade he will be 42 and of no use to anybody. This is the last big footballing decision he will make.IXGive him what he wants.Why does this narrative feel so inadequate? Perhaps because it’s based on the idea that Salah can still be strong-armed into signing a contract if the offer is lavish enough, reduces this incredibly complex personal decision to pure pecuniary instinct. As if this is a simple transaction between employer and employed. As if every pound of flesh has its price. As if, for all Salah’s talent and influence, this is still essentially Liverpool’s agency, Liverpool’s decision to make, Liverpool who would be “letting him go”. What does Salah want? Perhaps the pertinent question is: to what extent is it in the power of any football club to grant it?XEvery so often, he tries to go back home to Nagrig. Once word gets around that he’s in town, thousands of well‑wishers will descend on his house, blocking the roads, trapping him indoors. How about: let him go wherever he wants, on his terms, with your blessing, and your thanks? How about: do not presume to own a part of him because he occasionally makes you happy? How about recognising that adulation and persecution are two sides of the same coin?XIBut of course it will always be easier to retreat into stats and records, the rows and columns of our built world. To treat Salah as free content, a hanging steak with a price tag, rather than a messy lived experience, the breathtaking complexity of existing as a human being at the crux of so many other existences. Perhaps it’s no wonder we love staring at Salah’s feet. It saves us the trouble of looking into his eyes.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Donald Trump, then in his first term as president, had attacked players who knelt during the anthem to protest against racial inequality.Over the weekend, speculation – mostly based on a story published before the Eagles beat the Kansas City Chiefs in this year’s Super Bowl – grew that they would not visit the White House to celebrate their title. However,ESPN, CNN and theNFL Network reportedon Monday that the Eagles intend to attend the White House if invited.Trump at the Super Bowl: how the NFL’s culture war ended in surrenderRead more“We would be honored to visit the White House,”an Eagles source told CNN. “It’s one of the things we had looked forward to doing and we look forward to receiving the invitation.”In the buildup to this year’sSuper Bowl, Eagles offensive lineman Lane Johnson said he would be happy to visit the White House. “I’d be honored to go, regardless of who the president is, but we’ll see. It’s ultimately a team decision. I’ll do what’s best for the team,” Johnson said. In the aftermath of the team’s victory, head coach Nick Sirianni said “we’ll see as we go” when asked about a decision on the visit.The White House on Monday said it has not yet extended an invitation to the Eagles, but Trump himselftold reporters in the Oval Officeon Tuesday that it will be coming “sometime today”.”I thought it was a great performance by them – they’ll be extended that invitation,” Trump said. “They deserve to be down here, and we hope to see them.”Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies.

Having found a way back into the game at the start of the second half thanks to an equaliser from Morgan Rogers after he had seen another goal disallowed for the narrowest of offsides, Villa were blown away as Jean‑Philippe Mateta and Sarr’s second on the Senegal forward’s 27th birthday sealed only a third league win of the campaign at Selhurst Park for Palace.Chelsea return to top four after Nkunku and Neto sink sorry SouthamptonRead moreThe substitute Eddie Nketiah added a fourth in stoppage time to register his first Premier League goal for Palace since joining from Arsenal in the summer. But it was the imperious Wharton, a member of England’s Euro 2024 squad, that stole the show in front of Gareth Southgate’s successor Thomas Tuchel on his first start for nearly four months, after surgery on a groin injury.“He was a little bit rusty in the beginning but then you could see his quality as he adjusted so quickly to the pace of the Premier League again,” said Glasner. “He played excellent and we’re so pleased to have him back.”A measure of Emery’s respect for Palace was that he opted to switch to a back three for their trip to south London. But having come off the bench to inspiretheir victory against Chelseaon Saturday, there was nothing Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio could do this time after being introduced late on.“We have not been consistent enough,” admitted Emery, whose side have kept only three clean sheets all season. “Now we have to manage the frustration that we have today and move on.”The last time Wharton started a Premier League game, at the end of October, Palace had yet to register a victory in eight attempts. In his absence, Glasner has overseen a steady climb up the table thanks to impressive away form that has yielded four straight victories thanks to their ability to hit teams on the break.View image in fullscreenJean-Philippe Mateta scores past Robin Olsen for Palace’s second goal.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersWatching both managers prowling the touchline in their black puffer jackets was almost more entertaining than events on the pitch in the opening half-hour as Emery reacted to every misplaced pass. He had his head in his hands when Youri Tielemans glanced a cross from Andrés García wide of the far post before Jacob Ramsey saw a goal disallowed for offside.The breakthrough came at the other end on the half-hour mark when Villa failed to clear a corner and Sarr almost got on the end of a cross from Eberechi Eze. The ball came out to Wharton and he picked out the unmarked Chris Richards, whose header was parried straight into the path of the gleeful Sarr.The goal seemed to lift a collective weight from the Palace players’ shoulders, with Ezri Konsa having to throw himself in front of a goal-bound Eze shot before Emi Martínez parried Sarr’s brilliant volley from another Eze cross. Rogers thought he had equalised on the stroke of half-time but, to Emery’s clear disgust, Watkins’ knee was adjudged to have been offside when he was played through in the buildup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That prompted Emery to turn to Rashford and Asensio, even if it was a surprise to see Watkins make way.But it was Palace who underlined their dominance when Sarr rounded off his birthday celebrations by volleying home Daniel Muñoz’s cross to the delight of the home supporters before Nketiah finally broke his duck in injury time by tapping in Tyrick Mitchell’s cross.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueCrystal PalaceAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

So when he deflected a question after this third successivePremier Leaguewin – the first time Brighton have managed such a feat since 2023 – he did so with a knowing smirk.“Let’s wait for the next games,” Hürzeler said. “Then we can talk about this. I’m not a big fan to emphasise one victory or one loss too much. We have to work hard and go game by game and see what happens.”Chelsea v Southampton, Crystal Palace v Aston Villa, and more: football – liveRead moreWith league fixtures against ­Fulham, Manchester City and Aston Villa up next, perhaps he is wise not to allow his thoughts to drift too far into the future. In this battle between two clubs now with identical ­tallies, just a solitary point off fifth spot, ­Hürzeler concluded that his side was “the lucky winner” on the eve of his 32nd birthday.That was, perhaps, a slightly harsh assessment. IfBournemouthedged possession and perhaps enjoyed the best of the action in the middle of the park, it was Brighton who made their chances count.On his return from injury, Danny Welbeck proved the match-winner 15 minutes from time, restoring the hosts’ advantage just two minutes after entering the fray following a stunning Justin Kluivert strike that had cancelled out João Pedro’s fortunate early penalty.Andoni Iraola was left to rue his side failing to take advantage of a dominance that grew as the match wore on. “It’s difficult,” he said. “In the second half we played as good, if not better, than Brighton. We had more corners, more crosses, more time in their half. But in the end, when you lose, you have to make these things count and they have been the better in the box. That is what counts in football.”After an 11-match unbeaten league run to the end of January, ­Bournemouth have now lost three of their past five matches. But they remain seventh, above Brighton on goal difference.The hosts received an early boost here courtesy of a penalty that could either be deemed harsh on the helpless Kepa Arrizabalaga or simply the natural outcome of João Pedro’s attacking nous. Played in sweetly by a defence-splitting Diego Gómez pass, the Brazilian waited for the goalkeeper to charge off his line, poked the ball in the opposite direction without the slightest intention of ever regaining it, and happily ­clattered straight into Kepa.View image in fullscreenBournemouth’s Justin Kluivert celebrates scoring a spectacular goal.Photograph: Steven Paston/PAOnce Michael Oliver had pointed to the spot, the decision was never likely to be overturned and João Pedro duly converted. “I think the forward is very smart,” was Iraola’s verdict. “He buys the penalty.”The hosts might well have doubled their advantage just before half-time with a volley from the in-form Kaoru Mitoma. The Japanese winger did brilliantly to strike Tariq Lamptey’s cross so sweetly, given the ball was slightly behind him, but his shot hit a post.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionBournemouth responded to ­Iraola’s demands for an increase in intensity and just after the hour this had the desired effect. Kluivert ­levelled with one of the cleanest strikes he will place on a ball. Having picked it up on the left, the Dutchman drove infield, cut inside his defender and fired into the far top corner, rendering Bart Verbruggen’s full-stretch dive futile.Increasingly, it was the visitors who gained the ascendancy and only an excellent point-blank Verbruggen save stopped Alex Scott, on as a substitute, finding the net from close range.But then came Brighton’s sucker punch. With his first involvement after coming off the bench, ­Welbeck latched on to Georginio Rutter’s through ball and slotted neatly past the onrushing Kepa. His gently struck shot seemed to take an age, rolling towards the far post, where it flicked the inside of the post and nestled into the net, providing the injury-troubled striker his first goal since October.Evanilson came on for his first Bournemouth appearance since fracturing a bone in his foot at the start of January and was almost ­presented a late tap-in from a couple of yards, only for Verbruggen to palm Luis ­Sinisterra’s cross through the ­Brazilian’s legs.“The first half was good; we deserved to lead,” Hürzeler said. “The second half we suffered. It was not the most beautiful game for us, but very effective.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrighton & Hove AlbionBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The 60-year-old sold his controlling interest in the Serie B club Spezia this month and previously owned the Danish club Sønderjyske.Reading enter period of exclusivity with potential buyer as Dai Yongge eyes saleRead morePlatek is the co-head of global credit at BDT & MSD Partners, the investment vehicle of the technology billionaire Michael Dell. The company, known previously as MSD, became a major lender to several EFL clubs during the Covid-19 pandemic in commercial arrangements that continue to this day.MSD has lent tens of millions of pounds to the EFL clubs Burnley, West Brom, Derby and Sunderland and to the Premier League side Southampton. Several of the loans are understood to give MSD security over the stadium of the club in question in the event of a missed repayment.One executive at another club said: “MSD became major lenders during the pandemic and have effective control of several club’s cashflows. Platek has been at the company for over 20 years, runs their credit operation and will become chairman at the end of the year. At best it doesn’t look good, at worst it’s a huge conflict of interest.”The EFL declined to comment, but is understood to be aware of other clubs’ concerns. It has held talks withReadingabout their prospective buyer and made clear they must comply with its regulations.Platek said when buying his other clubs that they were personal investments with no link to MSD. Given the sensitivity of the issue to other clubs he will have to demonstrate a clear separation of funding to the EFL, and may have to prove he has no knowledge of other EFL clubs’ financial arrangements with MSD.The issue is particularly problematic for the EFL given the longstanding financial problems at Reading, who were put up for sale 18 months ago by their Chinese owner, Dai Yongge, andshut down their historically successful women’s operationlast summer. The Guardian revealed last October that a loan taken out by Dai from a state-backed Chinese bank was one of many complexities holding up a sale, but that matter has been resolved.Platek is the fifth potential buyer to enter exclusive talks with Reading in the past 12 months after offers from the former Wycombe owner Rob Couhig, the former Reading chairman Roger Smee and two proposals involving the property magnate Paul Taylor. Significantly, the Platek offer involves buying Dai’s stake, Reading’s stadium and the training ground, returning all of the club’s assets to one company.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ryan Sessegnon scored in the opening minute of the match and Rodrigo Muniz fell just short of replicating the feat after the break to boost their European hopes, while the hosts blew the chance to move eight points clear of the drop zone.Vítor Pereira’s side were worthy of more but they set their own downfall by not paying sufficient attention after kick-offs and being wasteful in front of goal, apart from João Gomes’s consolation.Chelsea v Southampton, Crystal Palace v Aston Villa, and more: football – liveRead moreWolves had 18 shots but only five hit the target, while Fulham were efficient when opportunities arose to move two points off fifth and a potential Champions League spot.Pereira, the Wolves head coach, said: “Today I am frustrated because after three days playing again, starting the first half conceding a very easy goal. Our level of concentration and focus was not at the right level. When you start the second half in the same way, it is very difficult.“In the second half I felt the team was tired, the movement and pressing was not what we are used to. When they started with the subs, they have a lot of solutions in the squad and for us it is not the case.”In response to Fulham’s weekend home defeat, Marco Silva made five changes to his side. One of those was a firstPremier Leaguestart in more than two years for Sessegnon.If there were any concerns about the wing‑back being rusty, they were allayed in the first minute. Two other fresh players combined as Muniz did well to hold up the ball on the halfway line before finding Andreas Pereira. The forward slid a pass through for Sessegnon to run on to in space on the left wing; he saw José Sá coming, but slotted into the far corner for his first goal since October 2022.“He’s a lovely boy and the last two, three years, they were really tough for him,” Silva said of Sessegnon.View image in fullscreenRodrigo Muniz fires in Fulham’s winner.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/Reuters“A player that started at 16 years old in high level and I think all of us that we are here and probably everybody that loves football in this country, recognising that moment that he’s going to have an amazing career because he was a top, top, top talent and sometimes football is not always like that. Let’s hope the future is going to be bright for him again.”It was a frustrating start for Wolves after the positivity of their win against Bournemouth. Molineux was effectively silenced and needed something from the home team to enliven the mood, and Matheus Cunha is more often than not the man to provide it. Fulham knew this and paid him close attention but, after winning a free‑kick from Issa Diop, the Brazilian then left the defender in a spin as the home fans sensed their team were on top.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The midfielder thrashed home from close range, before running off to celebrate and urged the Wolves faithful to up the decibels. The noise grew but the hosts failed to use the momentum to their advantage.Wolves, it transpires, start halves of football slowly. A whopping 62 seconds after the break, Fulham were back ahead. Adama Traoré played the ball between the home defence and Muniz made a clever run to reach the pass first and dink the ball over Sá, to leave everyone in gold seeking hair to pull out.From that point on possession was dominated by Wolves. They were happy to knock it side-to-side in search of a fissure that might become a crack but the Fulham defence were disciplined, forcing them out wide and Cunha could not provide the same spark as earlier. Questions were posed by crosses into the box but without an obvious Wolves aerial threat, until Jørgen Strand Larsen came off the bench, the three Fulham centre-backs were happy to deal with what came their way.Silva was able to send out some of those rested players to close out the match. It felt like a missed opportunity for Wolves as they began a crucial run of fixtures. In their next four games Everton and West Ham visit Molineux, mixed with trips to two teams in the relegation zone, Southampton and Ipswich. They have the chance to make amends but have increased the pressure on themselves.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWolverhampton WanderersFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I believe this case happened for a ­reason and makes us more respected as women. People will ­realise that it has been important, and it doesn’t need to happen any more.”Matildas fall to another SheBelieves Cup defeat after horror start against USARead moreLast week Rubiales, the former president of the Spanish football ­federation,was found guiltyof sexual assault for kissing Hermoso without consent during the medal ceremony of the 2023 World Cup final, with the court ruling he pay a €10,000 (£8,290) fine. However, Rubiales and his three co-defendants were cleared of the charge of coercion, for having ­allegedly put pressure on Hermoso to say the kiss was consensual. Rubiales has said he, too, will be appealing.The 27-year-old midfielder ­echoed the surprise of her teammate Irene Paredes that Rubiales was acquitted of coercion. “Everybody here knows what has happened in the last few months and years,” Bonmatí said. “The sentence is correct, it is a ­positive thing and the team feel the same. I was surprised that there was no sentence linked to coercion, but the trial has served a purpose.“We are all happy. We have been doing well on the pitch and sup­porting our teammate. We have battled hard, and we know what we have done has not been in vain.”View image in fullscreenLuis Rubiales outside the court in Madrid where he was found guilty of sexual assault.Photograph: Fernando Villar/EPABonmatí said that she hopes the case “makes changes in our country, in our football, and that we are respected better as footballers”, before adding: “But it’s also a global case, I don’t want to only speak about ­footballers, I think this ­happens in other jobs. I hope this case helps anyone who is going through these things. I hope this will help gain respect for women’s rights.“We didn’t only win on the pitch but also off the pitch. We are ­continuously fighting for our rights and women’s rights. We are ­continuing to make change in society, and we are proud of that. We know we have to suffer a lot and that makes us stronger and champions even more.”Speaking earlier in the day Sarina Wiegman, the England manager, said Hermoso was showing “­remarkable courage and bravery” with her decision to lodge an appeal after the conviction of Rubiales, and ­reiterated her support for Spain’s players. She said their comeback to secure a 3-2 win against Belgium just over 24 hours after the trial’s verdict ­demonstrated how brave they are.View image in fullscreenSpain celebrate Cristina Martín-Prieto’s winning goal against Belgium.Photograph: José Miguel Fernández/NurPhoto/Shutterstock“It says first of all that they are a very good team,” Wiegman said. “It also shows resilience; they are so brave. We are talking about it again today because we have to keep ­talking about it and telling the world we stand in solidarity with their fight to make change.”The Arsenal forward Alessia Russo added her support, too. “We hope it makes a change going forward,” she said. “It’s a testament to the players to be so brave to speak out and to perform at the levels they have. We stand with them and back them all the way.“I know it’s been tough on teammates who I have played with [­Arsenal’s Laia Codina and ­Mariona Caldentey]. They have acted with so much class. The community that women’s football has is really special. Whether it’s good or bad we come together as one.

The 33-year-old midfielder is out of contract at ­Manchester City in the summer and is yet to enter formal talks over an extension.De Bruyne has become a bit-part player this season as his body struggles to cope with the rigours of elite football. He endured a difficult afternoon against Liverpoolon Sunday and is unlikely to start at Tottenham on Wednesday night.Never mind the quality, feel the money: central flaw of football’s ‘greatest show on earth’ | Barney RonayRead moreGuardiola said of talks over De Bruyne’s future: “Nothing is going to change about that. Of course we know each other quite well and we are quite honest with that.“I think in that situation he has to decide, that is the most important thing. He’s completely honest with himself, to decide what he feels and what he can do in the next period of his life. He’s 34 in the summer and he has to decide, like what happened with David Silva for example.”Silva became a City legend over a 10-year spell before deciding to leave for Real Sociedad in 2020 when his contract expired. De Bruyne, who has won 14 major honours in his decade at City to become the club’s most decorated player, is free to talk to clubs abroad and has attracted interest from Saudi Arabia and the US in recent months.City are in a transitional phase under Guardiola, with four ­signings in January, and the head coach has admitted he will need to overhaul the squad in the summer. Older players, such as De Bruyne, who are struggling with the hectic schedule could be moved on, although ­Guardiola accepts he cannot lose too much experience, and the Belgian is open to staying.Guardiola has worked with a small squad throughout his coaching career but is considering expanding his options. “You have to think about who can play every three days for a month,” he said. “That’s the most important thing, otherwise it can happen the same as this season. You have to try to avoid it.“The club has to sign players but at the same time the club has to keep the players we have as much as possible. Because with the [Club] World Cup then immediately after the season, it will be even tougher next season. We need a little bit bigger squad next year.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arteta emphasised he had not given up hope of catching Arne Slot’s side but also believes finishing as runners-up for a third successive season would be an overachievement given the suspensions and injuries his team have had to overcome.“It’s been incredibly satisfying to work every day with the players and the coaches and the staff to try to overcome certain situations,” he said. “So if somebody tells you at the start of the season: ‘By this time, you have played five times with a red card over half an hour in each of those games, and you have lost this amount of players,’ what’s the bet? You are in the middle of the table, at least, you know, and you are out of the Champions League.“That’s not the situation. So that tells you the resilience, the resources, the ambition that the team has, every individual has, and that has been probably in my time one of the proudest moments to work in that sense. The thing is that when you are there, you want more and you want more and you want more. And I’m not going to stop; over my dead body. We’ll stop thinking that way and putting everything that we possibly can to increase the probability of us winning and being better than the opponent and hitting that performance and those standards constantly, regardless of what happens.”Asked whether he still believed Arsenal could overhaul Liverpool, he said: “If not, I’ll go home. Mathematically, it’s possible. You are there, you have to play every game. Suddenly, three days ago, we could close the gap and you are like: ‘You are one and a half games away.’ It doesn’t matter. We have to continue to go.”Arsenal have dropped 10 points in the five games in which they have been shown red cards, although they did manage to beat Wolves when Lewis-Skelly was dismissed at Molineux before his suspension was overturned by the FA. But while he Arteta acknowledged that individuals must take the blame for indiscipline, Arteta also and recognised that it hasd held his team back.He said: “There are things in certain red cards that we had that we could have done differently. Even though now the rules appear to change again and [have] not considered what it was before. But in other aspects it’s very difficult to change because when you ask the player why they have made that decision, it’s a very spontaneous decision. A very sharp movement or decision-making that caused you the action.

The 32-year-old has 30 goals and 21 assists from 38 appearances this season – 25 goals and 16 assists in the Premier League – and has scored in his past eight outings. Salah requires one more goal to overtake Gordon Hodgson as the third-highest goalscorer in Liverpool’s history.Mohamed Salah turns it up to 11: devotion, dexterity – and a new deal?  | Jonathan LiewRead moreThe Egypt international has just over four months remaining on his contract and, despite stating several times that he wishes to extend, has yet to reach agreement on a new deal. Slot believes the striker’s contribution to Liverpool’s title challenge has reinforced his value to the club.Asked whether Salah’s output made it harder or easier to extend his contract, the head coach replied: “You can look at it in both ways. You can say the better he does the more expensive he might become and if he did really worse we would have second thoughts to extend his contract. For everyone it is best that he brings in the performances he does now; maybe only for the one who has to pay him it is not the best.“For everyone else it is the best because if you want to play at this club you need to be at his level otherwise you are almost useless to play at this club because we only need players that are at the top of their game. Because this is one of the best, or the best, club in the world to play for. He needs to have these performances for him to play here and hopefully to extend here.”Slot believes Salah needs to end this season with a Premier League and/or Champions League winner’s medal to enhance his claims for individual prizes such as the Ballon d’Or. But he insisted the forward’s form was a result of everyone at Liverpool giving their all to win the club’s 20th league championship.“What I see is a top professional, not only what you see on the pitch but he comes in early, works so hard on his body and he works even at home as well,” Slot said. “If I see how much work he puts in over here and then to do so much extra at home, I think he has found the balance to get the best out of himself. That is what comes with experience and playing games at the highest level.“But he is not the only one. I see everyone in this building works so hard. The players first to get the best out of themselves but all the staff members work incredibly hard as well. It is February and we have three pitches which are perfectly ready for us to train in the best possible circumstance. It is not only about the players who put a lot of effort in to get the best out of themselves, it is the whole building and all the people who work here to get the best out of the players as well.”Slot disclosed he had criticised Darwin Núñez at Aston Villa last week because he was also unhappy with the striker’s work rate against Wolves. The Uruguay international received a rare public rebuke from his coach at Villa Park for allowing a glaring miss to affect his performance level. But it was the second game in succession in which Núñez had underwhelmed Slot when coming off the bench.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I know him at Villa at home where he made a 100-metre sprint and scored a goal. I know him when he came on at City at home and pressed really aggressively and wins the ball back and we score.“But I can’t accept if a player doesn’t give everything. That is clear. I can accept it once but twice was a bit too much. That’s why I addressed it. Not that I’m all of a sudden very angry with him. It just wasn’t the usual Darwin, the one that is loved by the fans.

Oppose this robbery of people’s creativity | Andrew Lloyd Webber and Alastair WebberRead moreThe music-free album represents the impact on artists’ livelihoods if the government pushes ahead with its plans, according to Ed Newton-Rex, the British composer and former AI executive behind the idea.“The government’s proposal would hand the life’s work of the country’s musicians to AI companies, for free, letting those companies exploit musicians’ work to outcompete them,” he said.“It is a plan that would not only be disastrous for musicians, but that is totally unnecessary: the UK can be leaders in AI without throwing our world-leading creative industries under the bus.”The project is a protest against agovernment proposal to let AI firms train their algorithms on the work of creative professionalsunder a new copyright exemption. The plan includes “an opt-out” option – where creatives and companies can block their work from being used – that has been dismissed by critics as unfair and unworkable.The album contains 12 recordings with more than 1,000 artists credited as co-writers, with the individual artist behind each of the dozen “silent” tracks uncredited. However, it is understood thatKate Bushhas recorded one of the dozen tracks in her studio.Bush said: “In the music of the future, will our voices go unheard?”The musicians credited as co-writers include Tori Amos, Billy Ocean, the Clash and the Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer as well as theKanneh-Mason family of classical musicians. The track listing spells out the message: “The British government must not legalise music theft to benefit AI companies.”Profits from the album, which is available on streaming services such as Spotify, will be donated to the musicians’ charity Help Musicians.The dispute over AI firms’ use of copyrighted work stems from how they create the technology underpinning their products.The AI models powering systems such as the ChatGPT chatbot, the image creator Stable Diffusion and the music tool Suno are fed vast amounts of data taken from the internet and learn to spot patterns in that information. This allows them to predict the next word in a sentence, create realistic images or produce convincing audio.However, the use of novels, music tracks, newspaper articles, photographs, art and other copyright-protected work without permission has led to a wave of lawsuits from authors, news publishers, music companies and artists.Some companies have signed licensing agreements with AI firms, including the Guardian, which hasstruck a deal with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

The protest also accuses the government of trying to change the law to “favour big tech platforms”.A letter in the Times from 34 leading creatives published on Tuesday also criticises the government’s stance, with signatories including Barbara Broccoli, Helen Fielding, Stephen Fry, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Ed Sheeran and Tom Stoppard.The letter warns that the proposals “represent a wholesale giveaway of rights and income from the UK’s creative sectors to Big Tech”.Warning the government against crushing the creative industries in its drive for growth, Fry said: “You don’t promote growth in a garden by allowing all the pests to feast on the fruit and flowers, and you don’t promote growth in an economy by allowing all the AIs to feast on the fruits of our creators.”A UK government spokesperson said: “As it stands, the UK’s current regime for copyright and AI is holding back the creative industries, media and AI sector from realising their full potential – and that cannot continue.“That’s why we have been consulting on a new approach that protects the interests of both AI developers and rights holders and delivers a solution which allows both to thrive.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Music industryKate BushDamon AlbarnAnnie LennoxnewsShareReuse this content"

The preliminary results will be outlined in a regulatory filing later on Tuesday.Google scraps diversity hiring goals and cites Trump’s DEI ordersRead moreThe outcome vindicated Apple management’s decision to stand behind its diversity commitment even though Trump asked the US Department of Justice to look into whether these types of programs have discriminated against employees whose race or gender are not aligned with the initiatives’ goals.But Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, has maintained a cordial relationship with Trump since his first term in office, an alliance that so far has helped the company skirt tariffs on its iPhones made in China. After Cook and Trump met last week, Apple on Monday announced it would invest $500bn in the US and create 20,000 more jobs during the next five years – a commitment applauded by the president.Tuesday’s shareholder vote came a month after the same group presented a similar proposal during Costco’s annual meeting, only to have it overwhelmingly rejected.That snub did not discourage the National Center for Public Policy Research from confronting Apple about its DEI program in a pre-recorded presentation by Stefan Padfield, executive director of the thinktank’s Free Enterprise Project, who asserted “forced diversity is bad for business”.In the presentation, Padfield attacked Apple’s diversity commitments for being out of line with recent court rulings and said the programs expose the Cupertino, California, company to an onslaught of potential lawsuits for alleged discrimination. He cited theTrump administrationas one of Apple’s potential legal adversaries.“The vibe shift is clear: DEI is out and merit is in,” Padfield said in the presentation.The specter of potential legal trouble was magnified last week when the Florida attorney general, James Uthmeier, filed a federal lawsuit against Target for allegedly failing to properly disclose the financial risks of its DEI programs to stakeholders.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nearly two-thirds of its employees were men.Other major technology companies for years have reported employing mostly white and Asian men, especially in high-paid engineering jobs – a tendency that spurred the industry to pursue largely unsuccessful efforts to diversify.Explore more on these topicsAppleRaceDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

By 2016, he was the proud owner of a Tesla, revelling in the thumbs up he would get from other drivers as he whizzed along Europe’s highways in the electric vehicle.But of late the sheen of owning a Tesla has begun to wear off. For years the brand has been synonymous with Elon Musk and his stance against the climate crisis. Recently, Schwede watched aghast as the Tesla CEOpoured hundreds of millionsinto backing Donald Trump as he made promises to ramp up domestic oil and gas production.“He was getting more and more weird,” said Schwede, an entrepreneur and digital strategist based in Switzerland. The final straw came when Musk made back-to-backfascist-style salutesduring Trump’s inauguration in January. “I felt nothing but utter disgust,” said Schwede. “And I no longer enjoyed sitting in my Tesla.”On Tuesday, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association showedsales of new Tesla cars almost halvedin Europe last month. The figures left analysts scrambling to assess how big a factor customers turning their backs on the brand because of Musk’s foray into far-right politics may be.The Texas-based carmaker sold 9,945 vehicles in Europe in January, down 45% from last year’s 18,161, the association said.View image in fullscreenA parody ‘Tesla – The Swasticar’ advert posted at a London bus stop.Photograph: People vs ElonNow, there are signs existingTeslaowners who have become disgruntled with Musk’s views are making their anger heard.Schwede contemplated selling his car, but after racking up more than 60,000 miles on it, there was little value left in it. So he came up with his own means of reclaiming his Tesla and the liberal ethos that had underpinned his purchase; he began donating 10 cents for every kilometre driven to a range of charities, countering Musk’s support of the far right with direct support tothose who help LGBTQ+ youthor fight hate and extremism. “It was something Elon wouldn’t like,” he said. “That’s my personal revenge.”It’s a hint of how some Tesla owners in Europe are fighting back, putting up their own – albeit small-scale – resistance as Musk wades into global politics, using his wealth to help secure Trump’s return to the White House and his sprawling influence to back far-right and anti-establishment parties across Europe.For Germany’s Patrik Schneider, the turning point came as he was heckled by a stranger at a petrol station, who pointed to his Tesla and called him a Trump supporter. Saddled with a long-term lease on the vehicle, he scrambled to find a way to address his relationship with a brand that – in his mind – had soured.“Of course, as a Tesla driver you were always the fool: the Green party voter, the world saviour, the CO2guy,” Schneider told Germany’s Capital.de media. “But now you’re in a category that’s no longer funny.”What he came up with was a line of “Anti-Elon stickers” for Tesla cars. In an echo ofan American initiative,he began selling the stickers online six months ago, taking orders for messages that range from “I bought this before Elon went crazy” to “Elon sucks”.As Musk waded more deeply into German politics,hosting the far-right AfD’s co-leader, Alice Weidel, in an interview on X andturning up at an AfD rallywhere he disparaged multiculturalism and lambasted the country’s focus on “past guilt”, demand for the stickers soared.View image in fullscreenThe far-right AfD’s Alice Weidel talks online to Elon Musk during her speech at an election campaign launch.Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/EPADemand has now climbed to as much as 2,000 stickers a day, with orders pouring in from across the German-speaking world but as far as Australia and South Korea. All of it was done without any advertising, said Schneider, adding wryly: “Elon Musk does that for us.”Others have called for the actions to go further. In Poland – where the Nazi German occupation led to the deaths of 6 million Poles, including 3 million Jews – the country’s tourism minister called on citizens to boycott Tesla after Musk’s surprise appearance at the AfD rally. “All I can say is that probably no normal Pole should buy a Tesla any more,” Sławomir Nitras recently told Polish broadcaster Tok FM. “A serious and strong response is necessary, including a consumer boycott.”In August, the German drugstore chain Rossmann saidit would no longer buy Tesla cars for its corporate fleet, citing Musk’s support for Trump, while the German energy company LichtBlick said on social media that it would be “pulling the plug” on the Tesla vehicles in its fleet, citing Musk’s backing of “a rightwing populist and extremist party”.The message was echoed recently by UK-based campaign group Led by Donkeys after theyprojected images of Musk’s salute on to the facade of the Tesla gigafactorynear Berlin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Tottenham, north London, a member of the activist group People vs Elon took a cardboard cutout of Musk’s salute into a Tesla dealership.In Sweden, the EV maker Polestar has sought to capitalise on the discontent. “We get a lot of people writing that they don’t like all this,” the company’s CEO, Michael Lohscheller,told Bloomberg, adding that he had directed sales staff to target disgruntled Tesla owners.After a Dutch pollsuggested31% of respondents who owned Teslas were considering selling them or had already done so, it remains to be seen what the impact will be on the company. Matthias Schmidt, a Germany-based automotive analyst, said “2025 will be one of the biggest tests for Tesla.”“With all respect, consumers tend to be like goldfish; they tend to forget things very quickly,” Schmidt added. “But Germany is potentially slightly different because of its history … The shift to him backing the AfD was potentially far more damaging in Germany than his move to back Trump.”View image in fullscreenElon Musk wields a chainsaw during his appearance at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in the US.Photograph: Carol Guzy/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockLast year, Tesla saw sales in Germanyplunge 41%– outpacing the overall 27% decline in EVs across the country – as rivals rolled out their own electric vehicles and governments rolled back subsidies.Figures for early 2025showthat Tesla sales fell sharply across several European markets.

But late last month, Musk appeared to be upbeat during a call with investors, hinting that 2025 may be a tough year but that 2026 would be “epic” for the company.“Musk is kind of like a character that – like a cat – has nine lives,” said Schmidt. “And he’s almost used up those nine lives.

No doubt kudos here should mostly be due to director Cutter Hodierne and screenwriter John Hibey, as well as their crew and cast, but it’s tempting to sense a light Soderberghian touch in Cold Wallet’s blackly comic look at how cryptocurrency eats the soul of all who meddle in its black arts.Charismatic Raúl Castillo stars as protagonist Billy, a bit of a screw-up who is neck deep in a crypto called – tellingly for those aware of the history of bubble stocks – Tulip. Hoping to cash out enough to buy a house so he can gain better access to his daughter who lives with his bitter ex-wife (Zoe Winters from Succession), Billy is the proverbialthis closeto his goal when the currency suddenly tanks after reports of the sudden death of its founder. Now, Billy finds he actually owes money. The same goes for his good friend, hippy-jock Dom (Tony Cavalero), who Billy talked into investing in Tulip and is now at risk of losing his gym business.Eva (Melonie Diaz), another Tulip investor Billy met through subreddits, works out that Tulip’s founder, Charles Hegel (Josh Brener, from Silicon Valley), is not dead at all; in fact, he’s conveniently holed up in a mansion not far away. So Eva, Dom and Billy set out to find him, and then strong-arm him into compensating not just themselves but everyone who has lost out in the Tulip bust. Naturally, it’s not as straightforward as all that, and while they duly find Hegel, the gap between the trio’s competence and Hegel’s slippery, manipulative wiliness is significant. There’s a lot of nerd talk about passkeys, cold wallets and whatnot, but the film is to its credit much more interested in psychology rather than tech, and the fine lines between avarice, rage and impotence that make the capitalist world go round.Cold Wallet is on digital platforms from 3 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersCryptocurrenciesSteven SoderberghE-commerceInternetreviewsShareReuse this content"

Some are forced on governments by circumstance. Others are self‑imposed. Labour’sdecisionto cut the aid budget to “pay” for increased defence spending is firmly in the latter category. It is also wrong – forcing the world’s poor to pay for Britain’s safety. This is a false economy. Cutting aid will make the world more unstable, not less. The very crises that fuel conflict – poverty, failed states, climate disasters and mass displacement – will only worsen with less development funding. Labour’s logic is self‑defeating: diverting money from aid to defence does not buy security; it undermines it.The numbers tell the story. Despite government attempts to inflate theamountsinvolved, the extra£5bn‑£6bnfor defence is tiny relative to Britain’s GDP. The UK could easily absorb this throughborrowing– especially in a global financial system wheresterlingis heavily traded – or, if the government prefers, through a modest wealth tax. Yet Sir Keir Starmer has chosen to frame this as a zero-sum game, where aid must give way to security. Why? Because this is not about economic necessity – it’s about political positioning. Labour wants to prove that it can be fiscally disciplined even when the numbers don’t demand it. It wants to neutraliseTory attacks, even when the real battle is over priorities, not affordability.It is also a move that aligns with Donald Trump’s worldview. The US president wants to close down theUS government’s main overseas aid agency, treating it as an expensive indulgence rather than a pillar of foreign policy. Sir Keir is set to go to Washington this week. A UK prime minister that echoes Mr Trump’s “America first” instincts on defence and aid may find the meeting more congenial. If so, Sir Keir may be taking the idea that “the meek shall inherit the earth” a little too literally.Labour doesn’t just believe in fiscal discipline, it believes that it must believe in fiscal discipline and it constructs a justification for that belief. The problem is this: by accepting Conservative trade‑offs, Labour locks itself into an orthodoxy that it may later need to break. In a volatile world, Britain – outside the EU – must boost high-value exports and cut reliance on fragile supply chains. Even under Joe Biden, the UK was kept out of theUS-EU Trade and Technology Council, which strengthened transatlantic industrial policy. Yet when does Downing Street admit Britain’s real limit is productive capacity – not budget deficits?Britain’s fiscal constraint is artificial, but its resource constraints are real. Energy, food and manufacturing are matters of national security, not just market functions. Without investment, dependence on key imports makes Britain vulnerable to supply-chain shocks and price inflation. That should make the announcements by Labour’sEd MilibandandSteve Reedmatter. If every pound spent requires a cut elsewhere, neither would have had much to say.Sir Keir often presents himself as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue – claiming to be adapting to circumstances rather than adhering to dogma. But such pragmatism is itself a belief system, one that treats capitalism’s rules as unchangeable, markets as beyond politics, and history as a one‑way street where past mistakes justify permanent, crippling caution. In doing so, he isn’t just rejecting alternatives – he’s rewriting history to suggest they were never an option to begin with.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But we have a common enemyAlejandra Gomez and Greisa Martínez RosasBillionaires have sown a myth that citizens are losing at the expense of undocumented people. The real solution is to empower all workersTue 25 Feb 2025 12.59 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 14.00 ESTShareOver the last few years, we have witnessed some leaders of theDemocraticparty retreat from delivering bold policies that would address people’s struggles and aspirations, from a pathway to citizenship for all to a higher federal minimum wage, in favor of Republican-light talking points about the border and those seeking asylum – which only eroded trust with the American people.Right now, 60% of the country is living paycheck to paycheck. Families are drowning in debt, whether it be from trying to pay for unaffordable childcare, exorbitant student loans, costly medical bills or months of missed rent payments. Homelessness has skyrocketed. Millions are struggling to survive another day and are penny-pinching to be able to afford rent and groceries, while billions of our taxpayer dollars are being spent on turbocharging mass abductions of our neighbors through raids and deportations, all in service of filling detention centers that make the CEOs of companies like GeoGroup and CoreCivic richer by the minute.Barely a month into the Trump administration and already we have seen senators from both parties support the Laken Riley Act, a highly exploitative, anti-immigrant bill that Trump signed into law, opening the floodgates to his mass detention and deportation agenda. As we speak, Congress is pushing forward a massive budget resolution that would gut billions in funding for vital resources such as education, healthcare and food assistance programs like Snap, while pouring $350bn towards targeting immigrants.Our obligation is to radically shift the public’s consciousness to center our interdependence as working people – immigrants and non-immigrants alikeAs immigrants and as organizers, our obligation at this moment is to radically shift the public’s consciousness in such a way that centers our interdependence as working people – immigrants and non-immigrants alike. We must wield our collective power against our common enemy and recognize that we have never been in competition with one another, despite what corporations, billionaires and some elected officials would like us to believe. Rather, our fights are the same.Progressive young leaders and organizations like ours are working to bring together a vast multiracial coalition of workers across the country who recognize immigrants cannot be left behind. Trump’s crusade is an opportunity we cannot miss to come together stronger than ever before. We have a shared enemy in the billionaire forces who have bought their way into our government and Trump’s good graces and whose interests elected officials on both sides of the aisle protect over ours.It’s time to get real about the fact that the wealthiest 1% in this country has kicked their feet up and watched the vast majority of people suffer and fight over breadcrumbs. They have planted and watered hateful seeds of division and individualism to sell communities the lie that we should only look out for ourselves and that our neighbors, especially immigrants, are not our comrades.Tracking Trump – updates on the presidency’s first 100 daysRead moreTake, for instance, the myth that Trump and rightwing billionaires have sown that American workers are losing at the expense of undocumented workers. The issue is not a lack of jobs in this country or that undocumented people came to the US in search of an overall better life. Past crackdowns on immigrants are proof that this has never resulted in more jobs for US-born workers; it hasn’t made life better or easier. In fact, it’s made life more expensive for everyone.Agriculture, for example, is an industry in which about70% of crop workerswere born outside the United States and at least 40% are undocumented. Mass deportations would assuredly result in supply chain breakdowns and soaring food prices. But rich corporations benefit from letting animosity brew between working-class communities; they benefit from keeping immigrant workers and US-born workers in contention with one another. If they can continue to exploit millions of undocumented people who are desperate to survive, they will also be able to underpay their US-born workers who are demanding higher wages by simply showing that there are desperate people willing to work for less. At the end of the day, executives have chosen to make a buck at the expense of all their workers, undocumented and otherwise.The real solution is to level the playing field for all workers and families in the US and to grow our collective labor power. Undocumented workers don’t want to be exploited. They have shared dreams with US-born workers: to make a dignified living, provide for their families, and improve their quality of life. A high minimum wage for all workers, in conjunction with a pathway to citizenship, ensures that companies cannot massively underpay and exploit undocumented people and cut jobs and wages to natural-born citizens at the same time.As organizations led by Black, brown, immigrant young people, our commitment is to represent our members and build political power to counter that of Super Pacs and billionaire donors. To advance this work requires deeper community organizing and relationship building to bridge the trust gap between American workers, everyday people and undocumented communities. Together, we must build a shared understanding that we need each other. Immigrants have always been key to breakthroughs in climate justice, housing justice, labor power, LGBTQ+ justice and so much more.The only way forward is for masses of everyday people across race, age, gender and geography to rise up together in a shared fight; whether we are fighting for a pathway to citizenship, higher wages or affordable housing, we cannot win any of these on our own.This vision – our movement’s vision – is not just for immigrants. It is for everyone.Alejandra Gomez is executive director of Living United for Change in Arizona (Lucha).

This is the paradoxical condition that occurs from time to time when the ruling party and the official opposition are forced by circumstance to have the same policy, while compelled by traditional enmity to resent the convergence.The pressure on Keir Starmer toraise defence spendingto 2.5% of gross domestic product has been building steadily in recent months, and independently of Tory demands that he do it.The case was already compelling last year. A violent storm was raging on Europe’s eastern frontiers and the cost of Britain’s commitment to protectUkraineagainst Russian aggression was mounting. It was clear that higher defence spending would be the necessary insurance premium to cover Europe against Vladimir Putin’s insatiable malevolence.That requirement became a matter of national emergency whenDonald Trumpreturned to the White House, sent the thrust of US policy on Ukraine into reverse and left the US’s Nato allies feeling abandoned and exposed.Trump’s endorsement of a Kremlin agenda – his characterisation of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,as a dictatorand the demand that assistance already given be repaid in surrender of land and mineral resources – signalled the advent of a new epoch on global affairs. US foreign policy is now modelled on a mafia extortion racket. Protection is procured with tribute. Territory and any lucrative commerce attached to it is carved up between bosses. The more powerful among them takes the bigger share.This way of doing international deals is perfectly aligned with the post-Soviet model of Russian statecraft that is a hybrid of bloodthirsty imperialism and gangster kleptocracy. It promises a slide back into the kind of ruthless competition for supremacy inEuropethat western democracies spent decades after the second world war trying to make obsolete.It is an existential crisis for the edifice of multilateral trade, mutual legal obligations and international institutions that, when the cold war ended, made it possible for countries such as Britain to spend less on guns and more on everything else.Now, somewhat belatedly, Starmer has recognised that the flow of resources must go the other way. Defence spending will rise to 2.5% of GDP (2.6% if security service budgets are in the mix) by 2027, with 3% as the eventual target. The money will come initially from the overseas aid budget – a symbolic and practical reorientation of Britain’s posture from soft to hard power.The prime minister was at pains to say how unhappy he was raiding funds that support international development, pleading the absence of easy money and the unprecedented gravity of the hour. The somewhat fanciful consolation on offer is a growth dividend, with military investment doubling as a new industrial strategy, creating jobs and stimulating economic activity.This is unlikely to be the last time that national security is cited as a reason for shifting resources away from things thatLabourMPs would much rather be funding. But their disapproval is not much of an obstacle for now because the reorientation of budget priorities enjoys cross-party support.Shortly before Tuesday’s announcement, Kemi Badenoch hadmade a speechcalling on the government to implement something on very similar lines. Starmer didn’t yield to Tory demands but the timing of the two interventions, just a few hours apart, isn’t coincidental. Both were timed to preface the prime minister’s trip to Washington later this week.Starmer is not given to impulsive acts. His preferred mode of government is methodical to a degree that infuriates colleagues who see it as a symptom of political flat-footedness. He had not wanted to commit to higher military spending before publication of a strategic defence review. His argument was that it was better to set a budget only after you know what it is you have to buy.That question has been settled by Trump. Britain needs to procure status as one of Nato’s big spenders. Extra money pledged for defence is the admission fee levied by the White House for Europeans wanting to join the discussion about Ukraine’s future. Starmer’s announcement is a calling card and, he hopes, a boost to his credentials with a man who seesNatoas a scam for siphoning Pentagon treasure into European pockets.That part of the discussion is not new. It is a gripe voiced by previous administrations, Democrats as well as Republicans. But only the incumbent president couples it with generalised contempt for European allies and glowing admiration for the tyrant who menaces them.Under those circumstances, the decision to ramp up defence spending makes sense both as a manoeuvre to help steer Trump away from betraying Europe completely, and as planning for the scenario where he does. It is consistent with Starmer’s modus operandi since first becoming Labour leader. He prefers, wherever possible, to defer a difficult choice, pending collection of all the data, surveilling a problem from every angle. Then, when it is time for making his mind up, usually in the heat of some crisis, he acts with a fixity of purpose that contains no trace of the prior equivocation.It is decision-making at a pace that isn’t calibrated to the frantic spin-cycle of the Westminster news machine. It feels sometimes as if the prime minister belongs to a different age, as if he is stubbornly conducting himself in the staid, analogue way of politics, only periodically dropping into the breathless, inflamed digital era to deliver some stilted pronouncement on grave matters of state.The verdict this time is that Britain is transitioning to a wartime economy. If there was a lingering question about what this Labour government was for – what Starmer’s ministry would ultimately beabout– this is the answer. It is a gruelling mission of rearmament and renewed national focus on security, in a dangerous world where the US is an unreliable source of protection and its president can’t be counted as a friend.This is a tough prospectus for a country that is craving economic respite. British society is not primed for the call to yet more collective sacrifice. Good times have been promised and deferred so often that confidence in any politician’s timetable for their return is gone.The national reserve of blitz spirit has been depleted by too many peacetime invocations over the years. This time, sadly, the martial language is no metaphor. That doesn’t give Starmer a great deal more leeway. His inscrutability is a barrier to persuasion. He doesn’t match many people’s archetype of a charismatic wartime leader. But he is also capable of wielding the authority of his office with purposeful, old-fashioned solidity. There are worse traits a prime minister could have – and much worse leaders on display – in this frightening new era.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In the late 1940s, myLabourpredecessor and hero Ernie Bevin, alongside Clement Attlee, saw through the fog when they led Britain into Nato and the UN, and secured the development of Britain’s nuclear deterrent. In the 1960s, Harold Wilson saw through the paranoia of the cold war, refusing Lyndon Johnson’s request to send British troops to Vietnam. In the 1990s, Tony Blair understood that unless we stopped the president of Serbia, Slobodan Milošević, there would be no peace in the Balkans.Three years into Vladimir Putin’s brutal war, this is again a hinge point for Britain. Keir Starmer’s commitment to dramatically raise defence spending in both this and the next parliament shows his leadership through the fog. Putin’s Russia is a threat not only to Ukraine and its neighbours, but to all of Europe, including the UK. Over successive administrations, our closest ally, the US, has turned increasingly towards the Indo-Pacific, and it is understandably calling for Nato’s European members to shoulder more of the burden for our continent’s security. Around the world, the threats are multiplying: from traditional warfare to hybrid threats and cyber-attacks.The first duty and foundation of this government’s plan for change is our national security. Seven months ago, the public gave us this responsibility, and we hold it with a profound sense of duty. Under the Conservatives, the foundations of our defence were weakened. The UK has not reached adefence spending level of 2.5% of GDP since Labour was last in government. And it falls to a Labour government to restore those foundations once again. We will deliver the biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the cold war because we are the party of defence. So we will hit our 2.5% promise in 2027 and, subject to economic conditions, go further, with defence spending rising to 3% during the next parliament. This is a pledge to safeguard our future – and act as a pillar of security on our continent – in a world plagued by more active conflicts than at any time since the second world war.Starmer announces big cut to UK aid budget to boost defence spendingRead moreTo make this commitment, and stick within our fiscal rules, we have had to make the extremely difficult decision to lower our spending on international development. As the prime minister said, we do not pretend any of this is easy. This is a hard choice that no government – let alone a Labour government – makes lightly. I am proud of our record on international development. It helps address global challenges from health to migration, contributes to prosperity, and supports the world’s most vulnerable people. It grows both our soft power and our geopolitical clout, while improving lives. For all of those reasons, this government remains committed to reverting spending on overseas aid to 0.7% of gross national income when the fiscal conditions allow.But we are a government of pragmatists not ideologues – and we have had to balance the compassion of our internationalism with the necessity of our national security.As we reduce the overseas aid budget, we will protect the most vital programmes in the world’s worst conflict zones ofUkraine, Gaza and Sudan. But there can be no hiding from the fact that many programmes doing vital work will have to be put on hold. The work of making further tough choices about programmes will proceed at pace over the weeks and months ahead, but our core priorities will remain the same. My vision for a reformed Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office fit for this more contested and dangerous world, in which diplomacy is more important than ever, remains paramount. We are working closely with the Treasury to ensure our diplomatic, intelligence and development footprint will align with our priorities. In a tough fiscal environment, all our spending must be laser-focused on delivering the maximum possible impacts for our national security and growth, equipping the FCDO to deliver the government’s plan for change internationally.At the height of the cold war, defence spending fluctuated between about 4% and 7% of GDP. At this moment of fiscal and geopolitical flux, not meeting the moment on defence would mean leaving Britain ill-prepared for a more dangerous world, potentially requiring even tougher choices down the line.I have written previously about this government’s foreign policy beingfounded on progressive realism. Being clear about our values, but treating the world as it is, not as we would wish it to be. These are the principles that guide our choices through these dangerous times. We will always do what is necessary to keep the public safe.David Lammy is British foreign secretaryDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In the 30 years since medical school we have exchanged many opinions but a constant has been the curveball questions thrown up by patient care. Questions that don’t have a clear answer that nonetheless test us.A new patient from last week has unexpectedly returned a biopsy showing cancer. The man typically defers his appointments, citing an inflexible work schedule. His first visit was delayed by a month and he doesn’t intend to return for the results any time soon. But suddenly, he doesn’t have the luxury of time. To plan treatment, the tumour board will need specialised tests. The tests can hardly be ordered without the patient knowing why.“What should I do if he just won’t come?” she vexes.“Call him to disclose the diagnosis so he can move forward.”Should Australia’s GPs and patients be excited about the Medicare pledge? Yes and no | Mariam TokhiRead moreShe flinches, saying she cannot imagine delivering such life-changing news over the phone.“It sounds so impersonal,” she protests, as I simultaneously say, “I do it all the time.”Her concern leaves me feeling callous.That morning, my emails contain many important results. Public hospital waiting lists are long, resources thin. It would take a sophisticated miracle to coordinate the timing of results with the timing of appointments.In oncology, handling the good results is easy: most patients will gladly accept the news from a nurse and wait patiently for a doctor’s appointment.But when the news is bad, people reasonably expect a doctor to be at hand to answer the question, “What does this mean for me?” To add stress, patients are increasingly handed their results from another provider not equipped to explain their significance or download their own results without understanding what they mean.My friend is right: all our patients deserve to be seen in person. Difficult news conveyed compassionately and sensitively does not alter the facts but does change the patient experience.Still, knowing this does not always change what I can do.Of the results in front of me, the most concerning is the emergence of liver metastases in a patient who has always been well. How to break bad news to someone going about her usual workday? Perhaps she is in a meeting, or doing the groceries, or pruning her flowers.Finding a face-to-face appointment will delay an entire procession of events. The wait itself might not be consequential but the fact of it would be disquieting.On the other hand, a cold call sounds, well, cold. There will be no gaze to meet, hand to touch, or silence to mark together. If she failed to answer, what voicemail would I leave? If she asked if it was urgent, how would I reply?Staring at the pictures of her liver, I ask myself how this patient in this set of circumstances might want to hear bad news. Her file holds reams of information gathered over years. What she is allergic to. What her hobbies are. What treatments she has had.Perhaps someone should have asked well before now: “How do you like your bad news delivered?” Absent her input, I use my instinct.The phone call is excruciating. She is shocked but also as pragmatic, as I had predicted.But if making these phone calls is hard, ending them is somehow worse, knowing that afterwards patients are left alone to face the onslaught of new worries. Shunning platitudes, I simply say that a small army of people is on her case and we will soon be in touch.That whole night, I am uneasy. The next day bleeds into evening before I bring myself to call her. She sounds vigilant, leading me to reassure her that there is no more bad news. I am merely calling to check in after what must have been a difficult 24 hours.It has been, she admits, but not why I might think. “If something happens to me, my daughter won’t have a parent.”Somehow, no matter how many angles a doctor considers, there is always something else that steals up on you. Her matter-of-fact remark pierces me as a mother.Albanese’s bulk billing pledge renews the promise at the heart of Medicare | Bill BowtellRead moreI listen quietly as she ponders the what-ifs. Without replacing her concerns, I talk about the promising treatments I hope to use and reassure her that I too want her to be well for as long as possible.She mentions her best friend who rushed to her side. Then, noting the late hour, she asks if I have eaten. I think how her fortitude has restored my appetite.“Listen, I am very grateful you called,” she says, her voice catching. The fervour in her voice touches me since I had hesitated to make the call.Medical training focuses a lot on saving lives but not nearly enough about navigatingwhat my colleague callsthe “existential weight of dying”.Future uncertainty mixed with anticipatory grief is hard to witness and hard to treat, demanding the kind of sustained attention and dedication to the whole person inimical to the business model of medicine. But treating gravely ill patients like customers also extracts a cost – in terms of patient health and provider satisfaction.This is the balancing act of medicine. When we get it right, there is no better feeling.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

In Africa, it’s time for the patriarchy to give wayMinna SalamiAll-male elections at the African Union highlighted the exclusion of talented women from power. The continent cannot thrive like thatTue 25 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTShareWhat does it mean to be African? Is it simply being one of the 1.5 billion people from the continent? Does African mean the same as black? If you are a descendant from the UK, US, Brazil or Cuba, are you still African? Are only black Africans African, or does this include white Zimbabweans and Arab Egyptians? Or is Africa merely“a western invention”?These questions are passionately debated. To be African is to inhabit an identity shaped by a complicated history, politics and geography. Yet there is one aspect of this identity that receives far less discussion: namely, do we see Africans as male?This may sound glib, but it’s a valid question. Africanness may be perceived as neutral, yet it is overwhelmingly shaped by male experiences. This is evident in political leadership, cultural representation, intellectual traditions and social structures, where men dominate positions of influence. It is African men who define the continent’s ideas, values, traditions and cultural beliefs – setting the parameters of African identity.At theirannual summit last weekin Addis Ababa, members of the African Union (AU) – the continent’s most powerful political organisation – elected Djibouti’s foreign minister, Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, as the next chair of the African Union Commission. The other two candidates – Raila Odinga of Kenya and Richard Randriamandrato of Madagascar – were also, as usual, men.Since its founding in 1963 (originally as the Organisation of African Unity), the AU has had only one female leader: the South African politician and anti-apartheid activist Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, elected in 2012. Introducing the leadership debate in Addis Ababa in December, the former Ethiopian ambassador Konjit Sinegiorgis, who is female, put it bluntly: “I regret the fact that our continent could not also have a female candidate, and place the AU Commission on the right side of history.”Statements such as hers are often made but rarely heard. As far as gender is concerned, the African male position holds firm at the top, and few men see a reason to change that. The AU’s slogan is “The Africa We Want”, but in practice it has been “The Africa Men Want”. While efforts toward equality exist, these remain isolated instances rather than systemic changes.So if women were equal architects of the continent, what kind of structures would they build? How would Africa’s “founding mothers” shape issues such as its global role, conflict resolution, democratic leadership or land ownership?Consider land: most African farmers are women, yet many are denied land ownership simply because they are not entitled to own property or manage money. The Nigerian senate, for instance, has repeatedlyblocked a billadvocating for rural women’s right to agricultural credit and loans, dismissing it as “antagonistic to African traditions”. If African traditions enable only men to manage land, then it seems women are not fully African.You might argue that theAfrican Unionis just one institution: more telling, however, is the ideology behind it.Pan-Africanism has shaped modern African identity more than any other movement. Yet, from its earliest days, it has been almost exclusively male-driven. Thefirst Pan-African Conference in 1919was all-male. The founding of the Organisation of African Unity, which institutionalised pan-Africanism, was an all-male affair. From political summits and intellectual manifestos to cultural festivals and literary journals, pan-Africanism has largely ignored African women’s experiences.This exclusion isn’t just political or economic – though it certainly is that, with womenowning less than 10% of land. It is also existential. If African identity has been wounded by colonisation, dispersal and exploitation, then African women must also contend with the fact that even the very definition of being African is entrenched in male power.None of this is an invitation to the colonialist logic that African women need saving from African men, especially not by another corresponding patriarchal system imported from the west: the oppression of African women is sustained as much by neocolonial power structures as by male supremacy. Rather, this moment calls for anAfrican feminist politics, not only for women but for the continent itself. This politics must assert women’s voices in Africa’s story, not merely as glorified heroines of the past or revered mother figures but as active shapers of all the economic, sociocultural, and political institutions – including the AU – that shape Africa’s place in the world.In 1963,Julius Nyerere, Tanzania’s first president, coined the term“Africanness”, describing it as “a feeling of mutual involvement, which pervades all the political and cultural life of the continent”. If only that feeling of mutual involvement had truly pervaded: perhaps we would be further along the path toward healing, unity and conscientious leadership.But just because past definitions of African identity have been male-centred doesn’t mean they cannot change.Womencan be equal makers of Africa’s future. It won’t be easy, but it will be worth it. It will require separating Africanness from maleness. It will mean seeing African identity not just from the thresholds of male experience, but from female experience too.Minna Salami is the author ofCan Feminism be African?and founder of theMsAfropolitan blogDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There’s a suspected culprit when celebrity after celebrity demonstrates a dramatic and sudden drop in size; one that made Danish pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordiskthe most valuable companyin Europe last year, and which Denmark has used as abargaining chip as retaliationto the US when Trump announced his plans to take over Greenland.Yes, it’s the widespread use of anti-obesity jabs (often referred to as GLP-1 drugs). Ina 2024 poll, 12% of those surveyed in the US said they had taken or were taking them, with the numbers rising steeply year by year.This is roughly the same as estimates of antidepressant usage in the American population and far higher than the numbers taking heartburn medication. It’s become a coveted luxury inmiddle- and low-income countries, with high prices being the main barrier to usage – the cost is $95 a month in Brazil and $115 in South Africa, compared with about $350 in the US.It’s not clear how many people are taking them in the UK: while prescriptions can be tracked, these are just part of the story of usage, given the growing online “hidden market”. This is where people hear about weight-loss drugs and find pharmacy or beauty websites to buy them from, withmajor risksto their health. Despite looking authentic, online purchases can be counterfeit and have quality issues.One of myprevious columnslooked at how these drugs, called GLP-1 agonists, work. Right now, I’m more interested in what we’ve learned from usage over the past few years of widespread use. Surprisingly, as sales and awareness went up, there has been no published evaluation of their effectiveness on health outcomes and risks in the overall population. However,a recent studypublished in Nature Medicine sheds some light.The authors went into the US Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare databases to identify individuals with diabetes who were on various types of treatments, including GLP-1 drugs. These almost 2 million people were followed, on average, for three and a half years to track the impact of drugs on 175 health outcomes. In those people taking GLP-1 drugs, there was reduced risk of substance use and psychotic disorders, seizures, Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, cardiometabolic disorders and several respiratory conditions.A journey on weight-loss drug OzempicRead moreOn the flipside, there was increased risk of gastrointestinal disorders, pancreatitis, arthritic disorders, hypotension (very low blood pressure), fainting, kidney stones and kidney disease. GLP-1 drugs stimulate thepancreas to make insulin, but in doing so, can cause internal inflammation. And given their mechanism of triggering satiety and slowing digestion, GLP-1 drugs have been linked to nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation and more severe stomach disease.A major limitation of the study was that the patients enrolled were largely older, mostly white males who received the drugs because of medical advice and to manage their diabetes. We don’t yet have a good longitudinal study on the health impacts for those taking the drug purely for weight loss, especially those within a healthy weight range already, which is linked to the uncertain data on the percentage of people acquiring the drug without a prescription – we simply don’t know much about the health and background of these people, or even how to identify and enrol them into a study.What about for tackling obesity? In terms of their intervention as a public health tool, the expert view is mixed. One view is that this is an incredibly valuable tool for dealing with the chronic disease burden, and the main issue is accessibility and price. For example, University of Torontoprofessor emeritus Peter Singerhas argued that widespread access globally could save almost a million lives a year for people with obesity and linked diseases. Adifferent view isthat we are simply ignoring the real drivers of obesity: cheap junk food, rubbish school meals and pricey nutritious food. I don’t think there’s a consensus among my colleagues yet, probably due to large uncertainty over the side effects and long-term risks of taking this medication, and awareness that prevention is better than cure.Personally, I tend towards the precautionary principle – that is, when we don’t fully understand the potential benefits or costs of an intervention, we err on the side of caution. Obviously, if a doctor prescribes a GLP-1 drug as necessary, that’s a medical decision made on an individual basis. However, if you’re able to manage your weight with diet and exercise, themental and physical health benefitsare huge. It’s about strength, muscle mass, cardiovascular fitness and good nutrition. At a population level, otherwise healthy individuals going down the path of lifelong dependency on a medication with major side effects is concerning. But the draw of weight loss can be very powerful. Ironically, many of those – such as Elon Musk – who wentback and forthonaccepting the safetyofCovid vaccines, seem super eager to get jabbed byGLP-1 drugs, damn any potential side effects. Ah yes, because Covid-19 vaccines were only about reduced risk of death, not losing weight.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, and the author of the How Not to Die (Too Soon)Explore more on these topicsObesityOpinionDiabetesPharmaceuticals industryHealthFood & drink industryDiets and dietingcommentShareReuse this content"

The continuing official British position, echoed by all the main media, has been “no peace without a Ukraine victory” – meaning, centrally, the expulsion of Russia from all territories seized since 2014. President Trump’s active search for a compromise peace tears up this script.When a long, consistently pursued policy ends in a shambles, it is time to reflect on what was right and what was wrong about it, and what might still be done to reinsert Britain into a process to which it has become largely irrelevant.What was right was the forthright condemnation of Russia’s so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine. Most of the world’s governments agreed: by141 votes to five, with 35 abstentions, the UN general assembly passed a resolution on 2 March 2022 condemning Russia’s aggression and demanding the withdrawal of its troops from Ukraine.However, the British response was muddled from the start. It recognised that Ukraine could not resist the Russian attack indefinitely, but at the same time ruled out both peace negotiations and Nato military intervention. The contradiction between militaristic rhetoric and unwillingness to “do what it takes” to secure victory for fear of Russian retaliation was the crucial fissure in the British approach. No one was willing to risk nuclear war to save Ukraine.Logically, this should have led to a search by Ukraine’s supporters for a compromise peace before Ukraine’s position significantly worsened. Peace initiatives have come from China, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico, Hungary and Pope Francis. India has consistently urged diplomacy to end the conflict.But within the UK, the only acceptable condition of peace was a Ukrainian victory. It is even alleged that Britain’s then prime minister, Boris Johnson,scuppered a provisional peace agreementbetween Russia and Ukraine in early April 2022.The question, therefore, is why almost no one in our country over the three following years has been willing to back negotiations to end the war, despite increasing recognition that Ukraine could not prevail at the existing level of military and economic support.I wrote on this issue extensively, but found scant interest from British publications. And from my perch in the House of Lords I repeatedly heard ministers say it was up to Ukraine to decide when, and on what terms, to make peace. To give such an unconditional guarantee to a country without a formal treaty obligation was the abnegation of prudent statesmanship.So why this refusal to back peace on any but Ukraine’s terms? Let me suggest three strands in the thinking of Britain’s governing class that culminated in the single voice.The first, and possibly most potent, the repurposing for current use of the domino theory, developed in the cold war era to justify military resistance to the spread of communism. The argument was that if you give ground to communism in one place (eg South Vietnam), the rest of the region will topple like a row of dominoes. The post-communist version of domino theory is that if Vladimir Putin is allowed to “get away with it” in Ukraine he will seek to gobble up all the adjacent bits ofEuropeand “who knows where he will stop?”Why the revival of domino theory? The answer is that with the collapse of the hopes of a fully democratic world, the ideological battle between the free and communist worlds is seen to have morphed into a global battle between democracy and dictatorship, with Ukraine positioned on the frontline of the democracies.In this geopolitical worldview, dictatorship is the warlike, democracy the peaceful form of the state, so that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine wasunprovokedby definition. This formula conveniently sets to one side any discussion of the extent to which Nato’s eastern expansion to the borders of post-communist Russia, condemned at the time as catastrophic by bothGeorge Kennanand Henry Kissinger, may have provoked Putin’s responses of 2014 and 2022.A subset of this argument harks back to the shame of the Munich agreement of 1938 and the lessons to be drawn from it. The chief lesson was that one must never appease dictators because they will always want more: hence the continuous comparison between Putin and Hitler, with all contextual and psychological differences between the two set aside.The second strand in British policy is moralism. In the 19th century this embraced all forms of anti-war sentiment: groups such as the Quakers who were pacifists on principle, and prudential pacifists, chiefly political economists, who attacked war because of its expense but also because they had discovered in free trade the peaceful, or non zero-sum, form of international relations. Prudential pacifists such asRichard Cobden and John Brightalso assigned a large role to diplomacy to adjust economic and political differences between countries.The imperialist surge of the second half of the 19th century increasingly submerged the pacifist approach, but not its moralism. Imperialism was repackaged as a western duty to bring civilised values to the lagging parts of the world. The sense of moral superiority and therefore of moral responsibility became the hallmark of British foreign policy in the run up to the first world war.The third strand, dating from the second world war, is the “special relationship” with the US. What happened here is that Britain’s sense of moral responsibility for the good of the world was hived off to the new hegemon, the United States. Britain would be Greece to America’s Rome, as Harold Macmillan put it. This has given to British utterances on foreign policy their mingled flavour of moralism and impotence.The British approach to the Ukrainian war has combined all three strands. The equation of dictatorship with war, and comparison between Putin and Hitler, precluded any diplomatic effort to end the war. There was no questioning of the moral purpose of Nato; and Britain’s Greece has been even more bellicose than America’s Rome.Now that the British script on Ukraine has been torn up, can we somehow insert ourselves into a peace process that we repeatedly disdained? Certainly not by sending British “peacekeepers” to Ukraine, asKeir Starmerhas suggested. Our prime minister must know this is a deal breaker, not maker, as there is not the slightest chance Putin will agree to it. Rather it is a desperate attempt to save Britain’s face.What Britain and its European partners should now be doing is opening an adult conversation with Ukraine’s leadership – with Volodymyr Zelenskyy as well as his possible successors – on the kind of peace Ukraine might make that Europe would be willing to underwrite. It is by making Ukrainian voices relevant to the Trump-Putin lovefest that Britain might hope to recover its own relevance and dignity.Robert Skidelsky is a crossbench peer in the House of Lords and author of Keynes: the Return of the Master and co-author of How Much Is Enough?

Our work has employed thousands globally, nurturing the next generation of talent. Copyright is the foundation that protects this, and all creative work: from music, theatre and literature to film and art. Copyright ensures creators retain control and are fairly compensated. It underpins the creative economy. Put simply, it allows artists and creatives to make a living. Endless studies have shown what a benefit that creativity – music, theatre, dance, art, film, TV, the list is endless – has on the rest of society.View image in fullscreenJeevan Braich as Rusty, right, with the cast of Starlight Express.Photograph: Pamela RaithYet, today, the UK government is proposing changes that would strip creators of this protection. Under thedata (use and access) bill, AI companies would be allowed to take works, past and future, and use them as training data without consent or payment. These models digest vast amounts of human-created content and then generate imitations, bypassing the rights of the original creators. The government’s proposed “opt-out” system – the idea that they will always be in a position to preemptively reserve their rights – is a sham. It is technically impossible for artists to opt out. Thegovernment’s consultationends today, but we should be clear: this is not regulation, it is a free pass for AI to exploit creativity without consequence.AI can replicate patterns, but it does not create. If left unregulated, it will not just be a creative crisis, but an economic failure in the making. AI will flood the market with machine-generated imitations, undercutting human creativity and destroying industries that drive jobs, tourism and Britain’s cultural identity. The creative industry on which we all thrive in myriad ways willstumble and falter.The government claims weakening copyright law will attract AI investment, and that it is offering “a copyright regime that providescreators with real control, transparency, and helps them license their content”, but there is no evidence to support this. Global AI firms will extract UK intellectual property while continuing their operations elsewhere, leaving British creators at a disadvantage. Meanwhile, responsible AI companies such as Adobe and DeepMind already license content, proving that regulation and innovation can coexist.The solution is clear. Beeban Kidron’samendments to the billwould introduce safeguards, ensuring AI firms seek permission and pay for the content they use. The alternative is, as she told the House of Lords last month, that we continue the “delusion that the UK’s best interest and economic future aligns with those of Silicon Valley”.Labour’s AI plan could be good for Britain – except the creatives it will throw under the bus | Ed Newton-RexRead moreCopyright protections are not a barrier to AI innovation; they are the foundation that allows creators to produce the high-quality work AI depends on. Without strong copyright laws, human creativity will be devalued and displaced by machines. Do we want our children to discover the next David Bowie, or David BowAI?We stand at a pivotal juncture. The streaming era has already diminished the value of songwriters to the extent that many struggle to make a living. Streaming revenue allocates about15% to songwriters, while record labels and artists receive 55%, and streaming servicesclaim 30%. Moreover, songwriters are not compensated upfront for their used songs by artists and labels, unlike in TV, film and theatre where there is an option for their works. Consequently, relying solely on 15% is an insurmountable challenge. Now, the UK risks making an even greater error.In 1710, Britain introduced the world’s first copyright law, theStatute of Anne, setting the global standard for protecting creators. Until then, authors found the copyright to their work belonged to the printers of that work. Self-publishing was effectively illegal, but the statute gave writers the ability to own their own creations. This was right and now seems obvious. It is extraordinary that more than 300 years later this government is planning to dismantle those protections. Labour claims to represent working people. Creative artists are working people, and their work is of untold value economically, socially and, of course, culturally.An AI machine is not a person. It is time to step up and protect the people at the heart of the UK’s unrivalled creative economy. If these efforts fail, we will all suffer.Andrew Lloyd Webber is a composer.

Our then two-year-old was raging with fever (he was not ill when we boarded) and had screamed for five out of the six hours.Dazed and confused, we joined the long line for international passport holders instead of the much shorter family line for Australians. We wasted 40 minutes. That was when our then four-year-old decided to vomit. We cleaned that up (FYI, immigration has spew bags), got past the custom dogs, hauled our stuff on to the insanely packed bus that would take us to the equally packed cheap car park, found our car and drove home, before collapsing into a heap.I vowed to never travel again – except that we did, toHong Kongand Vietnam the next year and to Hong Kong and Malaysia the year after that. We will probably go to Hong Kong again next year.Why do I do this? I ask myself as I unpack the largely unused bottles, sprays, inhalers and the whole of our local chemist that I bought pre-trip.Do I not have enough challenges as a parent?When the laundry is finally done, I know the answer is not staying home for ever, never to leave again.Like many Australians, I have family overseas, notably a centurion grandmother in Hong Kong who was widowed last year (RIPyeh yeh) so I have wanted, and will continue, to take my children to see their great-grandparent for as long as I can.How a spontaneous overseas trip made me see my son in a whole new light | Nova WeetmanRead moreHong Kong is also my birthplace and was home for the first seven years of my life. It’s half my children’s heritage so I never want it to feel foreign to them. I want them to feel the awe of the skyline and swelter in the humidity, ride all of the public transport and find comfort in Cantonese food.I have always had an urge to travel. In my 20s I took off to live in London and backpack through Europe, lapping up the wonder and freedom of solo travel. In my 30s I ventured to South America with my boyfriend. We weathered the misread maps and timetables (mostly on my part), altitude sickness (also me), mystery tropical viruses (him) and food served on overnight buses (both).We found inspiration in the Atacama desert and the Torres del Paine, in the Bolivian salt flats and the Brazilian jungle, and finally we found inspiration in each other. When we got back we felt as though we could do anything – even make lifelong commitments.This boyfriend is now my husband and the father of said two children.I want to pass on to the kids the joys of travel – and I suspect pandemic lockdowns deepened that motivation. When my then two-year-old daughter was locked in our small backyard (and I’m grateful we had one!) and confined to a 5km radius limit on where she could go, I dreamt of taking her to see the world when it was all over.Now six, she has been to five countries and many more cities. She is learning to plan, pack her bags and look after her own things. She is experiencing differences, noting the little baskets of flowers, candy and incense in Bali and the call to prayer in Penang. She is asking why we brush our teeth with bottled water and why she is not in a car seat.I am forced to really think, to explain things in an age-appropriate way or to find the answers if I don’t know them.At the end of last year my daughter’s prep class was asked to draw themselves doing something that makes them happy for a tea towel fundraiser.Children drew themselves skipping, on the monkey bars, playing football. My daughter drew herself, beaming widely, with a suitcase on big wheels alongside a rainbow. I felt her awe and wonder, the magic of travel.It’s all I need to start planning and saving for our next trip, even if she vomits at immigration.Lucille Wong is a Melbourne writerExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingSharing the LoadChildrenFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

A utopian vision of homes for 3,000 people. Built in the 1930s, they were modelled on theKarl-Marx-Hofin Vienna and La Cité de la Muette in Paris. However, after just 40 years, the buildings were crumbling and largely deserted. Over the course of five years in the 1970s, Peter Mitchelldocumented their demolition, from smashed windows and wrecked apartments to abandoned wardrobes and solitary shoes. Finally, when all that was left standing was a lone arch, he tried to photograph the wrecking crew standing in front of it, but couldn’t get the arch in.“So,” Mitchell remembers, “the foreman said, ‘We do have a crane.’ I can’t stand heights but they lowered the crane down so I could stand on it, then lifted me up to quickly get the shot. I was swaying about a bit and all but one of them came out blurred – but I got the picture.”'These aren’t astronomy,' they said. 'They look like they were taken with a Kodak seaside camera'Mitchell laughs gently at the memory. Now 82, he is one of the 20th century’s most important early colour photographers and social historians. He has been called “a narrator of how we were, a chaser of a disappearing world”. Yet he insists he just photographs “things that take my eye. Sometimes, I’d see something and think, ‘I’ll come back when it’s not raining.’ Then I’d go back and it had been knocked down.”View image in fullscreen‘Chaser of a disappearing world’ … Quarry Hill Flats, 1978.Photograph: Peter MitchellWe’re talking ahead of his new London exhibition Nothing Lasts Forever, which he thinks will be his last, but we meet in the ornate tiled cafe ofLeedsArt Gallery, which hosted the exhibition last year and first showed his photos in 1975, when it was the City Art Gallery. He remembers that the new curator Sheila Ross wasn’t hugely impressed by his silkscreen prints. “But then she said, ‘I like your photos.’”Mitchell’s work exudes warmth and empathy. Although he’s known for shots of what he calls “dying buildings”, some of his most powerful images capture people in the workplace and the dignity of their labour. From the early 1970s to the 2010s, he photographed fairground showman Francis Gavan alongside his gradually more weatherbeaten ghost train ride, which thrilled/terrified generations of schoolchildren (including myself) on Woodhouse Moor, then Pottery Fields – before suddenly both were gone.“He built it himself and was proud of it,” Mitchell remembers. “I think eventually the authorities deemed it unsafe.” After Gavan died, his family came to see Mitchell’s photos, and the ghost train’s giant skull is now in his cellar. “Which would be quite a shock for anyone going down there.”Mitchell has always been fascinated by “the glory of the wreckage”. Born in Eccles, near Manchester, he was relocated to Catford in London during the second world war and fondly remembers playing in air-raid shelters and bombed-out buildings. In his teens he held on to childhood things most people leave behind – toys, Airfix model kits, diaries – and he still has them to this day.View image in fullscreen‘He was very proud of it’ … Francis Gavan, Ghost Train Ride, Woodhouse Moor, Leeds, Spring 1986.Photograph: Peter MitchellAfter leaving school at 16, he trained as a cartographic draughtsman for the civil service but felt unfulfilled, so eight years later enrolled to study typography and graphic design at Hornsey College of Art, where a visiting Italian photographer inspired him to pick up a camera. “But I had always believed,” he says, “a photograph could be as powerful as a painting.”Mitchell came to Leeds in 1972 to visit a friend, fell in love with the Victorian architecture and never left, renting a place in Chapeltown for £2.50 a week and working as a van driver while he became established. On his first day in the city he visited Beckett Street cemetery. “There were lots of gravestones for babies who’d died from cholera,” he says. “I did a lot of photography that first day.”He made a major impact with his groundbreaking 1979 exhibition A New Refutation of the Space Viking 4 Mission – the first colour exhibition by a British photographer in a British gallery, namely Impressions in York. It was inspired by the 1976 Viking probes to Mars, althoughMitchell gave it a twist, imagining that an alien craft had landed on Earth, in Leeds to be precise, and begun to take photos.View image in fullscreenAs if taken by an alien … Bullus Dye Works, Leeds, from A New Refutation of the Viking 4 Space Mission.Photograph: Peter Mitchell“I knew a student who’d written to Nasa asking what qualities you needed to become a spaceman and received a reply,” he explains. “So I wrote to Nasa myself and received a humorous letter. ‘Dear Mr Mitchell. We understand you want to go to Mars. If you give us a couple of million, we can get you up there. But if you just want a picture, we can send you one for nothing.’”They sent him more than one, in fact, and Mitchell enlarged these Martian landscapes and exhibited them alongside his own images of decaying Leeds, adorned with map coordinates as if from a space mission. “A public school in the countryside borrowed the collection for a project on the solar system,” he grins. “They said, ‘These aren’t astronomy at all. They look like they were taken with a Kodak seaside camera.’”In fact, they were taken with the same 1950s Hasselblad camera (“the Blad”) that Mitchell has carried with him for over half a century. Every photo taken by the Blad, it seems, has a story.Take his striking shot of a biker gang in front of a motorcycle mural that adorned the side of a Leeds house. “I just happened by,” he says. “Two girls were leaning against an old Porsche, a bit of a wreck really. One guy was sitting on his bike and another bloke behind him was threatening somebody. I didn’t want to interrupt, so I said, ‘I’ll just take a picture.’” Later, Porsche offered him £300 to publish the photo in their magazine. “I said they could have it for nothing as long as they sent me a copy. They did and alongside my picture was a bigger one of the very same car, roaring around the tracks – as it once had been.”From Leeds to London: portraits of English cities in the 1970s – in picturesRead moreThe Blad has also documented decades of social change, including the impact of multiculturalism on the city. A photograph of Caribbean sound system Sir Yank’s Heavy Disco was taken during the annual carnival, in the days when DJs would pile loudspeakers in front gardens and run power cables out of every window looking out. “The day before the carnival, we’d always get a letter,” grins Mitchell. “It said, ‘Do not give them any electricity – because it’s dangerous.’” Sir Yank (“the boss of Yorkshire sounds”) ran a nearby record shop selling Jamaican imports, so Mitchell photographed that as well.Another shot, called How Many Aunties?, captures the colourful chaos at an Asian wedding that took place in the backstreets near his house. “I went to put the rubbish out,” says Mitchell, “and saw cars draw up. A Sikh chap was trying to take a photo but couldn’t get everyone in and all the women were drifting back inside. I ran up my steps, grabbed the camera from the kitchen, and told them, ‘I’ll take it!’”View image in fullscreen‘I’ll take it!’ … How Many Aunties? Back Hares Mount, Leeds, 1978.Photograph: Peter MitchellOccasionally, he shot interiors, such as Concorde Wallpaper, snapped on a bedroom wall. He glimpsed it through a window and politely asked to photograph it. “It’s a bad shot really, a bit blurred,” he says. “But it became really popular. A few years ago, a nice illustrator gave me a big piece of that same wallpaper in exchange for a large copy of my photo. She’d seen it somewhere, gone inside and prised it off.”Throughout it all, he has remained in Chapeltown, in the same house. Last year it was burgled four times, but recently a silver Audi pulled up and a man got out and expressed an interest in buying the place. “Then he went, ‘Do you still live here? I used to jump off that wall when I was a kid.’ He couldn’t believe it had been the same person in the house all this time.”What if a Mars rover landed in Leeds? Peter Mitchell’s best photographRead moreMeanwhile the city changes around him. Mitchell is dismayed whenever Victoriana is replaced by some big bit of boring plastic, but he still gets a childlike thrill from discovering a hidden gem, such as the century-old butcher’s shop he came across recently with “beautiful green tiling”.Although he doesn’t walk the streets with the Blad as much as he used to, he still likes to get around and does “little bits of photography” when he can. “The Blad’s almost too heavy for me to use now,” he says. “But someone’s knitted me a woollen replica. When I go to the exhibition, I’m going to carry that.”Nothing Lasts Forever is atthe Photographers’ Gallery, London, 7 March to 15 June.

We report on a booming businessDaniel Dylan WrayTue 25 Feb 2025 10.20 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 10.23 ESTShareIf you want to buy a bespoke, brand-new machine to cut your own vinyl records at home, there seems to be just one man who can help you. Ulrich Sourisseau’sworkshop is in a disused railway station in a remote part of the Black Forest in Germany, and he is in extremely high demand. He’s selective about who he sells his machines to, and if he does agree to make you a bit of kit, he’s a little old-school. “He’s cash-only, so I had to travel there with €7,000 on me,” recalls Jon Downing, who bought one back in 2017.Downing then began running his own micro record label in Sheffield, Do It Thissen (that’s “do it yourself” in Yorkshire dialect), specialising in music from his home region. It was a retirement project “to keep me out of mischief and give something back to the local scene,” he says, but Downing has since put out 75 records, from the wonky weirdo punk ofDearthwormsto the psychedelic krautpop ofSister Wives, which he personally cut in his shed at the bottom of the garden.View image in fullscreen‘It keeps me out of mischief’ … Jon Downing of Do It Thissen records at his lathe.Photograph: Jon DowningThe lathe-cutting machine he picked up in Germany produces records one at a time using a diamond needle. They are cut in real time on to blank vinyl discs from a digital source. And this service, and the record labels using it, are booming. “When I wrote our business plan seven years ago I did loads of research and I found maybe two or three other lathe-cutting services,” says Tasha Trigger, who co-runsLathe to the Grave. “And now they’re 10 a penny.”The enigmatic Sourisseau in Germany may be the only place to buy a freshly minted machine, but with more people refurbishing and selling older models, records are becoming more readily affordable in small batches from an increasing number of sources. “No project is too small for us,” Trigger says. This means that people are getting even the most niche things put on to record now, using them as gifts, mementos, or preserving family memories by pressing them into grooves. “We’ve done one-off records of everything from a baby’s first words pressed to vinyl, to a gender-reveal one where they got their doctor to send us an email with the gender of the baby, as they had a choice of two songs for boy and girl.”As well as serving smaller record labels, many lathe-cutters also sell direct to artists, who cannot afford to go to a large pressing plant that requires a minimum order. “Not everybody can afford 300 copies,” Trigger says. “So if we sell somebody 20 records, and they can sell them all on tour and make their money back, while getting coverage, then that’s our job done. Then they’re not going to sit around with 200 spare copies holding up their bed.”Graham Duff, known for writing TV shows such as Ideal, starring Johnny Vegas, also curates his own label,Heaven’s Lathe, in collaboration with lathe cutters Bladud Files! It allows him all the fun and creativity of running a record label but without the stress, risk or workload that would usually go with it. They only cut 100 copies each of the records they release, which have included music by Wire’s Graham Lewis, Throbbing Gristle’s Cosey Fanni Tutti, and even one of Lee “Scratch” Perry’s final recordings.View image in fullscreenInto the groove … Lathe to the Grave’s cutting stylus.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The Guardian“For all of us involved it’s a side project,” Duff says. “But it’s something precious. You can make a really high quality product, but you’re not having to have a massive outlay. And lead times are much shorter – you could be waiting a year at bigger manufacturing plants, so this creates a much shorter route from having an idea to recording it and getting it out there.”It’s a win-win for artists, too, who can release a physical record stripped of the usual expectations and obligations. “There’s no pressure on the artist,” says Duff. “There’s no cost, it’s completely up to them what they want to release, and they retain all rights.” He gives the example of Adi Newton from electronic experimentalists Clock DVA, who lathe-cut a piece of piano music. “You’re opening up channels for people to explore.”Demand is growing. Trigger is in talks with Sourisseau about acquiring a third machine so they can increase production next year – they currently run two machines for 70 hours a week – and it has enabled her and her partner to quit their other jobs. “It’s been incredible for us to be able to do this full-time,” she says. “But ultimately, we want artists to support themselves and know that there are other options out there: it’s not just streaming or nothing.”Explore more on these topicsVinylExperimental musicPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

From Bridgerton to The Sopranos, some have insisted on moments being axed – although they don’t always get their wayMichael HoganTue 25 Feb 2025 10.20 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 11.32 ESTShareAs professional show-offs with A-list ambitions, you might assume that any TV star wants to maximise their screen time – the meatier the role and the more minutes in the limelight, the better. Yet that isn’t always the case. Sometimes, actors want their scenes to be cut, either from the script or from the edit. And they can have all sorts of reasons, from personal politics to second thoughts about stripping off.The recent Channel 4 docudramaBrian and Maggie, written by Sherwood’s James Graham, saw Dame Harriet Walter deliver a nuanced, non-cartoonish portrayal of the, let’s say, “divisive” figure of Margaret Thatcher. The lady wasn’t for turning. She was for being left on the cutting room floor, though.In depicting the unconventional bond between the Conservative prime minister and Labour MP turned TV journalist Brian Walden, whose infamous 1989 grilling of the PM would trigger her downfall, programme-makers put their personal politics aside.The Guardian’s Lucy Mangan wrotethat we are “in a bad way when Thatcher begins to look like the way and the light”. For once, the Telegraph agreed: “Channel 4 has made a sympathetic drama about Thatcher by mistake.”Brian and Maggie trailer – video“In the edit, we cut something because I thought it was a bit too kind,”Steve Coogan, who played Walden, told Emily Maitlisin the Radio Times. “Of course I had huge antipathy towards Thatcher. I was very anti-Thatcher. I was worried about being too compassionate because at the end, she was definitely a victim of sexism.” At a press screening, Coogan clarified that the scene in question was the awkward post-interview drinks: “It was a line where Brian said: ‘She’s worth 100 of them.’ I thought it was too syrupy for him to say that after stabbing the knife in. Raising a glass to her was sufficient. Best to be more subtle.”Coogan has form for demanding tweaks to his TV biopics. InThe Reckoning, the queasy 2023 factual drama about Jimmy Savile, he asked to change a necrophilia scene in a Leeds hospital morgue because he was “uncomfortable” performing it. “It was as disturbing as it looks,” said Coogan. “A certain shot was planned that I didn’t want to do. It was just a detail that I was uncomfortable with. I had a conversation with the director [Sandra Goldbacher] and we came to an agreement on the most appropriate way to depict it.”Whether it’s down to professionalism, power dynamics or an ego-fuelled desire to maximise their screen time, actors asking for their own scenes to be cut is a rare occurrence on TV. The cases we know about, at least.View image in fullscreenState of undress … Evangeline Lilly and Josh Holloway in Lost.Photograph: Mario Perez/2007 American Broadcasting ComWith depressing predictability, instances often involve female actors fending off demands to bare all. Evangeline Lilly, who played Kate inLost,admittedthat she disliked most of the character’s later storylines. She felt kick-ass Kate had been reduced to “chasing men around the island” and felt “cornered” into partially nude scenes during the third and fourth seasons. In the end, Lilly told execs she would no longer do nudity.Not one but fourEuphoriaactors – Sydney Sweeney, Chloe Cherry, Martha Kelly and Minka Kelly – asked controversy-baiting creator Sam Levinson to cut “unnecessary” nude scenes from the script. Allison Williams was the only one of the four female leads in HBO’sGirlswho didn’t appear naked, explaining that she “didn’t want my future children to see that”.Male actors tend to push back over sexually predatory plotlines, rather than flesh-flashing. Penn Badgley, star of Netflix potboiler You, was “disgusted” after filming a sequence where the antihero Joe masturbates outside his lust object’s apartment. Badgley said he didn’t want to do the scene and has admitted that playing obsessive serial killer Joe takes a mental toll on him.Joseph Fiennes refused to film a scene in The Handmaid’s Tale where villainous Commander Fred Waterford rapes his wife Serena (Yvonne Strahovski). “As abhorrent and evil as Fred is, I have to defend parts of him because he’s still human,” said Fiennes, who stood firm with “long emails, defending and pushing”. He won the argument. The assault was never filmed.View image in fullscreenJoseph Fiennes successfully lobbied against filming a scene where his character rapes his wife (Yvonne Strahovski) in The Handmaid’s Tale.Photograph: Sophie Giraud/HuluActors also resist certain scenes for character consistency or fear of fan backlash. The breakout moment from Netflix’s teen-goth phenomenonWednesdaywas nearly very different. Moody Ms Addams’ prom dance, which went viral on TikTok, was originally meant to escalate into a flash mob. Actor Jenna Ortega thought a stage musical-style number was jarring and demanded it was changed.“Everyone was supposed to pick up on it and start dancing with her,” said Ortega. “I vetoed it because why would Wednesday be OK with that? She’d knock someone out.” Ortega also expressed disappointment that the series put Wednesday in the centre of a love triangle with fellow Nevermore students, arguing it made “no sense” for the character.Wednesday dance scene – videoIn the American version ofThe Office, John Krasinski wouldn’t allow Jim to cheat on wife Pam. The eighth season was supposed to see him kiss the new temp Cathy (Lindsey Broad) on a work trip. Krasinski believed this would alienate viewers, so declined to film it: “That’s the only time I remember putting my foot down. I remember saying, ‘I’m not going to shoot it. If you push the audience too far and show Jim cheating, they’ll never come back’.’”Similarly, Matt LeBlanc initially refused to do theFriendsstoryline where Joey dated Rachel. NBC showrunner Kevin S Bright said: “Matt was very firmly against it, saying Joey would never steal his buddy Ross’ girlfriend.” Bright admitted it “took a lot of conversations” for LeBlanc to be persuaded.Friends: The One Where Ross Is Fine – clipA Friends plot twist that didn’t get past the cast was Rachel flat-sharing with Central Perk mainstay Gunther, who harboured a puppyish peroxide crush on her. A planned season six subplot had Jennifer Aniston’s character moving out of Monica’s apartment and shacking up with the lovestruck barista. Actor James Michael Tyler said: “I remember seeing the first draft of the script and thinking, ‘Oh man, they’re never going to make this work.’ It didn’t read right, even to me. I looked over at Jen and she wasn’t convinced either.” Producers soon realised it was a bad idea and spiked it.View image in fullscreenI ain’t going out like that … Drea de Matteo (Adriana) and Steven Van Zandt (Silvio) in The Sopranos.Photograph: HBOThe Sopranos’ Drea de Matteo, AKA mob moll Adriana, lobbied the show’s producers to remove a scene before she got whacked in the woods. It was a scene in which she didn’t even appear.“In the script, Christopher went to Tony Soprano and told him I was an FBI rat,” recalls De Matteo. “So when Tony calls me and says Silvio will pick me up, the audience know I’m driving towards my death. That bothered me. The walk to her death wasn’t going to be suspenseful. It would make it kind of gratuitous. I fought for that phone call to be cut. A few other actors were onboard and helped argue my case. They took it out, thank God. They ended up using it as a flashback the following season.”More recently, the singer turned actor Alexandra Burke asked for a particularly distressing scene to be cut from the Paramount+ dystopian dramaCurfew.Burke saidthe content was too dark: “It was the most challenging role I’ve ever tackled but there were some things I didn’t think I could do,” she admitted. “I spoke to the producer and they agreed to take it out. I was like, ‘Thank you, because I’m not sure I could act that. And you’ve already shot scenes with me, hun, so the contract’s done!’”Bridgerton carriage scene – videoFinally, for a cuter variation on the theme, Nicola Coughlan’s negotiations with Netflix and Shondaland included them producing a family-friendly edit ofBridgertonepisodes – for the express purpose of showing her mother. Each instalment of the Regency romp, in which Coughlan plays Penelope Featherington, is supplied to her in an alternate cut with less sex and nudity.“It’s literally written into my contract,” says Coughlan. “People think I’m joking but we grew up Irish Catholic.

That was a mistake’Tim JonzeShe topped the charts, dropped the F-bomb on US TV, was ghosted by Jim Morrison and planned to spike Richard Nixon’s tea with LSD. Now 85, the legendary singer tells allTue 25 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 05.51 ESTShareRock’n’roll might not be advertised as being good for your health, but it’s worked out all right for Grace Slick. The former Jefferson Airplane singer is talking me through a life story that spans psychedelic drugs, free love, alcoholism, house fires and a high speed car crash. And yet, even at the age of 85, she sounds as perky, full of mischief and hilariously coarse as any interviewee I can remember.“Rock’n’roll people are spoiled brats,” she says at one point with a throaty cackle. “We don’t know anything about anything except having fun, how much money we can spend and who we can screw.”Slick may have done all of these things but she also helped to define the sound of the 60s. Does any other track sum up the trippy Summer of Love quite like her song White Rabbit, a hypnotic two and a half minutes stuffed with references to pills and mushrooms? That song cleverly evaded censors, taking hallucinogenic drug references into the homes of millions, but then Slick has always had a thing for breaking the rules. She was the first person to drop the F-bomb on US television, for instance, when the band performed their song We Can Be Together on the Dick Cavett show, complete with its rallying call “Up against the wall, motherfucker”.Yet the woman born Grace Barnett Wing has no idea where this rebellious streak came from. Her father was an investment banker, her mother looked after the home, and her upbringing in Illinois and then around parts of California was nothing out of the ordinary. She even attended Finch College, which she describes as a finishing school for young women in New York. A stable life had been mapped out for her. But there was something about that stifled 1950s way of living that just never appealed. “Don’t offend anybody, dress a certain way, get married, have children, stay at home and cook pies,” she snorts with disdain. “A whole bunch of women I knew at that time thought: ‘Don’t think so!’”It was a report in the San Francisco Chronicle that changed everything for Slick. She had been modelling clothes and wondering how to escape a normal life when she read about a band called Jefferson Airplane who were making waves in the city. Whatever it was that was going on, she wanted a part of it. And so, with her first husband, Jerry Slick, she formed a band called the Great Society. They soon got a gig supporting Airplane, and when that band’s singer Signe Toly Anderson left, they came calling for Slick to replace her.View image in fullscreen‘I was veryfriendlywith that band’ … Jefferson Airplane in 1968.Photograph: APWho wouldn’t have wanted Slick to front their band? That voice – deep, powerful, utterly captivating – still sounds like the unravelling of an era, when peace-loving hippy platitudes spun off towards something darker and more foreboding. Slick also brought stage presence to the group and, of course, two era-defining songs. Somebody to Love, a Great Society track written by her brother-in-law Darby, was transformed by Jefferson Airplane into a terrifying psych-rock stomper. As for White Rabbit, well, it was rock’n’roll, but not as anyone had heard it before. Slick grew up listening to classical music rather than Elvis, and her strange, Spanish-sounding march emerged from a love of Ravel’s Boléro.The lyrics, based on Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, shocked parents across the US. And they were supposed to – after all, they were writtenaboutthem and their slack parenting. “People kept saying: ‘Why do you young people use these chemicals now?’” she says. “Well, didn’t you notice the stories you were reading to us? Alice takes at least five different drugs in that book. Even Snow White was knocked out by some kind of chemical!”Today, Slick is speaking from her home in Malibu, Los Angeles. When the California wildfires broke out in January, she was all packed up and ready to leave for a hotel that had been booked, but it didn’t come to that. Still, Slick is no stranger to fires. In 2018, the Woolsey fire reached the outskirts of her property. At her previous home, a fire started by welders working on a gate nearby in 1993 was not so merciful – it destroyed her property and all Slick’s possessions, including her music memorabilia. The only thing left after the blaze, she says, was a ceramic white rabbit. They seem to have followed her around. Fans still send them. She paints them, too, these days. She remembers one riotous gig in the 1970s when a fan put a live rabbit on stage.“We were worried because what do you do?” she says. “We actually took it home. I remember it had one ear that wasn’t working, it didn’t stick up like rabbit’s ears do. And, oddly enough, he liked marijuana seeds. So not only were we loaded, but the rabbit was loaded too!”What happened to the rabbit?“We might have given him to one of the members of the band who had a child … I don’t know. We didn’tkill himor anything.”Slick’s stories are often quite like the lyrics in White Rabbit – populated by all kinds of weird and wonderful characters and events. In her 1998 autobiography she recalls an encounter with the Doors’ Jim Morrison in which he was on all fours howling like a dog.View image in fullscreen‘Don’t offend anybody, dress a certain way, get married, have children, stay at home and cook pies. Don’t think so!’ Slick performing in 1970.Photograph: Robert Altman/Getty Images“No, it was more like a wolf,” she corrects me, as if that makes it perfectly understandable. “He was howling at the moon. But that was not unusual for Jim.”It must have made an impression on Slick because, sometime later while on tour with the Doors, she found herself building up the courage to knock on Morrison’s hotel door. What followed was a session of smearing strawberries all over the room and a sexual encounter Slick describes as “like making love to a floating art form with eyes”. That might sound almost spiritual if not for her added acknowledgment: “He was a well-built boy … his cock was slightly larger than average.”“I was kind of disappointed he never called back,” says Slick today with a laugh. “But, apparently I wasn’t his style.” She reminisces about the Morrison she knew. “You could talk to him, but it wasn’t a conversation. You’d say something about amplifiers and he would reply with something about the colours that happen on a car if you don’t put primer on it. You’d go, ‘How the hell did he come up with that?’”The Morrison ghosting aside, Slick doesn’t have many regrets from this period. The band performed at the Monterey pop festival, a “wet” Woodstock (in which their evening set was so delayed they didn’t emerge on stage until the following morning after a night spent taking cocaine) and Altamont. They also performed a rooftop gig in New York two months before the Beatles had the same idea of doing it in London – and for extra bonus points, had it filmed by Jean-Luc Godard. “The city had never seen anything like that,” Slick recalls. “Everybody leaning out of their windows to see what was going on. The cops finally came and shut us down, but we knew that was going to happen. We got several songs in before they got there.”Did she get a kick out of being naughty?“I don’t know if naughty is the word,” she says, before adding with another guffaw: “Illegalis probably a better term.”Had her plan to spike Richard Nixon’s tea ever come to fruition, it certainly would have been illegal. In 1970 she received an invitation to meet the president at the White House – she knew his daughter Tricia from her time at Finch – and arrived with about 600 micrograms of LSD in her pocket. Nixon never got to experience the fourth dimension. At the door, security were alerted to the fact that the respectable-sounding Ms Barnett Wing was actually Grace Slick, a radical rock’n’roller and security risk, and she was barred from the event.Slick could be reckless, and when she began drinking heavily in the 70s the bad behaviour soured into something bleaker. She would heckle fans and, during one tour of Germany, ended up sticking her fingers up the nose of an audience member. Off stage, she would get behind the wheel of a car while inebriated. Once in 1971 she found herself caught up in a road race with the band’s lead guitarist Jorma Kaukonen, and hit a concrete wall at 80mph. “Very stupid of me,” she says. “That road was known as ‘deadly Doyle Drive’ for a reason. There was grease on it. And when you hit that grease, you start sliding.”View image in fullscreen‘I was trying to make it up to the band because I’d been this wild drunk’ … Slick in 1980.Photograph: Roger Ressmeyer/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesSlick was fortunate. The concrete wall ended up more damaged than she did. “I was lucky,” she says.Slick was seeing Kaukonen for some time – and if you look into the great loves of her life, they almost all seem to have one thing in common: being in her band. Jerry Slick, Jack Casady, Spencer Dryden, Paul Kantner. As she puts it herself: “Yeah, I was veryfriendlywith that band.”She lets out another snort of laughter. “I learned that phrase from another guy I lived with for a while. He referred to women you could sleep with as being ‘friendly’ and I thought: ‘Well that’s a sweet way of putting it.’ So I was ‘friendly’ with everybody in the band except Marty [Balin]. But, if he had come on to me, I would have gone for Marty, too.”She had a child with Kantner, a daughter they named China. Slick was determined to be an “alternative mum”, taking her on tour, showing her the world, and it worked out.“She is just an amazing person,” says Slick proudly. “We’ve had our ups and downs, but she has kept on working on herself.” China had a successful career acting in television and films but these days is a non-denominational chaplain, working in hospitals with people who are dying or in distress. “She also has a real nasty sense of humour,” says Slick, perhaps even more proudly. Like mother, like daughter, I guess.There were other things Slick shared with her daughter, such as a fondness for alcohol. When Slick entered rehab in the late 1990s, China would visit her. Then she surprised the staff by checking herself in, too. They have both been sober ever since. “I was a periodic drunk which means I didn’t drink every day,” says Slick. “I wouldn’t have any for a month and then I would get loaded on a weekend and get arrested and all that kind of stuff.” She has described her various arrests as TUIs – talking under the influence. Once she even waved an unloaded gun at a cop. “I had to go to rehab to learn, look, you can’t do this any more because you turn into an asshole.”There were plenty of sober times as well. In the 1980s, after Jefferson Airplane had mutated into Jefferson Starship and then simply Starship, she scored several No 1 hits in the US with 1985’s We Built This City, Sara, and 1987’s Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now. Although still in her mid-to-late 40s, these hits made her, at the time, the oldest female chart topper in history (a record held until Cher’s Believe in 1998). Slick didn’t particularly like this fact. She felt uncomfortable up on stage singing in her 40s – to her, rock’n’roll was a young person’s game. And shehatedthe songs, which were no longer the creative product of the band members themselves but written by external hit-makers for them to perform.“I thought they were ridiculous,” she says. “There isn’t a city built on rock’n’roll! Los Angeles was built on oil and oranges and the movie business.” The lyrics were written by Elton John’s longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin. “He’s British, and London obviously isn’t built on rock’n’roll. Stupid song. But our producer said, ‘Yeah, but it’s a hit.’ And he was right.” She starts listing some of the later songs of her career, mocking the lyrics and then delivering a long snoring noise. But if she hated the songs so much, why sing them?View image in fullscreenGrace Slick today.“I kind of had to because I was trying to make it up to the band,” she says. “I’d been this wild, crazy-ass drunk. So to make up for it I was sober all through the 80s … which was a mistake.” Another cackle of laughter.Since the mid-90s, Slick has turned to painting – mainly commercial works inspired by the counterculture through which she lived. On her website there are prints to buy of a topless Morrison, a hookah-smoking caterpillar and a trippy version of Monterey complete with white rabbit attenders. Does she paint every day?“No, I will paint for a couple of months straight, all day, all night. Then I stop for a while to regenerate. Now, I am writing a lot of lyrics instead. I can’t stop. It’s a habit that’s harder to break than alcohol.”She reads me a recent one: “I put the glory on you like a paper doll / You took it and wore it with no problem at all / So you took my heart and I took the fall / It took me years to see my mistake / The Prince Charming story was all a fake / You were just in it for all you could take / Paper doll.”Slick plans to record some punk songs in a band she recently formed with her son-in-law. “He’s right up my alley because he’s as gross as I am,” she laughs. “We thought, nobody ever talks about bodily functions, so we’re doing a song called Yankin’ Boogers and Blowin’ Gas (Everybody’s got a Nose and an Ass). And there’s another one called Hernias and Hot Flashes.”She’s cackling again, aware that being an 85-year-old punk singer is probably another rule she’s about to break. “Yeah,” she says, “it’ll be interesting to see what kind of repercussions I get from that.”Explore more on these topicsMusicArtPaintingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our work has employed thousands globally, nurturing the next generation of talent. Copyright is the foundation that protects this, and all creative work: from music, theatre and literature to film and art. Copyright ensures creators retain control and are fairly compensated. It underpins the creative economy. Put simply, it allows artists and creatives to make a living. Endless studies have shown what a benefit that creativity – music, theatre, dance, art, film, TV, the list is endless – has on the rest of society.View image in fullscreenJeevan Braich as Rusty, right, with the cast of Starlight Express.Photograph: Pamela RaithYet, today, the UK government is proposing changes that would strip creators of this protection. Under thedata (use and access) bill, AI companies would be allowed to take works, past and future, and use them as training data without consent or payment. These models digest vast amounts of human-created content and then generate imitations, bypassing the rights of the original creators. The government’s proposed “opt-out” system – the idea that they will always be in a position to preemptively reserve their rights – is a sham. It is technically impossible for artists to opt out. Thegovernment’s consultationends today, but we should be clear: this is not regulation, it is a free pass for AI to exploit creativity without consequence.AI can replicate patterns, but it does not create. If left unregulated, it will not just be a creative crisis, but an economic failure in the making. AI will flood the market with machine-generated imitations, undercutting human creativity and destroying industries that drive jobs, tourism and Britain’s cultural identity. The creative industry on which we all thrive in myriad ways willstumble and falter.The government claims weakening copyright law will attract AI investment, and that it is offering “a copyright regime that providescreators with real control, transparency, and helps them license their content”, but there is no evidence to support this. Global AI firms will extract UK intellectual property while continuing their operations elsewhere, leaving British creators at a disadvantage. Meanwhile, responsible AI companies such as Adobe and DeepMind already license content, proving that regulation and innovation can coexist.The solution is clear. Beeban Kidron’samendments to the billwould introduce safeguards, ensuring AI firms seek permission and pay for the content they use. The alternative is, as she told the House of Lords last month, that we continue the “delusion that the UK’s best interest and economic future aligns with those of Silicon Valley”.Labour’s AI plan could be good for Britain – except the creatives it will throw under the bus | Ed Newton-RexRead moreCopyright protections are not a barrier to AI innovation; they are the foundation that allows creators to produce the high-quality work AI depends on. Without strong copyright laws, human creativity will be devalued and displaced by machines. Do we want our children to discover the next David Bowie, or David BowAI?We stand at a pivotal juncture. The streaming era has already diminished the value of songwriters to the extent that many struggle to make a living. Streaming revenue allocates about15% to songwriters, while record labels and artists receive 55%, and streaming servicesclaim 30%. Moreover, songwriters are not compensated upfront for their used songs by artists and labels, unlike in TV, film and theatre where there is an option for their works. Consequently, relying solely on 15% is an insurmountable challenge. Now, the UK risks making an even greater error.In 1710, Britain introduced the world’s first copyright law, theStatute of Anne, setting the global standard for protecting creators. Until then, authors found the copyright to their work belonged to the printers of that work. Self-publishing was effectively illegal, but the statute gave writers the ability to own their own creations. This was right and now seems obvious. It is extraordinary that more than 300 years later this government is planning to dismantle those protections. Labour claims to represent working people. Creative artists are working people, and their work is of untold value economically, socially and, of course, culturally.An AI machine is not a person. It is time to step up and protect the people at the heart of the UK’s unrivalled creative economy. If these efforts fail, we will all suffer.Andrew Lloyd Webber is a composer.

But its imagery will be indelible well after the baubles are forgottenPaul MacInnesTue 25 Feb 2025 06.16 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 06.18 ESTShareThinking about it, I wasn’t sure which image disturbed me more: the one where an eyeball begets another eyeball and the two of them start jostling for prominence in the same socket hole?; or the one where one eyeball begetsfourother eyeballs and they, you know, start slamming into each other?On reflection, it’s the first that’s worse. As terrifying as the second may be, in a moment that sets off The Substance’s super gross-out denouement, it is at least expected. Also, with four eyes (actually it could be six, or eight, it all happens so quickly) you can feel the body horror being ratchetedup to levels of preposterousness that take the edge off. The first instance, by contrast, is simple and pure; it jabs its fingers into your stomach and squeezes away until it takes physical effort to stop yourself from gagging.So, that’s that. Ranked. And a little something I wanted to get out of the way before going further into why Coralie Fargeat’s story of a middle-aged woman who will do anything to get a pert butt should win this year’s best picture award.At least that’s one way of interpreting the plot of this film. Another is that Demi Moore’s Elisabeth Sparkle, the former Hollywood star turned Jane Fonda-esque dancercise queen, accepts an invitation to try a mysterious new treatment because she wants to prolong her career. Or, maybe, she is not sure what she wants at all and tries the substance just to do “something”. In many reviews of the movie this lack of clarity has been pinned down as a weak spot. If The Substance is an allegory, what is it an allegory of, exactly? But liberating yourself from the quest for intentional meaning, I found, only made The Substance more compelling.I knew about The Substance many months before I watched it, because the chatter around it found its way into my social feeds. This is not common for me, largely because my social media diet of football analysis and political journalists means nothing original ever comes my way. But here it was, a movie that had not only had a clear visceral impact on its audience, but also led them to ponder on its meaning.Personally, I’m interested in the angle that says The Substance is a critique on consumer capitalism; the idea that a product can resolve the internal anguish that exists in all of us (or at least encourage it to form a homunculus that bursts from your spine). But I’m even more interested in a film that allows for such speculation at all. Fargeat said she wanted to “explode the idea of beauty. To show the reality of who we really are and what we’re made of”, and that allows for a broader reflection on the human condition.The visual language helps this process along. From the opening shot of a cracked egg giving birth to a more perfect cracked egg, provocative images are contrived consistently and stick in your brain. The lifesize photo of Elisabeth in her exercise gear, hung in the heart of her apartment like a cross between a religious icon and a hunting trophy. Meanwhile, outside gazing in, an even bigger billboard tribute to Elisabeth’s more perfect alter ego, Sue, bought and paid for by corporate America. The font and the legend of The Substance itself (“You stabilise every day”) that comes over half-health supplement, half-chemical weapon. The corridor of red, patterned linoleum that is just demanding a torrent of blood be unleashed across it. The various pustules of differing colours. The breast in the middle of the face.I can’t think of many other movies I’ve watched recently that have so many memorable images. I can’t think of one that’s been so gleefully gory or in such bad taste. The former is a better argument for giving The Substance an Oscar, but the second would work too at a push: good art that is in bad taste? There are not many films like that on at the multiplex, and even less likely on a streamer.We can go on. The Substance has Moore giving a career-defining performance and Margaret Qualley an internet-breaking one. It has the impetus of history behind it, with the chance to become the first horror movie to win best picture (some people say that was The Silence of the Lambs, I would say no, that was a police procedural). It’s also a movie for movie lovers, from The Shining references to the Lynchian distortion of physical space, and one that once again encourages the viewer to think: what does this remind me of? (I was transported back to the 90s, and Peter Jackson’s Bad Taste on VHS).There are umpteen reasons to recommend this film for Hollywood’s most important bauble, and it’s possible to do so wholeheartedly thanks to the knowledge that, in reality, The Substance has no chance of winning at all. It’s a trashy horror film that makes you want to puke, for God’s sake, and – get this – it’s even made by a woman! Still, it’s the Academy’s loss. The Substance will probably continue unaffected: bouncing around our various screens and inside our heads, pulling us up short. This meme of a movie has a life of its own.Explore more on these topicsFilmBest picture Oscar hustingsOscarsThe SubstanceDemi MooreHorror filmsAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Kang won the International Booker in 2016 with her breakthrough novel, The Vegetarian, translated by Deborah Smith.Cărtărescu is the first Romanian author to be longlisted for the prize, with his novel Solenoid, translated by Sean Cotter. Set in late 1970s and early 1980s communist Bucharest, Solenoid begins with the diaristic reflections of a teacher before expanding into an existential, surrealist account of the narrator’s journey through alternate realities. Last May, it won the €100,000Dublin literary award.Along with Romanian, a second language, Kannada – spoken by approximately 38 million people, primarily in the state of Karnataka in southwest India – also features for the first time in the prize’s history with Heart Lamp by Banu Mushtaq, translated by Deepa Bhasthi.Japanese writer Kawakami, best known for her novel Strange Weather in Tokyo, was chosen for her novel-in-stories Under the Eye of the Big Bird. Set in a future in which humans are on the verge of extinction, its voice is “marvellously captured by translator Asa Yoneda”, writes James Bradley in aGuardian review.At 288 pages, Kawakami’s book is among the longest on the list: 11 of the 13 books come in at under 250 pages, with eight under 200.One of the slimmer titles, at 192 pages, is Kracht’s Eurotrash, translated from German by Daniel Bowles. The novel follows a middle-aged writer on a road trip through Switzerland with his terminally ill mother. “Their journey takes them through a number of blackly comic set pieces at a vegetarian commune, a private airstrip and inside a broken-down ski lift,” writes Marcel Therouxin the Guardian.This year’s longlist sees an Iraqi translator nominated for the first time, with The Book of Disappearance by Palestinian author Ibtisam Azem, translated by Sinan Antoon. When Palestinians suddenly disappear, a friend of one of the vanished begins searching for clues in what John Selfdescribed asa “rich, potent novel”.This year brings a record for the longest period between an original-language publication andInternational Booker prizelonglisting. On a Woman’s Madness by Astrid Roemer was first published in Dutch 43 years ago, and is now translated into English by Lucy Scott.Also on the longlist are On the Calculation of Volume I by Solvej Balle, translated by Barbara J Haveland; There’s a Monster Behind the Door by Gaëlle Bélem, translated by Karen Fleetwood and Laëtitia Saint-Loubert; Reservoir Bitches by Dahlia de la Cerda, translated by Julia Sanches and Heather Cleary; Small Boat by Vincent Delecroix, translated by Helen Stevenson; Hunchback by Saou Ichikawa, translated by Polly Barton; and A Leopard-Skin Hat by Anne Serre, translated by Mark Hutchinson.Author and judging chair Max Porter said that he hopes the “unconventional” longlist will “exhilarate” readers. “These books bring us into the agony of family, workplace or nation-state politics, the near-spiritual secrecy of friendship, the inner architecture of erotic feeling, the banality of capitalism and the agitations of faith,” he said.The shortlist of six books will be announced on 8 April, with the winner revealed at a ceremony at London’s Tate Modern on 20 May.Alongside Porter on this year’s judging panel are poet Caleb Femi, writer Sana Goyal, author and translator Anton Hur, and musician Beth Orton.The judges selected the longlist from 154 books submitted by publishers. The 2025 prize was open to works of long-form fiction and collections of short stories translated into English and published in the UK or Ireland between 1 May 2024 and 30 April 2025.Along with Kang, previous writers to have won the award include Olga Tokarczuk and Lucas Rijneveld. Last year, Jenny Erpenbeck and translator Michael Hofmannwon the prizefor Kairos.To explore all of the books on the longlist for the International Booker prize 2025 visitguardianbookshop.com.

To date, the song has racked up more than 60m digital streams and 1bn views across all platforms.Zambotto told Guardian Australia when he got the Eurovision news he initially thought it was a prank. “I was like ‘Where’s Ashton Kutcher?’, he said, adding: “I love music and singing – to be representing a country for doing what I love? There’s no better feeling.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe 29-year-old grew up in the small town of Manjimup, Western Australia, on a self-sustained, off-grid property built from recycled materials with no running water, electricity or phone reception.“It was very isolated, away from society,” he says. “So I learned how to think and be creative in a very individual way. When it came to me going to school, I was introduced into society a lot more and I felt quite like an outsider. Over the years, I learned to be comfortable with who I am, and I learned that people really appreciated it.”As Go-Jo, Zambotto has cultivated a massive fanbase online, posting high-energy clips of himself busking and interacting with members of the public. Mrs Hollywood’s success was fuelled by clips of him inviting passersby to join him for an impromptu guitar solo.For Eurovision, Go-Jo will perform a new song titled Milkshake Man, written in collaboration with Australian pop band Sheppard, in which he invites the audience to “Come and take a sip from my special cup / I’ve heard that you could use a little pick-me-up. / What can get you high when you’re oh so sad? / It’s the milk from the milkshake man.” He goes on to boast about his flavours, which include chocolate, vanilla, creme brulee and “a caramel banana you have got to see”.Zambotto hopes Milkshake Man will be a “motivational push” for audiences: “Through the lyrics and the story of the song, I hope to inspire people to feel like the most colourful version of themselves and feel confident.” As he sings, “The shake is not a drink it’s a state of mind / it’s the secrets of the power you were born to find.”Paul Clarke, Australia’s creative director for this year’s Eurovision contest, which will be held in Basel, Switzerland in May, described Zambotto as having “a unique connection with audiences”, adding: “We know he’ll get a lot of love from the Eurovision community.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But as profits plummet, bookshops are being replaced by kebab shopsBySaqib ManzoorSupported byAbout this contentTue 25 Feb 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2025 03.32 ESTShareInside one of the oldest bookshops in Delhi’s Urdu Bazaar, Rafiq Ahmad, a film critic and writer, is scrutinising the bookshelves for material to help with his next project. Ahmad often travels from Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh to Delhi’s famed Urdu Bazaar in search of the books he needs.“I know this is the place where I can find any Urdu book from any era. Whenever I have to write anything, I come here for material. Currently, I am looking for books about Dilip Kumar, the renowned Bollywood actor,” Ahmad says.Once known as a literary hub for book lovers, poets, writers and calligraphers, the Urdu market, nestled among the old and narrow lanes of India’s capital, is silently mourning its own slow death.About 40 years ago, there were 60 shops that sold Urdu novels and poetry books. Now, only half a dozen survive. The rest have been transformed into eateries, clothing shops and guesthouses. The smell of sizzling kebabs and biryani has triumphed over the scent of ancient books.Urdu Bazaar, also known as Kitab Ghar or Kitab Mandir, was established in 1920 in the walled city of Delhi and became a hub of Urdu printing, publishing and poetry.View image in fullscreenBookshop owner Moin-Ud-Din and Rafiq Ahmad, who travels to the bazaar from Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh to find research material for his projects.Photograph: Danyal HassanMoin-Ud-Din, 45, owner of Kutub Khana Anjuman-e-Taraqqi-e-Urdu, sits in his shop brushing the dust off a poetry book and reminiscing about his childhood, when the lanes were filled with bookshops, readers and poets.“I was born here beside these books,” he says. “I started assisting my father when I was in seventh standard [grade]. But witnessing my cradle crumble shatters my heart.”He is the third generation of his family to look after the bookshop, which his grandfather, Munshi Niyaz Ud-Din, established in 1939.For Moin-Ud-Din, the decline of Urdu Bazaar began during the partition of the country in 1947, and intensified in the 1980s and 1990s when fast-food restaurants and the digital revolution arrived. Instead of shelves bursting with a rich variety of Urdu Books, food, trendy clothes andmiswaqs(teeth-cleaning twigs) began to appear, and the scholars and poets were replaced with food vloggers and fashion fans.“Most of the booksellers who owned shops here went to Pakistan. Only a few remained here and, later on, many found profit in selling fast food and transformed bookshops into food hubs,” Moin-Ud-Din says.It was once a bookshop frequented by reputed writers, now it is a hotel selling kebabs and chickenAhmad Nabeel, shopkeeperMany of the bookshops that continue to exist have placed prayer rugs and dates outside to widen their appeal.“I have been here for seven years. I didn’t know anything about Urdu but my passion for Urdu brought me here,” Mohammad Alauddin, a bookseller at Zulfiqar Book Depot, says. His son-in-law owned the shop, but after his death, Alauddin took over. He too believes that people found selling kebabs more profitable than books.“Most of the famous, oldest shops – Nazeeria, Quran Ghar, Central Book Depot, Kutub Khana Rasheediya – have become hotels and guesthouses. Since Jama Masjid is here, the sale of food is always high,” Alauddin says, referring to the 400-year-old mosque that sits opposite the bazaar.Inside the dimly lit Kutub Khana Aziziya bookshop, Ahmad Nabeel is engrossed in writing daily notes. Established in 1937, the shop was looked after by his grandfather and father until it was Nabeel’s turn.He believes it is the new generation’s lack of interest in Urdu literature that has led to the bazaar’s demise. “Previously, parents taught their kids the Urdu language, but now people are inclined towards English,” Nabeel says. “They are mostly into English literature.”Back in the bazaar’s heyday, each shop employed about 10 members of staff; now just one or two are needed.View image in fullscreenWith the nearby 400-year-old Jama Masjid drawing tourists and worshippers, food shops can more readily find customers than bookshops do, say owners.Photograph: Danyal HassanNabeel points to the adjacent shop that once harboured the famous Kutub Khana Rasheediya. “It was once a bookshop often frequented by reputed writers but then it became a clothes shop and now it is a hotel selling kebabs and chicken,” he says.Khalid Mubashir, an assistant professor of Urdu at Jamia Millia Islamia university, believes ebooks and the digital world have affected the sale of Urdu books.“Firstly, the stamina of reading has reduced owing to an increasing 30-40 second ‘reel culture’. Secondly, everything is available and accessible on the internet in the form of ebooks and PDFs. This will be like this in future. I don’t think such space will be revived again,” Mubashir says.Mohammad Ghalib, 63, is the last surviving calligrapher in the Urdu Bazaar. He has calligraphed academic books and other weighty tomes but, as business dried up, Ghalib turned to writing wedding cards and short titles.View image in fullscreenCalligrapher Mohammed Ghalib demonstrates his skill.Photograph: Stuart Freedman/In Pictures/Getty ImagesGhalib recalls the bygone era of Urdu Bazaar: “There were around 14katibs– calligraphers – here. Some of them died, and some left the profession since they found no profit in it.“Technology took over the art of calligraphy and handwritten books,” he says, moving his hand over an example of ornate script.The lost mansions of Chettinad: festival showcases opulent homes turned heritage hotelsRead moreAway from the crowd, on the narrow and dimly-lit Chooriwalan bylane, Shah Wali Ullah library, established in 1994, determinedly promotes Urdu literature and gives space to young poets and writers.The library holds about 21,000 books, including a 100-year-old Qur’an; Ghalib’s Diwan-e-Ghalib, complete with his personal seal and signature; an illustrated Ramayana in Persian; and Diwan-i Zafar, a volume of Bahadur Shah Zafar’s poetry, printed and sealed by the royal press in the Red Fort in 1885.“Students from different universities and people from Iran, Japan, Thailand and Europe visit our library and are interested to see these old manuscripts,” says Sikander Mirza Changezi, co-founder of the library. Changezi believes the coming generation will preserve and revive such spaces.Meanwhile, Moin-Ud-Din is determined to keep his bookshop open. “I too could have switched to an eatery or clothes shop, but I want to carry on the legacy of my grandfather.“This place was established by scholars who didn’t want to earn from it but contribute to society and religion.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsiaDelhiBest bookshopsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Amid the ruins, brick chimneys covered in iridescent Batchelder tiles are the only markers where homes once stood.These tiles are relics of the AmericanArts and Crafts movement, popular during the turn of the 20th century, when the artist Ernest Batchelder handcrafted the tiles from his backyard kiln. The tiles at the Christensen family’s home on Altadena Drive survived a century and a wildfire when the rest of the house did not. To Cliff, known in inner circles as a tile historian, the Christensens’ tiles are particularly special because of the unique glaze.Determined to salvage what remains, Cliff and a team of volunteers are working to remove, restore and return these tiles to their owners before the bulldozers move in to clear the debris from Altadena’s burn zone.View image in fullscreenCliff Douglas holding a salvaged piece.Photograph: Lynda Lin Grigsby“This is what the mission is all about,” said Cliff, cradling a tile. “It’s about getting this art out of the fireplace and back to where the owners can enjoy it again.”Days before the fire swept out of Eaton Canyon and took her home, Susan Christensen sat in the living room of her English Revival home watching the Rose Parade – a New Year’s Day tradition – on the TV above her Batchelder-tiled fireplace. Now these same tiles are scattered on her front lawn as Cliff taps and chisels through the ruins of her home.Susan wants her fireplace back.Some day in new Altadena, the tiles may be the only throughline to the past.‘This is the merging of his passion and giving back’The goal is ambitious: rescue and restore tiles from as many houses as possible, said Darcy Douglas, Cliff’s daughter and a member of the family masonry business based in South Pasadena.What started as a weekend tile rescue effort now permeates the Douglas family’s life – including their backyard, where many rescued Batchelder tiles wait to be restored. In his downtime, Cliff pieces together broken tiles like jigsaw puzzles and retouches them with the tiniest paintbrush strokes.“This is the merging of his passion and giving back,” said Janet Douglas about her husband.In January, Cliff was moved to tears as he watched footage of the fire devouring Altadena homes with Batchelder-tiled fireplaces he once restored. He wanted to offer free services to help homeowners save the tiles. He asked Darcy to spread the word.View image in fullscreenAn example of Batchelder tile.Photograph: Lynda Lin GrigsbyNaturally, she turned to social media.In another part of town, neighbors Eric Garland and Stanley Zucker had also noticed the pristine Batchelder tiles gleaming in leveled neighborhoods. They wondered: who had the expertise to save them?Then they saw Darcy’s post offering Cliff’s masonry services.Save the Tiles, an ad hoc organization to preserve Altadena’s history, was born. It unites community members in a collective effort to rescue as many tiles as possible.“I mean, posting my dad’s phone number on Reddit is always questionable, but I’m glad I did it in the right one,” said Darcy.Since the mission started, the rescue crew has saved tiles from 15 homes, said Darcy. Crews are spread throughout the burn area. At a property on Beverly Way, Martin and Jorge Vargas, a father and son team that has worked with Cliff for 30 years gingerly removes a Batchelder tile emblazoned with an ornate bird standing in a flower field.“You have to be really gentle,” said Jorge.For now, the rhythmic clicking of hammers and chisels are the only sounds that pierce the silence. No bulldozers have arrived yet, but the army corps of engineers has begunclearing fire-damaged propertiesof debris, making the tile rescue a race.View image in fullscreenJorge Vargas with a Batchelder tile.Photograph: Lynda Lin GrigsbyThe scale of the mission is daunting. More than 200 of these Batchelder-tile fireplaces have been identified in Altadena’s burn zone, said Garland. Fewer than half of the owners have been contacted and have consented to the tile retrieval.“We’re terrified that this will be an exercise in failure by degree,” said Garland.The new tile rescue organization has many needs, including funds to support Cliff and his crews. They launched afundraising siteto support the rental of storage space and an artist studio for the restoration effort, said Zucker. Their command center is often just an open space on the job site.They also need boxes.“In my car, we have tiles that are being stored in a burnt-out dishwasher rack because we are working so quickly that we didn’t have enough cardboard boxes,” said Darcy.‘It’s a sacred pursuit’During the tile rescue mission, the homeowners should be present.“It’s a sacred pursuit,” said Garland.Mike Christensen sits on a low landscaping wall next to his wife Susan and watches the crew carefully extract their tiles. He can’t stop smiling. He’s witnessing the intersection of expertise and passion – both in Cliff and the artist behind the tiles.View image in fullscreenMike Christensen inspects a tile.Photograph: Lynda Lin GrigsbyStarting in 1910,Ernest Batchelderfired his first tiles with a portable kiln in the backyard of his Pasadena home. The tiles’ muted tones soon became sought after, and Batchelder’s work helped popularize the Arts and Crafts movement in California.The durability of the tiles – to survive both a century and a wildfire – is a testament to Batchelder’s craftsmanship, said Garland. His work is emblematic of the movement that gave rise to Altadena.It would be a shame to let the Batchelder legacy end here, said Mike. The rescue service is free for fire victims. If saving the tiles is not a priority, homeowners should allow the crew to save them.“They’re just worth preserving,” he said.For the Christensens, the worst part of losing their home is wrestling with the homesickness that lives in their bones. It’s a yearning that constantly whispers.Before the fire, this block was a living piece of California’s eclectic history. One home was built by a founder of American Express. Another was rumored to be once owned by the mobster Bugsy Siegel.Here, financial history intersects with mob lore.Mike gestures to a neighboring lot, where another Batchelder fireplace stands alone amid the rubble. Then to another in the distance. The tiles form an unbroken thread.“We’re putting the house back on the same footprint,” said Mike.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesCalifornia wildfiresWest CoastCaliforniaHeritagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Just about everything else Bowery did, as well as everyone he met, danced and drank with, everyone he hung out with, insulted and argued with, is.View image in fullscreenClub queen … Bowery in 1986.Photograph: The Hartnett Archive/PP Hartnett. Courtesy Camera Press Ltd.Club queen Princess Julia, the late singer Poly Styrene,Peter Doigand theNeo Naturists,Al “Lanah” Pillay, Lucian Freud andMark E Smith, as well as the closer world of Bowery’s friends and entourage, are all here. Here comes everybody, in a poppers-fuelled, coke-addled, smoke-wreathed show, filled with the noise of hi-NRG disco beats, bagpipes, the music of the Fall and sampled drones from the Velvet Underground, undercut by snatches of bitchy repartee and laughter.And here come mannequins striding in Bowery’s extreme get-ups, and Bowery’s clothes fastidiously remade for the Tate (the originals got trashed, and soiled by what’s called “disco dirt”), a pair of boots jammed into clogs, neck-corsets designed byMr Pearl, the annotated guest lists to Taboo, catwalk photos and tawdry red-top headlines, pop videos and excerpts from collaborations with dancer and choreographerMichael Clark, holiday snaps and postcards detailing Bowery’s sexual exploits, a one-piece outfit with the words A CUNT emblazoned where the head might be, and just about everything else you might, or might not, want to linger over. Phew.Born in 1961, Bowery escaped the town of Sunshine, a Melbourne suburb, and moved to London in 1980, where he lived until his death from an Aids-related illness in 1994. We plot the trajectory in sometimes excessive detail. Bowery’s Australian Music Examination Board piano certificate, his Transport for London Photocard and a pair of voluminous silver lamé hot pants are lain out in a vitrine. They sit beside pages from his diary and evidence of Bowery having fun in a photobooth: Leigh looking psycho, Leigh looking rough, Leigh bewigged and with his hair bleached, Leigh kiss-curled and Leigh with his head shaved. Looking at these, I thought of surrealist photographerClaude Cahun, with her own gender plays and switches of looks and attitudes for the camera, as well, of course, ofCindy Sherman’s photobooth self-portraits, but Bowery was probably just having fun, not pitching himself against anyone.Tate’s publicity material calls Bowery “one of the most fearless and original artists of the 20th century”. This is beyond hyperbole and misses the point of Bowery’s excess and his purpose. Playing with his image, his clothing and his body, Bowery’s career – if you could call it that – was mostly about self-invention and re-invention, and seeing how far he could go. This mostly meant going from club to club, from Kensington Market, where for a while he had a stall, to Brick Lane (he lived nearby), where he bought Indian sari material, jewellery and other accessories, and to parks and public lavatories where he cruised for sex. Wherever Bowery went, he went too far. Perhaps this is why this exhibition is at Tate Modern, rather than at the V&A, where it feels it more rightly belongs.View image in fullscreenNever knowingly underdressed … a display of performance costumes.Photograph: Malcolm Park/Alamy Live News/Alamy Live News.Bowery posed in blackface (as well as greenface and blueface, spot-faced and pierced face), and once used a racial slur to name a fashion collection. This was but one of the several crass provocations he made in his public life – not that he appeared to make any distinctions between public and private. Naivety is no defence here. Performing at an Aids benefit in 1990, Bowery filled his colon with a large water enema before appearing on stage, intending to lie on the floor and create a human fountain. His costume prevented him from assuming the right position, so he squatted on his hands and feet and sprayed the audience from the front of the stage. In his diary Bowery writes “performance had problems which I turned to my advantage. Shat on the audience. Stole the show …” Bowery’s primary tactic was to be asuccès de scandale, and, in the light of this retrospective, to upstage everyone.As well as wanting to paint him as an animal, Freud came to admire Bowery’s mind. This is one thing we don’t see much of in this overstretched exhibition. What we see instead is an endless desire to be seen. All the clothes Bowery designed were primarily with himself in mind.He turned headsat high-tea in Harrods for the The Clothes Show, and posed and preened behind a two-way mirror at London’s Anthony d’Offay Gallery, over two weeks in 1988, gathering crowds every day. He liked an audience and he liked the camera and the sense of confrontation, though all he could see in the reflective glass was himself, striking poses, assuming attitudes. My strongest memory of watching Bowery there was his stillness. Behind the glass, he made the rest of the room a vacuum. Somehow, he emptied us out.View image in fullscreenLaid bare … Lucian Freud’s Nude with Leg Up (Leigh Bowery) 1992.Photograph: Bridgeman ImagesBowery was inescapably a creature of his time and his milieu. Seeing him on the street in Soho, bustling along with matronly purpose, his clothing and face covered in big red spots, he made the day feel brighter, things more real.Although Bowery’s fashion designs have been influential, they seem an adjunct to his own plays with his body and his self-image. Diva and dandy, a social irritant and an alarming being-about-town, he became an unlikely model for Freud. Stripping naked, unasked, for their first session, Bowery became an ocean of flesh in Freud’s paintings, barely contained. In later photographs by Fergus Greer, Bowery seems to morph and shape-change from image to image, and in his costumes he slips between beauty and monstrousness, the outrageous and the vulnerable as we watch. He made of himself many things at once. This is inspiring and affirming and frightening and awful and somehow wonderful and dreadful to witness. You can’t take your eyes off him.Leigh Bowery! is at Tate Modern, London, from 27 February to 31 AugustExplore more on these topicsArt and designLeigh BoweryPerformance artClub cultureArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

Based on real events, this intelligent, understated drama asks the question that’s on everyone’s lips: why? It tells the story of the killings through the eyes of the boy’s father, a man of few words named Yuen, played with tremendous subtlety by Sean Lau in a performance that glimpses at the grief and guilt behind his character’s often expressionless face.The film moves quickly back and forth in time. In the present, Yuen is coming to the end of a night shift at the family’s 24-hour restaurant when he spots police in the apartment block opposite where he lives. Yuen’s son Ming (Dylan So) has killed his mother Yin (Jo Koo) and 12-year-old sister (Lainey Hung). In the days afterwards, Yuen goes through the motions, picking coffins for his wife and daughter, organising the funeral. His mind drifts back to Ming as a boy, running into nursery on unsteady toddler feet, speeding on his first bike.At the trial, the court is told that Ming has schizophrenia, and heard voices in his head before the killings. Yuen casts about in his memory for telltale signs in Ming’s behaviour, none of it definitive. He is an insular, awkward kid, like a lot of kids. And like a lot of teenage boys, he spends too much time playing video games. Then there is Yuen’s parenting; he loves his children, but is often distracted, can be irritable and impatient. Should he feel responsible? Could he have prevented the tragedy?Papa is perhaps too nuanced and low-key to try to answer these questions fully. At the heart of it is Lau’s naturalistic performance. There’s one brilliant moment, very soon after the killings, when he looks out from his restaurant, as if he cannot comprehend how the world is still turning; it is conveyed by Lau with barely a flicker, a tightening of the jaw, a slight squint of the eyes.Papa is in UK cinemas from 28 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsCrime filmsHong KongAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Shot in 2019, Alisa Kovalenko’s moving documentary captures the restlessness and dread that hung over the small towns in then Ukrainian-controlled territory. At the same time, despite the misery of war, a group of friends dare to dream of faraway horizons.All in their late teens, Andriy, Ruslan, Ilya, Lisa and Lera win a competition to travel to the Himalayas. The exciting prospect of the trek, with the promise of majestic vistas and new encounters, starkly contrasts with their everyday reality where the sounds of bombs and gunshots are so commonplace that they barely warrant a reaction. At one point, the camera lingers on a bullet-ridden wall on which flowers and graffiti are drawn. This small but striking moment articulates the resilient spirit of this mining town, where beauty can still bloom in the face of violence. Economic precariousness also casts a dark shadow over the future of the young generation. In one scene, Ruslan spends a day in a coal mine working alongside his father, who intends this experience to be both a lesson and warning.This atmosphere of physical and psychological claustrophobia evaporates when the teenagers finally embark on their trip to Nepal. As the frame opens up to take in the awe-inspring mountain ranges, we also see the camaraderie that flourishes among these international travellers. But these moments of friendship are fleeting next to the coda, which reveals the heartbreaking fates of the friendship group. However the film closes not with despair but golden-tinged footage of the teenagers in happier days, their smiles communicating a hope of reunion, and of peace.We Will Not Fade Away is on True Story from 28 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsUkraineEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

In this startlingly imaginative work, blood runs backwards and language itself has eyes – somehow, each word on the page “looks back, puzzled, like it dwells / on distances – between dip / and driving quill”.The “distances” these poems span are unremarkable in geographic terms. Farley is fond of scruffy car parks and cooling towers, PO boxes and photocopiers, taxi cabs and chimney stacks. I cannot always follow the beauty he sees in bus timetables or in a study of stacked chairs. But although the height of glamour involves a flying visit to the dismal grey of Heathrow, this subverted play on grandeur only renders his imagery more sublime. In one poem, a flag memorably “shivers like / a bolt of silk on a bed of nails, / or a waterfall in a pantomime”. And while he forages briefly in “the undergloom / where giant fronds of fern grow” in King Carbon, much of his interest lies in the industrial edgelands. It is a stark departure from his previous, avian-themed fifth book,The Mizzy(2019).Farley reminds us of the brevity of existence, before the sharp distraction of fried bread draws us back down to earthHowever, what fascinates me most of all is Farley’s meditation on the millennia-old question of time. What is time, where does it go, and what do we do in its long shadow? The “distances” covered inWhen It Rained for a Million Yearsare most surprising in a temporal sense. In The Workaround, our speaker emails the eighth century, hoping to take an illuminated leaf from Bede’s book. Fast forward to the present day in The Gorilla and we are sitting awkwardly in a Zoom waiting room, suspended from reality and its usual ticking reminder. “Here in the lobby, in limbo, waiting to gain / entry [ …] Time is out of joint”. The concept bends in his hands like a bough in the wind and miraculously never seems to break.Whether asking the bank for an overdraft or losing a wedding ring, buying a new computer or reading the small print on a tin of peaches, the speaker has a gift for making the mundane seem magical. Even his ode to bubble wrap is far from banal – each plastic air pocket becomes a perspective-shattering pause. He calls them “spots of time” after William Wordsworth, who wrote about the small but significant moments that shape a human life. As each bubble is popped and pouf! it is gone, Farley reminds us of the brevity of existence, before the sharp distraction of fried bread draws us back down to earth.There is a strong metaliterary thread to these poems as we meet a range of literary figures, from Ovid to John Clare as he escapes from the asylum and stops to eat grass. While this tale is based on the true feat of Clare walking 100 miles home over four days with no money, reduced to eating roadside grass which luckily he found as tasty as bread, I enjoy the moments where Farley plays with a little more poetic licence, and gladly accept the provocation to reimagine Oliver Twist trudging down the M62 in Close Reading.I am both amused and alarmed by the riotous literary rebellion in Attack of the Fifty-Foot Poem. Despite its defecating hero, a creature that criticises the sheer monstrosity of creative expression, Farley’s poetry – like each “word” he works “loose / from its sweet wrapper” – simply remains a delight to consume. The acrobatic leaps in Farley’s imagination make for a thrilling ride, and, as in Great Northern Diver, “sends a ripple through your heart”.When It Rained for a Million Yearsby Paul Farley is published by Picador (£12.99).

No doubt kudos here should mostly be due to director Cutter Hodierne and screenwriter John Hibey, as well as their crew and cast, but it’s tempting to sense a light Soderberghian touch in Cold Wallet’s blackly comic look at how cryptocurrency eats the soul of all who meddle in its black arts.Charismatic Raúl Castillo stars as protagonist Billy, a bit of a screw-up who is neck deep in a crypto called – tellingly for those aware of the history of bubble stocks – Tulip. Hoping to cash out enough to buy a house so he can gain better access to his daughter who lives with his bitter ex-wife (Zoe Winters from Succession), Billy is the proverbialthis closeto his goal when the currency suddenly tanks after reports of the sudden death of its founder. Now, Billy finds he actually owes money. The same goes for his good friend, hippy-jock Dom (Tony Cavalero), who Billy talked into investing in Tulip and is now at risk of losing his gym business.Eva (Melonie Diaz), another Tulip investor Billy met through subreddits, works out that Tulip’s founder, Charles Hegel (Josh Brener, from Silicon Valley), is not dead at all; in fact, he’s conveniently holed up in a mansion not far away. So Eva, Dom and Billy set out to find him, and then strong-arm him into compensating not just themselves but everyone who has lost out in the Tulip bust. Naturally, it’s not as straightforward as all that, and while they duly find Hegel, the gap between the trio’s competence and Hegel’s slippery, manipulative wiliness is significant. There’s a lot of nerd talk about passkeys, cold wallets and whatnot, but the film is to its credit much more interested in psychology rather than tech, and the fine lines between avarice, rage and impotence that make the capitalist world go round.Cold Wallet is on digital platforms from 3 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersCryptocurrenciesSteven SoderberghE-commerceInternetreviewsShareReuse this content"

Two new novels, both set in Asia and centred on the coming of age of gay men, play out against the legacy of section 377, the Victorian penal code criminalising homosexuality in British colonies –repealed in 2018 in India, where Santanu Bhattacharya’sDeviantsunfolds, and still applicable in Malaysia, the setting of Tash Aw’sThe South, the first of a planned quartet from the two-time Booker longlistee.Tash Aw: ‘There’s something hyper-masculine about writing an epic’Read moreDeviants, Bhattacharya’s second novel, hops with buttonholing vim around three gay men across three generations over the past half-century to draw surprising contrasts and continuities of experience amid legal and cultural change. The two earliest threads, which open in the 70s and 90s, tell of loneliness, shame, persecution. One protagonist, an artist, lives with the painful memory of a thrilling secret relationship that was snuffed out almost as soon as it began, with his lover, known only as X, curtly announcing his marriage. Another, a university student, falls in love with his university classmate only to be ostracised, with much worse to come.But the segment that lies closest to the book’s heart unfolds as a series of voice notes in the here and now. Vivaan from Bengaluru – tech-savvy, comfortably out, not yet 17 – tells us how his parents fight his corner when a teacher voices concern about bringing his latest dating-app hook-up, Zed, to the school dance. We’re as uneasy as Vivaan when his teacher, doing a U-turn, smugly congratulates herself for her enlightened approach; ditto when the night itself leaves him feeling as if he’s cos-playing straight coupledom. Yet we’re even more sceptical when Zed responds by introducing Vivaan to the joys of app-enabled polyamory, as they Uber themselves from one multiway rendezvous to the next. “Who would’ve thought there was this underbelly in this boring Silicon Plateau?” thinks Vivaan. “By day, everyone was an IT developer, project manager, venture capitalist and whatnot. And by night, they were... open to being anything.”Bhattacharya gives a fairly provocative side-eye to the notion of progress, registering potential losses as well as obvious gainsIt’s no surprise when Vivaan starts asking questions of where he and Zed stand. Twining their story with those of past lives is a way for Bhattacharya to give fairly provocative side-eye to the notion of progress, registering potential losses as well as obvious gains. A plot turn into the farther frontiers of AI leavesDeviantspoised between a sober portrait of stymied lives and a bold satire on big tech and the marketisation of sex, leaving us uncomfortably uncertain (victory, for a novelist) about the precise nature of Vivaan’s hard-won freedoms.View image in fullscreenTash Aw’s The South unfolds in rural Malaysia.Photograph: Sinseeho Travel/AlamyAw’s equally absorbing new novel,The South, unfolds in a gentler key. Set in rural Malaysia, it has a more classic coming-of-age setup, taking place over a single summer during the teenage narrator’s school holidays. We’re somewhere in the mid-2010s (there arecorruption allegations against the disgraced prime minister Najib Razak), when Jay pitches up from his unnamed home city with his Chinese-Malaysian family to figure out how best to deal with the long-neglected farm they’ve just inherited after his grandfather’s death. Gruffly dispatched by his dad to make himself useful on the land, he spends long days in the company of Chuan, a shrewd young farm worker in the family’s employ: Jay’s first cigarette, first beer and first kiss all ensue in short order.His cross-class relationship, built on swims and scooter rides and fuelled by lingering glances and, eventually, secret trysts, unfolds with unsensational reserve against the backdrop of wider family upheaval caused by revelations about Jay’s father, a university lecturer facing pre-retirement redundancy in a case of long-brewing sectarian discrimination. The double life he’s shown to have led holds up a mirror to Jay’s own, and supplies one of several contexts for the novel’s delicate airing of age-old questions about what it means to be a man.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lina won’t tell their parents about her Malay boyfriend for fear of what they’ll say; a worry confirmed by the casual bigotry of Chuan, whose views repeatedly grind against the righteousness of the novel’s big-city blow-ins, whether he’s standing up for the bulldozing of ancient forests or laughing at Jay’s question of whether they’ll be “able to hold hands in the street one day, somewhere”: “Don’t you have better things to think about in life?”, he responds, crushingly.The personal is political, but these novels – each smart and engaging,The Southinterior,Deviantsexpansive – unsettle the instrumentalism implied by that old saw (“What if same-sex love is not an act of resistance, what if that is just how it is for some people?”, asks one of Bhattacharya’s gay narrators).

If you know nothing about this period of history, which unfolds during the Tang dynasty, you’ll certainly learn a lot, but you’ll need to pay close attention to the welter of journeys to far-flung provinces, battles fought in mountain passes, and characters of note met along the way.The two main characters are governor and general Gao Shi (voiced as a young man by Yang Tianxiang, as an elder by Wu Junquan) and poet Li Bai (Ling Zhenhe and then Xuan Xiaoming). The latter was considered one of the greatest poets in Chinese history, and the film honours him and his work by featuring dozens of his poems, often declaimed lustily by the character in various states of inebriation (he was a legendary drinker). Gao Shi was also a poet of some note apparently, but the film makes it clear he was not in Li Bai’s league. Instead, Gao Shi gets to basically narrate the story of his and Li Bai’s entwined lives in one long flashback, told to a visiting luminary over the course of a single night before a decisive battle. (Surely the storytelling could wait so that the elderly Gao Shi could have a good sleep before the fight?)Chang’an, the title under which the film is released in the UK, refers to the ancient capital of China, of which we get to see quite a lot in the course of the story, rendered in gloriously intricate detail. The animation is indeed quite spectacular: fine grained as antique wood, made to be shown in 3D so that every pore and hair is practically photorealistic. No less care has been expended on the characters’ expressions, so the level of animated acting is very high indeed. That said, it all feels like a massive propaganda construction, celebrating a Chinese heritage that was maximally expansive and culturally significant, able to lord its sophistication over the barbarians at the borders. It’s significant, perhaps, that this subject should be chosen now, but if you want to appreciate an unquestionably impressive example of state-sponsored art, have a look at this.Chang’an is in UK and Irish cinemas from 28 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmPeriod and historical filmsChinaPoetryAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

So he is well placed to tackle another investigation, this time into how cyber sex crime has become an online policing war. But as he speaks to young people and experts, and travels across the globe in pursuit of answers, he is shocked to find that the “sextortion” picture is even darker than he imagined.Hollie RichardsonThe Fear Clinic: Face Your Phobia8pm, Channel 4It’s the final visit to the Amsterdam clinic that forces clients to literally face their fears.

It’s a provocative art show, a gallery space, and a shop in one: the words To Hell With Everything are written in pink neon on the window and set the tone as you enter. Inside, it’s wall-to-wall irreverent prints, pin badges, T-shirts, bags and postcards, with images of ducklings and frogs, walruses, raccoons and rubbish bins.Tullinsgade 3Modern pleasureView image in fullscreenPeech.Photograph: Theis MortensenCopenhagen is a sex-positive city – Denmark was the first country to legalise porn back in 1969 – and at contemporary sex shopPeechthe team firmly believe that buying sex toys should not be embarrassing. Opened in 2021 as an antidote to the stereotypical dark-and-seedy sex shop, its Nørrebro store is colourful and unthreatening, with helpful staff keen to make sure you feel comfortable and safe – a very Copenhagen take on the genre.Guldbergsgade 25Extraordinary scentsView image in fullscreenCrime Passionnel.Photograph: Filip GieldaCrime Passionnel, off atmospheric Magstræde on a little cobbled street, stocks a carefully curated, deliberately offbeat selection of perfume. Want to smell like the battle of Trafalgar? Or, perhaps, a biscuit? Or maybe you’re trying to track down a perfume that brings together the exact scent of maple syrup, pancakes and American diner coffee? Run by a passionate team, with walls lined with niche perfumes from South Korea, France, Italy and England, it’s a world away from a department store perfume hall.Hyskenstræde 14Quirky ceramicsView image in fullscreenStudio Arhoj.There are numerous tasteful, oatmeal/beige-themed ceramics shops in the city and they’re all worth a visit, butStudio Arhøj’smulti-coloured wonderland of curvaceous shapes, dripping glazes and bubbly glass is something else. Watch the glassblowers at work in the studio and browse shelves stacked with glassware, tableware, candle holders and vases decorated with googly-eye motifs and Mr Men-like characters. Owner Anders Arhøj has a graphic design background, has worked as a children’s book illustrator, and used to live in Japan, hence the style where Japanese ceramic techniques meet a playful, childlike world. Bonus: the staff are well versed in wrapping fragile items for international transit.Skindergade 7Retro toysView image in fullscreenPrik.Prikis a portal back to a 1970s childhood, selling everything from little paper windmills that swirl in a breeze to tiny plastic animals, knitted dolls, doll houses, toy cars and tiny slips of red plastic fish that curl up in your hand and tell your fortune. Run by Annette for the past 17 years, the treasure trove of a shop is packed to the rafters with dressing-up clothes and bags, room decorations and toys, with something at every price, for every child. It’s not all retro – there are new toys and handmade toys as well – but the trip down memory lane makes it extra fun.Gammel Kongevej 127, FrederiksbergWomen’s sneakersPutting the fun – and female – back into sneaker shops isNaked. Copenhagen’s premier destination for women who love trainers and streetwear has been around since 2004.

The boutique – which has a cafe-bar – is a bijou exhibition of champagne coupes, tables topped with discs of grey marble, perfectly turned sculptural wooden chairs and mugs with exaggerated handles. While you couldn’t describe the larger items as an impulse buy, the ceramics and occasional lighting could fit in hand luggage and bring that sense of Danish calm back home. The cafe is lit with parchment-coloured globe candles, and serves coffee in generous mugs accompanied by buns from superstar local bakeryJuno.Vognmagergade 9Boiled sweetsView image in fullscreenSømods Bolcher.Walk through a little courtyard behind Nørreport station and step back into the 1900s atSømods Bolcher, which has been making artisanal boiled sweets since 1891. The tiny factory behind the shop is at work twisting and pulling colourful ropes of sugar into sweet treats every day – it’s fun to watch the sweet-makers at work. The boiled sweets come in a rainbow of flavours, from the Danish favourite, liquorice, to pear, sherbert and rhubarb. Buy them in a pre-mixed bag, by the lollipop or in a mix of your choice – they’re all natural, following an age-old recipe.Nørregade 36BVintage fashionView image in fullscreenLidkøb.The best place to go vintage shopping is a Danish flea market. Outside the main flea-market season (April to October),Lidkøbis your next best bet. In a former storage warehouse in Østerbro (and easy to reach by metro), it’s a riotous jumble sale of fashion and homewares where you never know what you may find. A new Rotate dress with the tags in? A perfect unworn pair of Converse? Old Icelandic sweaters, Iittala glasses, a foot spa or a chocolate fountain could also be there. It’s not always cheap – this is Copenhagen after all – but there is a cafe for tired partners and friends.Strynøgade 7, ØsterbroCreative floristryView image in fullscreenFlowerism Studio.Fresh flowers are a tradition in Denmark, where florists do a roaring trade with a “Friday bouquet” to celebrate the upcoming weekend. However, for visitors wanting something longer-lasting to take home, the creative fake flowers atFlowerism Studio, down a cobbled street in the centre of town, are just as tempting. The shop opened in the summer of 2024 after enjoying huge popularity online, and it’s worth stopping by just to browse the creative bouquets.Valkendorfsgade 15Books & moreView image in fullscreenBooks & Company.Photograph: Anne Prytz SchaldemoseThe city’s best bookshop,Books & Company, in the chi-chi suburb of Hellerup, is stocked with 100% English tomes.

I want to see friends and family, but I’m also not too fussed about leaving the house. It’s too cold to be checking train times and organising diaries – come to mine and we can curl up in the warm. It’s also the time of year when I most crave comfort and nostalgia: school-style traybakes with cream (or custard, if you must) and retro dishes such as glazed ham, egg and chips. This coronation cauliflower salad is well within that theme: it’s retro and familiar, but also seasonal and worthy.Coronation cauliflower and egg saladFeel free to ramp up the spice, but to me this hearty, playful salad is perfect just the way it is.Prep10 minCook35 minServes41 large cauliflower, trimmed, outer leaves removed½ tspturmeric powder2 tbsp vegetable oilSea salt andblack pepper4 large eggs,at room temperature1 tbsp mild curry powder3 tbsp mayonnaise2 tbspgreek yoghurt1 tbsp mango chutney1 large (or 2 small) little gem lettuce, washed4 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced1 small bunchchives, finely sliced½ tsp nigella seedsHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7.

Using shop-bought paste and leftover cooked rice or microwave rice makes easy work of this dish based on the popular Thai soup. The paste sings of tom yum’s flavours, with galangal, lemongrass, chilli and lime leaf, while the extra aromatics boost the fragrance and vibrant punch. Tom yum paste (I likeMaesri’s) and lime leaves are available at supermarkets, Asian grocers and online.Tom yum fried ricePrep20 minCook25 minServes2Peanut oil, or other neutral oil2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped30g ginger, peeled and finely chopped or grated1 lemongrass stalk, white part only, finely chopped3 makrut lime leaves, deveined and very thinly sliced10g coriander(ie, a small handful), leaves picked, stalks finely chopped2 spring onions, trimmed and thinly sliced2½ tbsp tom yum paste2 tsp tomato paste12 large peeled prawns, peeled but tails left on, and deveined (215g)80g brown or white mushrooms, sliced8 cherry tomatoes(100g), halved250g cooked and cooled jasmine rice, or 250g cooked and cooled microwave rice1½ tsp fish sauce1 tsp sugar1 lime, cut into wedges2 eggsCucumber slices, to serveShop-bought fried shallots, to servePut a tablespoon and a half of oil in a wok on a medium-high heat.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.How can I make a tin of baked beans tastier?“You’ve come to the right place,” says food writerMelek Erdal. “One of my most popular recipes ever wasjazzed-up beans on toast,which came out of lockdown, when we were all utilisingeverything.” Essentially, when it comes to injecting flavour into baked beans, it’s all about the base, and for Erdal that means toasting spices (cumin seeds, ground coriander, aleppo chilli) in an ovenproof pan, then adding “the magic triangle”, namely ginger, garlic and chilli, and some oil. “Add the beans, crumble feta on top, then pop it in the oven until the top caramelises.” Erdal might also add a drizzle of tahini, “for a take on shakshuka, and a lovely brunch or lunch.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In a similar riffable vein, Eleanor Maidment, author ofPulse, makes a base of chorizo and red peppers, then adds beans and poaches some eggs in them. Cured meat is, of course, always a good idea, too: “Baked beans are quite sweet, so savoury things work really well with them,” Maidment says. “Fry onions and bacon, then add the beans and a splash of Worcestershire sauce, say.”It’s also helpful to think of your tin as beans in tomato sauce, rather than as a standalone dish, advises the Guardian’s ownFelicity Cloake. “Each tin is the start of any number of quick, tomato-based bean dishes,” she says, although a good start would be frying chopped onion, perhaps some ginger or diced carrot and celery, then stirring in spices or dried herbs: “Curry powder or an Indian spice blend of your choice, oregano and garlic for an Italian vibe [and especially good with mozzarella], or smoked paprika and crumbled chorizo for a Spanish feel … You get the idea.” Add the beans, bring to a simmer, stir in some frozen spinach and top with an egg, thick yoghurt and/or crumbled cheese: “Once you start seeing them as a stew, rather than a topping, a world of beany possibilities will open up.”You could expand your horizons further still with Ed Grace’s Tuscan twist. “Everyone knows how good baked beans and sausages are together,” says the chef atTrulloin London, “and when they’re cooked with wine and sage, too, they turn into a simple yet delicious dinner.” For two, he browns six good-quality sausages until golden. “Turn down the heat, add two finely sliced garlic cloves, three sage leaves and half a tablespoon of fennel seeds, and cook for three minutes more.” Pour in 75ml white wine and, once that’s evaporated, add a tin of baked beans, 500g spinach and a ladleful of chicken stock (or water). “Cook for about five minutes, until the spinach has wilted and the sauce has thickened, then finish with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.” Also looking to sunnier climes, Maidment might bolster baked beans with tomato puree, olive oil, garlic and fresh herbs, or she’d go in with some chipotle paste: “Stuff those into tacos with avocado and grated cheese”.If it’s baked beans you’re after, download the new Feast app: lots of bean recipes there. Scan or clickherefor your free trial.And if time is of the essence, other easy updates Erdal has in her arsenal include simply adding a knob of butter (“Thatalwaysworks”), mixing up the beans (“Bung in half a tin of drained butter beans, too”), or accessorising beans on toast with crumbled feta, chopped spring onion and parsley: “That’s how I make them a justifiable meal, anyway.”Got a culinary dilemma?

You’ll need about 150g per person.The broth is at its most satisfying when made with pork bonesPut the bones into a large pot, pour in enough water to come two-thirds of the way up the pan then bring to the boil. Add anonion, halved, 8black peppercorns, 1 tsp ofcoriander seeds, acarrotor two, a stick ofcelery, a couple ofbay leavesand 3star aniseflowers. Thinly slice a 60g piece ofgingerand add to the pan. Turn the heat down so the liquid bubbles calmly then partially cover with a lid. Leave for 45-60 minutes.For 2 people, cook 75g ofpearl barleyin boiling, lightly salted water for about 20 minutes till chewily tender. Drain and set aside. Fill the pan with water and return to the heat. Wash 4 big handfuls of greens, such aspurple sprouting broccoli,kaleandchard leaves, then cook them briefly in the boiling water and drain. Make 4 slices oftoast.Pour the stock through a colander to remove the vegetables and aromatics. Taste and check the seasoning – it will almost certainly need salt. Divide the barley and toast between 4 bowls, add the cooked greens, some of the reserved meat, then ladle over the hot broth.Enough for 2. Ready in 1 hour.For 4 people, I use approximately 150g purple sprouting broccoli, 125g of chard leaves and 50g of kale.The broth is at its most satisfying when made with pork bones, but a roast chicken carcass is a fine contender. I try to include any jelly from the roasting tin too, as well as bits of difficult-to-carve meat.Follow Nigel on Instagram@NigelSlaterExplore more on these topicsSoupNigel Slater's midweek dinnerPorkBeans, pulses and legumesFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One of the best known and still most widely used rankings singles out time as the most important factor: the basic thinking behind classifying a rioja reserva or gran reserva as in some way special is that the longer a wine has spent ageing in barrel and bottle before it is released, the more refined it will be.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

The general idea is that quality (or, at least, price) increases as the area where the grapes are grown becomes smaller, from single country to single region to single village, single estate and, finally, the most popular, single vineyard. It’s a way of thinking that is inspired by the wines and wine culture of arguably the most influential region in the contemporary wine world, Burgundy, which has a long established system that zeroes in from AOC bourgogne, with its grapes sourced from across the eastern French region, to the 33 officially top-ranked vineyard plots known as “grands crus”.The rampant spread of the “single vineyard” wine is not without its issues. Too many producers use the term to add lustre to ordinary wines from vineyards with little to commend them or that are so vast in size (extending more than 1,000 hectares) they make a nonsense of the idea. The rise of the single vineyard has also undermined, to some extent, the ancient art of blending: there is a reason producers in places such as Champagne, Barolo and South Australia traditionally chose to mix parcels of grapes from different growing conditions all around their region: it helped them to make a consistent, in more than a few cases, a more complex and frankly better wine.But as someone who has come to cherish wine’s ability to act as a kind of virtual form of travel, I have enjoyed seeing the wave of single vineyard bottlings emerging from all over the world. There’s a great deal of (admittedly slightly trainspotterish) pleasure to be had in finding out how a place “tastes” and in comparing the sometimes enormous differences between wines produced from neighbouring vineyards. And for all that the term is not always a guarantee of quality, some vineyards really do seem to have a talent, or a set of conditions, for producing distinctively delicious wines – wines that just couldn’t come from anywhere else.Six wines that know their placeView image in fullscreenFino Valdespino Inocente Sherry, Jerez, Spain NV(£11.95, 37.5cl,leaandsandeman.co.uk)The source materials for sherry are as important as any wine, and the single vineyard used to provide the grapes for this fine fino play a key role in shaping its richly satisfying, savoury, baked apple and sourdough tang.Leyda Single Vineyard Garuma Sauvignon Blanc, Leyda Valley, Chile 2023(from £11,Tesco;greatwinesdirect.co.uk)Bristling with lime and fresh spring veg greenness, this arresting sauvignon blanc, from a single vineyard just a stone’s throw from the cool of the Pacific Ocean, is consistently one of Chile’s best and most invigorating dry whites.Royal Tokaji on the QT Bin 35 Single Vineyard Old Vine Furmint Szent Tamás, Tokaj, Hungary 2023(£19.99,Waitrose)The great Hungarian wine region was one of the earliest to map and classify its best vineyards and Szent Tamás is one of the highest-rated, and source of this gloriously rich, complex dry whites with its typically electrifying, febrile acidity.Michelini i Mufatto Certezas Semillon, Mendoza Argentina 2021(£39.30,corneyandbarrow.com)After years in the doldrums, the semillon grape is having a moment in Argentina, and this example, from a 133-year-old vineyard, with its subtle grip, herbs, stone fruit and saline edge, is astonishing: a simultaneously substantial and graceful dry white.Domaine de Mourchon Séguret Tradition, Côtes du Rhône Villages, France 2022(£18.99,laithwaites.co.uk)An exemplary Southern Rhône blend of grenache, syrah and carignan, this gloriously deep-flavoured, lusciously dark-berry fruited but lithe and spicy red takes you right back to the idyllic sun-dappled vineyard where it came from.Vineyard Collection Oak Valley Swartland Cinsault, Swartland, South Africa 2022(£14.99,virginwines.co.uk)South African winemakers have transformed the previously much-maligned cinsault variety, producing wines that shimmer with pretty red fruits and subtle earthy tones, sourced, in this case, from just three rows of old vines in a hillside vineyard.Explore more on these topicsFoodDavid Williams on wineWineFrench food and drinkSpanish food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"
