I won’t let this rest | Gordon BrownMichael SavageMedia editorSat 26 Apr 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Apr 2025 14.11 EDTShareThe former prime minister Gordon Brown has made a new complaint to British police over allegations that Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper empire obstructed justice, after stating he has spoken to officers involved in the original phone-hacking inquiry.Writing in the Guardian, Brown said one of the detectives had alleged they believed there was “significant evidence” that News Group Newspapers (NGN) deleted millions of emails to pervert the course of justice.In the article, Brown states that the former officers told him that if they had been aware of the background to the email deletions, they would have pushed for further action.Brown said one former officer told him: “If we had known this in 2011, we would have investigated fully and taken a different course of action including considering arrests.”“Today I am making a criminal complaint to the Met and CPS alleging that I am, along with many others, a victim of the obstruction of the course of justice by News Group,” he writes. “This is not an allegation made lightly.It is informedby recentlyavailable evidence, and by thestatements of senior officersinvolved in the original investigations into unlawful news gathering, who have now stated to me that they were misled.”NGN strenuously denies any allegations of evidence destruction. It said the Crown Prosecution Service concluded in 2015 that there was no evidence that company email deletions were carried out to pervert the course of justice.In January,NGN apologised to Prince Harryfor phone hacking by journalists at its Sunday tabloid, the News of the World, and the “serious intrusion by the Sun between 1996 and 2011 into his private life, including incidents of unlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for the Sun”.The apology was part of an out-of-court settlement to end litigation brought against NGN by the prince andTom Watson, a former Labour deputy leader.Brown said the settlement had “not closed an era of investigation and litigation into media corruption. It has opened it up”.Brown’s complaint to the Metropolitan police follows details ofclaims made by former detectivescontained in a document filed with the high court in London.Their statements were made in support of the long-running phone-hacking litigation pursued against NGN by Harry and Watson.View image in fullscreenTom Watson gives a statement outside the high court in January after he and Prince Harry settled with NGN.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersThe skeleton legal arguments of both sides,reported by the Guardian, were not made public at the time and the claims have not been tested at trial because of the settlement.No admissions were made about the allegation of illegal destruction of evidence, which NGN strongly denies. The company said it would have successfully fought the allegation if the case had gone to trial.In his piece for the Guardian, Brown accuses Will Lewis, now chief executive of the Washington Post but then a senior NGN executive, ofattempting to incriminate him and Watson.He claims a false allegation against them was used to justify the deletion of emails to officers involved in Operation Weeting, the Met investigation launched in January 2011 to examine phone-hacking allegations.His accusation relates to documents disclosed in high court civil actions last year, which included a minute taken by the Met police of a meeting detectives held with Lewis on 8 July 2011.In the meeting, Lewis said the company had been told of a plot involving Brown and Watson to obtain the emails of Rebekah Brooks, the then chief executive of News International, through a third party. Lewis was the company’s general manager at the time.View image in fullscreenFormer senior NGN executive Will Lewis, who has previously denied wrongdoing, is at the centre of Gordon Brown’s allegations.Photograph: Elliott O’Donovan/APBrown states that one of the investigating officers has now said to him that NGN “falsely implicatedGordon Brown. If I had known this I would have made arrests for obstruction of justice.”NGN apologised to Watson over the idea of a plot as part of the settlement of his case, stating the company now understood “this information was false”.However, the company has said they believed at the time that the threat was genuine and would have proved this at trial. NGN planned to cite a 2011 email from Brooks, not previously made public, expressing concern about the internal security of the company’s IT systems.NGN’s skeleton defence also noted that a range of security measures were subsequently taken. The company also refers to a letter sent in January 2011 by Watson to the then Met assistant commissioner, John Yates, disclosed ahead of trial. In it Watson claimed to have been approached by former company employees with “knowledge of the information technology arrangements of News International”, NGN claimed.Lewis has previously strongly denied wrongdoing. He did not comment when approached by the Guardian.In its skeleton defence, NGN strenuously rejected allegations of a cover-up. A spokesperson stated that there was a lack of contemporaneous evidence in support of the claimants’ case and that NGN had a strong a lineup of witnesses who could confirm its own position. They said thestatements of two former officers with concernswere a “selective and partial consideration of the contemporaneous documents”.According to NGN’s skeleton argument, the deletion of emails had “long been in the planning, for sound commercial, IT and practical reasons”, and that Harry and Watson’s claims in this area had drawn on “wholly unreasonable inferences from an incomplete account of the facts, many of which are taken entirely out of context”.An NGN spokesperson said that when Operation Weeting was initiated, the company handed incriminating material to police, while officers were immediately made aware of “the steps NGN had taken in relation to its historic email archive as well as the actions it had taken to preserve relevant evidence”.View image in fullscreenRebekah Brooks, former chief executive of News International, with Rupert Murdoch.Photograph: ShutterstockThey said NGN worked alongside specialist IT police officers for months to reconstruct its electronic archives.“The allegations of email deletion had formed part of the prosecution case in the criminal trial in 2013/14,” they said. “The investigation into News International concluded in 2015, almost 10 years ago, with a lengthy statement by the CPS deciding that no further action was to be taken in the light of there being no evidence to support an allegation of wrongdoing.”Brown writes that the police should request a series of court documents submitted during years of litigation, including from former NGN employees and ex-police officers.He also calls for prosecutors to step in – and for parliamentary committees to reopen their inquiries into the deletion of emails. He also asks the attorney general, Richard Hermer, to intervene.A spokesperson for NGN said: “NGN once again strenuously denies that there was any plan to delete emails in order to conceal evidence from a police investigation.”They said Brown was an “unreliable complainant driven by vendetta and revenge for perceived wrongs by NGN”. They said NGN figures working with police on company emails “acted throughout with the utmost integrity and at all times followed the protocol agreed with the [Metropolitan police] in order to provide access to and restore data”.“Mr Brown’s concerns again provide an inaccurate summary of allegations dealt with in the civil proceedings, which have already been extensively investigated and litigated,” an NGN spokesperson said. “It is not uncommon for retired police officers to hold views about their failure to achieve a conviction or matters that have not gone their way in court … There are officers from the 2011 to 2015 investigations who, in possession of all the facts, would not agree.”A Met spokesperson said: “While we acknowledge that information emerging from civil proceedings is of interest to the public and the press who may be seeing it for the first time, in the vast majority of cases it is material that has already been considered as part of the numerous investigations and reviews that have previously been carried out.“We are aware that parties in this recent case indicated an intention to pass material to us but we are yet to receive any such correspondence. In the event that we do, we will consider it carefully and proportionally, recognising the need to explore genuine lines of inquiry but acknowledging the significant resources already committed to past investigations.”Explore more on these topicsPhone hackingGordon BrownWill LewisRupert MurdochPrince HarryTom WatsonNational newspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump said that “most of the major points are agreed to”, in a post on his Truth Social platform, without further elaboration. He called for a meeting between Kyiv and Moscow’s leadership to sign a ceasefire deal, which he said was “very close”.Despite Trump’s eagerness for a deal, significant differences remain between the US vision for peace and what Ukraine and its European allies have deemed acceptable conditions for a ceasefire.Two sets of peace plans published by Reuters on Friday showed that the US is proposing Moscow retain the territory it has captured, including the strategic Crimean peninsula, whichRussiaannexed in 2014.A carve-up in gift wrapping: Trump’s peace plan puts the sacrifice on UkraineRead moreThis is seemingly a non-starter for Ukraine and European countries, with Zelenskyy insisting the territory is the “property of the Ukrainian people”.“Our position is unchanged,” the Ukrainian president told reporters in Kyiv. “The constitution of Ukraine says that all the temporarily occupied territories … belong to Ukraine.”It is also unclear if Moscow will agree to the US peace deal, which is seen as offering considerable concessions to Russia.On Saturday, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said all Ukrainian troops had been forced from Russia’s Kursk region, a key aim for Moscow. Ukrainian officials disputed the claim.The technical details of a ceasefire deal still need to be hammered out, including how western sanctions imposed on Russia would be lifted and what sort of security guarantees would be offered to Ukraine.Trump acknowledged on Friday that the talks were “very fragile”, and he has warned that the US would halt its mediation efforts if the two sides did not come to an agreement soon.Fighting continues in tandem with mediation efforts, and the Kremlin blames Ukraine for a car bomb that killed a senior Russian general near Moscow on Friday. Kyiv did not comment on the incident, the latest in a string of killings of Russian military officials over the past three years.The day before, Russiacarried out its deadliest attack in months on Ukraine, launching 70 missiles and 145 drones, mostly towards Kyiv.The attack caused Trump to lash out at Putin on social media. “I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Let’s get the Peace Deal DONE!” Trump posted on Truth Social on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsUkraineDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyPope FrancisRussiaVaticanThe papacynewsShareReuse this content"

Now we have this huge hole,” said Cirielli. “He left us during a very ugly period for the world. He was the only one who loudly called for peace.”0:56From Trump to Prince William: who attended Pope Francis's funeral? – videoThe pilgrims were joined by leaders from more than 150 countries, including the US president, Donald Trump, who had repeatedly clashed with Francis over immigration, and his wife, Melania. A White House official said Trump had a “very productive” meeting before the ceremony with Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A photo showed the pair sitting opposite each other on chairs inside St Peter’s Basilica. Another image showed them with the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Trump and Zelenskyy were also expected to meet after the mass.Other guests included the former US president Joe Biden, who last met Francis at the G7 summit in Puglia in June 2024, the Argentinian president, Javier Milei, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, Julian Assange, and Prince William.More than 2,000 journalists from around the world travelled to Rome to cover the event.The 90-minute mass was celebrated by 220 cardinals, 750 bishops and more than 4,000 priests.View image in fullscreenPallbearers carry the coffin in St Peter’s Square.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images“The outpouring of affection that we have witnessed in recent days following his passing from this Earth into eternity tells us how much the profound pontificate of Pope Francis touched minds and hearts,” Battista Re said at the start of his eulogy.He recalled that the last image many people would have had of Francis was of him delivering what would become his final blessing on Easter Sunday, and saluting from the popemobile in the same piazza where his funeral was celebrated.Di Battista described Francis’s charisma of “welcome and listening”, adding that the guiding thread of his mission was “the conviction that the church is home for all”.There was more applause and cries of “Papa Francesco!” among the crowds lining the streets as the late pontiff made his final journey, aboard a specially adapted popemobile, from the Vatican towards his burial tomb at Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica in Rome’s Esquilino neighbourhood.View image in fullscreenCrowds fill St Peter’s Square.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesFlanked by police on motorbikes, the vehicle, which had been used on one of Francis’s trips overseas, crossed a bridge over Rome’s Tiber River, before slowly making its way along Via Vittorio Emmanele, passing Piazza Venezia, the Roman Forum, and the Colosseum before arriving at Santa Maria Maggiore, a basilica loved by Francis.Francis was given a final sendoff by a group of people, including prisoners, refugees, transgender people and the homeless, who awaited his arrival on the steps of the fourth-century basilica.Cardinals then performed the rite of burial, a private event attended by some of Francis’ relatives. His coffin was blessed by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who is leading the church between papacies, before it was interred.View image in fullscreenFrance’s Emmanuel Macron, Britain’s Keir Starmer and US president Donald Trump speak with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Photograph: Ukrainian Presdential Press Service/AFP/Getty ImagesFrancis is the first pontiff in more than a centurynot to be buried with great fanfarein the grottoes beneath St Peter’s Basilica. Instead, his coffin was entombed in a small niche that until now has been used to store candlestick holders.As requested in his final testament, the tomb will not be decorated and will be inscribed only with his papal name in Latin: Franciscus. The public will be able to visit the tomb from Sunday.As the funeral wraps up, speculation about who will succeed Francis will go into overdrive.Francis, born in Argentina, was the first non-European pope for almost 13 centuries. During his 12-year papacy, the liberal late pontiff faced some fierce challenges from rightwing cardinals. Nine days of mourning will begin from Saturday, with a conclave – thesecret election process to choose a new pope– therefore not expected to begin before 5 May.There is no clear frontrunner, although Luis Antonio Tagle, a reformer from the Philippines, and Pietro Parolin, from Italy, are early favourites.Virginio and his wife, Anna Maria, travelled to Rome from Naples for the funeral. They’re here to reflect on Francis but are also contemplating who will follow him.“We hope the new pope continues along the same line as Francis,” said Anna Maria.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismVaticanItalyChristianityReligionThe papacynewsShareReuse this content"

The fireworks were lit and the men in blue and red sprinted towards him from all sides of this stadium: here, at last, it was. TheCopa del Reyfinal, a firstclásicofinal in 11 years, had a winner. They had been a goal up and a goal down, they had thought they had a last-minute penalty to win it, but now the Catalan side had done it. Real Madrid had fought and rebelled, but eventually they were defeated 3-2.You might call it a game of two halves, but there were four of them, and they had been superb. They also had an unlikely man there at the heart of a decisive moment: Pedri, Kylian Mbappé, Aurélien Tchouaméni and Ferran Torres had all scored and now it was Koundé who did. It had also had a very, very likely man standing in the middle of what might have been the decisive moment: after all the talk about referees, after Madridhad boycotted pre-match activitiesand the threat that they might boycott the game itself, it was indeed the officials who took the spotlight at the decisive moment.Barcelona 3-2 Real Madrid (aet): Copa del Rey final – as it happenedRead moreRicardo De Burgos Bengoetxea, who had cried in the pre-match press conference, prompting that no-show from Madrid, gaveBarcelonaa penalty with 30 seconds of normal time remaining. But Pablo González Fuertes, the video assistant referee whose talk of taking action against those who criticised officials had so incensed Madrid, called him to the screen. And so there they were, time run out, a decision to make. Eventually the penalty was withdrawn, and so it went to extra time and Koundé’s moment.What a relief that Madrid had not boycotted this, even if at the end they may have wished they had. They played their part in a brilliant final that swung back and forth, where exhausted players gave everything – one that dignified this competition more than what had happened the day before. At the end of it, Barcelona – whose high line, life lived on the edge, had seen a Madrid goal and two penalties ruled out by the offside flag – had the trophy. Madrid were furious, but it had been some occasion.How exhausted everyone was. How this game had swung. How long ago, those early moments felt. It had taken took 56 seconds for Madrid to even touch the ball and then, when they did, they immediately lost it again, the tone was set already. In a first half in which Madrid found themselves always arriving a fraction later and Barcelona dominated, they fell behind to a lovely Pedri goal.Twice they might have equalised, two of those three flags denying them, but Barcelona were dominating, seemingly in control until the half-time introduction of Mbappé and a new mentality shifted everything. Arda Guler and Luka Modric too tipped the balance. Madrid were alive and could sense of vulnerability hidden until then. Every action felt like an opportunity. Pressed, Barcelona were finding it hard to get out and even harder to resist.View image in fullscreenKylian Mbappé (right) scores Real Madrid’s equaliser from a free-kick.Photograph: Joan Monfort/APThe equaliser came when Mbappé was dragged down by Frenkie de Jong. Madrid wanted a red card, the fans chanting about corruption at the federation, but they got something better. From the free-kick, Mbappe bend beyond Szczesny’s hand. Running to the touchline he gestured the way Cristiano Ronaldo once did against Barcelona: “Calm down, I’m here.” Barcelona knew: Mbappé was involved in another swift move with Bellingham that sent Vinícius Júnior skipping clear again, Barcelona rocking now. There was a speed and intent about Madrid, a directness, that soon led to Tchouaméni rising to head Madrid into the lead. Into the corner, they went, leaping about.But as the celebrating players broke Antonio Rüdiger had to be treated, a huge bandage applied to his leg. The significance of that was perhaps seen when with six minutes left, he couldn’t catch Torres as the forward ran on to Lamine Yamal’s lovely pass, went past Courtois and struck a clean, low, angled finish into the empty net to make it 2-2. Rüdiger, in his defence, continued and made a huge interception to deny Lamine Yamal as he raced into the area deep into added time. He also might have been fortunate not to be punished for what then appeared to be a foul in the area on Ferran Torres.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just maybe not with 30 seconds left. Raphinha dashed in from the right and went down under challenge from Raúl Asencio. De Burgos Bengoetxea gave the penalty. From the VAR room, though, González Fuertes called him to have another look. Minutes passed, conversations were had, pressure was applied. And in the middle of the storm, the last thing he could have ever wanted, the referee who says his son pays for moments like this too stood there alone. A single decision, a million consequences, so many thoughts to be blocked out. Eventually, De Burgos Bengoetxea stepped away from the screen and said: no penalty.View image in fullscreenReal Madrid players slump after Jules Koundé scored Barcelona’s third goal.Photograph: Joan Monfort/APAnd so to extra time, an exchange of blows, everyone on edge.

Their injuries were not regarded as life-threatening, police said.Counter Terrorism Policing North East said it had taken over the investigation “due to the circumstances surrounding the incident … Extensive enquiries continue to establish the full circumstances and explore any potential motivation.”The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said: “I am being kept updated on the serious violent incident in Leeds this afternoon.

She was the light that lifted so many survivors,” her family said in a statement confirmingher death.Her relentless pursuit of justice for what she claimed were the crimes committed against her by the billionaire financier and convicted paedophileJeffrey Epsteinmade her a public figure in her own right.The allegations she made againstPrince Andrewset in train a legal battle that culminated in an out-of-court settlement in which the royal admitted no wrongdoing.Andrew maintains his innocence, but the reputational damage brought on by the case – and the disastrous PR campaign he waged to cast doubt over Giuffre’s story – saw him step back from frontline duties with his image in tatters.In 2000, when she was 17-years-old, Giuffre met the British socialiteGhislaine Maxwellwhile working as a locker-room assistant at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Maxwell then offered her a job as massage therapist to Epstein.Giuffre alleged that after taking the role she was trafficked to the financier’s friends and clients and “passed around like a platter of fruit”. Among them, she claimed, was Prince Andrew.It was in March 2011 that Giuffre went on the record about the alleged horrors she faced, and claimed that she had met Andrew on three occasions in 2001.In the Mail on Sunday,she recounted her first alleged meeting with Andrewduring a six-week trip to Europe and North Africa when she was still 17. Giuffre said she flew to London with Epstein, who then took her to Maxwell’s house.She said that she, Epstein and Maxwell all stayed in the house overnight, and when Maxwell woke her up in the morning, she told Giuffre: “We’ve got to go shopping. You need a dress as you’re going to dance with a prince tonight.”She alleged Andrew arrived at Maxwell’s home before they went out for dinner and visited Tramp nightclub where, Giuffre claimed, she danced with Andrew.Later that evening, Giuffre said they all returned to Maxwell’s home where a now infamous photograph of Giuffre, Andrew and Maxwell was taken.She recounted two further meetings with Andrew: one in New York, and one on Epstein’s private island in the US Virgin Islands, by which time she was 18. At this point, claims of sexual contact with Andrew were not made public.In 2014, Giuffre made a court filing in Florida claiming that she was made to have sex with Andrew. A year later, a judge decided that her allegations about the prince were “immaterial and impertinent” to a defamation claim against Maxwell and ordered them struck out.In 2019, after Epstein’s arrest and death in jail, Giuffre gave her first television interview to NBC News, where she claimed she was “trafficked to that prince”.Later that year, after mounting public outcry, Andrew granted the BBC’s Newsnight programme an extraordinary interview that was widely seen as an embarrassment for the duke.Speaking to Emily Maitlis, Andrew said it was not possible for him to have been at Maxwell’s property in London on the night in question in 2001. Instead, he said he was at home after attending a children’s party at Pizza Express in Woking.He denied claims during the interview that he slept with Giuffre three times, saying: “I can absolutely, categorically tell you it never happened. I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.”The disastrous reception to the interview prompted Andrew to “step back from public duties for the foreseeable future”.In 2021, Giuffre sued Andrew in a New York court, accusing him of sexually abusing her at Epstein’s mansion in Manhattan and at other locations in 2001 when she was under the age of 18. The duke settled the case for an undisclosed sum in 2022.A month before he settled the case, Andrew was stripped of his military roles and use of the title His Royal Highness. The eventual settlement did not include an admission of wrongdoing from the duke, and he has continued to deny the allegations against him.Time has done little to repair Andrew’s public image. Last week, a rare public appearance at the royal family’s Easter Sunday service with King Charles sparked a fresh round of negative headlines.Giuffre’s death has not only drawn tributes, but also expressions of sorrow over the circumstances. Last month, she announced on social media that she had days to live after being involved in a bus crash. The story was later clarified by Giuffre and those around her.On Saturday, her family said she taken her own life at her farm in Western Australia.Charlotte Proudman, a barrister and women’s rights campaigner,said on X: “Virginia Giuffre survived sex trafficking, fought for justice for over a decade, and gave voice to the silenced.“She donated part of her $12m settlement to other victims. She has now taken her own life. The fight cost her everything.

One survey found a majority describing the president’s second stint in the White House so far as “scary”.Along with poor ratings on the economy and Trump’s immigration policy, a survey released on Saturday found that only 24% of Americans believe Trump has focussed on the right priorities as president.That poll comes as Trump’s popularity is historically low for a leader this early in a term. More than half of voters disapprove of Trump’s performance as president, and majorities oppose histariff policiesand slashing of the federal workforce.The scathing reviews come as Trump next week marks 100 days of his second stint office, and suggest Americans are already experiencing fatigue after a period that has seen global financial market nosedives and chilling deportations, including of documented people.A poll by the Associated Press-Norc Center for Public Affairs Researchpublishedthis weekend, found that even Republicans are not overwhelmingly convinced that Trump’s attention has been in the right place.Republican unity to be tested in talks over Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’Read moreA narrow majority, 54%, ofRepublicanssurveyed said that Trump is focussed on the “right priorities”, while the president’s numbers with crucial independent voters are much weaker. Just 9% of independents said that the president is focussed on the right priorities – with 42% believing Trump is paying attention to the wrong issues.About four in 10 people in the survey, 39%, approve of how Trump is handling the presidency overall, and only about 40% of Americans approve of Trump’s approach to foreign policy, trade negotiations and the economy.Meanwhile, aNew York Times/Siena College pollof registered voters on Friday found that Trump’s approval rating is 42%, and just 29% among independent voters. More than half of voters said Trump is “exceeding the powers available to him”, and 59% of respondents said the president’s second term has been “scary”.While Republican leaders typically receive strong scores on economic issues, Americans have been underwhelmed by Trump’s performance. The Times survey found that only 43% of voters approve of how Trump is handling the economy – a stark turnaround from aTimes poll in April 2024, which found that 64% approved of Trump’s economy in his first term.Half of voters disapproved of Trump’s trade policies with other countries, and 61% said a president should not have the authority toimpose tariffswithout congressional approval, while the Times reported that 63% – including 40% of Republicans – said “a president should not be able to deport legal immigrants who have protested Israel”.Further on immigration, a Washington Post-ABC-Ipsos poll on Friday found that 53% of Americans now disapprove of the president’s handling of immigration matters, while 46% approve. In February the majority was the other way, with half of those surveyed approving of Trump’s approach on that issue.The Postreportedthat as support has drained away on this topic, at this point 90% of Democrats, 56% of independents and 11% of Republicans dislike the way Trump is dealing with immigration.The poor reviews have dogged Trump all week. An Associated Presspollon Thursday found that about half of US adults say that Trump’s trade policies will increase prices “a lot” and another three in 10 think prices could go up “somewhat”, and half of Americans are “extremely” or “very” concerned about the possibility of the US economy going into a recession in the next few months.Polling conducted by the Trump-friendly Fox News has brought little respite. A survey published on Wednesday found that just 38% of Americans approve of Trump on the economy, with 56% disapproving.The Fox News poll found that 58% of respondents disapproved of Trump’s performance, and 59% disapproved on inflation. Just three in 10 Americans said they believed Trump’s policies were helping the economy, and only four in 10 said Trump’s policies will help the country.Among generation Z, generally regarded as those born between 1995 and 2012, a staggering 69% told pollsters for anNBC Stay Tuned surveythat they don’t approve of Trump’s handling of the economy and the cost of living. Gen Z participants complained of struggling to even pay the rent in some places, let alone buy a home, and they worry about inflation.A minority of gen Z people polled thought the country would be stronger if more people lived by traditional binary gender roles and more than 90% of those polled said they believed foreign students with visas or green cards should have the same due process protections as US citizens. This comes amid the Trump administration declaring there are only two genders, male and female, andarresting and detainingsome pro-Palestinian student activists without due process.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpRepublicansUS politicsTrump administrationUS foreign policyUS economyUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

He added that the port administration had previously been warned about the danger these chemicals posed.The Iranian government has not yet specified the exact cause of the explosion, though it suspected combustible chemicals to be behind the blast.The provincial attorney general had ordered a “thorough and urgent” investigation into the circumstances of the explosion, which local officials said began in several containers in the port.Shahid Rajaee is a large Iranian container facility that handles 80m tons of goods a year, including fuel and other combustible materials. It is part of the Bandar Abbas port, the country’s largest.State media had previously quoted Iranian security officials as saying “any speculation about the cause of the explosion is worthless”.Videos showed a huge billowing mushroom cloud and the force of the blast destroyed a nearby building and shattered windows.Injured people lay on the roadside as authorities declared a state of emergency at hospitals across Bandar Abbas to cope with the influx of wounded.Aerial and naval firefighting teams worked to extinguish the blast, and state media reported officials expected the firefighting operation to be completed within an hour. Local media reported people trapped under the wreckage of a collapsed building.View image in fullscreenPeople walk to safety after an explosion at the Shahid Rajaee port in Bandar Abbas, Iran.Photograph: Mohammad Rasoul Moradi/ReutersIn the aftermath of the explosion, port activities were suspended and Iranian customs officials halted export and transit shipments to the port.The state-owned National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company said that oil refineries, tankers and pipelines in the area continued to operate and were unaffected by the blast.The explosion occurred as Iran and the US met for the third round ofnuclear talksin Oman on Saturday, aiming to achieve a deal on Iran’s nuclear programme.Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araqchi spoke through Omani mediators for six hours on Saturday to create a framework for a new nuclear deal.Trump, in an interview with Time magazine on Friday, said that he thought a deal with Iran was possible. Oman’s foreign minister announced that another “high-level meeting” was scheduled for 3 May.The US and Israel view the prospect of Iran getting a nuclear weapon as an urgent threat. Iranian officials, in turn, are keen to lift a severe US sanctions regime on the beleaguered economy.“Iran remains steadfast in its principled stance on the need to end unjust sanctions and is ready to build confidence about the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said in Oman.In 2020, the Shahid Rajaee container facility was hit with a complex cyber-attack that jammed port logistics, which the Washington Postreportedas being perpetrated by Israel in retaliation for an Iranian cyber-attack.The cyber-attack was one of a series of incidents that has affected Iranian critical infrastructure in recent years.The government has blamed some of the incidents, such as a 2024 coalmine blast in southern Iran which killed 31 people, on negligence. Tehran has accused Israel of being behind other incidents, such as an attack on Iranian gas pipelines last year.The Israeli government made no comment on Saturday’s explosions in Iran.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

All three judges returned the same 116-112 scorecard in favour of the bigger, more poised and seasoned fighter who still had to weather some rocky moments when Benn hurt him.Eubank Jr was wobbled on numerous occasions but Benn, 28, was just too wild to administer conclusive punishment. In contrast, the 35-year-old landed the more effective blows, often in clubbing combinations, and Benn looked on the brink of being stopped in the last minute of the fight. Despite a cut eye and swollen face, Eubank Jr poured on the pressure as he went in search of the knockout.When his victory was confirmed Eubank Jr sank to his knees in relief and joy – while Benn, who had been so courageous, looked devastated.Chris Eubank Jr beats Conor Benn by unanimous decision – live reactionRead moreIt was a frenetic and violent brawl, short of finesse and class. Benn’s limitations were exposed while Eubank Jr suffered from the weight-cut rehydration clause which made him an additional $1m but caused him so many problems this week. They were both exhausted and drained but Eubank Jr matched the younger man for ambition and resolve – and he is the better boxer. He is entitled to enjoy his victory to the full because his gamble paid off. Eubank Jr had backed his knowhow and conviction against a lesser opponent and, more worryingly, the risk he took with his weight.A few hours earlier the muted hum that had settled over the stadium was replaced by a huge cheer as the big screens lit up with a surprising sight. Chris Eubank Sr stepped out of a suitably fancy car to the delight of a suddenly animated crowd that could not quite believe the old fighter had decided to attend in support of his estranged son. Those cheers then turned into a guttural roar as Eubank Jr walked across to greet his father.View image in fullscreenChris Eubank Sr with his son before Chris Eubank Jr fought Conor Benn.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersNo one seemed to care if it was a canny ploy – it looked and felt like a genuine reconciliation.Five minutes later, the dressing room cameras cut to the sight of Benn in his underwear. Sustained booing filled the arena and escalated when Eddie Hearn, Benn’s promoter, appeared next. The Eubanks, for once, seemed to be the good guys.Benn came out swinging, frantically, and the pattern was set. He missed more than he landed but his sheer aggression ensured a tight contest. There were plenty of warnings from the referee to both fighters, for their roughhouse tactics, and constant chatter between Eubank Jr and Benn. There were also moments of real drama. Eubank was hurt in the third but, in the next round, he nailed Benn with a shuddering right uppercut. Chants of “Eu-bank … Eu-bank” echoed around the arena but Benn fought back and they went toe-to-toe in a fierce battle.The scoring was tight but then, in the eighth round, Eubank Jr slowly began to beat up Benn who sagged against the ropes.. It was even more intense in the ninth as Eubank Jr was cut over his right eye after an accidental clash of heads. He was hurt again in the next stanza but ended it in the ascendancy.Eubank was three points clear as they started the final round – which he utterly dominated as Benn wilted amid the ferocity.View image in fullscreenChris Eubank Jr (left) and Conor Benn fall.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PARather than fighting for any titles the two men, who are normally separated by two weight divisions and operate below the elite level of world-class boxing, were put together in a crude money-making scrap built on the exploits of their fathers in the 1990s, cheap talk of family feuds and “bad blood”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Eubank Jr agreed to the request – and his confidence was justified.Eubank Jr shrugged aside the damaging effects of a perilous rehydration clause, which meant he could add only 10lb to his official weight on the morning of the fight. At least he made the 170lb rehydrated weight limit, which earned him an extra $1m, and compensated for the fact that he had lost exactly half that amount on Friday morning when he was less than an ounce over the stipulated middleweight mark.The previously undefeated Benn should have spent less time this week celebrating Eubank Jr’s weight tribulations and steeled himself for the biggest test of his modest career in the ring. He was also consumed by the idea that victory would have offered some kind of redemption after he had spent almost 1,000 days in the shadows of infamy following two positive results in two separate drug tests in 2022. But winning a domestic dust-up would not have cleansed the stain from Benn’s reputation.View image in fullscreenChris Eubank Jr celebrates with his father.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersEubank Jr will strut around with his typical air of entitlement because, throughout the long and protracted buildup, he has been by far the most impressive man among all those involved in selling this shameless promotion. Eubank Jr has spoken intelligently, amid his own bombast, and been a trenchant critic of Benn and his promoter, Eddie Hearn.The ring is unforgiving – and, for all his grit and guts, Benn could not quite match a bigger and heavier operator as experienced and savvy as the inimitable Eubank Jr.Explore more on these topicsBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s become this kind of political football.”Rowling had previously taken a swipe at Tennant for saying that Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch, who has called for abar on transgender peoplein single-sex spaces, should “shut up”, during his appearance at the British LGBT Awards in June 2024.When Badenoch was elected leader of the Conservative party in November, Rowling posted to X that her “thoughts and prayers” were “with David Tennant at this very difficult time”.Asked about Rowling’s remarks on the ITV1 show, which sees celebrities face questions from a group of autistic, neurodivergent and learning-disabled people, Tennant said: “JK Rowling is a wonderful author who’s created brilliant stories, and I wish her no ill will, but I hope that we can all as a society, just let people be. Just get out of people’s way.”Harry Potter actors Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have alsodistanced themselvesfrom Rowling’s gender-critical views, issuing statements in support of trans rights after the Scottish author’s2020 essayabout surviving sexual assault, in which she called arguments about “femaleness not residing in the sexed body … deeply misogynistic and regressive”.Rowling reportedly donated £70,000 to For Women Scotland, the campaign group whose long-running legal case against the Scottish government last week culminated in the UK supreme court ruling that the terms “woman” and “sex” in the Equality Act refer only to a biological woman and to biological sex.The Assembly will air on ITV1 at 10pm on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsDavid TennantTransgenderJK RowlingnewsShareReuse this content"

He had requested a simple burial, not a silent one.The quiet held while 14 pallbearers placed the wooden casket on the edge of the stairs for the start of the mass and continued while cardinals streamed to one side to form a blazing red bloc. On the other side was an array of dark-suited prime ministers, presidents, princes, princesses, kings and queens.View image in fullscreenPallbearers carrying the coffin of late Pope Francis during his burial at the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome.Photograph: Vatican Media Handout/EPAAnd in front, packed all the way down Via della Conciliazione to the edge of the Tiber, crowds gathered under Rome’s azure spring sky on Saturday to bid farewell to a pope who was number 266, yet a unique one.

Most of the mass was in Latin and punctuated with hymns and Gregorian chants. A light breeze ruffled an open gospel placed on the coffin.Battista Re is 92, but when he launched into the homily, a warm, personalised tribute to Francis made in Italian, he suddenly sounded younger, and that was when the crowd broke into cheers and applause.View image in fullscreenThe coffin of Pope Francis passes the Colosseum in Rome.Photograph: Bernat Armangué/APThe pontiff was a pope of the people, a pastor who knew how to reach the “least among us”, a man who believed that the church was “a home for all, a home with its doors always open”, said the cardinal.When he citedLampedusa– the Italian island synonymous with the pope’s outreach to migrants and refugees – the applause swelled. And did so again when he mentioned Francis’s visit to the border between Mexico and the US, and recited the pope’s mantra: “Build bridges, not walls.”The US president,Donald Trump, did not flinch, nor did Italy’s prime minister,Giorgia Meloni, two leaders associated withhardline policieson migrants. They were ringed by dozens of other political leaders, and there was safety in numbers because, for all their tributes to Francis, few, if any, had heeded hisexhortations to welcome migrants. It was an irony of his 12-year papacy that while he beseeched the world to open its heart, borders tightened.View image in fullscreenCardinals attend the funeral of Pope Francis in St Peter’s Square.Photograph: James Veysey/Rex/ShutterstockFor many in the crowd, the pope’s key legacy was advocacy for the vulnerable and downtrodden. “A good pope. He had a heart,” said Martin Joseph, 33, a pizza chef from India who lives in Italy. Andrej Kalamen, 47, a priest from Slovakia, said the pope abjured dogma. “He was a pastoral priest, he loved people.”Alison Briggs-McMullen, from Northumberland in the UK, had come with her mother to Italy’s capital to celebrate her 27th birthday but felt drawn to the funeral. “It felt right to be here and be part of a momentous occasion. We’re not Catholic but here to pay our respects and soak up the atmosphere.”Tiziana, a 69-year-old Roman, said she was not a believer in God but had faith in humanity and the goodness of Francis. “The god is inside. I’m here to be with the people, and to keep the pope company.”She lauded the funeral planners. “Rome is not always well organised but today we are playing it well.” Others also marvelled at the city’s transformation, almost overnight, into a well-drilled host with thousands of police, giant screens, portable loos and miles of fencing and tape for the funeral procession route.When the funeral ended, even cardinals joined in the applause as the coffin briefly returned to St Peter’s Basilica before crossing the city, a final journey in a popemobile past waving, tearful crowds, and the Colosseum, where early Christians were martyred.Adam Woolstenhulme, a tourist from Idaho in the US, was among those lining the route. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It feels that Rome is the most important city in the world today and that this is the most important street in the entire world.”The sentiment began to dissolve as Trump and other leaders dispersed and headed for the airport, ending the spectacle, or illusion, of global communion.Before and after trips, Francis used to visit the papal basilica ofSanta Maria Maggioreon the Esquiline Hill, and it was here that he asked to be buried. As pallbearers carried the coffin inside, a sign on a building opposite caught the mood: “Grazie Francesco.” The coffin was lowered into a niche – formerly used to store candlestick holders – and the undecorated tomb was inscribed with a single word, the papal name in Latin: Franciscus.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisEuropeCatholicismChristianityReligionThe papacyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s the warmest, funniest telly you’ll watch this yearHannah J DaviesSat 26 Apr 2025 17.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Apr 2025 17.31 EDTShareHelmed by interviewees with autism, other forms of neurodivergence and learning disabilities, The Assembly first aired a year ago as a pilot on BBC One, featuring much of the same cast. According toa recent interviewwith one of its producers in the Radio Times, the broadcaster couldn’t afford to commission a whole series of the show, which was originally a hit in France. Strange, as it doesn’t require big flashy sets, special effects or locations other than one nondescript room in an office building, but hey, maybe there’s more to it than that. In any case, it’s a huge fumble by the BBC: ITV’s series is some of the warmest telly you’ll see this year – even when Danny Dyer starts dropping f-bombs left, right and centre.Last year’s pilot featured Michael Sheen, who gracefully fielded questions on everything from his age-gap relationship to his affinity with Dylan Thomas and his favourite meal (egg and chips, ham optional). This time around the subjects are David Tennant, Little Mix’s Jade Thirlwall, Gary Lineker and – of course – Dyer, who opens the series and gently cranks the hardman act up and down as necessary, instantly putting the group at ease. In turn, they refuse to mince their words; the first question, from a young woman named Chardonnay, concerns Dyer’s finances, and whether he shares a bank account with his wife, Jo, given that she once reportedly kicked him out of their home and siphoned off their joint funds. Dyer turns the air blue in response – thank God for the post-watershed time slot. But he is also honest and humble: he was a “prick” before all that, he says, constantly off his face on drugs, and Jo “controls everything now” when it comes to cash. The next question, from Nicola, is a little lighter, although maybe equally invasive. Just how much did he get paid for presenting the middling Saturday night gameshow The Wall? (Answer: about £100,000).After some more sweary soundbites about David Cameron, we move to the meat of the thing: questions about class, therapy, his lack of male role models growing up (they either left, or died) and how to deal with absent dads. Some of the questions are excellent, and even ones that seem basic on the surface lead to intriguing conversations. What was it like to leave EastEnders, asks Harry. In reply, Dyer talks not only about the life-saving, career-reviving magic of his nine years on Albert Square, but also the ways in which – he says – he was pushed out of the series (“when the producers said you’re gonna be with Janine, I was like, Janine? But she murders people …?!”)Many journalists could learn a thing or two from the group’s interviewing style, which – although casual – gently joins the dots between past and present, leaving space for sprawling anecdotes and touching reflections. Shouldn’t we all be asking more people what their favourite kebab is, really?View image in fullscreenIn the firing line … Danny Dyer in The Assembly.Photograph: ITVTomorrow’s second episode features Tennant (I like to think that Sheen, his friend and co-star in Good Omens and Staged, told him how much fun it was). And while Tennant isn’t quite as unguarded as Dyer – who is? – it’s still a pleasure. He is particularly strong on the “devastating” grief of losing his parents, and his vocal support of trans people, who have become, he says, a “political football” in the UK. There is much joy, too, as he performs Shakespeare, learns how to Vogue like Madonna, and lists all the actors who’ve played the lead in Doctor Who in order, occasionally “forgetting” that that includes him (“the 14th Doctor, who was that again …?”)Both Dyer and Tennant are wiping away the tears by the time we get to the excellent musical performances that close out the programme (covers of Movin’ On Up by Primal Scream and the Proclaimers’ Sunshine on Leith respectively). Only the first two episodes were released to press, but you imagine Lineker and Thirlwall will have similar reactions – not least if the house band ends up performing a Little Mix song. Watching at home, you may well find yourself moved, too. The Assembly is powerful television, a portrait of disabled people that doesn’t go all serious and sombre, or – worse still – coat these adults in cotton wool. And, of course, it gets the Dyer seal of approval, complete with a final few expletives. “You better prepare yourself for a bit of fame you lot,” he says, as he gives everyone around him a hug, “because I think this show’s gonna be fucking massive!”The Assembly aired on ITV1 and is on ITVX nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDanny DyerNeurodiversityreviewsShareReuse this content"

He was raising money for the young people’s charity WellChild, so – with his partner’s help – he climbed into a 10ft (3-metre) purple nurse costume.As the race started, his pace was a little too fast. He said: “If you overtake someone, they’re like: ‘Oh God, I’ve been overtaken by the guy in the massive nurse uniform.’”Towards the end, with all the extra weight, Stoate was running out of puff. Five hours and 47 minutes later he crossed the finish line. “It was a relief to get the thing off,” he said. “I was pretty hot and tired by that stage.”Towering nurses, magic fairies, stocky rhinos, mighty oak trees, colossal chocolate bars, well-known monuments – marathons attract their share of wacky characters each year. But what’s it really like to drag these weird costumes over 26 miles?View image in fullscreenRichard Stoate said running in the nurse costume felt like ‘waddling with a 10ft monkey on your back’.Photograph: Richard Stoate/Guardian CommunityWhether it’s outfits that chafe and scratch, amusing comments from spectators, costumes falling apart mid-race, or the sheer heat and sweat inside heavy foam suits – completing a marathon in a novelty costume brings a somewhat unique running experience. Scores of people got in touch with the Guardian to tell their tales.Rhinoceros costumes from Save the Rhino International have been a feature of theLondonMarathon since 1992. But the temperature inside can be punishing. Former chief executive Cathy Dean last donned the suit in 2022.She said: “The costume develops its own microclimate – it’s incredibly hot and sweaty inside. You need to wear a sweatband around your forehead to stop your eyes from stinging.“And after a while you begin to smell the sweat of all the previous runners that has soaked into the plastazote over the years.” The rhino suits get sprayed after each run with furniture polish, but it doesn’t actually clean them.View image in fullscreenCathy Dean said Save the Rhino International’s rhino costumes had ‘hugely increased our profile’.Photograph: Cathy Dean/Guardian CommunityThen there’s the weight. About 10kg, the rhino suit is attached to a frame worn like a rucksack – with straps at the shoulder and waist – but the head bobs annoyingly. “So you start holding on to the sides to stabilise it,” Dean said, which causes stiff arms “as if you’re holding a tea tray out in front of you”.This year, 14 people will run the London Marathon in Save the Rhino suits. “They’ll be pounding the streets of London, that’s a proper crash of rhinos,” Dean said.Ann Beardsley, 73, and her sister have completed the “Disney Dopey Challenge” more than 10 times. It’s a fancy dress event of four races: a 5k, 10k, half- and full-marathon across four days in Disneyland Florida.The sisters ran as matching pink flamingos one year. But, Beardsley said, the headwear kept blowing away – so she “became a decapitated flamingo”. Another time they were rainbow fairies. The wigs itched, the tutus scratched, the hats kept falling off, but “it was all part of the fun”, she said. The annual races gave the sisters – one living in North Carolina, the other in Oregon – a happy excuse to get together.View image in fullscreenAnn Beardsley, with her sister, said running in costume makes her feel ‘a part of something bigger than me’.Photograph: Ann Beardsley/Guardian CommunityWhen Kellie Clark decided to run the London Marathon as a large Marathon (the old name for Snickers), in an effort to win a Guinness World Record, she deployed cardboard, fabric and her sister’s help to build the outfit. They had to follow guidelines – on the chocolate bar’s length and rigidity – which made it heavy and awkward to run in.“It was a very short stride,” she said. But even so, on her third attempt in 2022, Clark’s Marathon bar won the women’s world record for “fastest marathon dressed as a candy confectionery item”, clocking 4hrs 26mins. The record was stolen the next year by a pack of Haribo.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

George Bingham, a 64-year-old in West Yorkshire, ran the London Marathon raising money for Sue Ryder in 2010 as theAngel of the North, the 20-metre sculpture by Antony Gormley.View image in fullscreenGeorge Bingham (centre) found his Angel of the North costume caught the wind.Photograph: George Bingham/Guardian CommunityHis running outfit, 3.5 metres tall and 4.5 metres wide, was constructed from glass fibre rods, stuck together with marine glue and covered in a rust-coloured skin. It was light, but “the slightest breeze threw you,” he said. “You’ve got to just try scurrying along.”When Bingham was running over Tower Bridge, he said a gust sent him perilously towards the edge. “I had to be rugby-tackled by two stewards to stop me from being blown over,” he said. “They really were life-savers.”But above all, running a race in a novelty outfit can be emotional: people are raising money for charities close to their hearts, and the encouragement from fans can be overwhelming.Robert Duncombe, 57, ran 2022’s London Marathon as a tree, raising money for the Oak Cancer Centre at Royal Marsden hospital, where he is chief pharmacist. He said the 8ft bespoke suit, made by a company that constructs football mascots, was “bouncing up and down on my shoulders”. The foam insulation meant Duncombe was “sweating buckets” – but the “electric” crowd atmosphere powered him through.View image in fullscreenRob Duncombe: ‘It was huge. It barely fit in the back of my car.’Photograph: Chris Salmen/Guardian CommunityHe said: “Coming over Tower Bridge, you take a right, it’s eight or 10 people deep, and that wall of noise hits you – even slightly muffled through the costume – you could hear these chants of: ‘Tree! Tree! Tree!’ It was just so special.”Dean said running in a costume was “like being on a red carpet. The crowds go absolutely bonkers.” After her marathon, she said, the most overworked muscles weren’t her legs. “I remember my cheek muscles aching because I was smiling so much.”Explore more on these topicsLondon MarathonAthleticsLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is, he explains in the programme, where he made his professional stage debut in 1979. The return, from a lifetime of film work (though with a TV role very much still in play with Slow Horses), carries the sense of an older man in conversation with his younger self.Just as in Samuel Beckett’s 1958 one-act play – a monologue which becomes an existential encounter with past selves and the many voices we incorporate within us across a lifetime. So Beckett’s crabby writer ritualistically sits down on his 69th birthday to tape-record all that has come to be over his past year, as he does annually, and then begins listening to the voice of his younger self – or selves – first with haughty judgment of the romantic he once was and then the yearning, regret and desolation slowly creeps in.This is not only a one-man play but something of a one-man project for Oldman, who single-handedly directs, designs the set and performs, as well as co-producing the show. What could have been a disastrous vanity project is a startling piece of theatre, arresting and emotional, up there with the best of the modern day Krapps.He is surrounded by the accumulations of his past – books, files, boxes – which crowd around his desk. He climbs across a triangular heap of bric-a-brac to arrive at the desk and begin eating his bananas. The set design faintly resembles Winnie’s “heap” in Happy Days (written three years later) and conveys the same sense that Krapp is trapped, here in the detritus of his life’s hoardings.View image in fullscreenIn thrall … Oldman in Krapp's Last Tape.Photograph: Gisele SchmidtOldman does not go down the Vaudeville route with the play’s tragicomic elements – such as the banana eating. He is funny but never the clown. The opening silence, punctured with chomping, creaks of the desk in lieu of Krapp’s old joints, and squeals of the word “spool” (is he delighting in the word or fending off the lonely quietness around him?) has the audience leaning into his every sound and movement.Oldman becomes more vulnerable by inches. We listen intently to his character listening to himself. It is remarkable to build such intimacy in a space as big as this auditorium, but the beautiful, focused lighting by Malcolm Rippeth helps, along with crisp sound design by Tom Smith. Poignantly, the production features the same tape recorder used by Michael Gambon and John Hurt in their turns as Krapp. It lights up at the end, as if alive – the only part of Krapp that remains vital as the mortal fades, year by year.There is richness to Oldman’s voice – or voices – as he modulates his tone and delivery in the recordings to sound younger, and there is a hypnotic lyricism to the descriptions of a past lover. You feel Krapp’s alienation from this “other” man whose voice emanates from the tape – vigorous, sensuous, still hopeful; but he is also mesmerised, in thrall to him.“The earth might be uninhabited,” says younger Krapp, poetically, and the older man manifests the sentiment much more starkly, and without the poetry.The play makes for a negative kind of epiphany: Krapp’s intimations of mortality. That it is an encounter with the past for Oldman too gives this exquisite show all the more punch.At York Theatre Royal until 17 MayExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreSamuel BeckettGary OldmanreviewsShareReuse this content"

I’m going to have to just fight alongside my comrades and stick around till I drop dead.Actually, the potatoes are ready to go in the ground now – I am going to do all that this weekend. When you are thinking of Oranges, I’ll just be thinking about potatoes.Peter Carroll: ‘I had a fur phobia for many years – after I performed in Cats’Read moreDo you ever think about that timeeveryone got cross at you because you shot a rabbit in your garden?Yeah! And I’ve shot many since. I’m sure in Australia they’d be thinking, “Why would anybody care if she shot a rabbit?” You can’t live in the country and worry about things like that. When I got it, I skinned it and it was beautiful. It looked like a Vermeer. I put it on a tin plate, and I cooked it with some cider and rosemary. I chopped the skin up and put it outside for the birds, because they love that to line their nests. I gave all the innards to the cat. But this just freaked everybody out! People said, “I’ll never read Winterson’s books again.” I thought, do you only read books by vegans?It’s that kind of social media insanity where things spin out of control completely.Everybody got mad because I set my books on fire as well. But I didn’t like the covers and I was in a really bad mood, and I thought, fuck it. They’re my books. I shouldn’t burn anybody else’s books; that would be wrong, even ones I don’t like. Even Jordan Peterson’s, I wouldn’t burn them. But my own books – why can’t I? They belong to me. So I did and, of course, I put it on Twitter. Then the whole Penguin Random House was reading this while having their Sunday lunch and went into meltdown. You can’t do anything in this life any more. Shoot it. Burn it.Is your housestill haunted by ghosts?Oh yes, but not this house. This is a ghost-free zone. The ghosts are in my house in London. I may be speaking too soon because he may have just gone on vacation, but I think he might have gone. It’s very difficult to know whether an entity has truly vanished – what does a ghost do when they’re not bothering you? But mine has stopped switching the radio on at night and sitting on the bed. I had some friends staying there and he didn’t set the smoke alarms off, which is his favourite – he’s never liked visitors. Somebody said I should do an exorcism but I can’t do that! I’m a Guardian-reading liberal – where is he going to live? It’s really hard to get somewhere to live when you’re alive, how’s he going to cope? And everywhere is all Ikea and carpeted now; this poor, dead dude needs an 18th-century house.View image in fullscreenJeanette Winterson in her haunted 18th-century house.Photograph: Kate Peters/The ObserverYou recently wrote for us about your admiration fora short story written by Open AI’s creative writing model. Do you feel alone in your optimism about AI among authors?Yeah, I do. That was a fabulous piece of writing. AI has always been important to me andI’ve been writing about it for decades. I don’t think the doom and gloom around AI is helping us, because all we’re doing is moving the public conversation towards a dystopia while the tech bros are just going on doing exactly what they want, and the bigger conversation with more people in it isn’t happening.The pet I’ll never forget: Jeanette Winterson on Silver, ‘the brightest cat I have ever had’Read moreOne of the things that even secular people hate is the idea that this is the end, there’s no further to go. It feels ridiculous! We’re made of meat, we’ve got these fabulous minds, and we die – whose stupid idea was that? So I think there’s this sympathy towards the idea of being able to move outside of a bounded condition, which AI will allow in all sorts of ways. And none of the benefits are really being discussed because, as usual, we think they will accrue to the very, very few and could cause enormous misery, just like with the first industrial revolution. It’s like we’ve learned nothing from history and we really, really do need to learn this lesson. So I’m not pessimistic about what we’re doing. I think it’s our best chance of getting ourselves out of many of the messes we’re in. But I am pessimistic about the way the conversation’s going.Who is the most famous person in your phone?Nigella! She’ll be in Australia when I’m there. We often cross over and she always takes me to lunch – somewhere fantastic where I wouldn’t be able to get in under my own steam. We always get wonderful food.What’s the oldest thing you own?My house in Spitalfields. It was built before the French Revolution, in the early 1780s. It was very common around that time to sacrifice cats – they were unfortunately buried alive with little charms around their feet. We were digging down into the foundations so that you could actually stand up in the basement and we found a cat buried there. I said, “When we get to level, let’s put the cat back and put a nice cover over him.” And that’s what I did, in a respectful way. I don’t think taking something like that out of a house is a good idea. That’s my superstitious self.What’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever received?This was said by my dear friend, the crime writer Ruth Rendell, who gave me space to write early in my career, and was very kind to me. When I was about to turn 40, she said: “Jeanette, from now on, you go to the gym three times a week.” And that’s what I’ve done for the last 25 years. I just took her at her word, and I never stopped. It’s been fantastic because it’s kept me healthy and fit. It gives me tonnes of energy. I’m the same weight, I can run 5km without difficulty and I’m strong. So thank you Ruth Rendell, because she could have said some profound shit about spirit and soul. But so what, really?Would you rather die at the bottom of the ocean or out in space?Well, I’m assuming that none of us will die peacefully in our beds. I do doubt it now. But if we have the opportunity to die at an old age, I’d like to go up in space as a very old lady and just be pushed out. That’s how I’d like to die. I’d like to see the Earth from above. I think that will be the most moving, beautiful thing. And then I’d like to go in some sort of chute. Just let me go. I’ll be dead instantly. And then everything will come apart and there’ll be bits of me all over the universe, and I’ll be back as a piece of stardust, the way we all started.What is the weirdest thing you have done for love?This house is like the Taj Mahal, because I’ve always built things on to my property for my serious girlfriends. But then either I’ve left them or they’ve left me! So the kitchen that we’re in now was built for my ex-wife Susie Orbach, because she’s a New York Jew and she loves to cook. When we got together, I ended up building this fucking huge kitchen. And then we got divorced. But it doesn’t matter, because I’ve got this fantastic American fridge with the water in the door. And when I was with the theatre director Deborah Warner, I built a huge studio in the garden so she could rehearse her plays with actors. She left me, but now I’ve got this fantastic studio so that’s good. My present girlfriend is very modest: all she wanted was a hen house, because she likes chickens. I’m probably the most practical person you’ll ever meet – that’s why I show my love in these ways. If I can build something for you, I will.If you could change the size of any animal to keep as a pet, what would it be?Make a cat bigger, like the size of a dog. Wouldn’t that be cool? I don’t want to make a big cat smaller – I want a small cat, big. I’ve also always thought, how wonderful it would be to have a giant bird to ride. How good it would be if we could escape over the trees? I’d like a woodpecker, the ones with the red skirt. That would do it for me.Jeanette Winterson is appearing at Sydney writers’ festival as part of the opening night galaIn This Together(20 May),The Art and Science of AI(21 May) and40 Years of Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit(22 May); then in Melbourne at The Capitol Theatre forForty Years of Storytelling(24 May).Explore more on these topicsBooks10 Chaotic QuestionsJeanette WintersonSydney writers' festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Surrounded by red sandstone tenements in Glasgow’s West End, and roughly the size of a football pitch, this is where we first walked our four-year-old labrador Brèagha (Scots Gaelic for beautiful and she is, uncommonly so, thanks for asking). All I know about the etiquette of dog walking has been gleaned from the humans and animals who have paced its perimeter with us, and these are cardinal rules I have learned …View image in fullscreenIllustration: Becky Barnicoat/The GuardianPick. Up. PoopThe sine qua non of the dog walkers’ code. Nobody wants to discover an abandoned turd, typically on the underside of one’s shoe. Poop leavers give the rest of us dog owners a bad name.I’ve had animated debates with fellow walkers about whether it is ever legitimate to leave a turd. In deep undergrowth on a country walk? Beneath a jaggy bush, when retrieving it will probably require reconstructive surgery? I’m zero tolerance about poop myself, to the extent that I will pick up an unknown dog’s mess if I have a spare poo bag on me.Try to see your dog as others see themView image in fullscreenIllustration: Becky Barnicoat/The GuardianNot everyone will greet your animal with blanket delight.“You do project your love for your dog on to the general public and that is a mistake,” acknowledges Tim, owner of Brèagha’s friend Georgie, a tiny border terrier.To me Brèagha’s frantic bark is a declaration of pure joy, having recently evacuated her bowels and discovered a half-eaten kebab by the bins. To a stranger, however, it could be a threat to rip their face off.A responsible dog owner must become an expert interpreter of body language and a keen risk assessor – I can precisely calculate recall time divided by fabric contact as the dog scampers through a mucky puddle and towards that woman in the pristine camel coat.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Becky Barnicoat/The GuardianAllow a good sniffThere is nothing gladder than two dogs spinning nose to tail in a virtuous circle of bum-sniffing. But among primmer owners, there can be an underlying anxiety that being relaxed about this means you’re up for everyone sniffing everyone’s bottoms, which of course is neither practical nor desirable. Maz, owner of heart-throb labrador Otis, and I agree, we’ve become more laissez-faire as we’ve gained experience – both of our own dogs and how other dogs and humans respond to them.“Of course dogs will snap and snarl,” she says. “It’s how they communicate. The majority of difficulties we’ve encountered have been with owners, not dogs, who usually know how to handle themselves, and will give dogs who are aggressive or unfriendly a wide berth.” Whenever Otis makes an apologetic attempt to hump Brèagha, for example, he gets short shrift.It’s all about the recallPlenty of those I chat to are happy for a dog to be off the lead “so long as they come back when called”. Indeed, my cat-partial friend Lorna expresses her preference for this over acres of extendable lead lurking in the grass. Given Brèagha’sgenetic predisposition to greed, she is usually back at my side like a bullet for a biscuit.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Becky Barnicoat/The GuardianMaz is more militant. She believes some dog owners project their own nerves about control on to their dogs and struggle to keep them on the lead rather than learning how to manage them off.Maz also notes a certain demographic of male who likes to tell a woman how to walk her dog. “There’s an assumption that women don’t know how to control a bigger dog. Men are constantly telling me Otis would be easier to control without his knackers. Which I think says more about them. But one word and he is at my side.”Cry When the Baby Cries by Becky Barnicoat is published by Jonathan Cape at £25. To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Athletes who were cheated out of medals talk about what happened that day – and how the results have slowly unravelledEsther AddleySat 26 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Apr 2025 12.26 EDTShareThe tunnel in which athletes wait before they enter a stadium ahead of a major race is “by no means a friendly place to be”, saysLisa Dobriskey– and as a former Team GB athlete who won Commonwealth gold and world championship silver at 1500m, she has stood in enough of them to know. “Different people handle it differently,” she says. “Some people are really relaxed and friendly; other people just look right through you. It’s scary. I remember my coach saying to me, ‘When you go to the Olympics, you’ll be standing next to the meanest, toughest, hardest people that you’ll ever face.’ Everybody wants to win.”As it turned out, the wait to walk into London’s Olympic stadium for the final of her event in August 2012 was even more stressful than she’d been warned. With British excitement at fever pitch, support and expectation for home athletes had reached near hysteria at times. “It was terrifying,” Dobriskey says of hearing the 80,000-strong crowd in the stadium. “People were yelling, people were screaming, it was overwhelming.”Having come anagonising fourthin Beijing four years earlier, Dobriskey had battled her way into the London final after anightmarish year. In early 2012 she developed a stress fracture of her thigh, delaying her track training for months; then in late May, a niggling problem with her breathing led to her being rushed to hospital with a life-threatening pulmonary embolism. Doctors advised her not to think about running for six months. Instead, less than three months later, here she was in an Olympic final, havingwon her heatand with commentators talking up her chances of a medal.“That weight, that pressure,” she says, “I took it all on personally.”Footage of the race buildupshows the 13 athletes lining up jumpily on the track, with Dobriskey on the far outside lane. Her name is announced first, to a roar from the crowd. She bounces on her toes, then stands nervously, her eyes closed, breathing deeply.View image in fullscreenIn the final lap, Turkish team-mates Asli Cakir Alptekin ​and Gamze Bulut surged ahead to take gold and silver …Photograph: Brian Kersey/UPI/ShutterstockView image in fullscreen… leaving Maryam Yusuf Jamal, seen here in the lead, to finish third. In 2021, that bronze was upgraded to gold.Photograph: Tim Clayton/Corbis/Getty ImagesA little more than four minutes and 10 seconds later, it was all over. Asli Cakir Alptekin, a Turkish athlete who had won the European championships title a month earlier, had again taken gold after leading from the front for the last 300m. Silver was claimed by another Turkish competitor, Gamze Bulut, after a surge to the line as several others faded. Bronze went to Bahrain’s Maryam Yusuf Jamal. Dobriskey, who had been near the rear of the field and unable to fight her way back, crossed the line in 10th place, almost three seconds off the pace.She was bitterly disappointed, even embarrassed, at the result – but also deeply frustrated. A month earlier, after competing ata Diamond League meet in Parisat which a Moroccan athlete, Mariem Alaoui Selsouli, and Çakir Alptekin had raced seemingly effortlessly to a fast time, Dobriskey had privately contacted the world athletics governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF, since renamed World Athletics), to say she believed the athletes were doping. Sure enough, days laterSelsouli had tested positivefor a banned diuretic – whichcan be usedto flush other performance-enhancing substances out of the body – and been barred from competing at London 2012.View image in fullscreenLisa Dobriskey and Laura Weightman of Great Britain after the race.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesSo when, moments after the London final,BBC Five Live’s Sonja McLaughlan askedhow “comfortable” Dobriskey felt that Cakir Alptekin, the new Olympic champion, had previously served a two-year drugs ban, she told the truth. “I’m very uncomfortable with that,” she said. “I’m probably going to get in trouble for saying so, but I don’t believe I’m competing on a level playing field.” The then relatively newathlete biological passport scheme(ABP), designed to detect the use of banned substances by comparing multiple blood results over an extended period, would be a big step forward in the fight against doping, Dobriskey said: “But I think these Games came too soon. People will be caught eventually.”Then she went back to the athletes’ village, packed her bags and headed to her parents’ home in Kent. She had wanted to see her teammate Mo Farah racefor his second goldthe following day, “but I couldn’t go back. I remember my dad saying, ‘Just go and soak it in, go and enjoy it.’ But I didn’t want to be there any more.”Dobriskey didn’t watch a minute more of the Olympics on TV – and she still hasn’t. Now living with her family in Arizona, where she co-owns a pilates studio, she even found last summer’s Olympics in Paris too painful to watch. “I just had to detach myself from the sport,” she says. Watching it now “makes me feel like I didn’t do enough, I wasn’t good enough. Should I have trained harder? Should I have done better?”Dobriskey may have said what plenty of others were thinking, but her remarks brought her a sharp and wounding backlash. Though some fellow athletes andcommentatorsechoed her suspicions (“Hate hate hate drugs cheats#FUCKOFF”tweetedthe British steeplechaser Hatti Archer), from others there was a brutal smackdown. “Don’t think post-race insinuations by athletes who’ve been beaten achieve anything at all,” sniffed the former triple jumper Jonathan Edwards.But she would be vindicated in the end. In May 2013, Cakir Alptekinwas suspendedafter abnormalities were detected in her blood profile datingback to 2010. After a lengthy period during which she was initiallycleared by her own Turkish federation, the athlete wasgiven an eight-year banin 2015 and forfeited all her results from 2010 onwards – including herOlympic gold. (She would receivea life ban in 2017after a third doping offence.)The new champion, Bulut, upgraded from silver, didn’t last long either. The Turkish runner had shaved a near superhuman 17 seconds off her personal best time in the year leading up to London; those who had been sceptical about that achievement were proved right in 2017 when she wasalso bannedfor blood passport abnormalities and had her results annulled back to 2011.In the interim, two further athletes from the 1500m lineup, the BelarusianNatallia Kareivaand Russia’s Yekaterina Kostetskaya, had also been suspended for ABP abnormalities. Their results, in seventh and ninth place respectively, were wiped from the Olympic record.Some of these athletes I had never raced before, because they had been either banned or had just come out of the woodworkYet another athlete, Abeba Aregawi, who came fifth in 2012 racing for Ethiopia before transferring to Sweden, was also provisionallysuspended in January 2016after testing positive for the banned substancemeldonium, a heart medication that can be used by athletes to improve their endurance and recovery. Herban was later lifted, however, as the authorities could not prove she had taken it after the date it became illegal.Then, last September, more than 12 years after the race, there was one final twist. Tatyana Tomashova of Russia, who surged to fourth in 2012 and had since beenbumped upto silver, wasgiven a 10-year banfor using anabolic steroids, detected in retests of stored samples from 2012. Her results, too, were retrospectively wiped.The penalty came as a surprise to some, given the length of time since the London Games, but in other respects, not so much. Tomashova won silver behind Britain’s Kelly Holmes in the 2004 Games in Athens, but she wasabsent at the 2008 Olympicsin Beijing; at the time she was serving a two-year ban, handed down after her urine samples from different tournaments were found to contain more than one person’s DNA.View image in fullscreen‘I had to detach myself from the sport’: Lisa Dobriskey, who went from 10th place to 5th after other athletes’ results were annulled.Photograph: Haley SibleyThe revised results, then, would read as follows: the original bronze medallist, Jamal, was the new Olympic champion. Aregawi, who hadbeen presentedwith a revised bronze medal in Paris last summer, would be upgraded again to silver. That meant American Shannon Rowbury, the sixth athlete to cross the line in 2012, would now be awarded bronze. Dobriskey’s disappointing 10th place finish had, in fact, been a highly creditable fifth.And for the London 2012 1500m women’s final itself, its own ignominious reward: the title,widely attributed, of the dirtiest race in sporting history.Rowbury was on a family holiday in Ecuador when she heard she was an Olympic medallist, after a journalist texted her agent with the news. She handed the phone to her husband, shetold local San Francisco mediasoon afterwards. “He said, ‘Shannie! Oh my God, you’re going to get bronze!’ And I just started sobbing.”London had represented a huge opportunity for the American, who had bounced back from a disappointing Olympics in Beijing to win bronze at the 2009 world championships. “It was like, OK: now London,” she says from her present home in California. “I have one medal, I can do it again. Let’s go after it in London.”Once there and standing on the start line for the final, however, the race had presented a puzzle. As she waited for the gun, Rowbury says, she was acutely conscious of the others lined up beside her who had served doping bans. Her training had taught her to focus on her own race plan, “but it was tough, because some of these athletes I had never even raced before, because they had been either banned or had just come out of the woodwork. It was confusing to try to make a strategy.”She, too, recalls an overwhelming atmosphere in the stadium, “like nothing I’ve ever experienced before or since. Whereas Beijing and Rio were loud, it was sort of monotone, but in London the crowd, their energy, raised to an emotional crescendo as the race was going on. You could tell they were actually watching it, really engaged, and it just built and built. I had this out of body moment of, whoa, this is something special.”Her own strengths favoured a fast race, but it didn’t work out that way. Instead, first Jamal, then Bulut, taking a quick lead, slowed the early stages almost to a jog. The tactic is often favoured by those who know they have a strong sprint finish: slowing to what Rowbury calls “high school pace” forces their competitors either to sit behind at the leader’s favoured speed, or burn up their own energy in a spurt to overtake.View image in fullscreen‘Even after 13 years, justice can be served’: Shannon Rowbury, who originally placed sixth but has since been awarded bronze.Photograph: Winni Wintermeyer/The GuardianSome athletes are naturally fast finishers; others have some help. “When you’re competing against someone who’s cheated, their bodies don’t behave the way a normal, clean body would when everybody else is fading,” Rowbury says. “They seem to have these other gears. They don’t seem to be impacted by lactic acid in the same way as everybody else, because they aren’t like everybody else. They’ve cheated.” It is striking, watching the final metres of the race, that two athletes appear almost to be accelerating in the final metres, like a pair of e-bikes on a hill overtaking flagging pedal cyclists: Bulut and Tomashova.When it was over, Rowbury went straight to her then boyfriend (now husband), the Mexican middle distance runner Pablo Solares, and sobbed bitterly. “The hardest thing wasn’t that I had missed the medal,” she says. “It was more that it felt like the race wasn’t fair, and that no matter what I could have done, I wasn’t on a level playing field. That injustice was hard for me to accept. If it was a matching of equals, I could accept that, well, today wasn’t my day. But it was very hard to accept in a scenario where I suspected people were cheating.”The London Olympics, ironically, were supposed to be the cleanest ever staged. That, at least was the pledge made by Britain’s culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, in the early days of the Games. He was right that London had put in place one of the most rigorous testing regimes of any Olympics. Multiple doping positives aren’t just disastrous for the athletes and nations involved – no host country wants to be associated with them, either. Astate of the art testing lab,the size of seven tennis courts and with a staff of more than 1,000, had been built for the purpose in Harlow, Essex. There, more than 5,000 tests were carried out during the event’s 16 days, more than any previous Games. During that time, just eight samples tested positive.But Hunt’s assertion caused even some of those inside the drug testing establishment to raise an eyebrow. With athletes’ samples kept on ice and available for reanalysis for 10 years as testing technology improved, no one expected the number of athletes caught cheating in London – leaving aside those getting away with it – would remain in single figures. As the same samples have been reanalysed with newer technologies in the years since, more and more doping positives have been found. By 2022, when it concluded its 10-year reanalysis programme, the International Testing Agency hadwithdrawn 31 London medalsfrom athletes from 11 different countries. In one men’s weightlifting event,six of the top seven finishers, including all three medallists, would be disqualified and banned for doping offences. Bronze was eventually awarded to the athlete who hadoriginally come ninth.Anti-doping is all a shot in the dark because athletes are incentivised to do it as quietly and discreetly as possibleWorse was to come. When a Russian discus thrower who had won a silver medal at London 2012, Darya Pishchalnikova, wrote to the World Anti Doping Agency (Wada) later that year, admitting she had taken banned substances and asking it to investigate systemic doping in her country, itdeclined to open an inquiry, instead referring her case back to the corrupt officials on whom she was attempting to blow the whistle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But it was harder to ignore a German documentary the following year featuringastonishing revelationsfrom two Russian whistleblowers, 800m runner Yulia Stepanova and her husband, Vitaly Stepanov, a former official at Russia’s drug testing agency Rusada. Up to 99% of the Russian Olympic team used banned substances,the couple toldbroadcaster MDR, and the country’s supposed anti-doping establishment was in fact mostly concerned with covering it up. “You have to dope, that’s how it works in Russia,” Stepanov said. “Functionaries and coaches tell you very clearly that you can only get so far with your natural skills. In order to get medals, you need help. And that help is doping.”The head of the country’s Wada-accredited national anti-doping laboratory, Grigory Rodchenkov, would later flee to the US to tell his own story to documentary-makerBryan Fogelandthe New York Times. The details he had to add were even more extraordinary, particularly about the Winter Olympics of 2014 in the Russian city of Sochi, when he was the head of the laboratory coordinating all testing. That had allowed him todrill a tiny mouseholebetween the supposedly secure room in which test samples were stored overnight andhis own “shadow” laboratorynext door.At night, a team member would pass cheating Russian athletes’ sample bottles through the mousehole; from there, a member of Russia’s secret service, disguised as a plumber, would take them to its nearby command centre where the lids of supposedly unopenable bottles would be removed. Back in the secret lab, the urine would then be swapped for clean samples from the athletes that had been frozen months earlier, to which Rodchenkov and his colleagues would add distilled water or salt to make them up to the right volume, before passing the resealed bottles back through the hole.The agency charged with catching cheats, in other words, was carrying out the most audacious cheat imaginable – and without the whistleblowers, it is likely that no one would ever have known.The revelations rocked the sporting world, and Russia was banned from theRioand laterTokyoOlympics (the country’s Olympic committee has since been suspended by the IOC due toits actions in Ukraine). But Russia’s doping programme had been in place long before Sochi. In December 2016, Wada published its second major investigation into Russian doping. The country’s Olympic team, Canadian lawyer Prof Richard McLaren concluded, had “corrupted the London Gameson an unprecedented scale, the extent of which will probably never be fully established”.Rodchenkov would call London 2012 the “dirtiest Olympics in history” and, strictly speaking, judging by the number of positive tests recorded, he is right. But athletics has seen successive scandals over decades, making it hard to know how many historical results could be called into question.UnderEast Germany’sstate doping programmein the 1970s and 80s, for instance, at least 10,000 athletes were given performance-enhancing drugs, somewithout their knowledge. By Rodchenkov’s own account, the reason his countrywithdrew from the 1984 Gamesin Los Angeles was not a geopolitical snub in payback for America’s absence from Moscow four years earlier, but because LA port authorities had refused to allow Russia to anchor a ship containing its own doping control lab – designed to make sure Russian athletes’ urine appeared clean – in the city’s docks during the competition. Unable to be sure it could hide the extent of its cheating, he said, thepolitburopulled out altogether.The Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson became perhapsthe most notorious Olympic cheatafter his 100m gold medal in Seoul in 1988 was swiftly annulled after three days when steroids were detected in his urine sample. The Sydney Games in 2000 were dominated by the US track star Marion Jones who won three gold medals and two bronze; she would later bestripped of them all and sentencedto six months in prison after admitting she had lied about using performance-enhancing drugs. Also at those Games, Lance Armstrong, fresh from winning his second Tour de France of an eventual seven,won bronzein the Olympic time trial – all later annulled in one of the biggest doping scandals in sporting history.‘Imagine if a 60-year-old broke Usain Bolt’s record’: the story behind the Enhanced Games, the Olympics where everyone dopesRead moreWada had been established a year earlier, in 1999, to harmonise international anti-doping efforts across hundreds of sporting federations; a succession of further measures have since been introduced to help authorities in the cat-and-mouse game between dopers and testers. The “whereabouts” rule, by which elite athletes are required to provide continual updates on where they are to facilitate surprise testing, was introduced in 2004, followed four years later by the ABP.TheAthletics Integrity Unit, an arms-length body to combat doping and corruption, was founded by the IAAF in 2017. Meanwhile, in response to the Russian revelations, the US government passed the Rodchenkov Anti-doping Act of 2019, allowing US prosecutors to pursue those engaged in international doping conspiracies.How much of a difference have they made? It’s impossible to know for sure, saysApril Henning, an associate professor of international sport management at Edinburgh Heriot-Watt University, who haswritten in detailabout the history of drugs in sport. “The most sophisticated and successful doping programme in the world is the one we don’t know about,” she says. “This is the nature of anti-doping. It’s all a shot in the dark, because athletes are incentivised to do it as quietly and discreetly as possible, telling as few people as they can.” The most sophisticated anti-doping mechanisms won’t stop cheats if the people involved don’t want them to, she points out. “[Russia’s doping scandal] didn’t have anything to do with the sophistication of the testing or the way it was was carried out. This was a concerted effort to undermine the system, and because these people were placed where they were, with a lack of independent oversight, they got away with it.”In 2020, after all, no less a figure than the former president of the IAAF was convicted of corruption by a French court and sentenced to four years in prison. Lamine Diack, a Senegalese businessman, had run the sports body for 16 years until 2015; at the same time, however, he had beenoperating a scheme that he called “full protection” in which doping Russian athletes each paid hundreds of thousands of euros to make their positive drug findings disappear – so they could compete at, among other championships, London 2012.What it means for the modern-day athlete is a non-negotiable daily ritual to comply with the bureacracy of anti-doping. Every evening for 13 years until her retirement in 2023, the British 1500m runner Laura Weightman would set an alarm at 9pm to check in with Wada’s Adams app, which she says every elite athlete has on their phone, to make sure she was where she was meant to be in case a drug tester turned up unannounced. “It’s just part of the job,” she says. “It is something you have to remember every single day, and it can be stressful if you’re travelling or have last-minute plans, but it’s your responsibility to make sure that you support the bigger global picture of clean sport.”Weightman had just turned 21 at the London Games, her first major tournament, and hadn’t been expected to make the 1500m final but, thanks to a blinding personal best in the semis, she had fought her way to a place, lining up beside her British teammate Dobriskey.Weightman, from Alnwick in Northumberland, had been dreaming of competing in London since, as a talented teenage club runner, she had watched the televised announcement of the city’s winning bid – hosted by Steve Cram, who would later be her own coach. “I’ll never, ever forget walking out into the London stadium for my heats,” she says. “In the tunnel about to compete, I felt so overcome with emotion that I was about to achieve that childhood dream. I felt I could cry because that emotion was so overwhelming.”View image in fullscreen‘I was so naive about how many would be cheating’: Laura Weightman, who went from 11th place to sixth.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianWith that excitement, she admits, came an innocence about some of her competitors. “I was so naive about the world of sport that I had only had a handful of experiences of even being tested. I was aware of anti-doping in sport, but I just wasn’t aware of the severity. I wasn’t aware of how many would be cheating.”In the end, exhausted from her semi-final, she crossed the line in 11th place – or sixth, as the records now show. At that stage, she was delighted just to have made the final. “But because of the consequences of that race, you do find it hard to trust,” she says. “You do wonder what’s happening, but you have to remember along the way, you can’t control what anyone else does. It makes you become incredibly proud of what your body can do. And to be one of the fastest in your country, one of the fastest globally on occasions, it makes you really proud to think, well, I did that clean, and I know I can say that, whereas not everyone else can.”The new London 2012 1500m Olympic champion, Maryam Yusuf Jamal, wasfinally awarded the gold medalshe should have won at a ceremony in Bahrain’s capital, Manama, in December 2021. Though it may not have quite had the atmosphere of the London stadium, the presentation by a member of the Gulf state’s royal family represented the culmination of a remarkable journey for the athlete, who had been born Zenebech Tola in the mountainous Ethiopian district of Oromia in 1984.As a child, she would run 8km to school every day; by her teens she was training competitively. But, despite running very fast times, Jamal says she felt she was unfairly shut out of the national squad. “And I wanted to run.”In 2002, while competing at one event in Lausanne, the then 18-year-old decided not to go home and instead applied for political asylum. Switzerland declined, as did the US, France, Germany and Canada, before Bahrain – eager to build athletic success, even if it meant adopting those from other countries – eventually came calling. “And in the end, everything was good,” she says. “Really, Bahrain has helped me a lot.” She couldn’t train there, though – it’s far too hot, she says. Instead Jamal now lives in Germany with her young family.She laughs when asked if she knew, as she lined up for the London final, which of her competitors were likely to be doping. “Of course – every athlete knows,” she says. “You’ll see them once a year, maybe – they turn up and they go fast, even if they only run at the world championships or the Olympics. They don’t want to run the Diamond League races because they’re scared. But if you are strong, for sure, you can beat them – even with doping. I believe that. If you train hard and if you focus, you can beat them – like me.”Like Dobriskey, Rowbury’s career ended in disappointment, after her seventh place finish in Beijing and sixth (she thought) in London was followed by a gutting fourth in Rio in 2016. When it emerged in 2021 that Shelby Houlihan, the athlete who had beaten Rowbury’s American record at 1500m at the 2019 world championships in Doha, hadtested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone, “I just felt, I cannot do this any more,” she says. “I’d been burned so many times, I couldn’t psych myself up for it.”There has been “a lot of pain, a lot of disenchantment and disillusionment” in the years since London, she says, “but I refuse to be sad about good news. And this is good news. Even after 13 years, justice can be served.”She hasn’t yet been told when she can expect to be awarded her bronze medal. “It won’t feel real until I hold it in my hand,” she says. “That medal is a representation of so much more.”Explore more on these topicsDrugs in sportOlympic GamesOlympics 2012: athleticsAthleticsRussia Olympic teamRussia doping scandalOlympic Games 2012featuresShareReuse this content"

It was by far the closest match for England in this tournament, with their other four matches resulting in dominant wins. The lack of competition that the Red Roses face have led some to believe they needed a loss or a close game to learn from in order to know the answers if challenged at the upcoming World Cup.Aldcroft holds nerve but England will need to raise level to go all the way at World Cup | Andy BullRead more“We were sitting in the coaching room and saying: ‘It was ideal for us,’” Mitchell said. “After a really good start we could have put them away, but they got energy through the middle of us and once a French side gets that energy, they eye success. So we always talked about the fact that we probably had to win the game three or four times. I think we had to win it nine times.“I wasn’t happy with the defence. I thought they got through us too easily through the middle. We adjusted that at half-time, but the edge of the defence was not up to standard.”Mitchell, who led the team to a slam last year, spoke about how crucial the match was in terms of the occasion and it bringing experience to players who may not have played at Twickenham previously. He said: “In the coaching meeting this morning, we worked out that after today 95% of the girls that are likely to go to the World Cup have all had experience of playing in the stadium; before this game, that wouldn’t have been the case. That has definitely been a situation that we’ve planned for as well to make sure that the broader group had an experience here and now we’ve got a chance to enjoy ourselves on a break and come back and earn the right to contest here again.”Of the wing Claudia MacDonald, who came off in the second half shortly after receiving treatment, he said: “I don’t think she is too bad. I think it’s bruising. It looked like it could have been a hyper-extension but she seems to be quite comfortable with it. But you never know until she cools down and wakes up tomorrow morning. We’ll see what happens.”View image in fullscreenZoe Aldcroft scores England’s sixth try.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersZoe Aldcroft, the captain and the only Red Roses player to start all five Six Nations matches, said clear messages to her teammates were key when France staged their comeback. “It was about giving energy back into the girls,” she said. “When we were coming in together it was about that one clear point and how we actually action it and it was a big one in defence: getting off of that line and trying to stop them through the middle.”She agreed that the result would help her captaincy. “Yes.

Chris Eubank Jr’sunanimous-decision victoryover Conor Benn gradually developed into a contest so action-packed that it was tempting to completely overlook the tawdry buildup or the fact that it was only their famous surnames that had guaranteed both boxers career-high paydays.During a scrappy start, you could be forgiven for thinking the fight had perhaps peaked two hours and five minutes before the first bell. That was the moment when Chris Eubank Jr arrived at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium with a smirk and – perhaps more notably – his supposedly estranged father by his side in a suitably ostentatious sheepskin jacket, looking like a 1980s football commentator who had won the pools.Suitably measured reactions came from Johnny Nelson, the former world champion and Sky pundit, who said: “Seeing these pictures put a lump in my throat,” then promptly changed his pick from Benn to Eubank Jr based purely on his dad swanning out of a posh car with his son. The Dazn commentator Adam Smith was equally subdued: “He’s here! And the crowd are going wild – father and son reunited, simply the best. And that is the picture of the year so far.”View image in fullscreenNigel Benn (left) with Chris Eubank before their sons’ fight.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersIt was left to Billy Joe Saunders, an old Eubank Jr foe and someone who is rarely accused of being the voice of reason, to inject some common sense. Talking to Nigel Benn in the hour before the fight, he hit the nail squarely on the head: “Everyone is saying: oh look, Eubank Sr is here – you’re not in the ring; neither is he. It’s the sons fighting, not the dads – they did that years ago … It doesn’t matter if he’s got 10 Seniors here with him.”Yet at least both dads being ringside laid bare what the contest was all about: for all the talk of Conor and Chris Jr forging their own legacy, this was built almost entirely on their fathers’ work more than three decades ago. Both accompanied their sons to the ring and even got an introduction from Michael Buffer, which doesn’t tend to happen for ringside parents.Eubank Sr even went to hug and chat to a visibly uninterested Conor, which was unusual – and indeed understandably unwelcome – minutes before the fight began. He got a heartier embrace from Nigel, the two having buried the hatchet long ago.Alongside the famous fathers in the best seats sat Gordon Ramsay, who has spent more time ringside than he has kitchenside over the past 20 years, Idris Elba and a host of Premier League footballers, including Declan Rice and Marcus Rashford. Proof that for all the fact that fight aficionados might roll their eyes at the nepotism that led to this contest, not to mention the two positive drug tests that caused its postponement yet somehow increased its hype, the fight had definitely crossed over into the mainstream.But for all the cynicism, the fight itself turned into a barnburner. It began slowly, Benn all effort and not much finesse, having a particularly strong round three where he wobbled his larger foe. Eubank Jr, the more proven, experienced competitor, took over after that and almost certainly won the next three. Then, after halfway, a combination of Benn’s indefatigable endeavour and Eubank Jr’s exhaustion yet refusal to give ground led to a blistering firefight with both men trading haymakers.If professional boxing is a test of will and skill, there was, perhaps, a so-so supply of the latter but a gigantic supply of the former. As the crowd roared and the smaller Benn winged in an endless supply of blows, his trainer Tony Sims – a voice of wisdom in a maelstrom of madness – gave his charge the right advice of making room for his punches. “He’s leaning all over you, take a step back and let your hands go,” Sims implored. Yet Benn’s lack of in-ring smarts meant he was unwilling or unable to follow such sage instructions.Instead it was Eubank Jr who – yes, akin to his father in his prime – somehow found a second tank of petrol when it appeared the first had run dry. He willed himself through the last two rounds, winning them clearly to seal a decision that was deserved, even if the three 116-112 scorecards did not quite reflect the 28-year-old Benn’s effort.View image in fullscreenConor Benn and his promoter Eddie Hearn face the media after the defeat by Chris Eubank Jr.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersAfterwards, Eddie Hearn, Benn’s promoter and not a man to turn down a hyperbole when he has a shot at it, assessed: “Unbelievable! I couldn’t split them at the end. I thought Conor Benn was winning the fight, I thought he lost the last two rounds … But forget that, just unbelievable respect for both men. I could not be prouder of Conor Benn – for what he’s been though [two positive drug tests, never explained to the public] and the heart he’s shown in the ring tonight.”At least everyone could agree on the latter. Both boxers came to the ring in trunks that were exact replicas of their fathers’ from their first war in 1990. But if both came in cosplaying as their dads, both left having proven their guts and toughness beyond any doubt.Boxingis a curious sport where the best events sometimes fall flat and those mired in controversy sometimes show us something noble. For all that was ugly, worrying and distasteful about why this fight occurred, few could deny the pure courage on show inside the ring.Explore more on these topicsBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

A few minutes earlier, the Aston Villa goalkeeper had been pumping his fists in delight after Jean-Philippe Mateta’s penalty miss appeared to have kept his side in the game.Yet already leading through Eberechi Eze’s stunning goal in the first half, Palace were not to be denied. Ismaïla Sarr thumped the ball past Martínez from distance after another cheap Villa turnover and the Senegal forward was mobbed by his teammates as Oliver Glasner led a group hug with the substitutes on the bench.Eberechi Eze revs up Crystal Palace to ‘go all the way’ after making FA Cup finalRead moreThere was still more than half an hour to play at Wembley but Unai Emery’s side – without the injured Marcus Rashford to call on – already looked well beaten, the rigours of a long campaign having finally caught up with them potentially. Not that Palace will care one bit as they can now look forward to a thirdFA Cupfinal in their history, with Sarr adding his second for good measure in stoppage time to round off a perfect day. Perhaps this time their story will have a happy ending.Villa hadn’t been past the fourth round since being thrashed 4-0 by Arsenal in the final a decade ago and have now lost seven of their last nine visits to Wembley.Emery’s record against Glasner is even worse: four defeats in five meetings during the last 12 months that culminated with this disappointing display on the biggest stage of all. Villa have played at some of Europe’s most imposing arenas already this season during their run to the quarter-finals of the Champions League but were second best throughout and must pick themselves up quickly to stand a chance of returning next season via the Premier League.There was a tangible sense of anticipation before kick-off as both sets of supporters made themselves heard. With Palace contesting their third semi-final in the last nine years, a banner quoting Elvis Presley’s “Can’t Help Falling in Love” was the centrepiece behind Dean Henderson’s goal.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze curls Crystal Palace into a first-half lead at Wembley.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe news that Rashford was missing after picking up what Villa described as “a knock” at least made Emery’s team selection straightforward. Ollie Watkins was back to lead the line as one of three changes from the last-minute defeat against Manchester City in midweek, with Marco Asensio and John McGinn also returning.Palace looked happy to try to hit them on the break, with Boubacar Kamara picking up the game’s first booking for hauling down the marauding Mateta. He soon had Tyrick Mitchell for company when he was cautioned for impeding Asensio.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Palace were incensed when the referee, Anthony Taylor, ruled that Mateta had fouled Ezra Konsa after pinching the ball from the Villa defender and finishing past Martínez. Their anger didn’t last long, however, as Sarr forced Pau Torres into a mistake and the Senegal forward laid the ball on the plate for Eze to apply the brilliant curling finish. He has now scored four times since breaking his duck for England against Latvia in March, having previously managed only three all season.Villa tried to respond but found Palace’s well-organised defence a tough nut to crack, with Konsa denied by the sprawling Henderson after Watkins had won a corner. Palace should have doubled their lead on the stroke of half-time but somehow Mitchell couldn’t make proper contact with his right foot after being picked out by Daniel Muñoz.Emery didn’t look amused as he marched down the tunnel and Villa’s players were sent out early for the second half. They almost found an equaliser within five minutes of the restart but Henderson pushed McGinn’s half-volley wide before producing an even better save to deny Lucas Digne.View image in fullscreenIsmaïla Sarr sealed the win with his second goal of the match.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianPalace’s next chance came from the spot when Kamara brought down Eze inside the area after a clever pass from Adam Wharton and Anthony Taylor had no hesitation in awarding the penalty. Yet Mateta could not make them pay as his effort clipped the outside of the post and went wide, cueing a loud roar of approval from Martínez. His next act, however, was to pick the ball out of his net after another mistake from Villa allowed Wharton to win back possession. Mateta was the provider as Sarr unleashed an unstoppable shot from outside the area before celebrating in front of his adoring fans.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Emery unloaded his bench and Leon Bailey came closest to making it a nervy finish, only for his goalbound effort to deflect off Torres on the ground and over the bar. This was just one of those days for Villa, who could have lost by more had Sarr not fluffed an easy header before finishing off Eddie Nketiah’s pass late on to make it three.

As Inter travel to Barcelona for Wednesday’s semi-final first leg, the mind turns inevitably to their1-0 reverse at the Camp Nou 15 years ago– “the most beautiful defeat of my career” as José Mourinho has described it.Playing with 10 men for a little over an hour,Inter secured a 3-2 aggregate victory. Suddenly it became apparent that it didn’t matter whether you had the ball or not: you could win even with 19% possession. But the outcome was only part of it. The whole tie was played out amid an apocalyptic atmosphere symbolised by the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull, whose eruption made it impossible to fly over western Europe, forcing Barcelona to travel to Milan for the first legby bus.Gary Lineker’s critics have got it wrong. It’s reasonable to talk about more than sport | Max RushdenRead moreFor some it was good against evil; for others an upstart rebel daring to challenge the empire of aesthetic order. It felt fundamental. At the time, Barcelona, with Lionel Messi in his early pomp, seemed invincible.Pep Guardiolahad won the treble in his first season and, more than that, had revolutionised how football was played. The game suddenly became an enormousrondo, supreme technique allying with developments in playing surfaces so first touches could be taken for granted and superiority was achieved by the manipulation of space on the pitch.It was Total Football reimagined for the modern age, and its devotees took its principles with a zeal that at times tipped into sanctimony. For Mourinho, being overlooked for theBarcelonajob confirmed in his mind that in his time as a coach at Barcelona under Bobby Robson and Louis van Gaal he had never truly been accepted.They had called him the Translator, not only because that was what he had initially been, but to highlight that he had never been a player, that he was not of the club, that he was an outsider. He was not, as Guardiola was, one of their own.View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola clashes with Zlatan Ibrahimovic at the Camp Nou. The tension between them had boiled over in the Barcelona dressing room in the league match after the first leg in Milan.Photograph: Manu Fernández/APThere had always been a cynical streak to Mourinho’s football but at Porto and Chelsea his grounding at Barcelona had been apparent. His side had pressed and been capable of dominating games by controlling possession. But at Inter he began the move to becoming the anti-Barcelona: if they want the ball, we will play without it; if they want to press high, we will sit low.There were still moments of counterintuitive attacking, but the shift to the “he who has the ball has fear” phase of his career was under way. Barcelona would end that season in La Liga with 99 points; they lost only four games in all competitions. They seemed almost invincible, dominant and revolutionary, likely to become the first club in theChampions Leagueera to successfully defend the European title.Whatever impact that 14-hour bus journey had on Barça, Inter played brilliantly in the first leg. Pedro put Barça ahead but Wesley Sneijder levelled before half-time. Mourinho told his players that if they kept playing as they had they would win 4-1. He was one off, as Maicon and Diego Milito hit second-half goals. Milito had been just offside and Barça probably should have had a penalty, which allowed them to claim they had been unfortunate, but Inter had won comfortably.That weekend, having been left on the bench for a game at Villarreal, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a big-money signing from Inter the previous summer, raged at Guardiola in the dressing room, kicking over a metal skip that was used to transport kit. Guardiola simply picked it up and walked out. For Ibrahimovic, this was proof of Guardiola’s beta status: he was a “frightened little overthinker” with his team of “obedient little schoolboys”, far removed from the charismatic leadership of Mourinho.View image in fullscreenBarcelona’s Sergio Busquets is fouled by Inter’s Thiago Motta, who was shown the red card after the challenge.Photograph: Víctor R Caivano/APThis was football as soap opera and psychodrama, subplots everywhere. Mourinho named the same starting XI as in the first leg but, shortly before kick-off, it emerged that Goran Pandev had been injured in the warm-up and he was replaced on the left of midfield by the Romanian full-back Cristian Chivu. It was probably happenstance rather than being part of the some great Mourinho plot, but it fitted the narrative of him as some great Machiavellian puppet master.Inter were absorbing the pressure well when, with 28 minutes gone, Thiago Motta was shown a straight red aftera slight flex of the fingersin the face of Sergio Busquets. The Barça man clearly overreacted, at one point peeking between his fingers to see what action the referee was taking. But Motta, who had already been booked, did (lightly) push him in the face; a second yellow would have been entirely reasonable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bojan Krkic then had the ball in the net for what would have been an away-goals winner, but the goal was ruled out for a handball by Yaya Touré, a decision that could have gone either way and was debated just as furiously as the red card.A thrilling, operatic tie had profound consequences. Teams learned to ignore the siren call of Barcelona’s possessionAs Mourinho charged on to the pitch in celebration, Barcelona turned on the sprinklers. That, perhaps, was his greatest triumph: to reduce the club that had spurned him to an act of pettiness. Their halo had slipped and it was he who had dislodged it. Mourinho, having shown he could tame Barça,got the Real Madrid jobas a result, leading to perhaps the most all-consuming drama football has ever known as Guardiola reached his apogee, winning a third straight title and another Champions League,then resigned, exhausted, after Mourinho’s Madrid had claimed the league the following season.Madrid, once a club obsessed byseñorío, doing things the right way, became seduced by the consolations of imagined persecution, a trait they have still not shaken off.That 2010 semi-final was a thrilling, operatic tie that had profound consequences. Teams learned to ignore the siren call of Barcelona’s possession, to stay in shape and play without the ball, asChelsea did in beating themin their 2012 semi-final. And clubs and fans realised that you could choose your own truth, live in your own world of alternative facts.

On the eighth day of theWorld Snooker Championshipat the Crucible, Ronnie O’Sullivan, Mark Williams and John Higgins all rolled back the years.There have been plenty of shocks so far, but the three legends of the game are made of tough stuff. Williams is 50, the other two 49, but the class remains. They have won 14 world titles between them and who would bet against that figure rising to 15 a week on Monday?Higgins had to come back late on Saturday night to finish his gruelling last-16 tie with the improving Xiao Guodong, leading 12-11 when they ran out of time at the end of their morning session. Xiao won the first when they resumed to force a decider, but Higgins held his nerve to win 13-12 and take him into a quarter-final against Williams.The Scot is now the world No 3 after a fine season, which included winning the prestigious Tour Championship two weeks before this event, and said: “The three sessions – I really enjoyed them because it’s an unbelievable venue to play in. You play some good minutes, the pressure is on you and the crowd are all getting involved. You can’t replicate playing here.View image in fullscreenJohn Higgins celebrates after coming through a final-frame decider to beat Xiao Guodong and reach the quarter-finals at the Crucible.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA“Winning some of the big events has given me an inner belief I can get over the line. Even going into that last frame there. Am I a believer again? Yes.”On facing Williams, he said: “It’s incredible [that we are still going], and you throw Ronnie into the mix as well. Three special players, you have got to say that. I don’t care if I’m calling myself that a little bit.”Williams secured his place in the quarter-finals with a 13-10 victory against Hossein Vafaei, winning four out of seven frames having led 9-7 overnight.O’Sullivan soon took control against the Chinese Pang Junxu on Saturday afternoon, finishing the first session of their last-16 match with a 6-2 lead.Mark Allen hits 147 then loses as Barry Hearn warns Crucible ‘not fit for purpose’Read moreThe seven-time winner claimed each of the first four frames, with breaks of 58, 91, 50 and 63, before Pang, the world No 27, got off the mark by registering the contest’s first century break, making a 119. The Rocket swiftly hit back to secure frame six and after Pang took frame seven, O’Sullivan concluded the session by re-establishing a four-frame advantage to take into Sunday’s second session.Williams, three times the champion at the Crucible, advanced to the quarter-finals as he saw off Vafaei 13-10.The Welshman extended his two-frame lead at the start of the session to 11-8, but Vafaei took the next two frames to get within one of level pegging before Williams wrapped things up, finishing with a break of 115.The marathon clash between Higgins and Xiao could not be decided inside three sessions. Facing a race against time to complete the match before the afternoon action commenced, four-time Crucible champion Higgins won two frames in a row after the mid-session interval but was frustrated by Xiao with the winning post in sight, as the world No 14 battled back to make it 12-11 just over four hours after the session began.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With time running out in the session, Higgins took the next frame despite missing a fairly straightforward pink at 65-0 up to open the door for Xiao, who was unable to amass the points he needed to overturn his deficit. Requiring one more frame to win the match at 1.40pm, the 49-year-old appeared on course for victory but let Xiao back in and was punished.On Saturday evening,Luca Brecelevoked memories of hisamazing triumph two years agowhen he produced a display of superb attacking snooker to take a 7-1 lead againstDing Junhui. The Belgian is in danger of losing his top-16 ranking, having performed poorly ever since winning the Crucible crown, but was in irresistible form, leaving Ding helpless.Zhao Xintong, tipped by many to win the world championship, possibly this year, leads his Chinese compatriotLei Peifan10-6 after winning the morning session 5-3. Chris Wakelin, who has already beaten two fancied players in Neil Robertsonand Mark Allen, lies in wait for the winner in the quarter-finals.Si Jiahuitook a 5-3 advantage overBen Woollastonon Saturday evening.

On BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour, the former England forward said: “I’ve worked with Ian a long time and, you know, I think he’s a brilliant broadcaster. But I think he’s aware of just how much he’s doing in the women’s game. I think he should be aware of that.”After receiving backlash and scrutiny for her comments, Aluko issued a social mediaapology to Wright on Friday. She wrote on Instagram: “It was wrong for Ian’s name to be raised in that conversation, and for that I sincerely apologise.

She knows how I’ve helped her, supported her publicly. And I know the previous conversations she’s had with me and my management. So, for me, I’ve seen your apology on social media, but I can’t accept it. But I also want to move on from it.”Wright continued: “But the thing about where the women’s game is, it can’t be about individuals like me. It has to be about the collective. And because of the past, we know that men blocked the women’s game for 50 years. Because of the past the game has serious systemic challenges and it’s going to take everyone to help fix it. So for me, I’m always going to give back to the game that’s given me so much.”The 61-year-old concluded by thanking fans for their support throughout an emotional week.Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballIan WrightFootball politicsSport TVTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

The Met must actFormer UK prime minister makes criminal complaint against Rupert Murdoch’s media empireSat 26 Apr 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Apr 2025 13.09 EDTShareThegroundbreaking apologyto Prince Harry from Rupert Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers (NGN) has not closed an era of investigation and litigation into media corruption. It has opened it up. Far from ending one of the most sordid chapters in British media history, it is raising fundamental, troubling and as yet unresolved questions – and today I am making a criminal complaint to the Met and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) alleging that I am, along with many others, a victim of the obstruction of the course of justice by NGN.This is not an allegation made lightly.It is informedby recentlyavailable evidence, and by thestatements of senior officersinvolved in the original investigations into unlawful newsgathering, who have now stated to me that they were misled.One officer, who gave a statement to the court for Harry’s claim, has told me that they now believe there is “significant evidence” emails were deleted in a bid to pervert the course of justice. They said: “If we had known this in 2011, we would have investigated fully and taken a different course of action including considering arrests.” (NGN strenuously denies any allegations of evidence destruction.)For some time, the public have known that over three decades, and across every continent, NGN, marching under the banner of a “free press”, invaded theprivate lives of thousands of innocent citizens. It now admits“unlawful activities”occurred not only at the defunct News of the World but at its flagship daily, the Sun, carried out by private investigators working for the paper between 1996 and 2011.One private investigator, one of their hired hands, claimed to me in an interview that the use of unlawful methods by private investigators working for the Murdoch empire was endemic in the years before 2011. I do not believe I was wrong to have said in the House of Commons more than a decade ago that we were dealing with acriminal-media nexus.NGN destroyed millions of emails in the face of a criminal investigation, about 9m of which were never recovered. What now appears clear from court documents revealing the background to those deletions is that the Murdoch team did not only assault people’s individual liberties, but designed an elaborate cover-up. The result was that anyone scrutinising its operations would never discover the complete picture. (NGN argues that the deletion of emails had “long been in the planning, for sound commercial, IT and practical reasons”,that it made the Met aware of the deletions and steps it had taken to preserve evidence and that it worked alongside the Met to reconstruct its electronic archives.)What’s more, when this became known, Sir William Lewis (the former group general manager of NGN, and the current publisher of the Washington Post) attempted to incriminate Tom Watson and me, accusing us in statements made to the police in 2011 of theft and bribery. He falsely claimed a conspiracy by the two of us to suborn an unnamed employee who was, supposedly, handing us private documents. This was their pretext for shredding reams of evidence. As one of the investigating officers has said, they “falsely implicated Gordon Brown. If I had known this I would have made arrests for obstruction of justice.” (NGN states that its concerns were genuine at the time.)The investigation into NGN was closed down in 2015 but as this statement by officers conducting the investigation now shows, the investigation into perverting the course of justice was closed on the basis of wrong information.The authoritiesconcluded that “there is no evidence to suggest the email deletion was undertaken in order to pervert the course of justice”. Evidence from the civil case suggests the cover-up did not end with the destruction of what could have been vital evidence, but continued with statements to the police.The civil case, directly resulting in NGN’s belated admission of “incidents ofunlawful activities” carried out by private investigators working for the Sun, exposes not only three decades of lies but also its attempts to vilify some of those who claimed otherwise. In a series ofrevelatory articles, the investigative journalist Nick Davies revealed evidence that suggests NGN was not just using phone hacking and other means for the sensational coverage of private lives, but also spying on politicians whom they sought to influence. (This was denied by NGN.) This, he says, raises serious questions about whether such tactics may have been used during the supposedly secret negotiations that led to the formation of the 2010 coalition government.It is now for the police to request from the courts the statements made by dozens of witnesses, including former employees and ex-police officers, some of whom have now spoken to me. But the most telling condemnation of its tactics comes in statements from the victims of abuse, those maimed in the July 2005 bombings, the couples whose relationships were torn apart for ever by the unfair intrusion into their daily lives, and the families whose privacy was invaded when they were grieving for their murdered children – the Dowlers, the McCanns, the Paynes.Given the claims made in court documents about the deliberate deletion of emails and unlawful activities, the next steps are clear. Alongside the police, the director of public prosecutions, whose office appears to have been systematically misled, must now take up this serious challenge to the rule of law. Parliament, whose committees appear to have been misled, has a duty to reopen its investigations. The attorney general, who has just delivered an important and landmark speech on the importance of upholding the rule of law, has reason to ensure the extent of the lawlessness that has now been exposed is investigated as a criminal offence.This issue is not of mere historical interest. The Murdoch empire has already brought what should be a free media into disrepute. It is all law-upholding publishers that should have the greatest interest in securing justice, and in helping us achieve the further inquiry we seek.All of us benefit from showing that there is a difference between an honest media and one that corrupts the currency.Gordon Brown was UK prime minister 2007 to 2010Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This has become a reality for far too many journalistsMaxine Peake is an actor who appears in the new film Words of WarSat 26 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Apr 2025 10.03 EDTShareWhat drives someone to become a journalist? Agoodjournalist, someone whose keyboard is a tool for exposing injustice, a truth-seeker who would risk life and limb to report their experiences back to the world? I know I couldn’t do it. I’ve interviewed people for a research project and was hopeless. I found myself shying away from asking the really difficult questions. There’s no way I could confront a corrupt official, or race to file a breaking story before a hostile regime tried to silence me, possibly for ever. I like to think of myself as the kind of person who would speak truth to power, but would I really, if my life was in the balance?One of the many privileges of being an actor is that it affords you the opportunity to dip your toes into other worlds and experiences from the safest possible distance. In the upcoming film Words of War, I have the honour of portraying the Russian journalist and human rights activist Anna Politkovskaya – a woman with immense courage and integrity who, despite numerous threats to her life, continued to be a blazing beacon of truth in a time and place where speaking truth was extremely dangerous. The film,which was partly inspiredby Politkovskaya’sobituary in this newspaper, allowed me to delve into her remarkable life and work. The experience gave me a deeper appreciation for the journalists who risk everything to tell the stories that inform and shape our world.View image in fullscreenMaxine Peake as Anna Politkovskaya in Words of War.Photograph: Damir ŠagoljThose who tell these stories face more threats than perhaps ever before. Journalism has become a dangerous profession; according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, more than 1,800 journalists and media workers have been killed while pursuing a story since 1992. Of these, at least 124were killed in 2024 alone, making last year the deadliest in three decades. Nearly 70% of these deaths were at the hands of the Israeli military in Gaza and Lebanon. There was also a sharp 56% increase in the number of press violationsagainst female journalistssince 2023, according to the Coalition for Women in Journalism, including detentions, harassment, physical assault, threats and intimidation. Threats aren’t reserved for war zones or authoritarian regimes. Journalists are also coming under attack in western democracies; on the US campaign trail, Donald Trumpspoke about revoking broadcast licencesand jailing journalists, while rich individuals in Britain havetargeted journalistswith insidious Slapps (strategic lawsuits against public participation).In preparation for my role as Politkovskaya, I immersed myself as much as I could in the lives of the people who report from the frontlines of conflict, corruption and catastrophe, reading about and talking face-to-face with some of these extraordinary women and men. Before leaving to film in Latvia, I had the honour of being invited to a memorial at St Brides Church, on Fleet Street in London, for the murdered American-Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. Abu Akleh was shot on 11 May 2022 while she wascovering raids in Jenin refugee campin the West Bank. She was wearing a helmet and a clearly marked press vest. More than 1,000 days have passed since her death, yet no one has been held accountable.What struck me that day was the outpouring of love and respect from Abu Akleh’s friends and colleagues in the wider journalistic fraternity. Like Politkovskaya, Abu Akleh was someone who dared to expose the truth. Reading about both of these extraordinary women while I prepared for the role, I was struck not only by their courage, but their clarity of purpose. These journalists were not thrill-seekers or fame-chasers. They were driven by something elemental: the absolute belief that telling the truth matters.‘If I die, I want a loud death’: Gaza photojournalist killed by Israeli airstrikeRead moreWe rely on journalists to expose injustice, hold power to account, and to shine light into the world’s darkest corners. Without them, abuse and corruption remain unchecked and unknown. As John Adams, one of America’s founding fathers, put it: “The liberty of the press is essential to the security of the state.” Yet everywhere that journalists are being threatened or silenced, this principle is being eroded. This is not only a problem for journalists, but a threat to all of us, and to our democratic freedoms.That’s why it is so important that we must protect those who do the work of asking hard questions, digging deeper beyond the talking points and propaganda, even when their work is dangerous. I urge everyone to watch Words of War and support press freedom, not just as a political principle, but as a personal responsibility. Defend the truth-tellers. Share their work. Push back against efforts to delegitimise them. The UN’s World Press Freedom Day takes place on 3 May, and anyone can show their support for this principle by donating to organisations such as theNational Press Club Freedom Centreand theCommittee to Protect Journalists. Remember: the next time you see a headline in the news that exposes corruption, injustice or extremism, someone may have risked their life to bring that information to you.Maxine Peake is an actorWords of War will be released on 3 MayDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Gwyneth Paltrow is eating pasta againArwa MahdawiThe actor announced the change on her podcast. Apparently this is international news – and it has a serious sideSat 26 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Apr 2025 09.53 EDTShareLocal woman eats pastaYou’re going to want to sit down for this one, because there’s a lot to digest.Gwyneth Paltrow, who has consciously uncoupled from multiple food groups in the past, is bringing pasta back into her life. And she can have a little bread and cheese, too, as a treat.The actor and entrepreneur broke this news on arecent episodeof her Goop podcast, where she mused about all the fad diets she’s cycled through. “I went into hardcore macrobiotics for a certain time,” she noted. “That was an interesting chapter where I got kind of obsessed with eating very, very healthily.”More recently, Paltrow and her husband, Brad Falchuk, have been on the paleo diet. This is based on the idea that we should all have the same pre-agricultural food habits as our Paleolithic ancestors – a group of people who didn’tlive past the age of 35. While most interpretations of the paleo diet involve cutting out a lot of carbs, the “scientific” underpinning of this diet is bunk. Studies show that early humans had variable diets, influenced by a number of factors, and did, in fact,eat carbohydrates. Indeed, the average caveperson probably ate more carbs than the modern celebrity.Now, however, it seems the Goop founder is a little bored of the paleo diet. “I’m getting back into eating sourdough bread, and some cheese – there, I said it,” she said. “A little pasta after being strict with it for so long.”Why on earth am I writing about this? I’ll tell you why: because this little development in Paltrow’s digestive tract has made international news, getting coverage from the likes of theBBCto the Times of India. A wealthy white woman’s decision to (sparingly) eat spaghetti again seems to be getting more attention than the fact that kids are starving inGazaandSudan.This, by the way, is not the first time that Paltrow breaking bread has been deemed breaking news. In 2021, she revealed on a podcast that things hadgotten so darkin the early days of the pandemic that she had started eating carbs. “I drank alcohol during quarantine,” she said. “I was drinking seven nights a week and making pasta and eating bread. Iwent totally off the rails.” Do you know what Paltrow was binge-drinking while nibbling at sourdough, by the way? Honestly, you can’t make this up:quinoa whiskey.While all this may seem very silly, there is a serious side to Paltrow’s ever-changing palate. The Goop entrepreneur’s wellness ideas are highly influential – even if many of them are scientifically dubious. Over the years, she has arguably helped tonormalizerestrictive eating and glorifyorthorexia, an unhealthy obsession with healthy eating. I’m not trying to diagnose Paltrow with anything, to be clear, but I think it should be fairly obvious that going on a podcast to share that you now eat pasta, like it’s some sort of dirty little secret, is not a particularly normal thing to do. It should certainly be a sign to her followers that Paltrow isn’t someone you should look to for health and wellness advice.Of course, these bread revelations may be a sign of something else – perhaps they are a subtle recession indicator? With Trump’s tariffs poised to make everything more expensive, I cannoli imagine that we’re going to see a lot of people cutting back on meat and eating more pasta.Should sex education teach teenagers about consent?In a country that wasn’t run by anadjudicated sexual predator, this would be a fairly straightforward question. But it has proved quite thethorny issue in Indiana. Language that would have required teaching students about consentwas removedduring a meeting this week aboutSenate Bill 442. After a lot of backlash, the language wasput back in, but it sure says a lot about some Republican lawmakers that they find the concept of consent so controversial.Trump administration weighs $5,000 ‘baby bonus’ to boost birth ratesAccording to the New York Times, other pro-natalism proposals the administration is looking at include bestowing a “National Medal of Motherhood” on mothers with six or more children.Trump pardons politician who used money raised for slain police officers on plastic surgery insteadMichele Fiore, a former Las Vegas city councilwoman (once known as “Lady Trump”), was convicted of takingmoney meant for a memorialfor a fallen police officer and using it to pay for her rent, plastic surgery and her daughter’s wedding.

During his 12 years in St Peter’s chair, Francis railed against Christian complicity with “America first”-type nationalist movements across the west. Here, looming over him on what turned out to be the eve of his death, was the White House embodiment of the insular, bullying politics he spent so much energy fighting against.What now? The pope “from the ends of the earth” will be laid to rest on Saturday in an unadorned tomb in Rome’s Santa Maria Maggiore basilica, after a funeral attended by about 50 heads of state and 130 delegations from around the world. Progressives inside and outside the church will hope that encounter with the US vice-president was not an ominous portent.Theantipathyshown by US Catholic conservatives towards Francis has been virulent, extreme and, at times, close to schismatic. Arch-traditionalists and historicantagonistssuch as Donald Trump’s religious cheerleader, Cardinal Raymond Burke, will see the coming papal conclave as an opportunity to stage a full-blown counter-revolution in the Vatican. How Vance and the Maga movement’s other swaggering Catholic blowhard,Steve Bannon, would love that.After a decade in which secular western politics has drifted steadily to the authoritarian right, could Rome now take the religious version of the same route, rolling back Franciscan reforms such as the introduction of blessings for same-sex couples? The answer is probably not. But it is not by any means certain that Francis’s progressive legacy is entirely safe.In order to promote the outward-facing spirit of his papacy, and reflect his conviction that the global south should carry more weight and influence in 21st-century Catholicism, the first Latin American popeensuredthat the cardinals choosing his successor will be the most diverse group in church history. A prolific record of 108 new appointments included red hats for bishops and archbishops in 25 countries that had never boasted a cardinal before.Many of the relative newbies from Africa and Asia are unknown quantities in Rome, and to each other. Some hail from episcopal sees that are well off the beaten track within their own countries. This influx from what Francis called “the peripheries” will make an always unpredictable voting process still more unreadable. But it also represents a significant recalibration of ecclesiastical power away from the rich west.Such a rebalancing does not necessarily translate to an automatic boost for progressive forces in the conclave. On issues relating to sexuality, “gender ideology”, abortion and the family, many African and Asian prelates have more in common with the “illiberal Christianity” of Viktor Orbán’s Hungary. There may be some interesting coalition-building to come between the churches of the global south, and the conservative Catholic representatives of post-communist central Europe.Anti-Francis theological hardliners could benefit from that. But a more globally representative electorate means that to become “papabile”, a candidate will surely need to share the late pope’s focus on global inequality, the rights of the poorest nations and the climate emergency. A less western conclave should equally guarantee continuing empathy with the fate of millions of migrants on the move, in a world of harder and harsher borders.2:12Catholics across the world from the Vatican to Gaza pay tribute  to Pope Francis – videoIn the medium term, Francis’s empowerment of the laity and the grassroots of the church will also complicate any back-to-the future restoration project. The “synod on synodality” was burdened with a terrible name, and liberal-minded Catholics have been severely disappointed by a lack of progress on issues such as female deacons. But by convening this vast deliberation on the future of the church – in which women voted for the first time alongside clerics on the way forward – Francis cunningly embedded a more open, inclusive culture at the heart of Catholicism. That momentum will be difficult for a new pope to uproot and defy.In truth, though, for all the premature speculation over papal runners and riders, the post-Francis future can only be viewed through a glass darkly. In Robert Harris’s novelConclave, a terrorist attack in Rome sets the stage for a defining choice between a Trumpian cardinal eager to roll back the clock and take on Islam, and a Christlike peace-loving rival from the global south, who will eventually choose the papal name of Innocent. The prospect of a similarly clearcut and satisfying narrative unfolding in May, as an unusually large gathering of 135 cardinal electors contemplate their options, is remote.Against a backdrop already transformed by the impact of the second Trump presidency, the moral stakes for the world’s largest Christian church are intimidatingly high. Francis was afierce criticof the global economic culture that legitimised the restless, amoral profit-seeking of capital, as it sought to undermine every human, environmental and territorial limit to its ambition. His papacy of “the peripheries” was in part dedicated to championing the interests of those forgotten and left behind by such a model.The Guardian view on the coming papal conclave: Catholics at a crossroads | EditorialRead moreBut amid the ethnocentric, nationalist backlash to globalisation, which in parts of the west was often associated with a spurious defence of Christian heritage, he was also called to defend the suddenly endangered postwar architecture of international law and universal human rights. As a new authoritarian era apparently takes shape, in which raw power is allowed to undermine democratic and legal norms, the late pope’s English biographer, Austen Ivereigh, hascompared the challengeshis successor will face to those facing the papacy of Pius XI 100 years ago.Francis’s gut response to the growing crisis was to champion a spirit and ethic of catholicity, in the widest sense of the word. This radically pastoral approach was encapsulated in his repeated insistence that the church he led should be open to “todos, todos, todos”. But that missionary advocacy of inclusivity applied to the secular world as well. In February, it formed the substance of his extraordinary indirect rebuke of Vance, after he had the temerity to cite Catholic doctrine on love as a justification for summary deportations and cuts to US international aid.In his coruscatingletterto US bishops, which would become the last major intervention of his papacy, Francis wrote: “What is built on the basis of force, and not on the truth about the equal dignity of every human being, begins badly and will end badly.” That act of witness should be the starting point of the next pontificate, if the Catholic church is to fulfil its true vocation in the age of Trump.Julian Coman is a Guardian associate editorExplore more on these topicsPope FrancisOpinionThe papacyCatholicismVaticanChristianityReligionEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Now we know we’re not ‘failures’Rhiannon Lucy CosslettA study shows the impact of feeding challenges on maternal mental health. With official help in short supply, it’s time to support each otherSat 26 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Apr 2025 14.06 EDTShareAnyone who has struggled mentally knows it is often only with time and recovery that you can challenge the destructive thought patterns that once plagued you. That said, hindsight can also be a strange thing. While collecting Republic of Parenthood columns for a book, I spent time revisiting my old articles about mystruggles with breastfeeding. I felt vindicated, as some of the things I wrote have since been confirmed.This week, the largest ever qualitative study on how difficulties with breastfeeding affects mothers’ mental health has beenpublished in Scientific Reports. More than 2,000 mothers were surveyed with 65% reporting difficulties with infant latching, “which seemed to impact mental health”.. Feeling like “a bad mum” and “like I had failed my baby” were some of the common reasons given by participants.These feelings are almost identical to thoseI wrote aboutthree years ago. I felt like “a failure” because “desperately wanting to feed your child with your body and not being able to taps into something quite fundamental, really. Something that may have the potential to make you depressed.” Being aware of the culture of guilt around breastfeeding helped, but it didn’t seem to stop these feelings.Which is why I want to say to any woman going through this today that you are not a bad mum and you are not failing your baby if you are struggling to breastfeed. These thoughts are coming from somewhere, but that place is not one of objective reality. I know it feels very powerfully true in this moment – I believe that is down to a combination of cultural conditioning, hormones and sleep deprivation – but they are a lie.Most of the women in this study reported being highly motivated to breastfeed – as I was – and yet they still found it challenging. The lead researcher, Elizabeth Braithwaite, from Manchester Metropolitan University’s Institute for Children’s Futures, told me she wanted to investigate this subject because she noticed how, when she had her own babies, she was one of the few women she encountered who had an easy experience of breastfeeding. This surprised her. After all, isn’t it natural? Isn’t it what we are built to do? Furthermore, there was very little research on how those challenges impacted maternal mental health.Yet women who find it smooth going are portrayed as the default, and before you have a baby there’s a kind of institutional omertà in the health service and among some antenatal course leaders about all the ways in which it can go wrong, from tongue tie and mastitis to prematurity and milk supply. It is highly infantilising, as though even suggesting potential difficulties might put women off. Combi-feeding is barely mentioned, treated not as a method that can empower parents and, as in my case, actually help them breastfeed longer, but as a gateway drug that will spiral into formula addiction (Braithwaite tells me she was disturbed by how many women referred to formula as “poison” in their survey responses).All of this is part of a “baby friendly” rationale that is intended to increase the numbers of women in the UK who exclusively breastfeed up to six months and the length of time they continue to do it to supplement solid food (two years is recommendedby Unicef and the World Health Organization) and sidelines maternal mental health in the process.No one is denying the well established health benefits of breastfeeding for babies, and women who want to do it must receive support to do so. But the way breastfeeding is promoted isn’t working: and the UK has one of the lowest rates in the world, with data from 2010 showing just 23% of womenexclusively breastfeedingat six weeks in England and 1% at six months. Services have been decimated, yet it is mothers, rather than politicians, who arebeing guilt tripped.“Breastfeeding is really intertwined with the idea of being a good mum,” says Braithwaite. “It’s both societal and in the way health professionals can treat you.” I think it is time we decouple breastfeeding and the cult of perfect motherhood, and stop conferring it with so much moral weight (meanwhile, the concept of “being a good dad” and the act of giving the baby a bottle in the night are not intertwined nearly enough).It’s a hangover from the past, visible in so many paintings of lactating Madonnas. And yet we know that long before formula human beings were devising alternative food sources to a mother’s milk. Breastfeeding challenges have always existed. Historically, did women who struggled punish themselves, or do what was needed for everyone’s survival?This moral weight we give “natural” motherhood is damaging. It ischampioned by a toxic political rightthat is heavily invested in wanting women barefoot and pregnant and has no interest in funding services that might support them. From giving birth to diet, any deviation from the “ideal” way of mothering can see you put under a microscope. Claims that a woman can simply manifest a natural birth or that pouches cause speech delay aren’t backed up by scientific evidence, yet that doesn’t seem to stop parents judging each other.Braithwaite understood that just because she found breastfeeding easy didn’t mean she was somehow better than all those mothers who didn’t. There are many improvements that can be made in terms of postpartum care (try funding it, for a start). In the absence of so much state support, though, parents need to care for each other, refuse to participate in this culture of guilt any longer and challenge those who do.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBreastfeedingRepublic of ParenthoodParents and parentingWomenMental healthcommentShareReuse this content"

However, the capital’s 33 local authorities have spent less than £40m between them. Somehave saidthey do not have the resources, expertise or time to decide how to spend it.The money gathered from this fund must be spent on carbon reduction measures in local areas. These include energy efficiency improvements to council housing and other buildings that would lower energy bills for tenants, as well as renewable energy projects and district heating schemes. The cash can also be given out as community grants, and some councils have used it to fund education projects, tree planting and community food-growing schemes.The data, obtained through freedom of information requests, shows a wide variation in spending by councils up to the end of last year. Some authorities have spent all of the funding they have collected from developers while others have spent none. The vast majority have spent less than 20% of the cash.The Guardian was told by a number of councils that some of their unspent cash – about £15m in total – had been allocated for projects but not yet spent. Meanwhile, Greater London Authority figuresshowcouncils have at least another £150m on the way from developers.Amount collected by councils through London’s carbon offset funding since 2Zack Polanski, the deputy leader of the Green party and chair of the London assembly’s environment committee, said progress had been “unacceptably slow and inconsistent”.“Thousands of Londoners are stuck in cold, damp and mouldy homes while their bills keep climbing,” he said. “It’s unbelievable that despite having the funds available to fix this, councils are sitting on the money year after year, leaving the most vulnerable to suffer.”Polanski said the situation “reeks of complacency” and he blamed the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, for a failure to deliver a clear net zero plan.Tower Hamlets (£20m), Islington (£18.5m) and Westminster (£16.1m) councils have received the most offsetting cash from developers. Tower Hamlets has spent just over a quarter at £5.3m and Westminster has spent £2.4m – about 15%. Both say they have significantly more cash allocated for projects. Islington has spent £12.1m, the most of any London borough by some distance and about 65% of its pot.Isaac Beevor, a partnerships director at Climate Emergency UK, which monitors the climate action of councils across the country, said Khan needed to “get a grip” on his policy to achieve his target of a net zero London by 2030.Tower Hamlets has spent just over a quarter of the £20m it has received in carbon offset funds since 2016“This money could have been spent on retrofitting council homes, planting trees and greening our boroughs, or supporting community energy,” he said. “Some councils have utilised the fund, so there is no valid excuse for those who have spent the last decade refusing to spend a huge pile of cash destined for climate action. We would expect all London boroughs to be ramping up their climate action by spending this money.”He added: “This situation highlights flaws in these schemes: if funds aren’t spent, emissions from new developments have not been offset.”A City Hall spokesperson told the Guardian “urgent talks” were taking place with councils about speeding up the delivery of projects. They said the amount of money collected and spent by councils had been increasing year on year, but added: “A key challenge is the pipeline of deliverable projects available for funding.”London Councils, an umbrella group representing the capital’s boroughs, said there were “undoubtedly challenges to overcome” and pointed out that Khan’s recommended price of £95 for each tonne of carbon dioxide emitted had been devalued sinceit was set in 2021.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Councilstold the Greater London Authoritylast year that as well as lacking the required funding, they did not have the time, expertise or resources needed to get projects off the ground.London Councils has now launched a series of workshops to advise boroughs on how to spend the money.The majority of London councils charge developers the recommended £95/tonne CO2, but this is only a guide. As of last year, three Labour-run councils have started charging developers more – not with the aim of raising more cash, but to discourage offsetting, which the Climate Change Committee says “should not be relied on” to decarbonise buildings.Another 15 councilsare said to be looking into raising offsetting costs. Beevor has urged all councils to do this, saying it will encourage developers to hit net zero emissions on-site and remove the need for mitigation projects altogether.Merton council, which in 2003 introduced the pioneering“Merton rule”requiring new developments to generate 10% of their energy from renewables, now charges developers £300 per tonne of CO2. Lewisham has set a new price of £104, while Westminster now charges £330 for electric-based schemes and £880 for gas-based schemes.Haringey council in Februaryallocated all of its outstanding carbon offset fundingto projects including the Haringey Community Carbon Fund, which awards grants to community-led decarbonisation projects such as solar panel schemes, upcycling wood workshops, school uniform swaps and football boot recycling.Of London’s 33 local authorities, 28 declared a climate emergency in 2019 or 2020, announcing bold net zero targets and sweeping commitments to cut private vehicle use, divest pension funds from fossil fuel companies and improve energy efficiency of council housing.Last year, the Local Government Association found two-thirds of councils were not confident of hitting the net zero targets, saying climate action was being “strangled” by a complex web of hard-to-reach Whitehall funding pots.Explore more on these topicsCarbon offsettingGreenhouse gas emissionsLocal governmentLondon politicsLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

But some councils say the amount of funding they receive is often not enough to cover the cost of these kinds of projects.However, others have found solutions to this by combining their offset cash with other sources of funding to pay for major projects. Perhaps the most innovative example of this is Islington council’s award-winning Bunhill heat and power network in north London, which has received more than £5m in offset funding.It is said to be the first scheme in the world to harness warm air from underground train networks and use it to provide lower cost, greener energy.It first launched in 2012, providing cheaper and greener energy to 800 homes on estates near Old Street. The Bunhill 2 extension, which opened in 2020, is housed in a disused London Underground station between Angel and Old Street. It takes warm air from Northern line tube tunnels and uses it to heat water, which is then pumped into 1,350 homes, a school and two leisure centres, lowering energy bills and providing low-carbon heating. It also generates greener electricity, which is fed back into the underground network and a nearby tower block, powering its communal lighting and lifts.Rowena Champion, Islington council’s environment lead, said it was a “great example of smart, green thinking”. “We’re taking heat that would’ve gone to waste and using it to warm people’s homes,” she said. “It means lower energy bills for residents and less pollution, which is really important right now with the cost of living continuing to increase.Ealing council is also using its offset fund to decarbonise its leisure centres. An £800,000 grant has helped it replace traditional gas boilers with air-source and water-source heat pumps at three leisure centres in the borough.Other councils are using their carbon offset cash to fund retrofitting projects across council housing, sheltered housing and community buildings. Many others are giving a proportion of it away. Guidance states that such projects, which have “less tangible carbon savings”, can be funded but should not receive most of the funding pot.Since launching in 2022, Hackney’s community energy fund has received just over £1m in carbon offset funding. This cash has helped schools, faith organisations and charities install solar panels and deliver education programmes.View image in fullscreenHackney council’s microgrid supplies tenants with discounted energy.Photograph: chashat/Stockimo/AlamyIt has also helped support initiatives such as the east London council’smicrogrid development, a UK-first project that allows council housing tenants to buy discounted energy supplied directly by solar panels on their buildings thanks to an innovative localised electricity grid. Historically, solar panels on blocks of flats could only be used to supply electricity to the grid or to power communal areas. About 4,000 solar panels are being installed at 28 blocks across three estates in the borough. About 800 households will have the chance to sign up for the scheme, which will generate about 1MW of electricity, or a fifth of the blocks’ energy needs.Caroline Woodley, the mayor of Hackney, said: “The carbon offset fund has played a crucial role in empowering our communities to take meaningful climate action. It has allowed us to help schools teach children about energy and the environment, support faith groups to make their buildings warmer and more efficient, and give charities the tools to cut costs and carbon at the same time.”Kensington and Chelsea council is using all of its carbon offset funding – including that which has not yet been spent – to fund major retrofit projects at local schools and social housing estates.A spokesperson said some of the borough’s schools were built more than 140 years ago and have poor energy efficiency. As such, they make up nearly 10% of the council’s greenhouse gas emissions, and the council plans to retrofit all of them.The project will decarbonise heat systems by replacing gas boilers with heat pumps, installing new pipes to replace failed heating distribution systems and installing new windows and radiators.Explore more on these topicsCarbon offsettingLondonClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsLondon politicsEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, the failure to provide adequate funding to regulate something as basic as landfill sites that could be leaching highly hazardous waste is all the more shocking.“If our regulators can’t sort out how to protect us from pollutants that in theory have already been ‘safely’ disposed of, then we have little hope of ever seeing a holistic approach to combating the wider sources of water pollution.”Until 2017, councils could apply for contaminated land capital grants, which were administered by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, to remediate contaminated land. Since then, there has been an “erosion of funding”, said Dr Grant Richardson, an environmental consultant and expert on landfill and contaminated land.“If there’s no obvious risk of harm or pollution emanating from these sites, nothing will be done to investigate or remediate them unless sites come to be developed. That means there are likely hundreds or potentially thousands of sites that have not been properly investigated that could be leaching contaminants at harmful levels into the environment,” he said.Public affairs firms in Europe enable pollution by lobbying for big oil, says analysisRead moreThe lack of funding in areas such as this could have “devastating consequences”, the Local Government Association warned, pointing to a wider funding gap for councils of up to £8bn by 2028-29. A spokesperson said local authorities “desperately need a significant and sustained increase” in budgets to keep up with demands placed on them.The Green peerNatalie Bennett, whose party supports a law requiring better records of sites so they are not a public danger, said: “The lack of adequate regulations on contaminated land poses a threat to human life and welfare, especially given climate breakdown, rising sea levels, increased rainfall and flooding.“Greens urge Labour to add this law to the statute books and provide the necessary funds for local authorities to meet the requirements of such a new law.”The Environment Agency said it would “continue to support” local authorities with their responsibility for dealing with former landfills. “In circumstances where the Environment Agency leads on remediation, we work tirelessly with partners to reduce unacceptable risks to human health and the environment,” it added.Explore more on these topicsPollutionEnvironment AgencyRiversLandfillWasteNatalie BennettManchester Metropolitan UniversitynewsShareReuse this content"

Trump said his order “establishes the US as a global leader in seabed mineral exploration and development both within and beyond national jurisdiction.”‘Playing gods with the cradle of life’: French Polynesia’s president issues warning over deep-sea miningRead moreThe order also comes after the Canada-based Metals Company said it would request approval through a US subsidiary for mining in international waters.The company issued a statement on its website on Friday saying it planned to apply for permits this year to mine nodules that contain valuable minerals “to strengthen US critical mineral supply chains”.“As always, we remain committed to acting in the best interests of our sponsoring states, partners, investors, and the planet,” said Gerard Barron, the company’s chairman and chief executive.But environmentalists worry it could harm fisheries and even affect oceans’ ability to absorb and store carbon dioxide, the main driver of global warming caused by the burning of coal, gas and other fossil fuels.More than 30 countries, as well as fisheries trade groups, environmentalists and some auto and tech companies, have called for a moratorium on seabed mining.“Scientists agree that deep-sea mining is a deeply dangerous endeavor for our ocean and all of us who depend on it,” said Jeff Watters, vice-president for external affairs at the Ocean Conservancy. “The harm caused by deep-sea mining isn’t restricted to the ocean floor: it will impact the entire water column, top to bottom, and everyone and everything relying on it.’Such concerns prompted most countries in the 1990s to join a United Nations-affiliated International Seabed Authority to govern seabed mining in international waters. But the US never signed on to the effort, and has not yet adopted rules.Watters warned that ignoring those efforts “is opening a door for other countries to do the same” before safeguards are adopted. The ramifications could resonate beyond deep-sea mining, affecting agreements on fishing, shipping, navigation and marine research, warned Duncan Currie, legal adviser for the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition.The world also must ask if it can afford to not mine deep-sea minerals that could help develop low-carbon technologies to fight climate change and whether the impacts can be managed, said Assheton Stewart Carter, chief executive of the global consulting firm TDi Sustainability.“We face tough choices and the prospect of uncomfortable trade-offs if we are to face and find solutions to serious climate change problems,” he said.But Katie Matthews, chief scientist at the advocacy group Oceana, said Trump’s order to expedite the process now “is a clear case of putting mining companies’ greed over common sense … Any attempt to accelerate deep-sea mining without proper safeguards will only speed up the destruction of our oceans.”Explore more on these topicsDeep-sea miningDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Or, more specifically, the World Marmalade Awards.With a flock of spray-painted orange sheep, a giant red squirrel and Paddington wandering among the marmalade aficionados (many of whom are also dressed in orange), and a choir of schoolchildren performing a specially commissioned marmalade song, the event held at Dalemain Mansion near Penrith is something of a showcase of English eccentricity.The event’s founder, Jane Hasell-McCosh, set up the awards in 2005, “mainly because we’d had foot and mouth and the whole county had really suffered from it”, she said, and also because “I love marmalade and I was trying to think of a way of getting people to come to Cumbria”.View image in fullscreenJane Hasell-McCosh, the founder of the awards, was trying to think of a way to get people to come to Cumbria.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianIt began as a local competition, with Hasell-McCosh, who lives in Dalemain, convincing people to hand over jars of their marmalade. The next year, she says, “we thought, well, maybe we should try a festival. Somebody who was involved in tourism said: ‘Well, that’s a very silly idea, it will never work.’”Hasell-McCosh said she originally “gave it five years”, but two decades on, the awards have drawn in more than 3,200 entries from as far afield as Portugal, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and South Korea. Among the entrants were a Taiwanese Orphanage, the British embassy in Jordan and the director of a London Museum.This year’s preserves were flavoured with everything from Scotland’s famous Irn-Bru, to Belgian blue beer, to Taiwanese orchids, but the overall victor was Hitomi Wakamura from Tokyo, with her yuzu and pear marmalade.View image in fullscreenHitomi Wakamura with her yuzu and pear marmalade.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianIt is the first time in the competition’s 20-year history that an overseas winner has been crowned the overall champion.Wakamura flew 14 hours to London, then took a three-hour train to Penrith to collect her winner’s cup from Chris Bishop, past master of the Worshipful Company of Fruiterers, in the presence of Masaki Ikegami, the deputy chief of mission for the Japanese embassy.View image in fullscreenMasaki Ikegami, the deputy chief of mission for the Japanese embassy, and Elisabeth Bowes, Australian deputy high commissioner, at the awards.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianThe Australian deputy high commissioner to the UK, Elisabeth Bowes, had also travelled to Cumbria for the event, with José Robles, the Spanish minister-counsellor for cultural and scientific affairs, due to make an appearance later.Wakamura’s marmalade, which won in the “any citrus excluding Seville” category, will be stocked in the London department store Fortnum & Mason, raising money for the charity Hospice at Home.View image in fullscreenMarmalades in the ‘any citrus excluding Seville’ category.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The Guardian“I’m extremely happy to be here,” Wakamura said. “I’m so honoured to be able to receive this.” Tomorrow, she said, she will go to see her marmalade for sale in Fortnum & Mason, but, she added, “this is the main event”.Other categories include “savoury marmalade”, “interesting additions”, and “prison marmalade” – this year won by prisoners from HMP Styal in Cheshire, with a Seville and black treacle marmalade.Entrants to the competition are overwhelmingly female, but in the “man made” category, the winner was 72-year-old baker Simon Bowden, who shipped his entry of Amalfi lemon and Seville orange marmalade from New York, where he lives.View image in fullscreenVisitors sample the marmalades.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The Guardian“I’m absolutely astonished, actually, but thrilled at the same time,” he said. “I flew just last night to come here.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.

Hours earlier London ambulance paramedics had dismissed his friends’ concerns about his behaviour. And a crisis call handler from East London NHS trust also failed to properly assess his risk or arrange an urgent mental health assessment within the recommended time.Both the London ambulance service and the trust have now reached an undisclosed settlement with Graham’s former partner Francesca Macri.Graham’s friends first raised the alarm at about 4.20pm on 17 April when they called 999, worried by his erratic behaviour.Macri claimed that when paramedics arrived at his Clapton flat, they were “dismissive and flippant” and ignored what his friends were saying about his condition.The paramedics judged that Graham had capacity over his care. A serious incident report by the London ambulance service admitted that they failed to follow appropriate protocols by not contacting the mental health team for advice.At 6.30pm Graham’s flatmate, a GP, called the mental health crisis team warning there were still serious concerns about Graham’s state of mind.Instead of organising an urgent same-day assessment within a recommended four-hour window, the crisis team nurse only offered an appointment the following morning.In despair, Graham’s friends took him to a local hospital, but after waiting to be seen they took him home because he was agitated and restless. Once home they made two further emergency calls warning they were gravely concerned about his condition.At 12.25am on 18 April they made a third call to say he had fallen out of a window. Graham, who performed under the name Metropolis, suffered injuries and a cardiac arrest on the way to hospital. He died shortly after arriving at hospital.East London NHS foundation trust admitted shortcomings in how the call to its crisis team was handled.The London ambulance service’s investigation concluded there were “several missed opportunities” to get “expert help” to Graham.Macri said: “Since Ebow’s death we’ve had a number of concerns about the treatment he received, or rather didn’t receive, on that day.”She is particularly critical of the ambulance team. Macri said: “The paramedics that attended on that day were dismissive and flippant and ignored what Ebow’s friends were telling them.“They asked whether Ebow had smoked cannabis and this concerns me – were they asking this because Ebow was a black man with dreadlocks? Why did it even matter what had caused Ebow’s psychosis and shouldn’t the focus have been on helping him? I cannot help but wonder whether racial profiling played any part in the way Ebow was treated.”Macri added: “Our only hope now is that the heartbreak we’ve suffered highlights the dangers of drugs but also the need for those with mental health issues to receive the most appropriate and swift treatment. If Ebow had received the correct care on that fateful day he may still be here with us today.”Macri’s lawyer, Leena Savjani, from the medical negligence team at Irwin Mitchell, said: “It’s now vital that lessons are learned from the issues that have been identified to help improve patient safety in relation to mental health.“We’d always urge health professionals to listen carefully to loved ones when a person is in distress as it can help ensure that urgent assessments are carried out and appropriate help can be provided to those who need it.”Daniel Elkeles, the chief executive of the London ambulance service, said: “We would like to offer our sincere condolences to Mr Graham’s loved ones and we are sorry for the shortcomings in the care we provided to him in the hours before his death.“The inquest found we should have sought mental health specialist advice on whether Mr Graham had capacity to decline treatment. However there was no finding of racial profiling and these are claims we strongly refute.“We carried out an investigation into the care of Mr Graham and there has been much learning and action for the trust in the five years since he died.”East London NHS trust has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsLondonEnglandNHSMental healthnewsShareReuse this content"

His church, St Margaret’s Parish, welcomed a staggering 5,000 people across 20 masses in Holy Week.Church attendance across all Christian denominations has been in decline across England and Wales, with the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics describing both as “minority Christian countries”. But that national reality has been inverted in Canning Town, east London, where St Margaret’s first opened its doors in 1866.The church hosts mass in English, Romanian and Latin, averaging more than 800 worshippers a week. The chapel upstairs, originally built to handle overflow, regularly livestreams services to those who cannot find a seat. “The narrative has always been that nobody goes to church,” Armitage says. “It’s a narrative that needs to be adjusted, if not changed.”Recent polling by the Bible Society and YouGov points to a quiet resurgence in church attendance across the UK, particularly among young people in Roman Catholic communities. The figures go against the long-held assumption that secularity is on the rise, especially among the young.“Since Sunday, I’ve had three people phone up to say they want to be Catholics. Completely out of the blue,” Armitage says, adding that the pattern is not unique to their church. Others have continued pouring into the church following the news of Pope Francis’s death.View image in fullscreenFather John Armitage at St Margaret & All Saints Church, Canning Town, east London.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianGeorgia Clarke, the director of youth ministry at St Elizabeth of Portugal RC Church in Richmond, said her parish had four adult converts this Easter alone: two former Protestants, one former Muslim, and one with no religious background. “All under 35,” she says. Her youth ministry began in 2020 with six teenagers. Now more than 100 young people attend regularly.Clarke suggests this is down to the fact her parish was inspired by Pope Francis to move away from a traditional, classroom-style model towards a more relational approach to teaching the faith. She says people often jokingly describe confirmation as the “exit sacrament”, where those young people are not seen until they get married. Now, about 80–90% of teens stay connected to the church after confirmation through weekly meet-ups, mentoring and retreats, where discussions range from climate anxiety to getting into university.She adds that it is not just young people – overall mass attendance at Easter jumped from 560 in 2023 to 760 this year. “We had people pouring out of the church in every single side chapel you can imagine. The chairs were being run up and down the stairs to seat more people. People were looking in from the street. It was incredible. I’ve honestly never seen anything like it.”Teresa Carvalho, the Evangelisation coordinator for the Diocese of Westminster, says her parish in Forest Gate had 1,000 people from Saturday night to Sunday night. “People are giving church a try, or something has drawn them back again,” she says. “People are coming with whatever their question is … What will take it over the line for many people is how God breaks into their life.”Many cautioned that this increase is likely to be small, and concentrated in England’s urban centres, where waves of immigration from Catholic-majority countries such as the Philippines, Nigeria, Poland and many countries in Latin America have had a noticeable effect on parish congregations. But they were keen to point out that it is not just demographic changes. Several church members also spoke of a notable number of Britons, both white, and second- or third-generation ethnic minorities, who are converting to the faith.Elena Attfield, 29, converted in her early 20s after growing up in a Protestant household. Her husband and many of her friends are also young adult converts. When she first attended young Catholic gatherings in 2017, the majority of attendees were “cradle Catholics”, who are those born into the faith. “Now if I go to a young adult gathering it seems as if most of the people there are converts so I do believe there is some kind of revival happening.”View image in fullscreenGabriel Diai says Father John talks about ‘self-forgiveness and how a lot of people struggle with that’.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianGabriel Diai, 33, is a leading member of St Margaret’s youth group, which has experienced notable growth among 25- to 35-year-olds. “The package once was you find a job, get married and you’re going to be happy, but that’s not the system any more,” he says.About 30-35 people meet once every fortnight, Diai explains, many of whom are drawn to Armitage’s sermons. On a rainy Wednesday morning, just under 40 people attended morning mass at 9.30am, where Armitage preached that transformation begins not with belief, but with acts of love, particularly towards the stranger in need. This message resonates deeply with east London, which has long been one of the country’s main points of arrival.Diai added: “One of the key things Father John talks about is self-forgiveness and how a lot of people struggle with that. Whether they made a mistake … you’re still someone that’s loved.”Theresa Alessandro, who is based in Leicester and hosts a podcast about ordinary Catholics and their faith journeys, said many of her guests spoke about “finding truth in the church” and wondered if it is a reaction to “a kind of post-truth world where it’s hard to know what to hang on to”.She has also observed that younger guests are often surprisingly well-read, exploring Catholic writers and scripture in depth before choosing to commit. “They’ve really looked into it and felt confident that they found something here.”Diai agreed. “A lot of friends of mine have Bible studies in people’s houses. So that’s ammunition and curiosity to take things further.”What draws them in? Diai didn’t hesitate before answering. “There’s nothing new. We’re all experiencing life, but we’ve got the anecdotes and stories of people who’ve lived in worse situations than the present.“It’s your faith and your relationship with God that’s ultimately going to drive your motivation, your hope, your resilience.”Explore more on these topicsReligionChristianityCatholicismMassPope FrancisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two over Muslim-majorityKashmir, which is divided between them but claimed fully by both.India’s military said Pakistani soldiers opened fire from “multiple posts” along the heavily militarised ceasefire line, and Indian forces “responded appropriately” to what it called “unprovoked” firing. No casualties were reported. Pakistan did not immediately comment.The clashes followed the attack last Tuesday, whengunmen opened fire in a meadow near Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. The attackers reportedly asked the victims, all male, whether they were Hindu or Muslim and shot the Hindus. Violence had been steadily abating in Kashmir, and the attack struck a heavy blow to the region’s recovering tourism industry.An obscure group calling itself the Kashmir Resistance claimed responsibility. India links the group to the outlawed Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, but Pakistan denies involvement.In an apparent attempt to ease tensions, Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, offered to cooperate with a “neutral investigation”. The Indian prime minister,Narendra Modi, has vowed to “track and punish every terrorist and their backers” and pursue the killers “to the ends of the earth”.“Pakistan is open to participating in any neutral, transparent and credible investigation,” Sharif said, while warning Pakistan’s forces stood ready to repel “any misadventure” by India.The domestic pressures shaping India’s response to Kashmir attacksRead moreIn tit-for-tat moves, India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, a critical water-sharing pact, expelled Pakistani diplomats and cancelled Pakistani visas. Islamabad retaliated by expelling Indian diplomats, cancelling Indians’ visas and closing its airspace. It also suspended the 1972 Shimla accord, a key framework for dialogue.India’s resources minister, C R Patil, said the country would move to ensure “not a single drop” of river water flowed into Pakistan after the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty. Pakistan has warned any attempt to block water would be an “act of war”, with the Pakistan People’s party chief, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, declaring: “Either our water will flow through it, or their blood.”Experts say disrupting the flow would require big investment and years of work. “India lacks the hydro infrastructure needed to actually impede the flow of water to Pakistan in the short term,” Brahma Chellaney, an analyst, said. “So the action is largely symbolic.”Explore more on these topicsKashmirIndiaPakistanSouth and central AsiaNarendra ModinewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a major step by the ageing leader to designate a successor.The appointment of Hussein al-Sheikh as vice-president of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) does not guarantee he will be the next Palestinian president. But it makes him the frontrunner among longtime politicians in the dominant Fatah party who hope to succeed the 89-year-old Abbas.The move is unlikely to boost the image among many Palestinians of Fatah as a closed and corrupt movement out of touch with the general public.Abbas hopes to play a major role in postwar Gaza. He has been under pressure from western and Arab allies to rehabilitate the Palestinian Authority, which has limited autonomy in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He has announced a series of reforms in recent months, and last week his Fatah movement approved the new position of PLO vice-president.The PLO is the internationally recognised representative of the Palestinian people and oversees the western-backed Palestinian Authority. Abbas has led both entities for two decades.Despair in Gaza as Israeli aid blockade creates crisis ‘unmatched in severity’Read moreUnder last week’s decision, the new vice-president, coming from the PLO’s 16-member executive committee, would succeed Abbas in a caretaker capacity if the president dies or becomes incapacitated.That would make him the frontrunner to replace Abbas on a permanent basis, though it is not a guarantee. The PLO’s executive committee would need to approve that appointment, and the body is filled with veteran politicians who see themselves as worthy contenders.The Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, would have a separate caretaker leader, Rawhi Fattouh, the speaker of the Palestinians’ non-functioning parliament. But within 90 days, it would have to hold elections. If that is not possible, the new PLO president would probably take over the position.Al-Sheikh, 64, is a veteran politician who has held a series of top positions over decades, most recently as the secretary general of the PLO’s executive committee for the past three years. He spent 11 years in Israeli prisons in his youth and is a veteran of the Palestinian security forces – experiences that could give him credibility with Palestinian security figures and the broader public.Now he finds himself in a strong position to shore up his power.He is Abbas’s closest aide and, most critically, maintains good working relations with Israel and the Palestinians’ Arab allies, including wealthy Gulf countries. As Abbas’s point man with Israel, al-Sheikh is responsible for arranging coveted travel permits for Palestinians, including VIP leaders, giving him an important lever of power over his rivals.However, polls show al-Sheikh, like most of Fatah’s leadership, to be deeply unpopular with the general public. This week’s decision behind closed doors by the PLO’s ageing leadership is likely to reinforce its image as being stodgy and out of touch.The most popular Palestinian, Marwan Barghouti, is serving multiple life sentences in an Israeli prison, and Israel has ruled out releasing him as part of any swap for Israeli hostages held in Gaza by theHamasmilitant group.As Israel’s war with Hamas drags on, with talk by the US president, Donald Trump, and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, of uprooting Palestinians in Gaza to relocate them elsewhere, al-Sheikh will be under mounting pressure to unite the Palestinian leadership.The PLO is a rival to Hamas, which won the last national elections in 2006 and is not in the PLO. Hamas seized control of Gaza from Abbas’s forces in 2007, and reconciliation attempts have repeatedly failed.In a 2022 interview with the Associated Press, al-Sheikh defended his unpopular coordination with Israel, saying there was no choice under the difficult circumstances of the occupation.“I am not a representative for Israel in thePalestinian territories,” he said at the time. “We undertake the coordination because this is the prelude to a political solution for ending the occupation.”Explore more on these topicsMahmoud AbbasPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaHamasIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Will it assimilate Americans into the upper crust – or is it more about branding?Arielle DombSat 26 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTShareThis fall, the British boarding school Harrow will open its first offshoot in the US: a lush 170-acre waterfront campus in Long Island. For $75,000 a year, parents can wave away their children to the prestigiously named school, renowned for its centuries-old traditions (such as calling teachers “beaks” and bad behaviour “skew”). Classes will take place in the Bourne mansion, the opulent former home of a wealthy American businessman, around which modern facilities will be built.A shiny teaser video paints an idyllic picture of an anglophile life at HarrowNew York. “The school is like an oasis,” says Nick Page, former deputy head of Harrow UK, as drone footage pans out over pristine lawns and lakes, where ducklings and deer roam wild. “Yet so close to this huge metropolis of New York.” (The new school is almost equidistant from New York City and the Hamptons, so parents who have a seaside pied-à-terre can whisk away their darlings for the holidays.) In the video, students stroll about the verdant campus wearing Harrow’s trademark straw hats, and are seen painting, playing soccer, wearing VR goggles, reading poetry by Lord Byron and books about Winston Churchill.Boarding schools have a long history in the US, but top schools such as the New Hampshire-based Phillips Exeter Academy (where Mark Zuckerberg went) and Phillips Academy in Massachusetts (attended by George W Bush) have no mandatory uniform and emphasise sports like lacrosse and hockey.Americans have long romanticised the British boarding school, from Hogwarts to Goodbye, Mr Chips (the novella and subsequent film about a British boarding school teacher, which was initially serialised in the Atlantic). It’s not just the schools: castles, honorifics, lavish parties, a sense of history and the royal family have long made the British aristocracy attractive to American elites. Young Americans are evenadopting British accentsand using an increasing amount ofBritish English vocabulary.But while parents might be hoping that British educational traditions will rub off on their progeny, the school will in fact be owned, managed and operated by a company called Amity Education Group, which also runs a Harrow school in Bengaluru, India, but is a distinct entity from the UK school. It has led some to wonder whether the school’s international expansion is no more than a “rent-a-name” strategy, selling wealthy parents the British boarding school fantasy with little connection to the original institution. But will Americans buy it?To many Brits, boarding schools are emblematic of good old British elitism. That’s in part because of how expensive they are. It costs £61,584 a year to send your child to board at the original Harrow school (the annual undergraduate tuition fee for a university in England and Wales is £9,535, for comparison). A school like Harrow is seen by some as a way to find an elusive seat at the top table of society: out of the UK’s 58 prime ministers, 20 were educated at Eton College (which some Harrovians begrudgingly refer to as “that other place”) and 13 went to Harrow or Westminster.The Guardian spoke with a number of former Harrow students who said Americans would find some traditions such as students having to touch the brim of their hats when a beak (teacher) walks by a little strange. One former student, now 28 and living in New York, said that the launch of the school during Trump’s presidency was particularly well-timed, given “how revisionist the US is currently”. He said that there was a culture at Harrow that valorized the British empire and “the good old days”, which would fit in perfectly with the Trumpian vision of “when America was great”. (The former student didn’t want to give his name in case people at his job in the arts found out he went to boarding school.)View image in fullscreenThe former LaSalle Military Academy, in Oakdale, is in the process of being transformed into Harrow New York. Examples of the uniforms were on display during an open house for prospective students and parents on 25 February 2025.Photograph: Newsday LLC/Newsday/Getty ImagesHarrow was founded in 1572, when a landowner and farmer opened the school, providing free education for 30 “poor boys” from the Harrow parish. Soon, however, the school expanded to accept “foreigners” (boys who lived outside Harrow), which led to its boarding model. In 1998, the school launched its first international campus in Bangkok; “an appropriate location”, according to the school’s website, due to “the strong links between Harrow School in London and Thailand’s royal family” (23 princes of the royal household were apparently educated at Harrow in the UK). But beyond a fond transnational affiliation, there may have been financial incentives for opening a Harrow school in Asia.“Parents are attached to the perceived track record and trust of branded schools,” Selina Boyd, the international editor of the Good Schools Guide, told the wealth management and luxury magazineSpear’s. “Branded schools can almost short-cut the process when they’re setting up – it might take an unbranded school years to develop their name and demonstrate their credibility.”Harrow New York will add to the school’s growing portfolio of campuses across the globe, with 12 Harrow-branded schools in 11 locations across Asia and two newly announced schools in the United Arab Emirates opening next year. Yet what may not be initially clear to prospective Harrow parents is that the schools outside the UK are owned by three separate companies.According to Harrow InternationalSchoolsLimited (HISL), “the educational, administrative, financial and other operational responsibilities of all Harrow-branded schools rest solely with their owners and operators.” However, HISL emphasised: “All Harrow-branded schools are required under their sub-licences to reflect Harrow School’s educational purpose, practice, strategy and philosophy.”It said HISL “oversees this requirement” by “regularly” sending “teams of experienced educationalists” to the international schools “to evaluate and report on their performance”, and that members of HISL’s oversight teams sit on the governing bodies of all Harrow-branded schools.The Guardian spoke with two teachers at Harrow schools in Asia (who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of losing their jobs). They shared worries that the schools were more concerned with profits than the highest educational standards. (AISL, which runs a number of Harrow schools in Asia, said that it took measures to ensure compliance with the Harrow standards.)A representative for HISL told the Guardian that it “strongly refute[s]” the allegation that school is employing a “rent-a-name” strategy.However, areportfrom the thinktank Private Education Policy Forum (PEPF) cited “emerging evidence” that the relationships between British schools and their satellite campuses were “limited in nature”, with some overseas staff characterizing it as “exchanging a ‘brand’ license for a royalty payment”.For now, HISL looks forward to the opening of the Long Island school – which a representative told the Guardian would be “a sprawling, serene and secure” campus with “state-of-the-art facilities” and “exceptional athletic amenities”. Only time will tell whether British boarding school culture can be transplanted to the US, or whether anglophile Americans will be left pining after the carbon copy of British elitism they had in mind.Explore more on these topicsPrivate schoolsNew YorkSchoolsClass issuesUS educationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And given much of the visibility about detentions and deportations of travelers came from mid-March onwards, that figure is due to decline even further, which would be devastating to the tourism industry and beyond.Canadians, unhappy with Trump’s repeated threats to colonise Canada as a “51st state”, have been at the forefront of the decline. Canada’s major airlines have been forced to reduce flights to US destinations including Las Vegas, New York and Los Angeles, asbookings so far in 2025 have plunged, while car visitsdeclined by 32%in March.This was supposed to be a bumper year for US tourism. After a steep drop-off for the industry during the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of international visitors was expected to finally return to pre-2020 levels. Not any more.Adam Sacks, president ofTourism Economics, a tourism research group, said that before Trump’s inauguration his group had predicted a 9% increase in international travel to the US in 2025. They are now expecting a 12% drop in international travel.“You’re looking at substantial losses this year, about a $10bn loss this year in international travel spending relative to last year,” Sacks said.“It comes down to the basic principle that we’ve seen over decades, which is that travelers can go wherever they want, whenever they want. So antipathy towards a destination will have noticeable effects. It’s highly elastic to those sorts of external factors, and then you add to that the high-profile detainments which got a lot of press, particularly in Europe.”People in Spain and Germany appear to have been particularly deterred, with 25% and 28% fewer visitors, Travel and Tour Worldreported. The UK, Germany and other European countries haveupdated their travel guidelinesfor people planning to travel to the US, potentially dampening more travel, and it is already being felt in some of the country’s most popular destinations.Ticket sales for the Statue of Liberty have dropped by 6% so far in April,the New York Postreported, while hotel bookings for New York City hotels later this year are down 20% on last year. In Los Angeles, where the tourism and hospitality industry employs more than 500,000 people, people are equally concerned.“The way we are perceived globally is we are blowing up not just our economy but everyone else’s economy,” Jackie Filla, president of the Hotel Association of Los Angeles, toldthe LA Times.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asked if people were “scared” to come to the US, the president said: “No. We treat our tourists great. We’re the tourism capital of the world. There’s nobody – no place like this.”It’s not just hotels and tour guides that will be affected. Money spent by international visitors filters through a number of different industries: from entertainment to retail, transportation to restaurants. And the decline may not be just restricted to foreign visitors.Meanwhile the number of people making domestic trips is also expected to decline, Sacks said, as Trump’s trade war threatens to increase prices and cut people’s disposable income.A surveyby MMGY, a travel marketing company, 80% of Americans said their travel behavior will change as a result of the ailing economy.In a sort of grim consolation for those who decry the US’s political divides, Democratic and Republican states are expected to be hit equally hard.“It’ll affect blue states and red states alike. Florida is highly exposed to the Canadian and European markets. Texas is highly exposed to both European and Latin American markets. And California and New York are highly exposed to international travel,” Sacks said.“So there’s nowhere to hide.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsTrump administrationTrump tariffsUS politicsEconomicsTariffsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Politicians said they were working to strip citizenship from dual nationals who had been convicted of some crimes.It was a hint of a broader conversation taking place in capitals around the world. As far-right and nationalist partiessteadily gainpolitical ground, analysts say that citizenship is increasingly being linked to crime, giving rise to a shift that risks creating two classes of citizens and marginalising specific communities.The roots of these changes can be traced back partly to the early 2000s when the UK government – led at the time by Tony Blair – begancasting citizenshipas a privilege rather than a right, said Christian Joppke, a sociology professor at the University of Bern.The UK government posited citizenship as something to be “earned”, making it harder to obtain and easier to lose. “This idea of earned citizenship is that if you do wrong, you should also be able to lose it,” said Joppke. Recent proposals put forward in countries such as Sweden, Finland andGermanyseemingly take this one step further, he added. “The new proposals now suggest that if you do any kind of serious crime, that should also allow for the possibility to withdraw citizenship – that is quite new.”Days after Swedenannounced plansto eventually change the constitution so that people convicted of crimes like espionage or treason could be stripped of their Swedish passports, a handful of politicians in Icelandbegan callingfor similar changes for those convicted of serious crimes. Months earlier, the Dutch government saidit wasexploring the possibility of revoking citizenshipfor serious crimes that have “an antisemitic aspect”.The concept also made a cameo in Germany’s February election after Friedrich Merz – whose centre-right CDU/CSU bloc emerged victorious in the ballot –told the newspaper Weltit should be possible to revoke German citizenship in the case of dual nationals who commit criminal offences.The proposal was swiftly criticised, with one political commentator pointing out that it would result in some being “Germans on probation” for their entire lives. “They can never truly be German. One mistake, one crime – and their Germanness is gone,” the journalist and political commentator Gilda Sahebi wrote on social media. “It doesn’t matter if they were born here or if their family has lived in Germany for generations.”Merz’s idea, she added, had laid bare the normalisation of “racist discrimination” in that, “in other words,” he was calling for remigration – the conceptlong-peddledby far-right, anti-immigrant parties and which, in Germany, calls for the mass deportation of migrants, including those with German citizenship.For Joppke, it was little coincidence that citizenship was being reframed just as the far-right was tightening its grip on power across the continent. Instead, he described it as one of the few options for politicians on the right of the spectrum. “What can states promise? The golden age of democracy once promised two cars per family, a house, a stable job. Now all this is gone,” he said.Instead governments had homed in on the most basic type of security: physical security. “This is the toolbox which is intimately connected to the agenda of the radical right,” he said. “And mainstream parties are just very anxious not to be outvoted by them.”For years, governments acrossEuropehave sought to strip citizenship from those convicted of terrorism, offering a window on to how the expanded link between nationality and crime could play out.Because international law limits governments from rendering people stateless, the proposals linking citizenship to terrorism have been largely applied to dual nationals, said Tanya Mehra, a senior research fellow at the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism at The Hague. “But then the question is, aren’t you making a distinction on the basis of whether someone has one or two nationalities, and thus creating different classes of citizens?”The law leaves dual nationals vulnerable to being punished twice for the same crime, if they serve prison time and then also face having their citizenship revoked, she said. “It’s great media optics to say that you’re taking a strong stance against crime by depriving them of their nationality,” said Mehra. “But you have to really look more carefully at whether or not you’re violating their human rights.”Her research had delved into cases of people’s citizenship being revoked over terrorism convictions, finding a small number who were then left stranded in the country that had stripped them of citizenship after the country of their other nationality refused to take them in. “That means they basically become illegal,” she said, losing their right to stay and work in the country.The situation pushes them underground, making it easier for terrorist or criminal groups to potentially exploit them but also harder for officials to track them. “They disappear into the illegality,” she said. “You’re creating a situation that is counterproductive.”In Denmark, where, after years of revoking citizenship for terrorism, treason and threats to the state, thelaw was expandedin 2021 to include gang-related crime, it was difficult to say whether the changes had pushed down crime levels, said Somdeep Sen, an associate professor at Denmark’s Roskilde University.“There isn’t much out there in terms of qualitative or quantitative data that shows that individuals – otherwise keen to commit crime – have somehow been deterred by these changes,” he said.But what was clear was that the policy had provided “legal framing” for the longstanding, xenophobic public discourse that had falsely sought to link immigration to crime. “The issue with these changes is that it perpetuates the problematic perception that ancestry and ethnicity play a role in determining criminality,” he said.What emerged was an overly simplistic view of crime, one that overlooks the myriad ofresearchthat hasfoundnosignificant linkbetween immigration levels and crime rates across Europe.Years afterDenmarkhad been among the first to tie citizenship to serious crimes, the impact had been sharply felt by many, said Sen.“Already, the years of anti-immigration discourse has heightened this feeling of unwanted-ness in Denmark,” he added. “And such laws remind many of how tenuous their inclusion in Danish society is and how easily these ties to Denmark can be severed.”Explore more on these topicsEuropeSwedenDenmarkGermanyTony BlairFriedrich MerzThe far rightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photos byJulia KochetovaSat 26 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Apr 2025 04.20 EDTShareAbout 1am on Friday, Yuliia Verbytska woke to the sound of an air raid siren. She grabbed her teenage children – Dmitry, 17, and Olexiy, 12 – and sat in the corridor, checking her phone. In the sky above came an ominous whine. Minutes later, a Russian drone crashed into the disused soap factory down the road in Polyova Street. There was an enormous explosion.“We don’t have a shelter in our building, so we hide behind two concrete walls. All the neighbours sit together. You wonder if this is your last moment,” she said. Friday’s raid followed a massive attack on Thursday on Verbytska’s home, Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, and on the capital, Kyiv, where 12 people were killed. “I haven’t slept for two days,” she said wearily.Exhausted residents sweeping up glass and fixing broken panels pointed out that the latest attack camehours after a post from Donald Trump on social media. It said: “Vladimir, STOP.”Russia’s president, it seemed, had decided to ignore Trump’s rare rebuke. Despite peace negotiations and an appeal byUkraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyyfor a month-long ceasefire, the Russians were bombing as usual.View image in fullscreenYuliia Verbytska at the Heart of Kharkiv, which was damaged during the night in a Russian hit in Slobidsky district of the city.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianOne of the damaged buildings belongs to a charity,Heart of Kharkiv, where Verbytska works as a volunteer. Bits of concrete fell amid clothes and donated shoes. Children’s drawings were blown from a noticeboard. The charity’s wheelchairs and pushchairs survived unscathed. “I don’t believe in promises or words. Not from Trump or anybody else. I don’t really have much faith in anything any more,” Verbytska said gloomily.By late morning, emergency service workers were still extinguishing small blazes in the now-ruined factory. Built in 1918, it once made soap for the Soviet Union. It went bankrupt last year. The Kremlin’s drones narrowly missed an old acacia tree by its entrance gate. They flattened a brick administration building. Firefighters doused charred beams and splashed among puddles and piles of twisted metal.“They are fascists. Inhuman people. Barbarians. Cruel,” the complex’s security guard, Anton, said, when asked what he thought about Russians. “They want to destroy Ukraine and Ukrainians. That’s their plan.” He was sceptical that the peace process – Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff held talks on Friday with Putin in Moscow – would lead to a settlement that might end the fighting.View image in fullscreenA visitor to the Heart of Kharkiv collects a wheelchair.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianThe security guard said Zelenskyy would be unwise to accept the US’s latestleaked proposal. It envisages handing Crimea and four other Ukrainian regions to Russia. Ukraine gets back a sliver of territory in the Kharkiv region. “Today it’s fiveoblasts. Tomorrow, the Russians will demand another five. Zelenskyy should not sign,” he said. He dismissed Trump as a “Russian agent recruited long ago”, and said: “I’m disappointed that the Americans elected him.”‘Vladimir, stop!’ Trump in rare rebuke to Putin as Kyiv attack toll rises to 12Read moreRussia says its devastating attacks are against Ukrainian military objects. Its latest murderous barrage followsa double strike this month on the north-eastern city of Sumy, in which 35 people were killed. Most were travelling on a bus when an Iskander missile exploded next to them. Overwhelmingly, the victims of Russia’s air raids are civilians. They include two children killed on Thursday and dug from the rubble of their Kyiv apartment block.Liudmyla Hanzii, a pensioner, was at her home in Kharkiv’s Slobidsky district when the soap factory was hit. Her son, Andriy, showed off the bed where she had been sleeping. It was decorated with icons and a black-and-white photograph of Liudmyla as a young woman. “Mum heard a bang. All the glass came flying in. A teenage boy living next door dragged her out,” he said, adding she was being treated in hospital for minor injuries.View image in fullscreenAnton, a security guard at the soap factory, takes a Ukrainian flag to a safer location.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianAccording to Anatoliy Yaskovets, the deputy head of Kharkiv fire station No 6, Russia has stepped up its air attacks. The frequency increased in January, he said, when Trump came back as US president. Apart from a brief pause last weekend, when Putin announced an Easter ceasefire, bombing was continuous. “It’s terror against the civilian population. There’s no time to react. It takes 50 seconds for a missile fired from Belgorod in Russia to arrive,” he said.Zelenskyy says Ukraine cannot accept US recognition of Crimea as RussianRead moreThe Russians had recently changed tactics, he added. They now send a swarm of drones, one after another, at the same target. Three of his colleagues were killed last year when they went to the scene of a drone strike. Twenty minutes later, a second drone incinerated their vehicle. Moscow was using drones to drop CS gas and delayed-action grenades, which detonate up to an hour after impact. They go off if touched, he explained.Asked if he thought the war might end soon, Yaskovets answered: “Probably not.” He continued: “People are tired. There are air raid sirens all the time. It’s a psychological burden. Russia has been destroying our power stations and industrial infrastructure. The aim is to make people unhappy so they turn on Ukraine’s government.” His mobile phone rang with a popular song, Moscow Burns. “It’s my mother. She worries about me,” he said.View image in fullscreenFirefighters working on the aftermath of the drone hit on the soap factory.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianIn February 2022, Russian armoured columns tried to seize Kharkiv. There was fierce fighting. Ukrainian units pushed the enemy back to the city’s edge. For the next six months, Kharkiv was repeatedly shelled. That autumn, a Ukrainian counteroffensive liberated most of the surrounding province. In recent months, though, the Russians have been advancing again,reoccupying the border town of Vovchansklast year, andswallowing villages.How far could they go? Yaskovets said it was clear the Russians would try again to encircle and occupy Kharkiv. “Putin doesn’t intend to stop. He wants to take the south of Ukraine and go as far as the Dnipro River. He doesn’t have a big enough army to do that,” he suggested. In the meantime, there would be more drone attacks, and more casualties. “We’ve had four years of full-scale war. Somehow, people have got used to it,” he noted.A group of soldiers from the Kraken regiment – breaking off for coffee at a Kharkiv petrol station – said Putin’s behaviour this week was not surprising. “By bombing us, he shows his true nature,” one of them, Saifula, said. He added: “My feeling is that Trump is not really a president at all. He’s a parody or a clone of a president. The whole world is laughing at him. Our only option now is to have a strong army and to carrying on fighting.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiaUS foreign policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

By contrast, the base and sets on planet 6767 were huge, and lacking the claustrophobia that could have made this even more terrifying.As the Doctor,Ncuti Gatwahad a lot less room for his usual charm and flair when thrust instantly into a space military situation. Being told it was not appropriate for him to call an officer “babes” was one of the few moments of humour afforded him.View image in fullscreenCaoilfhionn Dunne and Christopher Chung are in charge of a mission on planet 6767 that is not going to end well.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/James PardonSlow Horses star Christopher Chung as Cassio Palin-Paleen was the latest in a long line of enjoyably dislikable second-in-commands. He took an instant distaste to his commander listening to this mysterious time-travelling stranger when the option of just shooting at something was on the table.Caoilfhionn Dunne was superb as that commander, Shaya Costallion. Given her early line about hope being irrelevant, it was a cruel twist that her final noble self-sacrifice was, ultimately, irrelevant. The bleak vignette after the Tardis departed suggested that It Has No Name will no doubt wreak havoc on the crew we did see escape.The episode, though, belonged to Rose Ayling-Ellis’ performance as Aliss. When the Doctor said both the survivor and the killer could be behind the door, it was true in more ways than one. She showed the vulnerability of having been abandoned in those traumatic circumstances, but also managed to convey a quiet malevolence, as her character began to think she might just get home alive without revealing that she already knew that something reallywasbehind her. And that it killed.View image in fullscreenThe episode belonged to her … Rose Ayling-Ellis as Aliss.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/James PardonSum it up in one sentence?What ifDoctor Whodid Midnight again, but couldn’t make it quite as tense?Life aboard the TardisAs Belinda, Varada Sethu’s nursing profession has stuck with her. This is the second time in three weeks she has ended up having to try to find her way around alien physiology and a medikit from another world.It was another adventure in which Gatwa and Sethu were barely ever out of earshot of each other. This may be contributing to the feeling that the chemistry and friendship between them has developed in front of us, rather than last year when we were just expected to take it on trust that Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson) and the Doctor had grown close off-screen.View image in fullscreenBethany Antonia, Varada Sethu and another alien medikit for Belinda to get to grips with.Photograph: James Pardon/BBC Studios/Bad WolfFear factorThe episode did build suspense well, and by Doctor Who standards the scenes of the dead mining colonists were gruesome. There will also surely be fewer more effective jump scares this season than when Belinda first glimpsed the Midnight creature.The sequence where several troopers met their violent end, mostly through confusion placing them at the fatal angle, was panic-inducing. As a drawback, the mechanics of the wall of mercury causing a reflection and allowing Aliss to escape the clutches of the creature weren’t terribly well explained.Mysteries and questionsWell, now we know that the Earth has somehow vanished from the continuity of the series. The floating relics of our planet seen at the end ofThe Robot Revolutionappear to have come home to roost. And Anita Dobson was imperious as a future bureaucratic space commander, whoever she transpires to be.Deeper into the vortexBritney Spears’Toxicgot another Doctor Who airing. It appeared in the 2005 Christopher Eccleston episodeThe End of the Worldwhere it was introduced as “a traditional ballad” with which to mourn the death of the planet Earth. That was also the first episode to show psychic paper, deployed by Gatwa here on planet 6767.Does Belinda’s name now technically have to be added to the growing list of companions who have been killed off in the programme, giving she was shot to convince the creature she was dead and had to have her heart restarted? Probably not.The Doctor answering “magic” when asked by Cassio what the sonic screwdriver was doing was surely intended to either amuse or antagonise, depending on whether you think it has been used as an over-powered magic wand in the modern era.Under the Lakein 2015 saw Peter Capaldi in another “base under siege” style scenario featuring a major character where the actor is deaf, with Sophie Stone starring as Cass and Zaqi Ismail as her signer Tim Lunn.This isn’t the first time the Earth has gone missing. The Daleks stole it in pursuit of making a reality bomb in the David Tennant two-parterThe Stolen Earth/Journey’s Endin 2008. The Time Lords have also been guilty of a similar heist. It was revealed during Colin Baker’s 14-partThe Trial of a Time Lordepic in 1986 that, as part of a cover-up, they once moved Earth two light years and renamed it Ravolox.Next timeRuby Sunday! Unit!

I thought it looked a bit girlie for me. It was only during lockdown that I finally got round to seeing it. I found the first few episodes entertaining, but didn’t really connect with any of the storylines. I was the same age as the characters, but I had been in a relationship for four years, so Carrie’s disastrous dates felt far removed from my own experience. I saw the show as no more than a guilty pleasure, something to do while my boyfriend played PlayStation in the other room. I certainly didn’t think it would end my relationship.It was Charlotte who got me hooked. Specifically her relationship with Trey, her sexually repressed husband. There was so much nuance to the scenes between them. The show dramatised the uncomfortable, shameful parts of a relationship like I’d never seen before on TV. My boyfriend and I had moved in together that year, and he seemed to have completely lost interest in sex. I played it down to friends, saying I had gone off sex too – but I hadn’t. I told myself what was happening between us was a natural progression out of the honeymoon stage, but it hurt me deeply every time I tried to be affectionate with my boyfriend and he turned me away.Often he wouldn’t even verbalise the rejection. I remember booking a hotel for his birthday, and dressing up for him in beautiful lingerie, and him just sitting on the bed hunched over his phone, placing bets on football as if I wasn’t even in the room. When I tried to discuss it with him he would say he was tired from work, or that he didn’t feel he was in good shape, but no matter how much I reassured him that I loved his body, nothing ever seemed to change. I retreated into myself, and watched a lot more Sex and the City alone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She slinks into their bedroom, in a lacy nightdress, but Trey responds with derision. I started crying because it was a direct reflection of so many nights I had experienced. What moved me the most was Charlotte’s response to the rejection. She simply says: “I’m your wife, I’m sexual and I love you.” I’d been tying myself up in knots trying to rationalise my partner’s lack of interest, but Charlotte spelled it out so unequivocally.I rewatched the scene obsessively for hours that night. I thought about going into the other room and interrupting my partner’s video game, to explain how moved I was by what I had seen, but I knew he wouldn’t understand it. He thought Sex and the City was beneath him, and would literally run out of the living room when he heard the theme tune. And by that point, even mentioning sex would start an argument between us. The fact that I knew it would be pointless to even try to share the scene with him showed me how distant we really were.Over the next few months I started secretly looking for a flat of my own, and making concrete plans to leave. It was a struggle, because there were things I still loved about my partner. I found a shortened clip of the scene on TikTok that I could rewatch when I doubted myself. It felt so frivolous to give up a good man for something as supposedly meaningless as sex – but every time I heard Charlotte’s words I felt less alone. She reminded me that it was natural to want to express your love for your partner physically, and that I wasn’t strange, or perverted, for wanting sex. It was a difficult breakup, but I owe my happiness today to Charlotte’s heartfelt plea for affection.Did a cultural moment convince you to make a major life change?

She talks about her shock diagnosis, conspiracy theories about her family, and the Instagram posts that get her in trouble with her kidsSat 26 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTShareIt’s been a decade since Tina Knowles started dictating her life story into her phone for her grandchildren and future great-grandchildren. She wanted them to know their history – her early life and world were so different from theirs, she might as well have been from another planet. Knowles, the youngest of seven, born to a docker and seamstress, grew up poor in segregated Texas. Her grandchildren, born to Knowles’s superstar daughters,Beyoncéand Solange, are growing up in Los Angeles and New York with unimaginable wealth, but under unimaginable scrutiny.A couple of years ago, Knowles started writing a book that was supposed to be her behind-the-scenes take on the outfits she had created for her daughters’ music careers – the dazzling triple-denimlooks she had cobbled together from fabric remnants and army-surplus stores, with almost no budget, for Beyoncé’s groupDestiny’s Childin the 1990s.She was still improvising costumes once Beyoncé had gone solo and could have her pick of designer clothes; even the singer’s spectacular recent Renaissance tour had input from her mother.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenBoth photographs: Mary Rozzi/The Guardian. Blazer and trousers: Alexander McQueen. Earrings: Gabriel & Co. Heels: KotsonasBut those stories from Knowles’s early life – the ones she was dictating for her grandkids – kept bubbling up, and she became more comfortable, she says, with the idea of sharing them. “Because, you know, my family’s very private,” she says; Beyoncé, notoriously so. Knowles dug out that old phone with the recordings and started listening. Eventually, she decided: “I can still be respectful and not tell their story, but tellmystory.” The result is her memoir Matriarch, a brilliant account of how a resilient little girl, born in terrible times, became a powerhouse, guiding her daughters to their potential without, it seems, all of them losing their sanity.Knowles is sitting in the back of a car, speaking on Zoom, looking phenomenally glamorous – red lips, cascading hair – having just come from a photoshoot. But I suspect Knowles always looks like this. (She has even taken toborrowing Beyoncé’s glittering stage costumesfor red-carpet events.)Now a multimillionaire businesswoman, Knowles raised arguably pop music’s greatest of all time. Beyoncé has won 35 Grammys, sold more than 200m records, performed at the Super Bowl, sung at inaugurations, and worked with everyone from Nile Rodgers toChimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Her mother’s life is now one of award ceremonies, beautiful houses, yachts, private jets, and business meetings for the hair and fashion lines they share. But Knowles has realised, she says, that a lot of the time, particularly with Destiny’s Child, the group she helped shepherd with her now ex-husband Mathew Knowles, her input was minimised, even criticised. “I didn’t take credit for things; I stayed in the background. Now I’m 71 and I want to be bold.” She laughs. “I don’t have those hang-ups any more, I’m just living out loud.”View image in fullscreenTina Knowles and her then husband Mathew in 2005.Photograph: Michael Caulfield Archive/WireImageKnowles, who is known by fans as Mama Tina or Ms Tina, is a great talker – warm and funny, with her charming Texas accent. She is acutely aware of her children’s privacy, but can’t help addressing some of the media stories about them. When Beyoncé was pregnant with her first daughter, Blue, in 2011 (she also has seven-year-old twins, Rumi and Sir), the strange theory that she was faking it, complete with false baby bump,enraged her mother. “It was one of the worst times of my life, because I couldn’t say anything,” says Knowles. “But, you know, we deal with rumours all the time. So at some point you just roll with the punches and say …” She pauses. “When they start messing with your kids, your kids signed up for this. But when they start messing with your grandkids, that’s when it gets really bad.”Knowles will sometimes address these things on social media. “I get in trouble with my kids all the time for speaking out. They’re like, don’t dignify that with an answer. And most of the time I’m able not to do that, but sometimes my little fingers just …” She flickers perfectly painted nails in the air as if she’s about to type. Mostly, though, she says, “it’s so silly, and the stupidity and the ignorance that people put out there, some of it is just funny. That’s what my kids say all the time. They’re like, some of this stuff is a joke, so why are you letting it make you mad?”There are topics, however, that she is tight-lipped about. There is no mention in the book of the 2014 incident in a lift after the Met Gala, where leaked CCTV footage showed Knowles’s younger daughter,Solange, attacking Beyoncé’s husband, the rapper Jay-Z, nor of his supposed infidelity. (The statement released after the lift footage emerged said they had apologised to each other and “moved forward as a united family”.) She also skirts over the breakup of the original Destiny’s Child in 2000 and the time Beyoncéremoved her father as their manager in 2011.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenBoth photographs: Mary Rozzi/The Guardian.

Vintage ring and bangles: Knowles’s own. Heels: Dolce & GabbanaAs matriarch of one of the most scrutinised celebrity families – as well as Beyoncé and Solange, Knowles also considers her niece Angie, and Kelly Rowland, the Destiny’s Child singer and actor whom she helped to bring up, as daughters – what does a family get-together look like? Who does the cooking? “I do a lot of cooking, but, thank God, I don’t have to do all of it any more,” she says. “We’re together most holidays, we vacation together a lot. We make sure that we stay close.”Do people often arrive by helicopter? I’m thinking of her description in the book of Beyoncé’s 40th birthday party in Italy, arranged as a surprise by Jay-Z,which Solange initially couldn’t make, only to arrive by helicopter the day afterwards. “No, that’s not normal!” says Knowles with a laugh. “But when we’re together, it’s very normal. It’s like any other family. We’ve got our shoes off and we’re relaxed and we’re talking and we’re having a good time with each other. Kids are running around.”When Knowles started writing, she thought she would finish the book in triumph – fabulous in her 70s, surrounded by family and grandchildren, her daughters on top of the world. Instead, it ends with a shock diagnosis of breast cancer.Last summer, Knowles had been at Beyoncé’s house in the Hamptons, playing in the pool with her granddaughter Rumi. She writes movingly of feeling a stillness in the air, “the singular awareness of being watched with love”. Knowles turned, half-expecting, she writes, to see her latemother standing there, but it was Beyoncé. It felt like four female generations all there together.The next day, Knowles went back to LA to have biopsies of a mass in each breast, which had been picked up in a mammogram three months earlier. She had had unusual mammograms before, which turned out to be nothing, and if the doctors weren’t hassling her to make an appointment, she thought, it couldn’t be anything to worry about. One lump was found to be benign, the other was cancer. It was caught early and removed, and she was reassured that the prognosis was good, but, she says, “it was like a punch in the face”.I taught my girls that other girls are not your competition. You are your own competitionView image in fullscreenBeyoncé and Solange, 1990.Photograph: Paul S Howell/Houston Chronicle via Getty ImagesShe had no intention of sharing the news publicly, she says. “I was, like, absolutely not, that’s nobody’s business but mine.” But she wanted to encourage other women to check, and to keep on top of their screening tests. Knowles thought she had had a mammogram in 2022, but because of the pandemic it was postponed and then forgotten. The cancer could have been diagnosed at an even earlier stage, she says. “That is my big reason for talking about it, because I want women to take the time and not put themselves last.”When she arrived at her room at the hospital, Solange, Beyoncé and Kelly were there. They prayed together and sang. Solange cheered Knowles up with memes, laughing together at the TikToker Jools Lebron’s viral “very demure, very mindful” video. A month later, Knowles had more surgery to remove a blood clot, and later got an infection;Beyoncé would insist on being on speakerphone to ask Knowles’s doctors questions. She moved into Beyoncé’s house, and an old friend came to help care for her. “It was really hard, really challenging,” says Knowles. “Something that I thought was going to be easy turned into something pretty traumatic, but I am doing so good now, and I am just so grateful and blessed that I am healthy. It could have been way worse.”What pulled her through? “Absolutely my faith, and my kids. My kids were …” Knowles pauses. “I can’t even explain how supportive they were.” Her voice cracks and she holds back tears. “This was a seven-day-a-week thing, and I felt, with them by my side, I could get through anything – and I did.” Did it affect her confidence? No, she says with a smile. “My confidence is better, actually. I decided that my silver lining of all of this would be a breast reduction, and, let me tell you, I wore a dress to the Billboard awards that I could never have dreamed of wearing before.” She laughs. “So that part, for me, has been awesome.”Neither has it brought fresh perspectives on life – those came a decade earlier, she says, when she turned 60. “I had the view that I would live each day as fully as I possibly can, and just live out loud, which doesn’t mean I’m loud or boisterous or anything. It just means that I am a priority, and I don’t feel bad about the good things that I’ve accomplished. I feel proud, I feel happy, I feel fulfilled.”She might have a new outlook, but has not forgotten her female ancestors. Rosalie, enslaved in Louisiana in the early 1800s, managed to hold on to her daughter Célestine when the white family who had enslaved them downsized. Célestine became pregnant by the slaver’s grandson; later, he would buy Célestine and their two children at a public auction. “I type those words, say them aloud,” writes Knowles, “and I feel that fear and rage in my blood, the trauma passed down through my DNA.” Living with the man’s white wife and children, Célestine would go on to have 10 more children by him – one of them, Odilia, Knowles’s grandmother.Knowles’s mother, Agnes – whose stories instilled a firm sense of Black pride and female strength – named her Célestine (Tina for short), after Knowles’s great-grandmother. Tina’s maiden name, Beyoncé, was a misspelling of the family’s surname – all her siblings had variations. When Agnes had asked for it to be corrected, she was told to be grateful that they had birth certificates at all. Tina named Beyoncé to honour her own name and her history.Knowles’s family lived in the island city Galveston, just off the Texas coast. She remembers the rocky bit of the beach that Galveston’s Black population was allowed to use, the areas in the backs of restaurants where they could order food, which they would have to eat outside. Having to stand at the back in buses.View image in fullscreenTina Knowles in first grade, c1960.Photograph: Courtesy of Ms Tina KnowlesIt was worse in Louisiana, where her parents were from. When Knowles was there visiting relatives in 1959, her cousins told her they had to wait outside a shop until the white children inside had finished. “I was really confused,” says Knowles. “It was very shocking to me.” And then there was her cousins’ reaction: “They were just OK with it, and they thought I was a troublemaker.” She pauses. “As an adult, I totally get it, because if I had pushed it, that could have been a very bad outcome.” Only four years earlier, 14-year-old Emmett Till, visiting relatives in Mississippi, was abducted and murdered after being accused of offending a white woman in a grocery store. “My mom would prep us for Louisiana,” says Knowles. “She was always saying, ‘You can’t do what you do at home, it’s a different place.’ I had the message, but I didn’t fully understand it until [the shop incident] happened.”For Agnes, drilling those rules into her children, however painful, was a matter of survival. One night, Knowles’s 17-year-old brother was arrested after falling asleep outside somebody’s house. Knowles, then in her early teens, remembers their mother praying, convinced the police were going to kill her son. “We were so afraid that we’d lost my brother,” she says. When he was released the following day, he had been beaten up so badly that his ribs were broken.From then on, the police would harass her family. Her father would be constantly stopped in his car. Waiting for her brother to pick her up outside the cinema, Knowles was questioned by police and taken to the police station when she refused to give her name. There were other traumatising, dehumanising incidents. Once she was violently ill, and her father took her to hospital. She was given an invasive vaginal examination, without explanation or consent, that left her bleeding. The doctors, seeing a Black teenage girl, assumed she was pregnant or had a sexually transmitted disease. They missed that she had viral hepatitis.“I had a lot of anger,” remembers Knowles. “I was just mad when I was a teenager, but didn’t really connect the dots about why I was so angry. It was tough years.” She wasn’t rebellious in terms of drugs and boys, she says, “but I was rebellious in my mouth. I was rebellious in being angry at my parents, and it wasn’t even their fault, but I was just mad.” Had she told her children about these experiences, or did they come as a surprise when they read her book? “I told my children. They know all of these things.”One of her early nicknames was Badass Tenie B, perfect for that spirited little girl. “That was not a term of endearment,” she points out. “It was like, that’s a bad little kid. She’s wild, talking back, she’s doing all these things.” Does she still feel like Badass Tenie B sometimes? Knowles smiles. “Now I can revel in it, I can enjoy it, and I can pull her out when I need to protect myself or my children, because I pulled her out all the time for my kids. Badass Tenie B would come out because that’s my protector.”By the time Beyoncé was born, in 1981, Tina was married to Mathew Knowles, then a successful sales executive, and living in Houston. It’s fun to read about Beyoncé as a challenging baby, whose two-hourly night wakings would only be soothed by jazz. Knowles also writes about Beyoncé’s shyness as a child; it’s hard to believe that now she performs to millions. What caused the transformation? “Performing changed her life. Even when she was shy, she was dancing and putting on shows, and she would just come alive at that time, which is why we got her in the dance class. When she was dancing, there was no shyness.” She pauses. “I don’t know if shy is the right word, but she is still reserved. She always has been and always will be. She’s not that person that walks into the room, like, ‘I’m here!’ I don’t think that changed. I just think that she has this other personality when she gets on stage.”Solange, born five years later, was always more outgoing, says Knowles, and a creative spirit. Later, she would become known for her performance art and groundbreaking album A Seat at the Table, which includes spoken-word interludes from her parents among its songs of Black womanhood. Knowles writes about not wanting Solange to be overshadowed by her older sister before she had a chance to develop her own talent.Did she worry about sibling rivalry? “I don’t know if I worried about it, but everybody who has kids that are five years apart, there is a time where they’re super close, and then when the older kid gets to be around seven or eight, that little kid is going to get on their nerves. I started seeing signs that Beyoncé was getting irritated with her, and didn’t want her around as much. I started seeing them being mean to each other, and that was scary for me, so I got them in therapy. It didn’t take long, because the therapist showed Beyoncé how that could be so damaging to her sister, and she loved her sister, so she became way kinder and more protective of her.”View image in fullscreenTina, Solange and Beyoncé at Solange’s birthday party, 2008.Photograph: Alberto E Rodríguez/Getty ImagesWas it a problem later, as Beyoncé’s megastardom eclipsed the careers of both Kelly Rowland and Solange? “No, I never worried about the competition or sibling rivalry with them as adults,” says Knowles. “They are so close, and they love and support each other, all three of them in every way. People try to make up that story, but it doesn’t fit, because they’re so different, and there is no rivalry between them.” How much of that came from Knowles? She writes that she made a point of never comparing them, always celebrating their differences. Did that help? “Absolutely, and I also taught my girls that other girls are not your competition. You are your own competition. Go and work harder so that you can top your own self. Don’t focus on them, because the time that you’re spending focusing on what they’re doing, you could be working on yourself and becoming better. They learned that very early. I think that philosophy had a lot to do with who they are now.”In the early days of Destiny’s Child, and its predecessor groupGirls Tyme, Knowles worried the girls were driving themselves too hard. “It was their choice – they lived and breathed music and what they were doing, and I would have to make them go and do stuff.” She would force Beyoncé and Kelly to go to high-school parties, she says, to give them a sense of normal 16-year-old life. “They would rather stay home and listen to music and rehearse, and I just didn’t feel like it was as balanced as it should be.” Meanwhile, Mathew created a “boot camp”, as Knowles describes it in the book, taking the girls running and getting them to sing the whole time to increase their lung capacity so they could perform challenging choreography on stage.Knowles had endured some tough years. She writes about being hit by a tax bill and the family going bankrupt. She had forgiven Mathew’s infidelities over the years, but eventually she left and moved with the girls into a small flat. She had set up a hairdressing salon, which was doing well, but it was a stressful time. “Your kids have to be your priority. I believe that with all my heart, but I do think that if I had to do it all over again, I would have balanced a little more in terms of myself. It was tough. I just didn’t have the time to focus on the pain of whatever else was going on in my life.”I’m close to my kids but at times they don’t want my input. They are adults. You have to let them grow upFor years, even after she left, Knowles’s marriage would be on and off. Several months after she filed for divorce in 2009, she started secretly seeing Mathew again: the couple took romantic cruises on their boat for several nights at a time before ending up at their Galveston beach house. If one of the girls called, worried their mother was lonely, their father would have to be quiet. There was one extraordinary incident when they rang to surprise Knowles on Mother’s Day, announcing they were on their way. It meant their father had to flee before they got there. The “affair” only ended when he confessed what reporters already knew – that he had recently fathered a child with someone else. Knowles would later get married again, to the actor Richard Lawson in 2015, but she divorced him nine years later when she was 70.If there’s one thing that’s clear from Matriarch, it’s that Knowles feels things deeply – whether that’s love for the people in her life or the rights of wider communities around her. Her Instagram page is often political – recently, it included admiring posts aboutSenator Cory Booker’s 25-hour evisceration of President Trump. She is a friend of Michelle Obama and she, Beyoncé and Kelly appeared at a rally for Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris. (Although, when I ask about the current situation in the US, she says: “I’m not going to talk about politics.”) She has also long been a supporter of LGBTQ+ movements and lost her nephew Johnny to the HIV/Aids epidemic. They were a similar age and had been inseparable childhood friends who both loved fashion and dreamed of getting out of Galveston. They lived together as adults, and he had helped Knowles’s family, running the household and designing clothes for the girls. (Years later, Beyoncé dedicated herRenaissance albumto the cousin she called “uncle”, who introduced her to the house music and disco made by queer people of colour that inspired the album.)View image in fullscreenKnowles with her nephew, Johnny. They were a similar age and had been inseparable childhood friends.Photograph: Courtesy of Tina KnowlesBy the late 90s, the HIV/Aids epidemic had killed many people within the gay community. “Johnny lost all his friends, and I was always fearful of it,” says Knowles. Then Johnny became ill. “We tried to protect him as much as we could, and tried to educate ourselves so that we weren’t condoning the ignorance that was going on at the time.” It was shocking to visit him at the hospice, where so many other young men had been disowned by their families. “I just find it really hard to believe that people could abandon their kid, no matter what they’re going through,” says Knowles. Johnny died in 1998 at the age of 48.Around the time of Johnny’s death, Destiny’s Child had a record deal and were starting to get big. Knowles had to fight for the girls, particularly their look, which she took charge of. They were sent drab clothes, and designers wouldn’t dress them. She writes: “The reality was that many did not want to give their clothes to these curvy Black girls.” Instead, Knowles came up with her own creations. So many are enduring: the camouflage looks for Survivor, or the strappy and cut-out leather-look creations for Bills Bills Bills. Some people at the label didn’t appreciate her input (one of Knowles’s arch chapter titles about this is “Tina is the problem”). The colours she chose, Knowles writes, were “too bold, too bright, too Black for them”.Sometimes, says Knowles with a smile, “I’ll look at some of the clothes and I’m like, ‘Oh lord, what were we thinking?’” But mostly their look worked and the group and their fans loved them. “I think the label just didn’t have this open mind to things – it had to be proven to them. And, in all honesty, we were country, we were from Texas. We had big hair, I love sparkle and it wasn’t what was happening at that time – we were going against the grain. But these were four Black girls from the south, and we worshipped Motown, so we wanted something different. They were unique.”Many parents, especially in the entertainment industry, who have been involved with their children’s careers end up falling out (Beyoncé’s relationship with her father hasn’t seemed so straightforward). Why hasn’t Knowles, who still works with Beyoncé three decades on? “I’m very close to my kids,” says Knowles, “and I also know when enough is enough, like, sometimes they don’t want my input, and I know how to keep my mouth closed and mind my own business. I also realised that my kids are adults. You’ve got to let your kids grow up.”View image in fullscreenDestiny’s Child wearing outfits designed by Knowles, 2001.Photograph: RJ Capak/WireImageThe book gives a mother’s-eye view of Solange’s artistic development, Kelly steadily forging her own path, and Beyoncé’s work ethic and steely determination. Knowles was there when Beyoncé, watching Whitney Houston sing the national anthem at the Super Bowl, declared that one day she would do the same (in 2004, she succeeded). And in the meeting at the record label where her daughter was told her first solo album, Dangerously in Love, didn’t have any potential hits, but refused to back down (it spent eight weeks at No 1).I ask her what she thinks are the most valuable lessons she has taught her daughters, and what she has learned from them. “They’ve taught me some great stuff. Beyoncé has taught me how to take a compliment, Solange has told taught me to be bolder, Kelly has taught me patience, and Angie has just taught me to laugh at stuff and not take it so seriously.”As for what she has left them, it’s “family first. Also what my mom taught me, which I think is the message they are passing on to their children – my mom would say, pretty is as pretty does. My mom would always say to me, ‘You’re a pretty girl, but one day you’re not going to be so cute, and what people are going to remember is how you acted and how you treated them.’”There is something moving about the wisdom passed through her family’s female line, and something energising about Knowles’s power seeming to grow as she gets older. Finally, she says, she has reached an age where she is content to be single. “I think, up until 70, I really felt like no matter how great my life was, I need to have a partner to make it whole. I don’t feel that way any more.” There is too much to do, even if Knowles seems to have unlimited energy. “You know, 71 is harder than 70, and 70 is harder than 69, but, I tell you, I’m going to try to keep my young spirit.” She smiles, dazzling. “The phrase ‘I can’t’ – I try not to use that too much.”Matriarch: A Memoir by Tina Knowles is published by Dialogue (£25).

Robert Macfarlane on the lives, deaths and rights of our riversAs pollution levels hit record highs and fresh water becomes ‘the new oil’, is it time to radically reimagine our relationship to the natural world?Robert MacfarlaneSat 26 Apr 2025 04.00 EDTShareIf you find it difficult to think of a river as alive, try picturing a dying or dead river. This is easier. We know what this looks like. We know how itfeels. A dying river is one who does not reach the sea. A dying river’s fish float belly-up in stagnant pools. Swans on the upper Thames near Windsor now wear brown tidemarks on their snowy chest feathers, showing where they have sailed through sewage. I recently saw a SouthernWaterriverbank sign badged with a bright blue logo that read “Water for Life”. The sign instructed passersby to “avoid contact with the water. If you’ve had contact with the water, please wash your hands before eating.” In parts of this septic isle, fresh water has become first undrinkable, then unswimmable, then untouchable.How did it come to this – and where do we go from here? The crisis is one of imagination as well as of legislation. We have forgotten that our fate flows with that of rivers, and always has. Our relationship with fresh water has become intensely instrumentalised, privatised and monetised: river understood as resource, not life force. The duty of care for rivers, who extend such care to us, has been abrogated. Regulation has gone unenforced, monitoring is strategically underfunded.Riversnamed after deities – the Shannon (Sinnan), the Dee (Deva) – now struggle under burdens of nitrates, forever chemicals and waste.One of modernity’s many vanishing tricks is to disappear the provisionality of its own conclusions. We now take it for granted that we take rivers for granted. It is unremarkable that a company registered yesterday is, in the eyes of the law, an entity with legal standing and a suite of rights, including the right to sue – but that a river who has flowed for 10,000 years has no rights at all.The vast Anthropocene reshaping of the planet that is now under way extends to water as well as landWater stocks are traded on futures markets, with disaster-capitalist investors gambling that crises to come will drive unit prices up. Fresh water is fiscalised as a liquid asset or, as Goldman Sachs hungrily describes it, “the new oil”. Rivers have been reduced to “one-dimensional water”, to adapt Marcuse: de-territorialised and organised in order to maximise yield. Flowing fresh water has been systematically stripped of its spirits, and reduced to what Isaac Newton called “inanimate brute matter”. Thus designated as feedstock for the machine, rivers have been laid open for the slow violence that has been inflicted on them.The vast Anthropocene reshaping of the planet that is now under way extends to water as well as land. The Three Gorges dam project on the Yangtze River in China impounds so much water that it has measurably slowed the rotation speed of the Earth. Oil extraction from the Alberta tar sands uses more than 200bn litres of fresh water a year: this is abstracted from the Athabasca River,rendered toxic– and then injected back into aquifers by way of “disposal”. Europe has the most obstructed river system of any continent, with more than 1m barriers fragmenting flow and only a handful of free-running waterways remaining.It has long been in the interests of power to deem nature dead, in preparation for its extraction, conversion and consumption. This systematic de-animation process has been accelerated to calamity speed by the new US administration. Trump’s inaugural address was obsessively focused on “land”; his speech a bingo card of 19th-century settler-Christian tropes glorifying first the subjugation then exploitation of the continent’s “resources”, natural and human: manifest destiny, the “untamed wilderness”, the “frontier hypothesis”. At his Senate confirmation hearing, Doug Burgum – the new interior secretary – described public lands and waters as “America’s balance sheet”, which he would “unleash” for “economic activity”. Everything must be assetised. Listening to Burgum, I thought of Leslie Marmon Silko in her visionary Ceremony (1977): ‘They see no life / When they look they see only objects / The world is a dead thing for them / The trees and rivers are not alive …’As the living world has been further deadened into “brute matter”, so language that recognises its liveliness – a “grammar of animacy”, in Robin Wall Kimmerer’s celebrated phrase – has in turn become rarer. Words make worlds. In English, we “it” rivers, trees, mountains and creatures: a mode of address that reduces them to the status of stuff, and distinguishes them from human people. In English, pronouns for natural features are “which” or “that”: the river that flows; the forest that grows. I prefer to speak of riverswhoflow and forestswhogrow. In English, we refer to a river in the singular, but “river” is one of the great group nouns, containing multitudes. In English, there is no verb “to river”. But what could be more of a verb than a river?In the spring of 2020, I made the first notes for a book about ideas of life. Under the heading “Anima”, I jotted a triplet of quick, provocative questions to myself:Can a forest think? Does a mountain remember? Is a river alive?All have proved good questions with which to spend time, but it was the last of the three that would not let me go.In the end, I spent four years in pursuit of answers to this enigmatic question. That pursuit took me to places in the world where rivers are being imagined in radically different ways; it brought me into contact with scores of brave and visionary people – among them lawyers, judges, ecologists, activists, community leaders and artists – who are working to redefine the ways rivers are perceived and treated; who are working, indeed, to redefine life itself.View image in fullscreenThe 11km long Cheonggyecheon Stream in downtown Seoul.Photograph: Mlenny/Getty ImagesIn urban planning, “daylighting” is the practice of bringing rivers back to the surface of towns and cities: unburying them from the dark tunnels in which they have been confined. These entombed watercourses are sometimes known as “ghost rivers”; their voices heard at street level only as prisoners’ whispers drifting from drain grilles. London has more than 20 such ghosts. You could walk the capital’s streets for years and not know that each day you are crossing rivers other than the Thames: the Fleet, the Moselle, the Walbrook, the Tyburn and the Westbourne to the north of the Thames; and south of it the Quaggy, the Neckinger, the Falconbrook and others, their names now largely lost to concrete and culvert.“Daylighting” is a means of resurrecting river ghosts – of re-encountering rivers as fellow citizens. In cities where daylighting has occurred – Seattle, Yonkers, Singapore, San Antonio, many more – the results have often been transformative. In Seoul, the Cheonggyecheon Stream was freed from the highway that encased it: the public park created along its banks now draws 90,000 pedestrians on an average day. Summer temperatures at the waterside can be five degrees cooler than surrounding areas, and air pollution levels have dropped by more than a third. Earlier this year, a long-buried section of Sheffield’s River Sheaf wasdisinterred in the city centreto widespread celebration; the result of a long campaign to make the river visible, restored and accessible.Buried feelings, as well as buried rivers, can be daylighted. We need now, urgently, to resurface older, kinder ways of relating to rivers – and to see what transformations occur if rivers were recognised as both alive and killable. What might flow from such a recognition in terms of imagination, law and politics?Seeking answers to such questions, I made three long river journeys to regions where rivers have become a focus for revolutionary thinking about what the philosopher Michel Serres called “the natural contract”. In each of these places, rivers are understood in some fundamental way to be “alive” – and in each place, too, the survival of rivers is under extreme threat: from mining, pollution and damming.By the time I finished writing, it was irrefutable to me that the rivers had been my vital collaborators and co-authorsThe first journey was to an Ecuadorian cloud forest named Los Cedros, home to the headwaters of the Rio Los Cedros, the “River of the Cedars”. In November 2021, as mining companies were preparing to destroy Los Cedros in search of its gold, the cloud forest was saved byan astonishing court judgmentthat invoked the “rights of nature” articles embedded in the Ecuadorian constitution, and proclaimed the “right to life” of the forest and its rivers.The second was to the sorely wounded creeks, lagoons and estuaries of the watery city of Chennai in south-east India. There, rivers barely endure for most of the year – then return monstrously in cyclone season to flood the city, bringing crocodiles and catfish into the inundated streets. There, too, an indefatigable group of young people is trying to resurrect a just water culture, in a region where humans and their ancestors have lived and thrived by rivers for at least 1m years but where a severe water amnesia has now taken hold.The third journey was to the interior of Nitassinan (also known as Quebec), homeland of the Innu people, where the wild Mutehekau Shipu flows for more than 100 miles through roadless boreal forest to make seafall at the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. In 2021, that extraordinary river becamethe first in Canada to have its rights declared, as part of a campaign to save it from death by drowning at the hands of a planned multi-dam hydro development.In the course of those journeys I met stolen, drowned and vanished rivers, and I saw the ruthlessly executed power of companies, criminals and governments. I also watched three people being brought back from within the shadow of death by rivers. I witnessed two mycological discoveries, one of which shifted slightly the whole story of life on Earth. By the time I finished writing, it was irrefutable to me that the rivers themselves had been my vital collaborators and co-authors.The question of what is alive is both an ancient and an urgent one. It is at the heart of the oldest written long-narrative poem we know, the Epic of Gilgamesh, more than 4,000 years old in its earliest form. The Epic is materially a river text: it was recorded on tablets made from river clay, in a cuneiform script pressed into the clay using the trimmed end of a river reed, and it was first composed and circulated in Mesopotamia, the region whose name means “the land between rivers”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

There he confronts a “demon” called Humbaba, who is in fact the embodiment of the forest’sanima. Gilgamesh slaughters Humbaba and then – in the world’s first recorded act of ecocide – draws his axe and clear-fells the Cedar Forest. Catastrophe follows, of course. The poem sounds a warning that we are still failing to heed, more than four millennia later. The law too is a storied thing – and as such it can be re-storied. On 20 March 2017 an extraordinary piece of legislation called theTe Awa Tupua(Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act was passed in Aotearoa New Zealand’s parliament house, accompanied by tears and songs from many of those present. The act concerned the Whanganui River, who rises as meltwater on the slopes of three North Island volcanoes and flows for 180 miles to its mouth at the Tasman Sea.At the act’s heart is a radical claim: that the Whanganui River is alive. The act speaks unambiguously of the river as an “indivisible and living whole”; a “spiritual and physical entity” with a “lifeforce”. “We want … to begin with the view that [the river] is a living being, and then consider its future from that central belief,” said Gerrard Albert, lead negotiator for the Whanganuiiwi(tribe) during the act’s drafting. To its declaration of the river as alive, the act added a second dramatic innovation: it also recognised the river as a rights-bearing “legal person”, with the capacity to represent itself in court.The passing of the Te Awa Tupua Actrang like a gong-strike around the worldand supercharged the dynamic, disruptive current of ideas usually known as the Rights of Nature movement. Over the past 20 years, Rights of Nature thinking has lit up activists, artists, lawmakers and politicians across six continents, and inspired powerful new forms of future dreaming.View image in fullscreenThe Leutasch gorge in the Wetterstein mountain range, Leutasch, Austria.Photograph: Cyril Gosselin/Getty ImagesRivers have become a particular focus for this movement. “River rights” have become the commonest form of novel legal subjectivity in dozens of countries from Australia to Canada. AUniversal Declaration of River Rightshas been drawn up that recognises rivers as living entities with fundamental rights, including the right to flow and the right to be free from pollution. These ideas have now washed up on British shores. In early March, Lewes district council in East Sussex agreed to champion acharter of rights for the River Ouse, and river rights campaigns are emerging for the Clyde, the Don, the Derwent and the Rye.Meanwhile, a wider chorus of voices is speaking up for Britain’s rivers in terms of life, death and love: animism energising activism. Feargal Sharkey has held government and industry’s feet to the fire for five years, fighting to reverse, as he puts it, “the simple truth of the matter that every river in England is dying”. Last November, 15,000 people joined amarch for clean water in London, the biggest water protest in the country’s history. In the upper Usk, in Wales, the youth-ledPenpont Projectis restoring lost areas of riparian woodland and creating a “living memory map” of the sub-catchment. The inspirational activist-lawyer Paul Powlesland has forged a group ofhardworking “guardians” for the River Roding in Essex, motivated by “the belief that the Roding is sacred, it is a being and it does have rights”. Each January now, a Blessing of the River Thames ceremony is held on London Bridge by the parishes of Southwark and St Magnus the Martyr. On the English-Welsh border, citizen scientists are organising and training one another in order to fight the demise of River Wye: “a great river dying before our eyes”, in George Monbiot’s words. The agile, bullish young organisationRiver Actionis taking the government to court in order to drive policy change, and has created an extensiveRiver Rescue Kitaimed at empowering ordinary people to take action for their waterbodies: River Action’s work is foundedon the belief that“every family, home and institution has its roots in rivers of this land”, and that “rescuing the rivers is upholding values of gratitude, respect, justice, love, compassion and honour”.Rivers are easily wounded. But given a chance, they heal themselves with remarkable speed. Their lifepoursback.On 2 October 2024, the century-old Iron Gate dam was removed from the upper Klamath River, who flows out of Oregon and into California. Its demolition concluded thelargest de-damming project in US history, and was the outcome of two decades of campaigning and watershed activism, led by members of the Klamath Tribe.Only a few days later, something extraordinary happened. A sonar camera set up by scientists detected a single chinook salmon migrating upstream to spawn, past the pinch-point where the Iron Gate Dam had stood. It was the first fish to make that journey in more than 100 years, guided by an ancient navigation system and driven by an undeniable urge.View image in fullscreenThe upper reaches of New Zealand’s Whanganui river flowing through a forest.Photograph: Brett Phibbs/APAs the salmon return in number to the Klamath, so with them will come the web of life they feed. Salmon are primarily ocean creatures; they carry marine nutrients far inland in their bodies when they come to spawn. In the upper watershed, scavengers will drag off the carcasses of spawned salmon, strip their flesh and guts and discard the skeletons. Fungi will reach up their white ghost-fingers, draw the fishbones down and decompose them – then share the goodness with the roots of the trees. By means of the river, the ocean will feed the forest.I saw the sonar image of that single chinook – the harbinger of all that is to come for the Klamath – on the day it was released. The image was grainy in the way that sonar is, the fish just a blurry lozenge-line set against a blurry background. Definition didn’t matter, though; the simple fact of it caused happiness to bloom suddenly huge in my heart, and the heaviness of spirit from which I had been suffering for weeks began to lift.The great Mississippi tops list of most endangered rivers amid fears over Trump rollbacksRead moreI haven’t been able to find the image of the salmon again online, though I’ve searched for it several times. It has swum back out into the ocean of the internet. Perhaps I dreamed it. I do know this for sure: water, once healed, heals us in return.Adapted fromIs a River Alive?by Robert Macfarlane, published on 1 May by Hamish Hamilton.To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

But the contestants here compete in puzzles so unthinkably boring and complex that you’re baffled from the get-go. Then someone gets locked in a cage …Hannah J DaviesSat 26 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTShareBritain loves a good gameshow. And if there weren’t enough on our screens already, the quizmasters-in-chief, ITV, recently announced that they would be bumping off the reality-focused ITVBe in favour of a new channel dedicated to them. Hopefully it will have some better programmes than Genius Game (Wednesday 30 April, ITV1), a new series that answers a question no one was asking. Namely, what if we had more light entertainment shows that felt like being back in GCSE maths?Frustratingly, Genius Gameshouldbe good. David Tennant is the host, for God’s sake (though he joins the show via Zoom – maybe he’s elsewhere in the studio, or even at home, perhaps already aware it wasn’t worth the three-hour round trip from London, where he lives, to Maidstone in Kent, where it was filmed). Based on a South Korean series, a group of “geniuses” must compete in puzzles and games based on strategy and social manipulation, with Tennant confined to a TV screen in the corner, doing a very loose impression of Richard O’Brien inThe Crystal Maze. Contestants include Bodalia, an NHS doctor who is also a touring DJ; entrepreneur Bex, who doesn’t think academic qualifications are the be-all and end-all, but does proudly possess a 100m swimming badge; and comedian Ken Cheng, who is easily one of the funniest people on LinkedIn, known for his satirical posts that send up “hustle and grind” business culture. There seems to be real potential at the outset, with the sense that this bunch were cast for their charisma as much as their IQs (or, as lecturer Benjamin puts it, “I applied for gay Love Island, so I don’t know what the hell I’m doing here!”) Oh, and there’s a £50,000 prize pot, which isn’t to be sniffed at.Sadly, though, Genius Game is dire – the TV equivalent of walking into a party halfway through an extremely convoluted game you never quite catch up with, and which is unthinkably dull to boot. After eight minutes of indeterminable explanations, the first episode begins with a challenge centred on stealing money from hypothetical vaults. It has the air of a logic puzzle, but also relies heavily on the kind of alliances you’ve seen on literally every other reality TV show ever broadcast. Forensic scientist Scott declares himself to be “ruthless”, while doctor Bhasha says she’s “good at coming across trustworthy”. All of this would be really helpful if it were compelling telly, and not the sort of thing that requires regular onscreen diagrams and voiceovers to make sure the audience at home are still following. Where it does try to do “drama”, it ends up looking more like a guide to committing elder abuse; a retired businessman called Paul is reduced to a patsy for Scott’s scheming, and is locked away in a big cage in a way that feels undignified for everybody involved.As for the puzzles, you know that there’ssomethingvaguely intelligent happening here, but it’s all explained so poorly that Genius Game often feels like watching the Mitchell and Webb sketch where a quiz host shouts “Numberwang!” at random. In episode one, you can actually see the contestants blinking in slow motion as they figure out what they’re supposed to be doing – never a good sign. In episode two, the challenges are a little easier to understand but, sadly, just as boring. The main task (“humans” and “zombies” trying to work out who is who, to gain the most points) has nothing of the wit or the high-stakes backstabbing ofThe Traitors. By the time we make it to what is supposed to be a thrilling finale featuring a giant noughts and crosses board, my brain has switched off entirely. I am left pining for a real ITV quiz: a classic episode of The Chase, or even something featuring Ant and Dec. Where’sStephen Mulhernwhen you need him, eh?It would be easy to say that Genius Game is too lofty, misunderstood by the narrow-minded idiots at home. But nerdy gameshows can and do work: just look at Only Connect or University Challenge. The important thing is that they have to be entertaining, too – and it doesn’t take a genius to see that this one falls flat.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherDavid TennantfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now often you’ll walk around and have nobody else there. It feels empty. You definitely feel the absence of life on those lots.”‘It’s a gut punch’: how the California wildfires affected film and TV workersRead moreLike theonce proud industrial factoriesof the midwest, the dream factories of southern California are in decline. Last year was the worst for on-location filming in Los Angeles since tracking began 30 years ago apart from pandemic-hit 2020. Of all the TV shows and feature films that North American audiences watch, only one-fifth are now made in California.This is because Hollywood is facing intense competition for film production from domestic rivals such as Atlanta and New York, and international challengers such asAustralia,BritainandCanada, all offering more aggressive financial incentives. California’s politicians stand accused of resting on their laurels too long.Donald Trump has a plan but, critics say, it will be no more effective for Hollywood than his notorious tariffs for the rust belt. The US president’s appointment of the actorsMel Gibson, Sylvester Stallone and Jon Voight(combined age 233) as “special ambassadors” to rescue the local industry met with widespread scepticism. Instead campaigners are focused on the hard graft of legislating new tax incentives in California’s state government.Scarpa, whose recent credits include Gladiator II and Napoleon, adds: “The state and the city are both struggling with big fiscal issues and in a way it becomes an arms race: is LA going to be able to compete with eastern Europe? We have the best people in the world here but often producers find themselves shopping for the best price. If LA wants to remain a hub of production, they’re going to have to have some form of tax incentives to compete with them.”Hollywood has been synonymous with film for more than a century. Southern California’s sunny weather allowed year-round outdoor filming while land and labour were cheaper than in eastern cities. Film-makers such asCecil B DeMilleand companies such as Paramount and Universal set up studios that ensured a creative ecosystem of actors, directors, musicians, writers and technicians. Hollywood burnished its self-mythology through films such asSunset Boulevard, Singin’ in the Rain, The Player, Mulholland Drive and La La Land.View image in fullscreenGloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard.Photograph: Granger/Historical Picture Archive/AlamyCalifornia continues to boom. According to IMF data released this week, the state’s nominal GDP reached $4.1tn, surpassing Japan’s $4.02tn and placing California behind only the US, China and Germany as thefourth biggest economy in the world.Yet while the tech giants of Silicon Valley continue to thrive, Hollywood is facing an existential crisis. The first quarter of the year saw downturns in every category of production compared with the same period in 2024, according toFilmLA, a non-profit that handles film permits for the city and county.Shoot daysdeclined 22%over that period and just 13 TV pilots were made, the lowest tally ever observed by FilmLA. Meanwhile average occupancy rates for the majority of stages were 63% last year, down from 69% in 2023. Andaccording to the Hollywood Reporter, the number of recording days booked for music scoring stages dropped from 127 in 2022 to just 11 so far this year.The malaise threatens “below-the-line” crew members such as grips, electricians, carpenters, set decorators, sound engineers, costume designers and makeup artists who came to Hollywood because that was where the work was. If that allure fades they could take their talents elsewhere, sending the ecosystem into a death spiral.The warning signs are everywhere. Los Angeles is now merely one of 120 jurisdictions around the world that offer some form of incentive for film-making. In February, the streaming giant Netflixannounced a $1bn investmentto produce 20 films and TV series in Mexico annually over the next four years. Last week Texaspassed a billthat would more than double the money spent to lure film and TV production to the Lone Star state.The flight from Hollywood has even prompted comparisons with Detroit, the “motor city” that, with the struggles of the car manufacturing industry, went from one of America’s most prosperous cities toone of its most troubled. Factories shut down, thousands of jobs were lost, the population collapsed and the city ultimately declared bankruptcy.Philip Sokoloski, vice-president of integrated communications for Film LA, says:“I don’t think we’re past the point of rescue, but Detroit offers an example of what happens when everything is in your hands and you fail to work to keep it. For California, for greaterLos Angeles, we’ve maintained leadership in this industry for a century.“Generations of people have invested their time, their sweat and their dreams into building this business and it’s been ours to lose. California has underestimated the staying power of its competitors when it comes to their desire to have a slice of Hollywood for themselves.”California remains the production leader, Sokoloski notes, but its share of the cake is down to an all-time low of just 20%. “That’s not what most people would think of when they think of Hollywood as a dominant presence in the industry. It’s very small, the smallest we’ve ever seen it, and as a result what happens to a region when the thing you’re best known for four out of five times is done somewhere else?”View image in fullscreenA firefighting helicopter drops water as the Sunset fire burns in the Hollywood Hills in January.Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesLast October, Film LA made the case that California needs a vast expansion of its film and TV tax credit to maintain its competitiveness.Stay in LA, a grassroots campaign, is pushing for action. The state governor,Gavin Newsom, has proposedmore than doubling the money allocated annually to California’s film and TV tax credit programme from $330m to $750m.Two bills are now working their way through committee in the state legislature. Some politicians warn that the tax incentives will represent a corporate giveaway to wealthy studio bosses; others argue that more importantly they are about keeping jobs in California and offering workers a wage to match the high cost of living.Mary Flynn, an actor who has noticed a drop in her auditions and work opportunities, reflects: “This is how bleak it is: we’re at a point where poor and working-class people are advocating to our government to provide tax incentives for big film studios to keep the work in California so that we can keep working because we can’t compete with Atlanta, where the minimum wage and things like that are lower. They’re taking advantage of tax opportunities but also how much they have to pay into labour.”The drive comes after a punishing few years that have included the end of the streaming boom, pandemic, strikes andwildfires. Flynn adds: “We have exhausted so many resources and even in the midst of all this at Sag-Aftra [Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists] we have video game actors still on strike.“We are very much still hurting so it’s now up to the leadership at large to do what they ran on, which is to protect work and advocate for working-class people. Every single politician that sits at the state level in California advocated on that promise so now they’ve just got to deliver.”Soon before his return to the White House, Trump described Hollywood as “a great but very troubled place” and declared that Gibson, Stallone and Voight would be his “eyes and ears”, helping to bring it back “bigger, better, and stronger than ever before!”View image in fullscreenJon Voight, Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone.Photograph: Valerie Macontimothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesBut Flynn for one is not pinning her hopes on the trio, noting that Voight has adopted “financial core” status with the Sag-Aftra, making him a fee-paying non-member who is allowed to work on both union and non-union projects. She adds: “He’s not only abandoned his fellow union brethren but any work in this town that is worth a cent is union-made; George Clooney and Tom Cruise are in Sag-Aftra, they are not fi-core.“I don’t know what someone like Jon Voight is going to do to save all of our industry when he hasn’t really been in it seriously in a minute. I highly doubt that they would be able to be our knights in shining armour. It’s not a basket I’m putting my eggs in.”Indeed, there is little sign of the promised rescue mission, with industry insiders reportedly saying it has been mostly “crickets”. The ghost of past failing metropolises persists. Last year Scott Galloway, a business school professor and podcaster,told Matthew Belloniof Puck that “LA is a much-better-weather version of Detroit right now.”Belloni comments: “There are certainly differences from what happened in Detroit where the entire manufacturing industry left, and with it, the entire business is now a shell of itself. The entertainment industry will always have some root and connection to Los Angeles because of the infrastructure that is here and by that I mean the studios and the talent agencies are not talking about upping their headquarters and moving to Nashville or London.“But he’s not wrong in the sense that the core rank-and-file middle class of the entertainment industry is being hollowed out, much like it was in Michigan. It’s never been more expensive to live here and, for many of these artists, it’s never been more difficult to find a job.”Explore more on these topicsFilm industryLos AngelesUS televisionTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

First, its ability to hold up during cooking: good pasta retains structure and form, which helps it retain flavour and digestibility, which are the second and third things I look for. If the opposite is true and the pasta is not muscular, there is a good chance it will be flabby one minute and pudding-like the next, which adversely affects flavour, digestibility and – the fourth thing I look for – its ability to hold sauce. This fourth aspect is interesting, because, while a more rustic-looking, fine sandpaper-like texture is the visibly good sauce-catcher, some apparently smoother surfaces are surprisingly good with sauce, which is why trying out different brands can be really worthwhile.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.To test, I looked at the spaghetti raw, for its colour and texture, then I cooked it according to the rule of thumb of a litre of water salted with 10g of salt for every 100g of pasta. I always bring the water to a boil, then add salt, then stir, before adding the pasta and letting it come to a boil again before starting the timer.I also cooked all the pasta according to the packet recommendations: if it offered a range of nine to 11 minutes, I did 10, setting the time for 30 seconds before to give myself enough time to get it out (at home, I usually give it a minute less than the recommended time). All dried pasta is made from a paste (dough) of hard durum wheat and water, which is extruded through holes in round plates called dies to form shapes – and, yes, itislike pressing Play-Doh through a plastic press as a child.If the packet notes “exuded through bronze”, that is what the dies were made from, and what gives the surface of the pasta texture, which is good for sauce-clinging. Teflon dies produce a smoother surface, which can also be pleasing. Have a look at your raw pasta and sniff it: some really does smell of wheat, others of wax. After being extruded, pasta shapes need drying, which is where the true art of a pasta maker lies, different shapes having different needs.The best supermarket spaghettiBest all-rounder:Barilla spaghettiView image in fullscreen£1.40 (500g) at Sainsbury’s£1.50 (500g) at Morrisons★★★★★While the strands don’t have a visibly rough texture, they do have texture once cooked and they hold sauce well, too. The suggested timing of nine minutes was spot on, and the pasta was muscular and had a really decent flavour. A standard but hugely likable and relatable pasta that works brilliantly with clams and other seafood.Best splurge:Rummo spaghettiView image in fullscreen£2.15 (500g) at Ocado£2.15 (500g) at Amazon★★★★☆Spaghetti grossi, or “big spaghetti”, with a dusty aspect and a rough texture, like salt on skin. The very specific 11-minute cooking time was accurate. Rustic is the word that comes to mind, as does chunky, which makes it feel like a pasta that dominates. Has a nice, pronounced flavour, with the wheat coming through in a way that is rare. We enjoyed this with a sausage and tomato sauce.Best bargain:Lidl Baresa spaghettiView image in fullscreen75p (500g) at Lidl★★★★☆Thin, shiny, a bit waxy and, at seven minutes, the shortest recommended cooking time, which was spot on. The right amount of firmness, lovely to wind around a fork, and a great example of how a good-value pasta cooked for the right length of time can be satisfying and rewarding. We enjoyed the rest of the packet with a smooth tomato and basil sauce.And the rest …Iceland Ragu spaghettiView image in fullscreen£1.25 (750g) at Iceland★★★★☆An almost show-off shine here, but also a pleasing texture. This was the only packet that noted the importance of boiling, not moderate heat. As recommended, we cooked it for 11 minutes, and that was spot-on, producing a firm, nicelyal dente, well-textured spaghetti – which is so pleasing because that made up for the average flavour. We cooked the rest of the packet withamatricianaand it was hugely enjoyable.De Cecco spaghettiView image in fullscreen£2 (500g) at Sainsbury’s£2 (500g) at Tesco★★★★☆Thin, slightly opaque and slightly textured makes this a slick-looking pasta. Bang on at 10 minutes –al dente, reliable. There’s maybe no great texture or deep flavour, but it’s pleasing nonetheless, if slightly waxy, which some might find appealing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The recommended cooking time of 11 minutes was fine, and it held up, just about (it was close to gummy), but on a second attempt, nine-and-a-half minutes was much better. It has a decisive, and all too often elusive, wheat flavour: very decent.M&S Made in Italy spaghettiView image in fullscreen£2.30 (500g) at Ocado★★★☆☆Nice to look at, with a slightly dusty aspect and visibly rough texture. I followed the recommended 11-minute cook time, and the pasta maintained good structure and a nutty flavour, although next time I’d pull it out after 10 minutes. The thicker strings would suit all the classic Roman pastas: carbonara, amatriciana, cacio e pepe …Sainsbury’s spaghettiView image in fullscreen75p (500g) at Sainsbury’s★★☆☆☆Very smooth and shiny to look at. The recommended cooking time is eight to 10 minutes, so I did nine. It held up relatively well to cooking, although its smoothness made it seem a bit waxy, and the lack of texture wasn’t helpful with smooth tomato sauce; a richer sauce might work better, and finely grated cheese always helps to bring things together. Had almost no flavour, though.Tesco spaghettiView image in fullscreen75p (500g) at Tesco★☆☆☆☆Very thin and almost transparent. The timing range suggested is nine to 11 minutes, so I gave it 10, after which it was overcooked, flabby and gluey.

At lunchtime, where did you sit? Did you take advantage of the smorgasbord of kids to find someone new and expand your horizons? Probably not. But that’s what Kate Freston advises you do when eating with other people. She’s a veteran of dining at Castlemaine’sCommunity Lunch– which attracts up to 150 people every Tuesday during school term time.“I used to do a quick scan around the tables and think, ‘Oh God, I hope I don’t sit next to a dud’,” she says sheepishly. “And then, you’re like … maybeI’mthe dud! Now, I really like how this crosses over into general life. You may have had a chat with 80-year-old Margaret, then you see her down the street and you may give a little wave and have a little chat.”Feeling a bit down under: Australia drops out of world’s top 10 happiest countriesRead moreFreston, a community access worker who lives with her teenage son, had been missing the communal eating she’d experienced when travelling overseas, such as in Ghana where she stayed with local families. “It was beautiful, this simple act of fostering closeness with people,” she says. “I thought, why don’t I do that here? But I guess lifestyles and schedules get in the way.”Sharing meals is the one of the best things we can do for our wellbeing, according to a report released last month. TheWorld Happiness report 2025, based on a Gallup poll of more than 150,000 people from 142 countries and territories,found that people who dine alone have the lowest life evaluation rating globally compared with those who regularly share a meal, who are happier.The benefits don’t just come from breaking bread with the townsfolk: the WorldHappinessreport focuses on eating with people we know, which may mean friends, family or housemates. According to the report, sharing meals “has a strong impact on subjective wellbeing – on par with the influence of income and unemployment. Those who share more meals with others report significantly higher levels of life satisfaction and positive affect, and lower levels of negative affect. This is true across ages, genders, countries, cultures and regions.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningGrowing up,my family only ate together once a week and we all brought a book to the table, thinking that more interesting than conversation. By contrast, my boyfriend is the youngest of seven, and all nine family members were expected to take turns telling a story while squabbling over the potatoes.Family timeFreston’s background is more like mine. “Growing up, we were pretty much forced to eat at the table, but it wasn’t like in movies. It was more ‘You’re not getting down until you finish.’ So when we got older and could rebel, we’d just eat dinner on our lap watching TV,” she says. “Now, unfortunately, my son and I don’t eat much together because we’ve got different schedules. I think not having grown up with eating at the table being a happy occasion, I’ve never tried to instil it.”Parents risk getting burnout if they worry too much about getting bums on dinner table seats every day, says Dr Georgia Middleton. A research fellow at Flinders University’s Caring Futures Institute, Middleton focusses on the social and cultural aspects of food. She thinks it’s fine to have a few meals a week that are a means to an end: getting everyone fed and back to their nightly routines. What she’s interested in is how to encourage families to share a few meals more intentionally.Go outside, ditch the phone, get humble: my top 10 Scandi life lessons after a decade in DenmarkRead more“A kinder and more beneficial way to go may be having one or two meals a week where you sit down together, with the intention of connecting with each other, connecting over the food you’re eating, communicating, sharing and bonding,” she says. “The meal may be messy, it may not be perfect, but you will have spent some dedicated time together as a family.”According to the World Happiness report, Australians share, on average, 8.5 meals per week with people they know (about 50% of our lunches and 70% of our dinners), ranking well above people in the UK and US. While the connection is strong, the report says “there remain vast gaps in our understanding of the causal dynamics” – that is, it is not yet clear whether eating together improves subjective wellbeing and social connectedness or vice versa. Nevertheless, when it comes to the strength of the association between sharing meals and wellbeing, Australia is one place where this association is the strongest – although more research needs to be done to ascertain why.“My conjecture is that in countries where individualistic culture is strong, social rituals that bring people together might be particularly important for people’s wellbeing,” says Alberto Prati, one of the authors of the report and an assistant professor in economics at University College London.Middleton says other research has indicated that prioritising personal dining preferences is more prevalent in more individualistic countries such as the US and the UK, compared with European countries such as France, Italy or Switzerland where tradition and eating together are more important. “I would say that [Australia is] a bit of a hybrid between the two, perhaps heading in the direction of more individualisation, but not quite to the same extent as the US and UK,” she says.Living aloneBut we are living more individualised lives. Single-person households are on the rise in Australia, with the 2021 census showing an increase from 18% in 1981 to 26% in 2021. Castlemaine Community Lunch is not the only initiative designed to bring together people – living alone or not – at a social meal.

Like Freston, I live in Castlemaine, and despite it being a culturally buzzing small town, I’ve resisted diving headfirst into the community. It’s that avoidant gene: what if you commit and then can’t escape?Retired school principal Vic Say, who says he is shy and an introvert, reckons it’s fine to just dip a toe in the water. “Community Lunch is valuable in being with people without necessarily having to be madly social,” he says. “As somebody who’s lived on my own for the past nine years, it creates a punctuation mark in the week.”“The food is always fabulous and very healthy and contains a lovely range of ingredients that I wouldn’t have at home,” he says.Using donated ingredients, chefDuang Tengtriratcreates a vegetarian main, two salads and a dessert each week. That makes sense – it’s likely that by sharing meals we will benefit from better nutrition. If I’m on my own I’m liable to crack an egg over instant rice to save time and money. Reviewing the literature about shared meals, the World Happiness report researchers found that adolescents who ate more meals with family members had “better diet and nutritional habits, lower levels of obesity, fewer eating disorders, and greater academic achievement”.Having settled at a trestle table with my bean bake, I suss out the room. The lunch is attended by a broad demographic, most of whom are chatting, but there’s no pressure. Freston had even advised me I could bring a book if I wanted – better than scrolling a phone, in her view.“Anyone sitting here?” a woman asks, hovering next to me.“Youare,” the woman opposite says with a smile. I was about to say that.As is human nature, I impose an entire backstory on to the woman sitting opposite, but all my preconceptions explode five minutes into our conversation. By the end of the lunch I have to admit to myself that one advantage of being a journalist is the privilege of having intense conversations with strangers but it turns out you can do that even when you’re not on the job.That night, I take a leaf from the book of my boyfriend’s family. When we sit down for dinner, he and I see who can tell the best tale from the day.Explore more on these topicsHappinessMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some of the most charming outdoor spaces have been created with hardly any budget at all – just a bit of time, a few innovative ideas and maybe the occasional raid of the recycling bin.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.British garden owners say they would consider spending up to £4,700 to create their dream outdoor space, according to Wickes’s great garden report. However, with rising costs and more people living in temporary or shared spaces, many are finding cheaper ways to create something beautiful.From composting kitchen scraps to swapping cuttings with neighbours, low-cost gardening was a top priority for readers who responded to a recent Guardian call-out for budget-friendly gardening tips. Whether you’ve got a garden, a balcony or a sunny windowsill, there is plenty you can do to bring it to life without spending a fortune.PlanningGardening can be an expensive hobby, a horticultural expert Dr Susanne Lux, says, but you can make it more cost-effective with “good planning, and by choosing hardy perennial plants which are resistant to pests and disease and will return each year.“Hardy or ‘true’ geraniums are a good choice as they can withstand winter frosts and will bloom profusely for months on end from May onwards.” You can identify hardy geraniums by their open, saucer-shaped five-petalled flowers, she says.View image in fullscreenThere are ways to make gardening more cost-effective.Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesThink about slugs, snails and other pests you want to avoid, while factoring in which plants will attract more welcome wildlife such as hedgehogs and pollinators. Geraniums, for instance, “are virtually inedible to slugs and snails”, Lux says.“This will help you save plenty of money that you’d otherwise have to invest in new plants or slug deterrents, such as copper wiring, which can be very expensive or look untidy,” she says.Geraniumsstart at £8.99 at the RHS plants shop, and seeds at B&Qgo for about £3.Digitalis, more commonly known as foxgloves, are also generally resistant to slugs and snails because of their toxicity, as are sedums because of their thick leaves.Plan out where you will plant things and use all of your space, including fences and walls, say the Chelsea flower show garden designers Freddie Strickland and Ben Gifford.“Look for opportunities to grow plants in adapted planters suitable for the walls and railings, not just on the floor. [And] don’t be intimidated by using taller plants. There are lots of wonderful plants that can add height and will work well on a small balcony,” they add.View image in fullscreenWhen planning your garden, think about which plants will attract wildlife such as hedgehogs.Photograph: Coatsey/AlamyThe Guardian reader Loz, who lives in the West Midlands, says you can create stunning and long-lasting beds in hanging baskets, which are portable and great for smaller spaces. “You can buy static hanging baskets that attach to a wall or fence, pack them with some bedding and compost that you can also buy, and fill them with beautiful little flowers … When you get practised and more skilled, you can even sell them or give them to family and friends.”PlantingGrowing plants from seeds will save you some cash. Seed packets can cost less than £1 depending on the type of plant. Or you can get seeds for free from friendly neighbours, from wildflowers on the side of the road or from plants you already own.“Collecting seeds from a previous crop is easily the cheapest way to build a seed collection,” Rosie Dunkley, a Guardian reader who lives in Sheffield, says. Something to bear in mind at the end of the growing season.To start a seed collection on the cheap, Dunkley suggests checking Freecycle, Facebook marketplace or general seed selling websites for giveaways.View image in fullscreenYou can collect seeds from a previous crop.Photograph: Tim Gainey/AlamyShe also suggests growing things from your kitchen cupboards. “If you’re growing for the love of it, try experimenting with popping corn or lentils,” she says. “These may not necessarily produce a crop depending on the initial breed but will give you green plants in the meantime.”Suzanne from Wiltshire says she “shops” in her friends’ and family’s gardens. “If there is a plant I like, I ask if I can take a cutting, or some seed heads at the end of the growing season,” she says. “I’ve had calendula seeds, nigella seeds, poppy seeds, as well as primroses (which seem to self seed everywhere), hellebore, hebe, mint, marjoram and many others.”If you don’t have the patience, or are still too nervous to start from scratch, you could buy young plants, as Suzanne does. “When I do buy my own, I always opt for smaller versions of plants, which are much cheaper. I’ve bought lots of different fuchsias for £1.50 each, which are tiny – but I’ve potted them up and kept them indoors until they are big enough to be acclimatised outside,” she says.“I don’t mind my garden taking longer to look ‘established’ if it means I can afford a variety of plants – and I get the added satisfaction of knowing I’ve nurtured them to maturity myself.”Caroline and Peter Clayton, the designers of the ME+EM City Garden at the Chelsea flower show, recommend replanting supermarket herbs. “Gently separate the crowded seedlings into clumps of two to three stems and replant them as individual plants. Give them decent light, and harvest from the top, not the sides, to encourage bushy growth.”View image in fullscreenYoghurt pots in a gardener’s shed ready to be used for planting seeds.Photograph: cstock/AlamyTo help your plants thrive, David Straker, who lives in Abergavenny, says you can often get woodchip for free if you ask a tree surgeon. “Woodchip is free from arborists who have to pay to dump it. It makes beautiful natural paths and eventually decomposes into a super soil additive.“It can also be used to mulch beds, stopping unsightly weeds and holding in moisture,” he says.ContainersTania, who lives in Swindon, turns used supermarket food containers such as used yoghurt tubs or empty grape cartons as starter pots to get seeds going. “I save these throughout the year and start my seeds in early spring in these. You can also use chocolate trays with clear lids because it keeps the temperature warmer,” she says.Rosie, who lives in Warwickshire, recommends keeping plastic milk bottles to create a mini greenhouse, which “protects seeds from elements”.Paul Jones, who is based in Lewes, fills old plastic milk bottles with water to act as radiators in his greenhouse. “The sun warms them up during the day (water is highly efficient at storing heat) and they radiate the heat out at night,” he says.Craig Hutton from Southampton says he created tall raised beds in his garden from “an old chest of drawers on its back”, and used the drawers as planters. Look out for old furniture being offered for free or cheap online.Fences and furnitureA quick way to freshen up your outdoor space is by painting any walls or fences, after filling cracks and smoothing out any messy surfaces, says Susie Worth, who lives in London.“In my experience, fences very rarely look swish, but with a fresh coat of fence paint for maybe a tenner, you could transform it,” she says. When we looked, a five-litre tub of Ronseal shed and fence paintcosts £10 at B&Q.View image in fullscreenHave you got old bits of wood lying around that could be used for raised vegetable or flower beds?Photograph: Derek Harris/AlamyTo enjoy your outside space, you will need somewhere to sit, so garden furniture should be a top priority in your garden spending. Clair Albone, a garden expert at Wickes, says you should invest in hard-wearing furniture that will last, so you don’t need to pay to replace it as often.“Opt for neutral tones, quality materials such as wood or metal, and clean, simple lines that complement your space rather than compete with it,” she says.Folding furniture is great if you have a smaller space, such as a balcony or small patio, and you can find lots of affordable options. Habitat’sEve two-seater metal bistro set is £65and has a manufacturer’s one-year guarantee. It can be folded and stored away when not in use, which can prevent unnecessary wear and tear.You can often create fences or boarded-off areas using old wood or plants. Clare Cormack, who lives in South Derbyshire, says she has saved on fences by incorporating materials she has sourced for free, or very cheaply: “Instead of buying bamboo canes, fencing and arches, create dead hedges. Build your own arches and structures using hazel or willow or any other suitable materials.”Old scaffolding boards or branches from pruned trees can also work well for fences or raised flower beds. Hutton says if you have pruned trees or shrubs, you “may have a lot of wood about that can be either cut up into sections and driven into the ground as rows of short stakes or larger pieces can be laid out flat to do the same job. It looks great, is free and is good for insect life.“The best way to cut up the wood is using a small electric saw. They have a six-inch blade and are easily handled,” he says. You can buy one for about £50. This multifunction saw from Argoscosts £45.LawnMowing your lawn according to the seasons can reduce some of the costs associated with looking after it, says Nick Ee, a product and training manager at the tool company Black+Decker.View image in fullscreenLawn maintenance varies through the seasons.Photograph: David J Green/Lifestyle/AlamySpring is usually when the first cut of the year takes place, he says, and the “rest of the season should be spent maintaining a healthy lawn, only cutting about once a week depending on growth and weather conditions”.In the summer, “a lawn cut twice a week is likely to be necessary to keep gardens looking tidy”. You can treat the lawn in autumn as you would in the spring.Winter calls for only cutting grass “occasionally if absolutely necessary”, Ee says. Finally, “never mow grass that is wet or frozen as this can cause damage to the lawn and soil as well as tools,” which will cost money in the long run.The mower you need depends on the size of your garden. “For smaller gardens, it’s not necessary to spend a lot. A basic electric mower, either corded or cordless, will usually be more than enough and very affordable,” Ee says. At Toolstation, you can get a mower from about £60.Readers suggested asking in neighbourhood chats if anyone has one to borrow, or renting one if you only plan to mow occasionally.Let it growAlternatively, you can keep costs down by letting your lawn grow wild, creating a wildflower meadow.“Allocating a portion of your lawn to wildflowers is a fantastic way to reduce both maintenance and costs, while also supporting biodiversity,” Ee says. “It not only cuts down on mowing but also adds a beautiful, natural feel to your outdoor space.”To keep it looking tidy and balanced, he suggests using a strimmer to trim some of the longer grass without disrupting the wildflower growth.Other eco-friendly lawn options are clover lawns, or adding in mulch or gravel.Explore more on these topicsGardensSaving moneyHome improvementsConsumer affairsSeedsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The approach – oral immunotherapy – is already successfully used in children and is among a wave of treatments on the horizon aimed at reducing the burden of allergies – and potentially curing them.“Up until 15 years ago we never offered anything other than complete avoidance and carry your epinephrine,” says Prof Robert Wood, the director of paediatric allergy and immunology at Johns Hopkins University. “Now we have options.”The surge of interest in treating allergies has been motivated, in part, by an unprecedented rise in prevalence. Food anaphylaxis admissions to UK hospitals increased threefold from 1998 to 2018,according to one analysis, and the number of people affected by less severe allergies has alsorisen significantly, with factors including weaning practices, detergents and lack of childhood contact with dirt and animals all potential drivers of the trend.Exposure as treatment is not a new idea: the first successful use of oral immunotherapy for a 13-year-old boy with egg allergy wasreported in The Lancet in 1908. But in the past decade, scientists have developed the incremental dosing protocols required to move this concept into the clinic. The licensing of the drug Palforzia – pharmaceutical-grade peanut protein – means the treatment can now be delivered to those whose allergies are extreme enough that a few milligrams too much peanut protein could trigger anaphylaxis.The treatment regimes are intensive, requiring fortnightly dosage escalations and a level of clinical supervision that has resulted in paediatric NHS waiting lists of several years. And, for most, they are not a cure – patients have an increased tolerance to low doses, but need to maintain daily exposure and are still considered allergic.“The issue with eating a peanut every day is that you’re on a bit of a tightrope,” says Prof Graham Roberts, an allergy specialist at the University of Southampton. “You might still have a life-threatening allergic reaction.”There is also a growing cohort of patients managing multiple allergies, for whom the approach is impractical. “That’s where the advantage of treatments that are completely agnostic to the food you’re allergic to comes in,” says Wood.Food allergies normally involve a class of potent antibodies, called IgEs, that bind to immune cells 1,000 times more tightly than other classes of antibody and which scientists think originally evolved to protect the body from parasites. Now, largely redundant in modern lifestyles, they have a weakness for misfiring in response to food proteins.In alandmark study last year, Wood and his colleagues found that the anti-IgE drug omalizumab, already licensed for severe asthma, could desensitise people to peanut, cashew, milk, egg, walnut, wheat and hazelnut allergies (participants were allergic to at least three) by mopping up the antibodies.The treatment is “not without some burden”, Wood acknowledges, requiring ongoing fortnightly injections of a drug with an annual list price of between$30,000 and $60,000. But it can be life-changing for those who need to avoid pervasive products such as milk, eggs and wheat. “Those families don’t travel without a cooler full of food,” Wood says. “They can’t eat out. They can’t trust anyone to prepare anything for their child. Your day-to-day life is massively compromised.”New products in the pipeline could further lower the bar for treatment, including apeanut allergy vaccine candidatebeing developed by the Australian biotech firm Aravax (the phase 2 trial still involved monthly injections) and apeanut patchdeveloped by the French company DBV that recently showed promising results in a three-year trial. Both promise a less gruelling and safer treatment regime, with lower chances of severe reactions during dose escalation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While immunotherapy does not reverse most food allergies, for bee stings it has a higher than 90% cure rate. Prof Markus Ollert, of the Luxembourg Institute ofHealth, tracked patients treated for bee sting allergies and revealed that a molecule called interleukin-6 appears to act as a switch in the transition from being allergic to tolerant.Others are focused on trying to prevent allergies arising in the first place. A primary culprit for the rise in allergies appears to have been misguided medical advice in the 1990s that parents should avoid giving babies foods such as peanuts in the first year of life. “Since then we’ve seen an absolute explosion in allergies,” says Roberts.In a randomised trial, he and colleagues found that introducing peanuts into the diet at four months led to an 80% reduction in allergies. Another, more recent study, found large reductions in peanut, egg, wheat and cows’ milk allergies when introduced to babies from three months of age. However, despite iron-clad evidence that early introduction is protective, it has proved difficult to undo warnings around the dangers of introducing peanuts too early and change parents’ behaviour.Explore more on these topicsAllergiesHealthChildrenFoodPharmaceuticals industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the weather is wilful and the air can turn chilly in a flash, and it’s this in-between time when soothing braises made with lighter ingredients are just what’s needed. I recently found a recipe for an Iranian chicken stew recipe that paired carrots and yoghurt, and its sunniness really appealed to me; I added cardamom for its evocative scent and chickpeas for body, and it was demolished by the troops. Pudding had to be simple, and both the biscuits and poached apricots can be made a few days ahead, so it is also blissfully easy. A lovely spring lunch for a lazy, sun-soaked day.Cardamom chicken braised with sweet onions, chickpeas and saffron yoghurt (pictured top)Beautifully scented, yellow-stained chicken that is as lovely served at room temperature as it is warm.Prep20 minCook1 hr 15 minServes6Sea salt and black pepper1 medium chicken, jointed, or use 8 chicken thighs, if you prefer3 tbsp olive oil30g butter2 large onions, peeled and thinly sliced4 celery stalks, finely chopped4 large carrots, cut at an angle into chunks4garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced2 tsp green cardamomseeds1 tbsp cumin seeds1 tsp black peppercorns500g drained jarred or tinned chickpeas1 small bunch fresh thyme, leaves picked300ml chicken stock2 large pinches saffron threads, toasted, crushed and steeped in 3 tbsp boiling water200ml yoghurt½ lemon1small bunch fresh parsley, leaves picked and roughly choppedCouscous or rice, to serveSeason the chicken all over, and put a large casserole pan on a high heat. Once it’s good and hot, add half the oil, then brown the chicken pieces, in batches, if need be, until golden all over. Transfer the browned chicken to a large bowl.Turn down the heat, add the remaining oil and all the butter, then gently fry the onion and celery for 10-12 minutes. Season with salt, then stir in the carrots and garlic.Meanwhile, toast the cardamom, cumin and peppercorns in a small frying pan until fragrant. Crush the spices, then stir them into the vegetables and cook for five minutes more.Return the browned chicken legs, thighs and wings (or all the thighs, if using those) to the pan, add the chickpeas and thyme, pour in the stock and two-thirds of the saffron liquid, and bring to a boil. Turn the heat right down to a very gentle simmer, then leave to cook for 12-14 minutes.Stir in the chicken breasts and cook for a further 12-14 minutes, or until the thighs are cooked through.Mix the remaining saffron water with the yoghurt and season with a little salt and pepper. Squeeze the lemon juice into the chicken, taste and adjust the seasoning, and serve with the yoghurt, parsley and some couscous (large, for preference) or rice.Rosewater apricots with pistachio butter biscuitsView image in fullscreenThomasina Miers’ rosewater apricots with pistachio butter biscuits.Ludicrously simple, but nonetheless delicious. Try serving the apricots with different ice-creams: pistachio, hazelnut, and vanilla are all great.Prep5 minChill1 hrCook1 hrServes660g golden caster sugar250g dried apricots2 drops rosewaterZest of1 lemon, pared off in wide strips (use a vegetable peeler), plus the juice of ½ lemon1 tsp vanilla bean pasteFor the biscuits80g pistachios, plus a few extra, roughly chopped, to finish125g softened unsalted butter70g caster sugar175g plain flour2 tsp fennel seeds½ tsp sea saltTo serveWhipped cream, greek yoghurtor ice-creamRoughly chopped pistachiosPut 350ml cold water and the sugar in a small pan on a medium heat and, once the sugar has dissolved, add the apricots, rosewater, pared lemon skin and vanilla, and simmer for 25 minutes. Off the heat, stir in the juice of half the lemon, then leave to cool in the pan.To make the biscuits, blitz the pistachios in a food processor to light crumbs – this should only take a few pulses; you want a mostly ground texture, but with some chunks. Using an electric whisk (or a hand whisk), cream the butter and sugar, then add the flour, fennel seeds and salt, and gently bring the dough together. Add the blitzed pistachios, shape the dough into a sausage, then wrap and refrigerate for an hour.Try this recipe and many more of Tommi’s creations on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, and line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper. Take the biscuit dough out of the fridge and cut it into 5mm-thick rounds – you should have 16-18. Arrange on the tray spaced slightly apart, bake for 15 minutes, or until the biscuits are very slightly starting to turn golden, then remove and leave to cool.Serve the apricots with some lightly whipped cream, ice-cream or thick yoghurt, and topped with some roughly chopped pistachios and the biscuits alongside for some welcome crunch. The apricots can be kept in their poaching liquid in the fridge for up to a week – I love them for breakfast.Explore more on these topicsFoodThomasina Miers recipesChickenMeatVegetablesFruitDessertMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

We already have one for a cleaner, so what’s the difference?Living in a shared house with Raheem and one other flatmate is a bit of a balancing act with splitting bills, dishes, and deciding who gets the good shelf in the fridge. But now we’re in a moral and financial standoff over grass.Our house has a decent-sized front and back lawn which is the landlord’s responsibility. Except now they’ve decided to let nature reclaim it. The grass is out of control, weeds are creeping up – it looks awful.I want to cut the lawn myself but that means buying a lawnmower and maybe a strimmer. Raheem is vehemently against paying for any of it. He says it’s not our house or our responsibility. He only moved in last year, so I get it. But I want to have barbecues in the summer, and walk to my front door without it feeling as if I’m entering Narnia.Raheem said we should delay doing the work ourselves for as long as possible. But by that point the weeds will be even worseI think we should make a house fund for garden stuff. We already have one for a cleaner, so what’s the difference? Raheem is dragging his heels and saying “grass-cutting is the landlord’s job”, which I know, but surely we can take some initiative? I’ve been here five years, and I don’t remember the grass ever being this long. It’s spring now, so it’s going to get worse. The landlord has come over to trim it before, but now he is living abroad and won’t answer our emails. I tried mentioning it via text and he just pointed out that he hadn’t raised the rent since I moved in, as if I’m supposed to be grateful.So now I’m stuck between wanting to prioritise my living space and not wanting to do free work for someone who doesn’t care. My other housemate says she will just go with the majority.Last week, Raheem said we should keep pressuring the landlord and delay doing it ourselves for as long as possible, and that only if we don’t get an answer by June should go ahead and do it ourselves. But by that point the weeds and grass will be even worse.It’s really unfair that I have to put this much effort into a house that I don’t own, but it is my home. I don’t think the landlord is going to do much and we might as well enjoy our summer now, which means not wading through weeds when we go outside.The defence: RaheemThe house is not our responsibility. We have a contract which says the landlord handles the gardensEven when you’ve found a “good” landlord, issues still crop up. I found this house last year after moving out of an awful, overcrowded place, and things have been smooth until now. I like it here and get on well with Eleanor, but I’m not attached to the place. She’s been here five years and so there’s some sentimentality.But the house is not our responsibility. We have a contract which says the landlord handles the gardens. He’s in the wrong – I’m not about to reward that by shelling out money for a lawnmower just to make their property look nice. I don’t care much about using the garden in summer. I’d rather go to the park.And we’re not just talking about doing a quick tidy-up with a pair of shears. She’s asking me to split the cost of a machine, find somewhere to store it, and take on a chore that’s officially not our job. What if it breaks? What if the landlord gets used to us doing it and never lifts a finger again?I’m all for enjoying our summer. But I’d rather do that without dropping cash on a lawnmower for a lawn that isn’t oursI care about living in a decent place too. But I can live with things looking like Jurassic Park for a bit because I can’t afford to spend £100 on garden equipment and hours of my time doing a job I hate. I’ve never had a garden before. I don’t even know how to weed, and I’m just not interested. I care more about not setting a precedent that says: “If you ignore your responsibilities for long enough, we’ll handle it for you.”I think we should keep emailing the landlord as a house and attach pictures of the growth. Eleanor wants me to put the pressure on because I’m the newest, but surely we’re stronger as a unit? I believe there are proper channels for all this and we don’t need to suddenly become part-time groundskeepers just because the landlord is slacking.I’m all for enjoying our summer too. But I’d rather do that without dropping cash on a lawnmower for a lawn that isn’t ours. I don’t think anyone can force me into paying for that and our third housemate is kind of on my side. But if Eleanor wants to spend money on the garden herself, then she can go ahead and do that.The jury of Guardian readersShould Raheem cut it out and chip in?Raheem is not guilty: he’s right to point out that their contracts say the landlord is responsible for the gardens. But this situation does need compromise. Could they push the landlord to buy a mower and strimmer for the house, which Eleanor could then use while he’s away?Sophy, 44Raheem is right: it’s not the tenants’ responsibility and they shouldn’t have to pay for it. Pester the landlord! Failing that, ask a neighbour if you can borrow a lawnmower or look on a website for your area like nextdoor.co.uk.Janina, 57While I sympathise with Eleanor, I think it’s fair for Raheem to not want to spend money on something he’d be happy to forgo. It’s not the ideal situation, but Eleanor should respect his preference. They should find an effective way to continue pressuring the landlord.Tiffany, 23Don’t fork out for this. Is the landlord part of the Housing Ombudsman Scheme? Is there a property manager or agent? Besides, letting the grass grow will be great for local wildlife: you want it at least knee-high to encourage bugs, which will then feed the birds.Oliver, 41Eleanor, I understand your yearning for a hot sausage on a barbecue, but Raheem is right – if you go through with your plans it will be you getting burnt. If your contract says the garden is the landlord’s responsibility, you need to stand firm. Perhaps withholding rent will get you faster results?Shaun, 35Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: should Raheem agree to help buy a lawnmower?The poll closes on Thursday 1 May at 10am BSTLast week’s resultsRita missed her dad’s birthday meal– we asked if she should still pay her share.49%of you said yes –Rita is guilty51%of you said no –Rita is not guiltyExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeRelationshipsFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This albino toad was produced by a team of scientists with one foot in a Sydney university laboratory and the other in a research station on the vast tropical savannahs and wetlands far away to the north near Humpty Doo.It was September 2023 and for the man who dreamed it into being, the toad was but an opening act in a radical new play against one of the world’s worst invasive species.The molecular biologist Maciej Maselko was stunned by how quickly the team was able to successfully inject a cane toad egg with a mixture of proteins and RNA to knock out a gene needed for pigmentation.“I was astonished,” the Macquarie University associate professor says.“I mean, I knew it was technically feasible, but we got – within a few months – as far as I hoped we would get within, maybe, two years. Basically, one of our very first attempts at genetically engineering the cane toads worked.”This, however, was just stage one in the plan put to Maselko – meant only to prove “the capabilities necessary” for stage two. Because the injected tadpoles, normally jet black, were instead pure white, it was immediately obvious that the scientists could, indeed, useCrispr-Cas9 gene-editing technologyon cane toads.Cane toads will literally breed in a puddleProf Rob CaponWhat they would produce next was a tadpole that – should eggs dream – would belong to a cane toad’s most diabolical of nightmares. They called it Peter Pan – and it was a “super cannibal”.But while Maselko and the likes of post-doctoral researcher Michael Clark brought the genetic engineering expertise needed to execute the plan, it was not one of which they had conceived.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsMacquarie University’s Prof Rick Shine, an evolutionary biologist, ecologist and author of Cane Toad Wars,has dedicated much of his life to devising novel strategies in the ecological defence against the toads. In 2016, hewon the prime minister’s prize for sciencefor teaching quolls and goannas not to eat the invading amphibians by feeding them cane toad sausages.That year he also won the New South Wales scientist of the year award for developing pheromone traps that lure cane toad tadpoles using the toad’s own poison.“The Peter Pan approach is definitely [Shine’s] baby,” Maselko says.By knocking out a single gene in toad eggs, the scientists produced hatchlings unable to metamorphose beyond tadpoles, hence their likening to the boy who wouldn’t grow up.View image in fullscreenEvolutionary biologist and ecologist Rick Shine hopes his ‘Peter Pan’ approach could help control the cane toad’s spread.Photograph: Terri ShineSo how does this tale turn from fantasy to – for a cane toad at least – horror? The answer lies in its brief but storied Australian history.The cane toad was introduced in 1935 in an effort to stop native beetles devastating sugar cane crops. An utter failure as a biological control, it was spectacularly successful as an invasive species.The toads now number more than 200 million, having conquered the entire east coast of Queensland, swept across the tropical north, and are now marching down Australia’s west coast. Along the way they have devastated big predators naive to their deadly toxins, from lizards more than 1 metre long to freshwater crocodiles, marsupial carnivores to king brown snakes.‘Toadbusters’ take on exploding cane toad population in Queensland with gloves, bucket and torchRead more“The history of biocontrol is littered with failures,” Shine says. “But the introduction of cane toads to Australia is one of the classic examples of a truly stupid decision.”Shine has spent time in the toad’s native South American range. There, kept in check by parasites and co-evolved predators, and in competition with similar species, the cane toad can be “hard to find”.Largely freed of these population checks in Australia, it thrives in such “fantastic abundance” that a cane toad’s greatest threat to its growing up is tens of thousands of other rival cane toads.“If you are a cane toad tadpole and a female toad comes along and lays 20,000 eggs in your little pond, there are going to be 20,000 hungry mouths all trying to eat exactly the same stuff that you need,” Shine says.Over years of observation and research, the ecologist and his team learned Australian tadpoles have responded by becoming irresistibly attracted to the scent of cane toad eggs, which they devour before the competition can hatch.“We’ve discovered that the toads have evolved to be voracious cannibals in the course of their Australian invasion,” he says.According to the team’s field studies, 99% of cane toad eggs are eaten in ponds that already have tadpoles – meaning eggs have next to no chance of survival until those tadpoles metamorphose and leave.But would the Peter Pans share that taste for toad egg? Shine and his wife, Terri, address this question ona website they run to document the work.“To our delight they are super cannibals – they eat about four times as many eggs as a normal tadpole,” they say on the site.View image in fullscreenA Peter Pan cane toad tadpole eating newly laid toad eggs.Photograph: Etienne LittlefairShine says that unable to transform into toads, his Peter Pans grow larger and exist as tadpoles for as long as three months, as opposed to – under ideal conditions – fewer than three weeks.Which means that if Peter Pans were put into a pond, they might eat just about every single egg laid in it for an entire breeding season. Then, unable to metamorphose, they too would die.Much work remains before any “widescale deployment in the field” of gene-edited tadpoles. The team must master mass producing Peter Pans, assess their impacts, publish results and earn a social licence.To that end, Shine insists, the Peter Pan “is no Franken-toad”.Maselko stresses that the tadpoles are not produced by crossing genes from different species – transgenics – but simply by disrupting a gene already present in their DNA.“Peter Pan tadpoles are really exciting because all you’re doing is releasing some organisms into the wild that are sterile … [and have] mutations that will happen in the wild, naturally, anyway,” he says.Cane toads’ spread through Western Australia’s Kimberley revealed by motion sensor camerasRead moreThe University of Queensland’s Prof Rob Capon worked for about a decade with Shine to develop the cane toad tadpole trapsnow being rolled out around the country.Not involved in the Peter Pan project, the organic chemist applauds Shine and his collaborators for “having the imagination to try” what is, he says, “a technical achievement in its own right”.But – given the “imponderable cascade” of effects that can occur when interfering with an ecosystem – he says Shine’s team must prove that releasing Peter Pans into the wild would bring benefits that outweigh any risks.And Capon tempers any expectation that the cane toad can ever be eradicated. Getting a Peter Pan tadpole in every water body in northern Australia, for example, would be a “near herculean task”.“Cane toads will literally breed in a puddle,” Capon says.No one is more aware of the scale of the cane toad challenge than Shine. But by the end of next year, he hopes to have “very convincing data” behind his Peter Pans.And as the research continues in earnest, Shine is permitting himself a rare sensation in the fight against invasive species in Australia.He remains steady and determined, but feels the glimmer of optimism.“We’re going to go slowly,” Shine says. “We want to get it right. We don’t run into those mistakes that people get by hurtling in and playing God with ecosystems.”Explore more on these topicsInvasive speciesAnimalsGene editingBiologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In at least one of those goals, Kennedy has been expeditious.Experts said as Kennedy makes major cuts in public health in his first weeks in office, the infrastructure built to mitigateCovid-19has become a clear target – an aim that has the dual effect of weakening immunization efforts as the US endures the largest measles outbreaksince 2000.“If his goal is to undermine public health infrastructure, he’s making strides there,” said Dorit Reiss, a University of California Law School professor whose research focuses on vaccine law. “If his goal is combating chronic diseases – he’s not doing very well.”The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been characterized by upheaval since Kennedy and the billionaireElon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) cumulatively axed 20,000 jobs – roughly a quarter of the 82,000-person workforce.And it appears that turmoil will continue: a leaked budget memo shows the administration poised to propose a budget cut of another$40bn, or roughly one-third of the department’s discretionary spending.Amid the cuts, attacks on Covid-19 infrastructure have proven thematic, and show the administration’s hostility toward work that once mitigated the virus. That’s included attackingpromising vaccine platformsand elevating once-ostracized voices to high-level roles.“The Covid-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,” a spokesperson for HHS told the Guardian in response to questions about its strategy.“HHS is prioritizing funding projects that will deliver on President Trump’s mandate to address our chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”Gregg Gonsalves, a Yale University associate professor and infectious disease epidemiologist, calls this strategy the “revenge of the Covid contrarians”.“They’re not interested in the science, they’re interested in their conclusions and having the science bend to their will,” said Gonsalves. “They want to create a Potemkin village of their own making that looks like science but has nothing to do with science at all.”Among Kennedy’s changes: attacks on the promising platform that supported Covid-19 vaccine development, delayed approval of a Covid-19 vaccine, the clawing back of grants that provided local immunization support and studied vaccine safety, and elevating one-time critics of Covid-19 policy.“When the new administration came in, we were hearing even within the organization: ‘We can’t say Covid, we’re not allowed to say Covid,’” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials (Naccho), about her members’ conversations.Freeman noted that “we kind of saw the writing on the wall a couple months ago that: ‘OK, they really don’t want anything Covid-related to be pursued any more.’ Everything Covid-related is quite honestly at risk.”In the latest change, Kennedy said this week he may remove Covid-19 shots from the childhood vaccine schedule, which would probably make the shots harder to get by limiting insurance coverage.“The recommendation for children was always dubious,” Kennedy toldFox News. Although aminorityof children are vaccinated, the shotsare recommended, especially for immune-compromised children.Freeman believes the desire to erase the government’s Covid legacy led to HHS’s decision to claw back$11bnin public health funds from states and localities. In effect done overnight, the clawback gave local officials only hours to lay off workers, cancel immunization clinics and even stop construction projects.“That’s why we feel like the drawback of the funding occurred: Covid,” said Freeman.A spokesperson for HHS characterized this as a savings, and said most canceled awards were for Covid-19-related work.The pullback led to the cancellation of more than50 measles immunization clinics in Texas, where the measles outbreak has already claimed the lives of two unvaccinated children, to pilot programs such as “Text4Vax”, which sent reminders about pediatric vaccines to parents.Among the canceled grants were also programs that would seem to align with Kennedy’s rhetoric about vaccine safety – among them, a study of the safety and effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant women in California and global Covid-19 vaccine safety monitoring in New Zealand.“If you start to take away people from health departments – the immunizers, the educators, the clinicians – through some of these other funding cuts , it disables the program naturally,” said Freeman. “You can’t put as many shots in arms.”Larger cancelled grants included a$2.25bn grantprogram to reduce Covid-19’s impact on the people worst affected, which had been sent to states and localities from South Dakota to Florida and the Virgin Islands to Vermont.Under Kennedy’s watch, HHS has also taken the unusual step of delaying an expected vaccine approval, reportedly under the watch of a Kennedy political appointee.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which sits under the umbrella of HHS,delayedthe expected 1 April approval of the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine. Novavax confirmed to the Guardian that its application remained on hold, and said it would have “no further comments”.Reiss said she doesn’t think “any vaccine that’s in the pipeline is going to go forward under Kennedy” or that “he will let any vaccine go far now”.Dr Tracy Hoeg, a political appointee, wasreportedly involvedin the decision. Hoeg also appeared as the FDA’s representative at a special advisory committee on immunizations in April, where she took the opportunity toquestion the efficacyof Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine.An HHS spokesperson told the Guardian: “The FDA’s independent review process for the Novavax vaccine, like all vaccines, is based solely on ensuring safety and efficacy, not political considerations. Any delays are a result of scientific review, not a lack of priority. It’s important to focus on the facts rather than unfounded speculation.”Scientists have also said they fear for the future ofmessenger RNA(mRNA) vaccine technology – the platform that underpinned the fast development of Covid-19 vaccines and that held promise for treating and preventing a wide range of diseases.Hoeg served on Florida’spublic health integrity committee, which served as a platform for Covid-19 criticism during the pandemic. At the time, it was chaired by the Florida surgeon general, Dr Joseph Ladapo, who has also sown doubt about the safety and efficacy ofmRNA vaccines.Experts fear rise in diseases as layoffs halt health research: ‘Incredibly bizarre gaslighting’Read moreHoeg could be further buttressed by insiders such as Dr Matthew Memoli, who,Kennedy said, “is going to be running Niaid [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]”.Memoli, whom Kennedy described as “the top flu researcher at NIH”, is known for opposition to Covid-19 vaccine mandates and declined to be vaccinated.In March, Memoli sent an email to NIH grant officials requiring any grant applications that reference mRNA technology to be reported to Kennedy’s office. He also canceled government-backed studies on vaccine hesitancy.Thenomineefor HHS general counsel, Michael B Stuart, is also well-known for involvement in vaccine fights. Stuart, a former West Virginia lawmaker, in 2023 proposed a bill to exempt virtual public school students from vaccine requirements and allow private schools to set their own requirements, according toStat.“Dismantling the sort of vaccine infrastructure this country relies upon – that’s been in place for several dozens and dozens of years – only impacts the chronic disease front he’s trying to ameliorate as well,” said James Hodge, a professor of law at Arizona State University and a health law expert who said he worries about the future of vaccine advisory committees. “Acquiring infectious diseases leads to chronic conditions later.”Still, some of Kennedy’s most ardent supporters and reported informal advisers, such as theformer cardiologistPeter McCullough, have argued these actions don’t go far enough.“The big threat is that we still have Covid-19 vaccines on the market,” McCullough toldKFF Health News. “It’s horrendous. I would not hesitate – I would just pull it. What’s he waiting for?” McCullough did not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian.Explore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrInfectious diseasesCoronavirusTrump administrationUS politicsHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Valerie’s owners, Georgia Gardner and Josh Fishlock, are said to be “over the moon”.How the trap was setThe Kangaroo Island-based wildlife rescuers designed a special cosy trap – complete with a webcam and remote trigger system – to lure Valerie in.Kangala describedit as “like her own little room with her toys and bed from home, mum’s clothing, hidden food and challenges to keep her entertained”.Over about a fortnight, they gradually added familiar items, starting with Valerie’s toy.While the dachshund didn’t recognise things immediately, these were little moments “clicking her back into calmness”.“So she grabbed the toy and thrashed it around.”Later, they added “more and more” strips of a T-shirt worn for 12-hour shifts by her owner, Georgia.View image in fullscreenKangala Wildlife Rescue posted images of Valerie at large on Kangaroo Island.Photograph: Kangala Wildlife RescueHow Valerie was finally caughtOnce Valerie was comfortable coming in and out of the trap, it was just a matter of waiting for her to return and be in the right position, Jared said. “We finally got that opportunity.”The tiny 4kg dog came in and rummaged around for hidden food stashes, eventually ending up in the back corner of the cage.At that moment, Jared pressed the button and remotely dropped the door. “Thankfully it all worked perfectly.”He said Valerie handled her capture well, she “took it in her stride”. And, after initially running around, trying to find ways out, she went into her crate and took a nap.“She just curled up and went to sleep.”Are there any concerns for her welfare?The Kangala team expected Valerie to be in survival mode – called “lost dogs syndrome” – a stress response that helps a dog fend for itself.“Her mental health was one of the biggest components we were worried about,” Lisa said.Along with the familiar items and scents, the rescuers were careful to take things slowly once Valerie was in the trap.“Normal things, like houses, humans, scents, other animals. These are all things that need to be reintroduced and relearnt.”Lisa said she wore Georgia’s T-shirt down to the cage. “The idea is just to sit,” she said. “Don’t make direct eye contact. Have your posture either lying down or shrugged or low, and you just wait.”Amazingly, Valerie didn’t shy away. “She was up at the front, barking and communicating with us.”Valerie’s first mealFood was also a big thing, Lisa said.“Of course, we had her favourites – roast chicken and her favourite dog food as well – they were the first things to help her recognise that we were safe and that we were not a threat.”What was it like meeting Valerie in real life?“She looks quite big on the camera. When I saw her in real life, she is tiny. She’s got, like, an inch clearance under her belly, tiny little legs,” Jared said.Now out of the cage, Valerie was wearing a special “escape proof” harness, to make sure she didn’t slip away again.When will she be reunited with her owners?Valerie’s owners, Georgia and Josh, were said to be “over the moon” when they heard the news their dog was secured and would be home soon.First, there would be at least a week on the island for Valerie to decompress.“We want to return her to her beautiful owners the best way possible, and not cause her any more trauma or stress. Because undoubtedly out there in 16 months she would have gone through a lot.”Explore more on these topicsValerie the dachshundAustralian climate and environment in focusKangaroo IslandSouth AustraliaWildlifeexplainersShareReuse this content"

On the video call, she said, the dean told her that she would be suspended for one semester for staging a protest at the college’s trustees’ dinner in December 2023. Using a bullhorn, EK had interrupted the event todemandthat the school divest from products that fuelIsrael’swaronGaza.A panel of students and school employees had found her responsible for assault, among other code of conduct violations for the incident. EK, a final-semester senior who is using a pseudonym out of fear of retaliation, recalled being in shock: “I’ve been really distraught by all of this,” EK said. “I used to be unhoused before I came to Swarthmore, so to be put into this situation again is very disturbing.”She filed an appeal in mid-March and remained in campus housing until the school came to a decision on 10 April. A first-generation, low-income college student on financial aid, EK had been forbidden from campus housing pending the appeal decision, and lost crucial finances when she was let go from her school job. She said she also fears she may be vulnerable to attacks from theTrump administration, which haspenalized pro-Palestinian protesters: “I’m worried that this is not the end, and only the beginning, especially now that it’s on my record. It could be the case that I could face further punitive measures from the federal government, and the college is not doing anything to protect students.”I’m worried that this is not the end, and only the beginningEK, Swarthmore College studentIn March, the Trump administration listed Swarthmore College asone of 60 schoolsat risk of losing hundreds of millions of federal dollars for allowing what it considered antisemitic harassment on campus. Colleges and universities across the country were alreadyquashingpro-Palestinian protests by suspending and arresting students, and severalrevisedtheir policies to ban encampments prior to Trump’s inauguration. But some have gone even further to penalize students in light of the government’s threats to pull their funding.In some cases, those preventive measures have been for naught. Columbia announced that itexpelled studentswho occupied a building last year and revoked alumnis’ diplomas at the same time the federal government stillcancelled $400mworth of contracts and grants to the university. Harvard University placed the undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee onprobationand temporarily banned the pro-Palestinian group from hosting events, only for the Trump administration tofreeze $2.2bnin federal grants to the school two weeks later.Though Columbia and Harvard have received the most attention for their responses to activists, campus crackdowns have been widespread. The Guardian spoke to 1o student protesters in Pennsylvania, California, Wisconsin and New York who have faced disciplinary action from their colleges and universities. They said that the process is often arbitrary and marked by fear tactics aimed to discourage them from protesting in the future. Building a defense for disciplinary hearings, they said, distracted them from their studies and caused anxiety, as the processes can last months.Why Trump’s brutal crackdown on free speech is unprecedented in the USRead moreIn some cases, the disciplinary process has no conclusive end, causing students to languish while being banned from campus or otherwise limited from participating in student life. Following pushback from students and faculty, EK said, Swarthmore College agreed to pay for her off-campus housing until the end of the semester. She is taking virtual classes and will be allowed to graduate on time, but she is still barred from attending on-campus events or from walking with her peers during graduation.In a statement to the Guardian, Swarthmore College spokesperson Alisa Giardinelli said that the school repeatedly warned student protesters that their actions were in violation of the college’s code of conduct, and that they would face disciplinary action if found responsible. Despite the college’s efforts to discuss the students’ demands, including that the school divest from weapons manufacturers that fuel Israel’s war on Gaza, “some students chose to continue to engage in – and in some cases escalated – behaviors that violated the Code”, Giardinelli said.Guardian interviews with student activists, attorneys and researchers reveal an increased sense of hostility on campuses since 7 October 2023, which has stoked fear and anxiety and resulted in financial concerns for some pro-Palestinian student protesters. Some attorneys have said that Palestinians, Arab Muslims, and people of color have been universities’ primary targets when repressing pro-Palestinian free speech. In March, the federal government went even further in targeting pro-Palestinian scholars and students of color by arresting and detaining the Georgetown University professorBadar Khan Suriand the Columbia graduate studentMahmoud Khalil.“A majority of students who are contacting us for support are either Palestinian, Arab Muslim or other students of color,” said the advocacy group Palestine Legal’s staff attorney, Tori Porell. Additionally, low-income students or those who rely on financial aid are hardest hit by disciplinary actions, she said: “Students who live on campus might rely on campus meal plans. If they are abruptly suspended, they are losing access to housing, to their food, to healthcare, and they might not have funds to just fly home the way some students with more resources would.”If students are abruptly suspended, they are losing access to housing, to their food, to healthcareTori Porell, Palestine LegalIn 2024, Palestine Legal receivedmore than 2,000requests for legal assistance, with about two-thirds coming from students, staff or faculty on college campuses.While schools have long served as stages for mass protests including against the Vietnam war and South Africa’s apartheid, activists say that the universities’ actions toward them have had a chilling effect on civil disobedience this academic year. Still, students such as Dahlia Saba, a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, see it as their duty to continue pushing universities to divest from Israel, whose war on Gaza has killed at least62,000 Palestinianssince October 2023.US student journalists go dark fearing Trump crusade against pro-Palestinian speechRead moreSaba was at a conference in Colorado last July when she received a concerning text message from her schoolmate Vignesh Ramachandran. The two were being investigated by the University of Wisconsin-Madison for a May 2024op-edthat they had written in a local publication. The article criticized the university’s failure to respond to a student-ledproposalaround transparent and ethical investment, and demanded that it divest from arms-manufacturing companies fueling Israel’s war on Gaza.She pulled up an email from the university about the charges that she faced, which included allegedly refusing to comply with rules about no picnicking or camping. (Wisconsin state statuteprohibitstents or camping on undesignated parts of university land.) Saba, a graduate student in electrical engineering, recalled her thoughts in that moment: would the charges jeopardize her career, or prevent her from being vocal about Palestinian rights in the future?“For me, it’s still important to speak up,” Saba, a Palestinian American, told the Guardian, “because the point of these repression tactics is to try to silence us. And so I think that makes it all the more imperative to refuse to be silenced.”A ‘Palestine exception’ to free speechSince October 2023, many schools have responded to pro-Palestinian campus protests in an outsized way compared with demonstrations going back several decades, say attorneys. In aHarvard Crimsonseries, 11 former student activists said that Harvard’s response to pro-Palestinian protesters had been more violent and punitive than the treatment they experienced for protesting againstSouth Africa’s apartheid, againstfossil fuel divestment, and for university workers to bepaidliving wages.Race, combined with political viewpoints about being pro-Palestinian, are the targets of the most severe punishmentThomas Harvey, attorneyRace and political views may account for universities’ stricter policies and punishments since last year. Pointing to the Orange county district attorney’s list of people who had been suspended and arrested, Thomas Harvey, a California attorney who represents pro-Palestinian students facing criminal charges, said: “It’s very rare that it’s anyone other than people of color.” Harvey said he knows many of the students on the district attorney’s list because he’s represented them or provided them pro bono legal support. “It seems very obvious that race, combined with political viewpoints about being pro-Palestinian, are the targets of the most severe punishment.”UT, a Muslim woman of color and Swarthmore College senior, said that she was alarmed to learn how closely the college surveilled her during pro-Palestinian protests. On 6 March 2025, UT, who is using her initials out of fear of being doxxed, received an email from the school that she would be on academic probation until she graduated for violating the college’s code of conduct during rallies between October 2023 and March 2024. Last spring, she received a packet from the university on the evidence they had against her, including CCTV footage of her walking on a path next to the woods on campus.“It was a real moment of realization that there is so much surveillance on this campus, and especially out of the students that were charged, very few were white students. Most students were students of color, and first-generation, low-income students. And to learn that the college is so meticulously tracking these students – it was a very scary moment.”Giardinelli of Swarthmore College told the Guardian that “sanctions are based solely on alleged misconduct, without regard to race, socioeconomic standing, or identity”. Of the surveillance, she said: “CCTV images are only used, when available, to verify involved parties and behaviors that are suspected to be, or are alleged violations of, the Student Code of Conduct or of state and federal law.”Students who support Palestinian rights tend to face harsher discipline, harsher criticism, more challengesFarah Afify, Council on American-Islamic RelationsSchools’ crackdowns on pro-Palestinian student protesters are indicative of a “Palestine exception” to free speech, said Farah Afify, a research and advocacy coordinator at the civil rights group Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair). As the co-author ofCair’s analysison how universities target pro-Palestinian protesters, Afify consolidated incidents found in newspaper reports and education-related complaints that Afify received from October 2023 to May 2024.“Students who support Palestinian rights,” Afify said, “tend to face harsher discipline, harsher criticism, more challenges by people who would otherwise encourage that kind of expression because it meets the standard principles of what we’d expect of our institutions of higher education.” Cair has since launched awebsitewhere students can report their campuses to be investigated and placed on the organization’s “institutions of particular concern” list for targeting pro-Palestinian protesters.‘There’s a genocide, and we need to be organizing against it’While Saba was found responsible for violating the University of Wisconsin’s policies by a student-conduct investigating officer last August, her charges were dropped in October after she appealed them before a committee consisting of a student and university employees. Palestine Legal also sent her school aletterdemanding that they end disciplinary proceedings against students in September, which assisted in Saba and another unnamed student’s charges being dropped.In a statement to the Guardian, University of Wisconsin-Madison spokesperson Kelly Tyrrell said that the school “does not disclose details related to individual student conduct cases”, and weighs each case based on a person’s conduct history and the circumstances surrounding the offense. She said the university seeks to create a campus “where all students feel supported, can pursue their educational goals without disruption, and are free to express themselves and engage across difference on complex topics, whether in their local community or around the world”.Jewish senators accuse Trump of exploiting antisemitism to target universitiesRead moreDespite the intimidation and disciplinary action that student protesters say they faced by their universities, they remain resolute in their fight to speak against their schools’ ties to Israel.Saba said she feels vindicated that her charges were dropped, though she thinks that the university’s system was flawed for finding her co-author, Ramachandran, culpable on the same limited evidence. Still, she holds onto hope that her school will eventually disclose its investments to the public and divest from companies that contribute to or profit from Israel’s war on Gaza.“This university, like many other universities, has lost its sense as a moral institution, an institution of ethics and an institution that aspires to do good in the world,” Saba said. “I want to see a university that actually responds to the demands of its students, rather than restricting their rights, and that prioritizes acting as a force of justice in the world, rather than just a machine that takes in money and spits out degrees.”Additional reporting by Adria RWalkerExplore more on these topicsUS universitiesIsrael-Gaza warUS politicsStudentsHigher educationTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

[Making a deal with them] is the last thing they’d ever want me to do. And frankly, if I do a deal with someone, I shake their hand, I look them in the eye and I trust them. I don’t trust them.”As Farage attempted to move on, drinkers outside the Queen’s Head pub cheered. An older man in a hi-vis jacket patted him on the arm and said: “You’ve got my vote.”View image in fullscreenNigel Farage told people in Ramsgate he doesn’t trust the Tories.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAFarage is a man who likes an audience and Ramsgate is certainly a place where he wouldn’t expect to get a rough ride. But, to the horror of the Conservative party, and many in Labour too, the signs are that Reform UK is making a genuine impact across the country.Keir Starmer’s government, still less than a year into a five-year term, is unpopular. The Tories under Kemi Badenoch appear still in shock fromlast year’s general election implosion.Ever the opportunist, Farage has seen the gap and charged into it. And next week could be quite a moment for him.Earlier this week, Robert Hayward, a pollster and Conservative peer, said he believed Farage would win up to 450 seats while the Conservatives would lose up to 525 in the local elections. Reform was also said to be on course to win two mayoral contests, according to a YouGov poll released on Friday.Map of the areas in England where local elections will be held next weekThis despite, or perhaps because of, his willingness to cause offence and peddle populist ideas. On Thursday,his assertionthat the UK is “massively overdiagnosing those with mental health illness problems” was predictably provocative.The National Autistic Society said his remarks were “incorrect, wrong, fake news”. He has described net zero as “lunacy” and vowed to scrap carbon targets entirely.So far, there is little sign of any lasting damage to his brand from hisrelationship with Donald Trump, or the fact he has seemed sympathetic to Vladimir Putin.One of his own MPs,Rupert Lowe, even condemned himfor being the messianic leader of a protest party. None of this appeared to worry the votersat the Wetherspoon’s pub in Ramsgate, where he ordered a pint of Doom Bar. His burly security guards hovered nearby as there were more photo opportunities, this time with five male Reform candidates wearing rosettes.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage has a drink with Reform UK candidates at the Royal Victoria Pavilion.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianBut before he could finish his pint, Farage was approached by a 57-year-old man who said he has struggled to find work since moving back to Ramsgate from Spain.He feared he was being discriminated against, he said. “But I believe in what you’re doing,” he told Farage. “I would love to meet up with you some time and have a chat, if there’s anything I can do.”Farage introduced the man to the party’s local chair before heading upstairs to the balcony overlooking the harbour for an arranged interview with the Daily Mail.After finishing up, he had a cigarette in the sunshine while surrounded by the council candidates, including 75-year-old Trevor Shonk, a former Ramsgate mayor, and Ukip and Tory councillor who recently defected to Reform.In 2014, Shonktold the BBC’s World at One programmethat Britain had become a “racist” country because Conservative and Labour governments had let in too many immigrants.Shonk, who campaigned for Farage when he stood in Thanet South, his seventh unsuccessful attempt to enter parliament, said door-to-door campaigning in recent weeks had gone so well that people had been chasing him down the streets, saying: “Trevor, we’re voting for you and Reform.”As Farage and his mostly male entourage prepared to leave the pub to drive to Sittingbourne, their final stop of the day, a group of young men at the New Belgium Bar opposite cheered and asked for selfies.“He’s a man of the people, he’s not stuck up, he’s more like a commoner like us,” one said of the privately educated MP for Clacton. “He’s definitely got the celebrity status.”View image in fullscreen‘He’s a man of the people’. Farage with local workers.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAThe longtime Eurosceptic politician reportedly made a joke about the name of the drinking establishment, saying: “Why are you drinking in the Belgian bar?”One drinker recognised Zia Yusuf, the Reform party chair, who was by Farage’s side, but, the man said “he just walked off because nobody was giving him any attention”.Similarly, inside the Wetherspoon’s pub, one woman who seemingly had no idea who Yusuf was had reportedly asked if he could take a photo of her with Farage. Yusuf is said to have politely declined before walking off.After Farage departed, Karl Serveld, who manages Peter’s Fish Factory, said the politician seemed to be the only person listening to local concerns about immigration.“Not everybody would voice their opinion because we all know the racism card comes out. But it’s not about race, it’s about money being spent and we’re not seeing any benefit of it,” he said.Kent county council has been run by the Conservatives since 1997 butan Electoral Calculus poll of 5,400 peoplepredicted last month that Reform UK would take control.Serveld said that he hoped Reform would changeKentso “the normal working man was looked after”.Earlier, at the Best Western hotel in Dover, about 20 miles (32km) away, Farage had held a press conference in which he announced Reform would be appointing a minister for deportations.Introduced on stage as Britain’s next prime minister by Yusuf, Farage reeled off a bunch of statistics about immigration.“We’re in Dover because it was here in 2020, just as the pandemic was kicking in and lockdown was starting, that I began to go out from this port to film the migrant boats crossing,” he said.“I said that, frankly, you might as well put up a sign on the white cliffs of Dover, [saying] ‘everyone welcome’. And I predicted there would be an invasion, the word that got me in very big trouble, but have a look at the numbers that have come.”Farage claimed there had been a trend of Palestinians from Gaza making the crossing in recent weeks. “Frankly, letting people in from war zones, young males of fighting age from war zones, when you don’t know what their involvement in those areas might have been, is an incredibly dangerous thing to do,” he said.His words were echoed by one of the two would-be Kent councillors filming his address from the front row.‘I’ve been assaulted’: Reform’s minority ethnic candidates seeking local election winsRead more“It does feel like an invasion. And if they’re coming from war zones, where are the women and children? They’re all fighting age men and that’s scary,” said Paul King, the chair of Reform’s Dover and Deal branch and a candidate for Dover West.With a blue rosette pinned to his dark suit, the 56-year-old said he had been heartened by the local support after delivering thousands of leaflets in recent weeks.“Virtually everybody I speak to is fully behind us. Not very many people want to be publicly supporting us, but privately they do, like a silent Reform voter.”King, who lives in a village outside Dover, blamed the silent majority on the public’s fear of being labelled racist. But he saidFarage’s distancing of Tommy Robinsonhad worked in the party’s favour: “Because then we could actually explain that we’re not far right, we’re not racist. Our chairman is a Sri Lankan Muslim. We’ve got homosexual candidates. We’ve got people of colour. We’re a meritocracy.”Pauline Bailey, the campaign manager of the Dover and Deal branch, said there had been an uplift in support since last year’s general election when she was spat at and called names while leafleting. “Now they’re grabbing papers off me,” the 62-year-old claimed."

Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The GuardianOn the anniversary of Liberation Day, members of Australia’s Vietnamese community look back at the sacrifices made in pursuit of ‘a good life’ByBertin HuynhSat 26 Apr 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Apr 2025 20.06 EDTShare“It’s like the world collapsed,” says Thi Xa Nguyen, looking back 50 years to the fall of Saigon.She was living in the coastal town of Vũng Tàu where the soldiers of the southern Army of the Republic ofVietnamhad retreated.A 12-hour walk away in Long Thanh, Nguyen’s mother waited. There was only one way to know if her daughters were alive as their motherland fell – so she started walking.Like the war itself, the date that commemorates its ending has lots of names. To millions of Vietnamese people today, it isgiải phóng– the liberation; but for many it is the fall of Saigon orngày vong quốc– the day the country was lost.Nguyen says it was the day ofsụp trời– the sky falling.View image in fullscreenThi Xa Nguyen and her daughter Tammy.Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The GuardianWednesday marks 50 years since the northern People’s Army of Vietnam captured Saigon, the capital of the southern Republic of Vietnam, ending a war that had raged on for nearly two decades, taking more than a million lives and leaving thousands displaced.In Vietnam, there will be a sense of nostalgia in the air. It’ll be Reunification Day and every year the streets are emblazoned with national symbols: a golden star on a red flag and phrases expounding socialist values. The film-maker Mai Huyen Chi, speaking to the Guardian from Da Nang, had family on both sides of the war – remembering 1975 is not as straightforward.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsWhile her mother’s family were ordinary citizens of south Vietnam, Mai’s grandfather was a war hero, fighting against both the French and Americans in the consecutive Indochina wars. She says he fought for “dignity, self-respect (and) because the French were ruling a country that didn’t belong to them … it made sense for the Vietnamese that we should run our own country.”Since the conclusion of theVietnam war– or American war as Mai and many Vietnamese call it – the country has developed at a breakneck pace. In a single generation, the nation has emerged from devastating poverty to become one of the rising middle-income economies of the region.View image in fullscreenMai Huyen Chi’s grandfather Mai Dang Chon who died fighting in the Tet Offensive. His story is featured in the documentary film 50 Years of ForgettingBut Mai feels like Liberation Day in Vietnam will just be another public holiday.“I don’t know if they even care,” Mai wonders about today’s young Vietnamese. She believes that in the age of social media, people only ever lived in prospering and independent Vietnam do not have the bandwidth to engage in history.In Australia, the mood is very different. By the time northern troops had entered Saigon, most Australians had already left Vietnam, save for embassy staff and journalist Neil Davis, who scooped an exclusive film of tanks smashing through the gates of the southern president’s palace.Australian forces, about 50,000 service personnel, had been withdrawn by 1971.“All Ho Chi Minh wanted was his country,” says Vietnam war veteran Tony Mullavey. “Someone put a bloody line through it, and there was north and south.”It’s a perspective that Mullavey has developed with age, but at the time, he says, “we were doing our duty … it was for the good of Australia”.He was conscripted to fight in Vietnam a few months before he turned 20. He recalls his training, being taught that the enemy wore black pyjamas and conical hats, and then arriving in Vietnam to see ordinary civilians in black pyjamas conical hats. It was there, he says, that they all grew up and experienced something many back home wouldn’t understand.“Vietnam wasn’t considered a war,” Mullavey says. Despite the lethal combat, there was no formal declaration of war on the northern Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Organisations like RSL NSW would ostracise service personnel who returned from Vietnam. It would be a fight to get veterans the recognition they were due fighting for Australia. “Today, the younger veterans can thank us.”It was that struggle that established organisations, like the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, that ensured those who fought in Vietnam got their due benefits and recognition. They also opened benefits to the refugee veterans of the southern Republic of Vietnam army – making Australia one of the only countries in the world to do so. But for Mullavey and his brothers in arms, the association and its outposts has been a vital source of human connection.View image in fullscreenRefugees flee Vung Tau in 1975 during the fall of Saigon.Photograph: Jacques Pavlovsky/Sygma/Getty ImagesPerhaps the most visible way the Vietnam war changed Australia was through the thousands of Vietnamese refugees it accepted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

His government declared the end of the White Australia policy and in the same year that Saigon fell, the Whitlam government passed the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.Despite that, Whitlam had been apprehensive to accept Vietnamese refugees from the fallen south – many of whom would face reprisal for working with foreign forces like Australia.Whitlam’s government saw southern refugees as anti-communist and potentially anti-Labor. Labor senator and repatriation minister, John Wheeldon, once said: “What did we see in the dying hours of the so-called Saigon government? What did we see of these heroic defenders of democracy? We saw them doing the scoot as fast as their legs could carry them.”It wouldn’t be until 1976 – and a change in government – that Vietnamese refugees started arriving. Under the leadership of Malcolm Fraser, Australia came to accept the most refugees per capita of any country.View image in fullscreenNguyen and Tammy go through old family photos showing their first years in Australia.Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The GuardianIn 1981, Thi Xa Nguyen got her chance to seek asylum. Her husband had survived arrest and re-education to save enough money and petrol to leave Vietnam by boat. They sedated their daughters and boarded what essentially was a riverboat. It was a voyage of seven days before they arrived in Indonesia.By 1982, Thi and her family had been resettled in Melbourne. It was a journey often recalled in dreams, but it all came flooding back vividly at her daughter Tammy’s wedding.A moment that changed me: I patronised a refugee – and he taught me an invaluable lessonRead more“I got married in Fiji,” says Tammy, who is the chief executive of the Vietnamese Museum Australia. “The ferry that we took was very unfortunate because … the weather was really terrible … and it was so traumatic for her. It just reminded her of the escape from Vietnam.”“It was actually really challenging,” Tammy says. She’s part of what the community calls the 1.5 generation, a cohort of refugees who arrived in Australia as children and grew up in a land drastically different from the one they were born in. To this day, she remembers how hard it was to grow up as a minority. “If in your formative years you don’t fit in somewhere, who do you fit in with?”Tammy remembers from her work social worker when her community was overrepresented in prisons in Melbourne. “It was pretty diabolical … If you’re a displaced person and your parents are busy setting up a new life, they’re busy working and don’t have time, you’re going to hang out with other kids … who feel ostracised by western society.”“We were normal kids growing up who got into a whole lot of issues: drugs, teen pregnancy, crime.”Today Vietnamese is the fourth most spoken language in Australia , and more than 300,000 Australians have Vietnamese ancestry. Vietnamese staples like banh mi and pho have entered the culinary lexicon (and standard dictionary) of the country.Thi says despite the pain she endured and the nation that she lost, becoming an Australian has been “like a dream come true”.“That’s what we were raised with. Gratitude for being in this country,” Tammy says. “We have a good life off the back of the sacrifice that my parents made. I wouldn’t have this life if they weren’t brave enough to get on that boat.”Explore more on these topicsVietnam warAustralian immigration and asylumVietnamAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hate tomatoes? Go to Italy. Not a fan ofmarmalade? Savour a spoonful in the presence of beaming marmalade fanatics who have spent their lives devoted to creating the tangiest, sweetest, jelly-ish version of the preserve.View image in fullscreenHitomi Wakamura with her winning yuzu and pear marmalade.Photograph: Mark PinderAt first I was sceptical about tasting the jam off the spoon. What is marmalade without the soft layer of butter? The crunch of toast? Surely it cannot be enjoyed without its accompaniments. Reassured by the purists, I dive in.The first one I try is Keya Jam, a marmalade made from citrus taiwanica, a fruit endemic to the forests of Miaoli inTaiwan.The marmalade is the perfect blend of sweet and bitter: honey notes come through more powerfully at the end and melt away the sharper taste of the citrus taiwanica. The texture is jelly-like, wobbling on the spoon. It’s also smooth, with peel so finely cut it immediately melts in the mouth.Next up is the winner of the “interesting additions” category: a marmalade made with Seville oranges, clementines, lemon, sugar and peanut butter. I was apprehensive about this one. I’ve never been a fan of mixing two big staples together. But I am pleasantly surprised. The peanut flavour immediately tickles through, but it’s not overpowering, and gently fades into the background giving space for the citrus notes to shine through.View image in fullscreenSome of the marmalade entries on offer.Photograph: Mark PinderJapanese marmalades are traditionally more bitter in taste, but Hitomi Wakamura’s winning marmalade is the exception.The notes of pear make it deliciously sweet. Made with yuzu, a small, round citrus fruit, it’s zesty and tastes exceptionally fresh, as if the fruit had just been picked off a tree. The mix of flavours are exquisite.Explore more on these topicsFoodFruitLake DistrictCumbriaJapanTaiwanEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s the same measure introduced in March 2022 but set against a hugely different backdrop.Three years ago petrol prices were spiking after Russia’s invasion in Ukraine.Now oil prices are plunging and a litre of petrol is 10 cents cheaper than it was at the start of the year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sure, they really didn’t have much choice – but it has been the right one.And there’s a good story to tell, albeit carefully.Real wages have been climbing for a year and the battle to tame inflation has not pushed unemployment up. The economy has regained momentum and even the threat from Donald Trump’s trade war plays into the hands of the incumbents.Labor will get another opportunity to trumpet this progress in Wednesday’s inflation figures. The headlines will be about further interest rate cuts on the way, and economists are talking about three this year.That’s not to say that Labor has presented a compelling suite of meaningful reforms that are desperately needed to underpin the next era of national prosperity.It hasn’t.But when it comes to what swings votes and wins elections, the old trope holds true: it’s the economy, stupid.And as the two major parties enter the final stretch to Saturday’s election, it has become clear that the economy on many punters’ minds is tomorrow’s, not yesterday’s.Patrick Commins is Guardian Australia’s economics editorExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyAustralian election 2025Peter DuttonCost of living crisisAustralian politicsReserve Bank of AustraliaHousinganalysisShareReuse this content"

She lost her life to suicide, after being a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking,” the statement read.“In the end, the toll of abuse is so heavy that it became unbearable for Virginia to handle its weight.”Giuffre was one of the most vocal victims of Epstein, alleging she had been groomed and sexually abused by him and his longtime associate,Ghislaine Maxwell, beginning in her teens.View image in fullscreenVirginia Giuffre with a photograph of herself as a teenager.Photograph: Miami Herald/Tribune News Service/GettyThe family described her as a “fierce warrior” against sexual abuse and sex trafficking and a “light that lifted so many survivors”.“Despite all the adversity she faced in her life, she shone so bright. She will be missed beyond measure,” they said.Giuffre is survived by her three children, Christian, Noah and Emily, who her family said were the “light of her life”.“It was when she held her newborn daughter in her arms that Virginia realised she had to fight back against those who had abused her and so many others,” they said.“There are no words that can express the grave loss we feel today with the passing of our sweet Virginia. She was heroic and will always be remembered for her incredible courage and loving spirit.”View image in fullscreenVirginia Giuffre holds a news conference outside a New York court in 2019.Photograph: Bebeto Matthews/APGiuffre’s lawyer, Sigrid McCawley, said she was “much more than a client”.“She was a dear friend and an incredible champion for other victims. Her courage pushed me to fight harder, and her strength was awe-inspiring,” McCawley said. “The world has lost an amazing human being today. Rest in peace, my sweet angel.”Giuffre’s representative Dini von Mueffling said she was “one of the most extraordinary human beings I have ever had the honour to know”.“Deeply loving, wise, and funny, she was a beacon to other survivors and victims. She adored her children and many animals,” she said. “She was always more concerned with me than with herself. I will miss her beyond words. It was the privilege of a lifetime to represent her.”Josh Schiffer, a lawyer who represents one of Epstein’s victims, said Giuffre was integral to exposing the financier. “The case wouldn’t have existed without the input, her cooperation, her bravery at the beginning, inspiring so many other people to come forward,” he told the US cable network NewsNation.Schiffer said: “Her loss will hopefully be a marker and almost an inspiration for people to calling attention to the epidemic that is sex trafficking, that is the international sex industry. This is an issue that still persists. It changes its form all the time and it exists all around the world. This just happened to be a really prominent example.”Western Australia police did not publicly confirm Giuffre had died, but said emergency services responded to reports a 41-year-old woman was unresponsive at a home in Neergabby, about 75km north of Perth, about 9.50pm on Friday.The woman was given emergency first aid but was pronounced dead, they said.The death will be investigated but is not considered suspicious.Earlier this month, Giuffre posted on social media that she hadjust days to live after a school bus crashed into her car.WA police later confirmed a 41-year-old woman was in a car that collided with a bus on 24 March but there were no reported injuries. It is understood Giuffre presented to a Perth hospital emergency department on 1 April.View image in fullscreenPrince Andrew, Virginia Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell.Photograph: US Department of Justice/PAGiuffre, who is American, said she met Maxwell, a British socialite, in 2000 when working as a locker-room assistant at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.Maxwell offered her a job as massage therapist to Epstein, during which she alleged she was trafficked to the financier’s friends and clients – “passed around like a platter of fruit”.In a 2009 civil lawsuit against Epstein, under the pseudonym “Jane Doe 102”, she alleged that her duties included being “sexually exploited by Epstein’s adult male peers including royalty”. Giuffre reached a settlement with Epstein in that case before it went to trial.In 2021, Giuffrefiled a civil lawsuitagainstPrince Andrewin the federal court in New York, alleging he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17. Andrew has repeatedly and strongly denied the accusations.In the lawsuit, Giuffre alleged Epstein and Maxwell had introduced her to Andrew in 2001, and alleged that Maxwell forced her to have sex with Andrew.In 2022,Andrew and Giuffre agreed to an out-of-court settlementfor an undisclosed sum.Maxwell, who has maintained her innocence,was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022for sex trafficking.Epstein wasarrested by federal authorities in July 2019and charged with sex-trafficking counts. Shortly after, hedied by suicidewhile awaiting trial.In the US on Saturday, the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (Rainn) praised Guiffre’s courage while warning that victims of abuse are “significantly more likely to attempt suicide or suffer other long term effects of trauma”.“Our heart goes out to Virginia Giuffre’s family and loved ones and to all those victimized byJeffrey Epsteinand his associates,” said Scott Berkowitz, the president and founder of Rainn, adding that the group “will honor Giuffre’s memory by continuing our work to prevent sexual violence and to improve the criminal justice process for survivors” and urging other victims that they are “never alone” and to reach out for help to relevant groups.Maya Yang contributed reportingIn Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis 13 11 14.

But she and two First Nations groups who were also scheduled to perform at the game ultimately cancelled.“We were all just dumbfounded,” she toldthe Age. “We would dearly love to be out there, but they’ve broken our hearts.”The Storm later released a statement blaming a “miscommunication” for the cancellation.“We acknowledge and accept the timing and miscommunication was not ideal and we have spoken to the groups concerned this afternoon,” the club said.The controversy at AAMI Park unfolded after hecklers interrupted welcome to country addresses at Friday’s Melbourne and Perth Anzac Day dawn services –incidents that drew widespread condemnation.5:05Hecklers boo Indigenous elder during Melbourne Anzac Day dawn service welcome to country – videoDutton has previously expressed scepticism about Indigenous acknowledgment and welcome to country ceremonies. In 2023 he told2GB radiothat repeated acknowledgments could “detract from the significance of the statement” and accused some corporations of using them as “virtue signalling”.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterHis shadow minister forIndigenous AustraliansJacinta Nampijinpa Price told Sky News in December that “everyone’s getting sick of welcome to country” ceremonies and said there were “other ways” for Indigenous groups to “take up employment”.The former Liberal prime minister Tony Abbottused similar languageduring the voice referendum.But on Saturday Dutton urged people to respect the ceremony.“If an organiser of a particular event decides that there’s a welcome to country, then people can respect that decision,” he told reporters in Cairns.Dutton also repeated his condemnation of the dawn service interruptions, saying Anzac Day was “not a place for political statements”.“Near 100% of Australians who were at Anzac Day ceremonies yesterday conducted themselves in a way that we should all be very proud of, but we should condemn those bad actions,” he said.Dutton, however, reaffirmed his position that, if elected prime minister, he would not display the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags at official press conferences.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What occurred yesterday, though – and what has got universal condemnation – is the inappropriate actions of people disrupting an Anzac Day service. That is completely unacceptable,” he said.Albanese alleged the hecklers were “far right figures” and known “neo-Nazis” and said their threat was growing, citingAustralian Security Intelligence Organisation advice.“I have had some of those figures confront me, as you might be aware, here in Melbourne during this campaign,” he said.“It’s good that across the board the political spectrum condemned what occurred yesterday. It was condemned by Mr Dutton as well. That’s a good thing.”Albanese said if re-elected, he would convene a meeting with media organisations to discuss how to combat the spread of hate and extremism, particularly online.“We need to take this seriously, these threats, because they are real,” he said.Victoria police said they interviewed a 26-year-old Kensington man about offensive behaviour at Melbourne’s Shrine of Remembrance on Friday morning and directed him to leave.They will proceed with a summons and expect the man will be charged.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Indigenous AustraliansAustralian politicsPeter DuttonCoalitionnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump said that “most of the major points are agreed to”, in a post on his Truth Social platform, without further elaboration. He called for a meeting between Kyiv and Moscow’s leadership to sign a ceasefire deal, which he said was “very close”.Despite Trump’s eagerness for a deal, significant differences remain between the US vision for peace and what Ukraine and its European allies have deemed acceptable conditions for a ceasefire.Two sets of peace plans published by Reuters on Friday showed that the US is proposing Moscow retain the territory it has captured, including the strategic Crimean peninsula, whichRussiaannexed in 2014.A carve-up in gift wrapping: Trump’s peace plan puts the sacrifice on UkraineRead moreThis is seemingly a non-starter for Ukraine and European countries, with Zelenskyy insisting the territory is the “property of the Ukrainian people”.“Our position is unchanged,” the Ukrainian president told reporters in Kyiv. “The constitution of Ukraine says that all the temporarily occupied territories … belong to Ukraine.”It is also unclear if Moscow will agree to the US peace deal, which is seen as offering considerable concessions to Russia.On Saturday, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said all Ukrainian troops had been forced from Russia’s Kursk region, a key aim for Moscow. Ukrainian officials disputed the claim.The technical details of a ceasefire deal still need to be hammered out, including how western sanctions imposed on Russia would be lifted and what sort of security guarantees would be offered to Ukraine.Trump acknowledged on Friday that the talks were “very fragile”, and he has warned that the US would halt its mediation efforts if the two sides did not come to an agreement soon.Fighting continues in tandem with mediation efforts, and the Kremlin blames Ukraine for a car bomb that killed a senior Russian general near Moscow on Friday. Kyiv did not comment on the incident, the latest in a string of killings of Russian military officials over the past three years.The day before, Russiacarried out its deadliest attack in months on Ukraine, launching 70 missiles and 145 drones, mostly towards Kyiv.The attack caused Trump to lash out at Putin on social media. “I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Let’s get the Peace Deal DONE!” Trump posted on Truth Social on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsUkraineDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyPope FrancisRussiaVaticanThe papacynewsShareReuse this content"

Photos byJulia KochetovaSat 26 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Apr 2025 04.20 EDTShareAbout 1am on Friday, Yuliia Verbytska woke to the sound of an air raid siren. She grabbed her teenage children – Dmitry, 17, and Olexiy, 12 – and sat in the corridor, checking her phone. In the sky above came an ominous whine. Minutes later, a Russian drone crashed into the disused soap factory down the road in Polyova Street. There was an enormous explosion.“We don’t have a shelter in our building, so we hide behind two concrete walls. All the neighbours sit together. You wonder if this is your last moment,” she said. Friday’s raid followed a massive attack on Thursday on Verbytska’s home, Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, and on the capital, Kyiv, where 12 people were killed. “I haven’t slept for two days,” she said wearily.Exhausted residents sweeping up glass and fixing broken panels pointed out that the latest attack camehours after a post from Donald Trump on social media. It said: “Vladimir, STOP.”Russia’s president, it seemed, had decided to ignore Trump’s rare rebuke. Despite peace negotiations and an appeal byUkraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyyfor a month-long ceasefire, the Russians were bombing as usual.View image in fullscreenYuliia Verbytska at the Heart of Kharkiv, which was damaged during the night in a Russian hit in Slobidsky district of the city.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianOne of the damaged buildings belongs to a charity,Heart of Kharkiv, where Verbytska works as a volunteer. Bits of concrete fell amid clothes and donated shoes. Children’s drawings were blown from a noticeboard. The charity’s wheelchairs and pushchairs survived unscathed. “I don’t believe in promises or words. Not from Trump or anybody else. I don’t really have much faith in anything any more,” Verbytska said gloomily.By late morning, emergency service workers were still extinguishing small blazes in the now-ruined factory. Built in 1918, it once made soap for the Soviet Union. It went bankrupt last year. The Kremlin’s drones narrowly missed an old acacia tree by its entrance gate. They flattened a brick administration building. Firefighters doused charred beams and splashed among puddles and piles of twisted metal.“They are fascists. Inhuman people. Barbarians. Cruel,” the complex’s security guard, Anton, said, when asked what he thought about Russians. “They want to destroy Ukraine and Ukrainians. That’s their plan.” He was sceptical that the peace process – Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff held talks on Friday with Putin in Moscow – would lead to a settlement that might end the fighting.View image in fullscreenA visitor to the Heart of Kharkiv collects a wheelchair.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianThe security guard said Zelenskyy would be unwise to accept the US’s latestleaked proposal. It envisages handing Crimea and four other Ukrainian regions to Russia. Ukraine gets back a sliver of territory in the Kharkiv region. “Today it’s fiveoblasts. Tomorrow, the Russians will demand another five. Zelenskyy should not sign,” he said. He dismissed Trump as a “Russian agent recruited long ago”, and said: “I’m disappointed that the Americans elected him.”‘Vladimir, stop!’ Trump in rare rebuke to Putin as Kyiv attack toll rises to 12Read moreRussia says its devastating attacks are against Ukrainian military objects. Its latest murderous barrage followsa double strike this month on the north-eastern city of Sumy, in which 35 people were killed. Most were travelling on a bus when an Iskander missile exploded next to them. Overwhelmingly, the victims of Russia’s air raids are civilians. They include two children killed on Thursday and dug from the rubble of their Kyiv apartment block.Liudmyla Hanzii, a pensioner, was at her home in Kharkiv’s Slobidsky district when the soap factory was hit. Her son, Andriy, showed off the bed where she had been sleeping. It was decorated with icons and a black-and-white photograph of Liudmyla as a young woman. “Mum heard a bang. All the glass came flying in. A teenage boy living next door dragged her out,” he said, adding she was being treated in hospital for minor injuries.View image in fullscreenAnton, a security guard at the soap factory, takes a Ukrainian flag to a safer location.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianAccording to Anatoliy Yaskovets, the deputy head of Kharkiv fire station No 6, Russia has stepped up its air attacks. The frequency increased in January, he said, when Trump came back as US president. Apart from a brief pause last weekend, when Putin announced an Easter ceasefire, bombing was continuous. “It’s terror against the civilian population. There’s no time to react. It takes 50 seconds for a missile fired from Belgorod in Russia to arrive,” he said.Zelenskyy says Ukraine cannot accept US recognition of Crimea as RussianRead moreThe Russians had recently changed tactics, he added. They now send a swarm of drones, one after another, at the same target. Three of his colleagues were killed last year when they went to the scene of a drone strike. Twenty minutes later, a second drone incinerated their vehicle. Moscow was using drones to drop CS gas and delayed-action grenades, which detonate up to an hour after impact. They go off if touched, he explained.Asked if he thought the war might end soon, Yaskovets answered: “Probably not.” He continued: “People are tired. There are air raid sirens all the time. It’s a psychological burden. Russia has been destroying our power stations and industrial infrastructure. The aim is to make people unhappy so they turn on Ukraine’s government.” His mobile phone rang with a popular song, Moscow Burns. “It’s my mother. She worries about me,” he said.View image in fullscreenFirefighters working on the aftermath of the drone hit on the soap factory.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianIn February 2022, Russian armoured columns tried to seize Kharkiv. There was fierce fighting. Ukrainian units pushed the enemy back to the city’s edge. For the next six months, Kharkiv was repeatedly shelled. That autumn, a Ukrainian counteroffensive liberated most of the surrounding province. In recent months, though, the Russians have been advancing again,reoccupying the border town of Vovchansklast year, andswallowing villages.How far could they go? Yaskovets said it was clear the Russians would try again to encircle and occupy Kharkiv. “Putin doesn’t intend to stop. He wants to take the south of Ukraine and go as far as the Dnipro River. He doesn’t have a big enough army to do that,” he suggested. In the meantime, there would be more drone attacks, and more casualties. “We’ve had four years of full-scale war. Somehow, people have got used to it,” he noted.A group of soldiers from the Kraken regiment – breaking off for coffee at a Kharkiv petrol station – said Putin’s behaviour this week was not surprising. “By bombing us, he shows his true nature,” one of them, Saifula, said. He added: “My feeling is that Trump is not really a president at all. He’s a parody or a clone of a president. The whole world is laughing at him. Our only option now is to have a strong army and to carrying on fighting.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiaUS foreign policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Italian leader will host a gathering of world leaders to say goodbye to a much-revered pope whose public views – from the treatment of people fleeing war to the climate crisis – were diametrically opposed to hers.WhilePope Franciswas a staunch advocate for asylum seekers, and blessed the vessels that saved refugees at sea, Meloni once said Italy should “repatriate migrants back to their countries and then sink the boats that rescued them”.When is Pope Francis’s funeral, who will be there and what happens nextRead moreClose allies of Meloni are attending, including the US president, Donald Trump, who Francissharply criticised for his anti-immigration stance, saying: “Anyone who only wants to build walls and not bridges is not a Christian.” Also flying in is Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, who at various times called the pontiffan imbecile and a representative of the “evil one”.In ajoint session of parliament on Wednesday, Meloni cited how the pope “gave back a voice to those who did not have one”.The words of Italy’s prime minister were sharply criticised by opposition parties in parliament. The leader of the centre-left opposition Democratic party,Elly Schlein, said: “Francis does not deserve the hypocrisy of those who deport migrants, take money from the poor, deny the climate emergency and deny care to those who cannot afford it.”The former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi of Italia Viva was equally scathing. “It is very funny that each of us seeks to grab a little piece of his legacy,” he said.Addressing the government’s members, he added: “Your detention camps for migrants were a disgrace to Pope Francis.”On big issues, Meloni and the pope could not have been further apart. The climate emergency was for Francis a moral and spiritual crisis demanding a radical and systemic response, whereas for Meloni the ecological transition is subordinate to economic competitiveness and national interest.In economics, the pope denounced the “culture of waste”, criticising a system that values people according to their productivity and calling for an economy in the service of human dignity. Meloni, meanwhile, has abolishedsubsidies for the poorand cut healthcare.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump, whose stance on immigration Francis sharply criticised, will be among the guests greeted by Meloni.Photograph: Andrew Leyden/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock“There was a huge gap between the two,” said Francesco Galietti, the founder of Policy Sonar, a political consultancy in Rome. “Meloni bet on Atlanticism, on a close rapport with Trump, while Bergoglio [Pope Francis] was by no means pro-American nor a friend of Trump. There was also a divergence in geopolitical vision: Francis pursued a policy of rapprochement with China, whereas under MeloniItaly withdrew from Beijing’s ambitious belt and road initiative.”But on a personal level, they appeared to be friendly, even friends.“Despite this,” Galietti added, “the friendship between Meloni and the pope was allegedly genuine. They spoke in Spanish and met often. This should come as no surprise: after all, the pope, who grew up under Argentina’s Videla dictatorship, was forced to coexist with generals in uniform far to the right of Meloni.”Melonihas long publicised her personal rapport with Francis, frequently citing details of their conversations in public speeches. Many political observers and media outlets described the prime minister’s strategy as an“operazione simpatia”, an attempt to win over her electorate by highlighting her friendship with one of the most beloved pontiffs.With the death of Francis, Meloni has lost someone politically, and possibly personally, important to her.“Francis accepted Meloni’s history, her self-portrayal as an underdog,” said Prof Alberto Melloni, a church historian at the University of Modena-Reggio Emilia and the Unesco chair on religious pluralism and peace. “Once Bergoglio told me he liked the PM because she was ‘a woman of the people’.”The professor said the crucial question for Meloni was whether the next leader of the Catholic church would also play a useful role. “If the pope does not sympathise with them, he won’t let them off so lightly.”Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisGiorgia MeloniItalyReligionCatholicismChristianityThe papacyanalysisShareReuse this content"

It’s a major step by the ageing leader to designate a successor.The appointment of Hussein al-Sheikh as vice-president of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) does not guarantee he will be the next Palestinian president. But it makes him the frontrunner among longtime politicians in the dominant Fatah party who hope to succeed the 89-year-old Abbas.The move is unlikely to boost the image among many Palestinians of Fatah as a closed and corrupt movement out of touch with the general public.Abbas hopes to play a major role in postwar Gaza. He has been under pressure from western and Arab allies to rehabilitate the Palestinian Authority, which has limited autonomy in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He has announced a series of reforms in recent months, and last week his Fatah movement approved the new position of PLO vice-president.The PLO is the internationally recognised representative of the Palestinian people and oversees the western-backed Palestinian Authority. Abbas has led both entities for two decades.Despair in Gaza as Israeli aid blockade creates crisis ‘unmatched in severity’Read moreUnder last week’s decision, the new vice-president, coming from the PLO’s 16-member executive committee, would succeed Abbas in a caretaker capacity if the president dies or becomes incapacitated.That would make him the frontrunner to replace Abbas on a permanent basis, though it is not a guarantee. The PLO’s executive committee would need to approve that appointment, and the body is filled with veteran politicians who see themselves as worthy contenders.The Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, would have a separate caretaker leader, Rawhi Fattouh, the speaker of the Palestinians’ non-functioning parliament. But within 90 days, it would have to hold elections. If that is not possible, the new PLO president would probably take over the position.Al-Sheikh, 64, is a veteran politician who has held a series of top positions over decades, most recently as the secretary general of the PLO’s executive committee for the past three years. He spent 11 years in Israeli prisons in his youth and is a veteran of the Palestinian security forces – experiences that could give him credibility with Palestinian security figures and the broader public.Now he finds himself in a strong position to shore up his power.He is Abbas’s closest aide and, most critically, maintains good working relations with Israel and the Palestinians’ Arab allies, including wealthy Gulf countries. As Abbas’s point man with Israel, al-Sheikh is responsible for arranging coveted travel permits for Palestinians, including VIP leaders, giving him an important lever of power over his rivals.However, polls show al-Sheikh, like most of Fatah’s leadership, to be deeply unpopular with the general public. This week’s decision behind closed doors by the PLO’s ageing leadership is likely to reinforce its image as being stodgy and out of touch.The most popular Palestinian, Marwan Barghouti, is serving multiple life sentences in an Israeli prison, and Israel has ruled out releasing him as part of any swap for Israeli hostages held in Gaza by theHamasmilitant group.As Israel’s war with Hamas drags on, with talk by the US president, Donald Trump, and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, of uprooting Palestinians in Gaza to relocate them elsewhere, al-Sheikh will be under mounting pressure to unite the Palestinian leadership.The PLO is a rival to Hamas, which won the last national elections in 2006 and is not in the PLO. Hamas seized control of Gaza from Abbas’s forces in 2007, and reconciliation attempts have repeatedly failed.In a 2022 interview with the Associated Press, al-Sheikh defended his unpopular coordination with Israel, saying there was no choice under the difficult circumstances of the occupation.“I am not a representative for Israel in thePalestinian territories,” he said at the time. “We undertake the coordination because this is the prelude to a political solution for ending the occupation.”Explore more on these topicsMahmoud AbbasPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaHamasIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

He added that the port administration had previously been warned about the danger these chemicals posed.The Iranian government has not yet specified the exact cause of the explosion, though it suspected combustible chemicals to be behind the blast.The provincial attorney general had ordered a “thorough and urgent” investigation into the circumstances of the explosion, which local officials said began in several containers in the port.Shahid Rajaee is a large Iranian container facility that handles 80m tons of goods a year, including fuel and other combustible materials. It is part of the Bandar Abbas port, the country’s largest.State media had previously quoted Iranian security officials as saying “any speculation about the cause of the explosion is worthless”.Videos showed a huge billowing mushroom cloud and the force of the blast destroyed a nearby building and shattered windows.Injured people lay on the roadside as authorities declared a state of emergency at hospitals across Bandar Abbas to cope with the influx of wounded.Aerial and naval firefighting teams worked to extinguish the blast, and state media reported officials expected the firefighting operation to be completed within an hour. Local media reported people trapped under the wreckage of a collapsed building.View image in fullscreenPeople walk to safety after an explosion at the Shahid Rajaee port in Bandar Abbas, Iran.Photograph: Mohammad Rasoul Moradi/ReutersIn the aftermath of the explosion, port activities were suspended and Iranian customs officials halted export and transit shipments to the port.The state-owned National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company said that oil refineries, tankers and pipelines in the area continued to operate and were unaffected by the blast.The explosion occurred as Iran and the US met for the third round ofnuclear talksin Oman on Saturday, aiming to achieve a deal on Iran’s nuclear programme.Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araqchi spoke through Omani mediators for six hours on Saturday to create a framework for a new nuclear deal.Trump, in an interview with Time magazine on Friday, said that he thought a deal with Iran was possible. Oman’s foreign minister announced that another “high-level meeting” was scheduled for 3 May.The US and Israel view the prospect of Iran getting a nuclear weapon as an urgent threat. Iranian officials, in turn, are keen to lift a severe US sanctions regime on the beleaguered economy.“Iran remains steadfast in its principled stance on the need to end unjust sanctions and is ready to build confidence about the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said in Oman.In 2020, the Shahid Rajaee container facility was hit with a complex cyber-attack that jammed port logistics, which the Washington Postreportedas being perpetrated by Israel in retaliation for an Iranian cyber-attack.The cyber-attack was one of a series of incidents that has affected Iranian critical infrastructure in recent years.The government has blamed some of the incidents, such as a 2024 coalmine blast in southern Iran which killed 31 people, on negligence. Tehran has accused Israel of being behind other incidents, such as an attack on Iranian gas pipelines last year.The Israeli government made no comment on Saturday’s explosions in Iran.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two over Muslim-majorityKashmir, which is divided between them but claimed fully by both.India’s military said Pakistani soldiers opened fire from “multiple posts” along the heavily militarised ceasefire line, and Indian forces “responded appropriately” to what it called “unprovoked” firing. No casualties were reported. Pakistan did not immediately comment.The clashes followed the attack last Tuesday, whengunmen opened fire in a meadow near Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. The attackers reportedly asked the victims, all male, whether they were Hindu or Muslim and shot the Hindus. Violence had been steadily abating in Kashmir, and the attack struck a heavy blow to the region’s recovering tourism industry.An obscure group calling itself the Kashmir Resistance claimed responsibility. India links the group to the outlawed Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, but Pakistan denies involvement.In an apparent attempt to ease tensions, Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, offered to cooperate with a “neutral investigation”. The Indian prime minister,Narendra Modi, has vowed to “track and punish every terrorist and their backers” and pursue the killers “to the ends of the earth”.“Pakistan is open to participating in any neutral, transparent and credible investigation,” Sharif said, while warning Pakistan’s forces stood ready to repel “any misadventure” by India.The domestic pressures shaping India’s response to Kashmir attacksRead moreIn tit-for-tat moves, India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, a critical water-sharing pact, expelled Pakistani diplomats and cancelled Pakistani visas. Islamabad retaliated by expelling Indian diplomats, cancelling Indians’ visas and closing its airspace. It also suspended the 1972 Shimla accord, a key framework for dialogue.India’s resources minister, C R Patil, said the country would move to ensure “not a single drop” of river water flowed into Pakistan after the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty. Pakistan has warned any attempt to block water would be an “act of war”, with the Pakistan People’s party chief, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, declaring: “Either our water will flow through it, or their blood.”Experts say disrupting the flow would require big investment and years of work. “India lacks the hydro infrastructure needed to actually impede the flow of water to Pakistan in the short term,” Brahma Chellaney, an analyst, said. “So the action is largely symbolic.”Explore more on these topicsKashmirIndiaPakistanSouth and central AsiaNarendra ModinewsShareReuse this content"

It’s become this kind of political football.”Rowling had previously taken a swipe at Tennant for saying that Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch, who has called for abar on transgender peoplein single-sex spaces, should “shut up”, during his appearance at the British LGBT Awards in June 2024.When Badenoch was elected leader of the Conservative party in November, Rowling posted to X that her “thoughts and prayers” were “with David Tennant at this very difficult time”.Asked about Rowling’s remarks on the ITV1 show, which sees celebrities face questions from a group of autistic, neurodivergent and learning-disabled people, Tennant said: “JK Rowling is a wonderful author who’s created brilliant stories, and I wish her no ill will, but I hope that we can all as a society, just let people be. Just get out of people’s way.”Harry Potter actors Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have alsodistanced themselvesfrom Rowling’s gender-critical views, issuing statements in support of trans rights after the Scottish author’s2020 essayabout surviving sexual assault, in which she called arguments about “femaleness not residing in the sexed body … deeply misogynistic and regressive”.Rowling reportedly donated £70,000 to For Women Scotland, the campaign group whose long-running legal case against the Scottish government last week culminated in the UK supreme court ruling that the terms “woman” and “sex” in the Equality Act refer only to a biological woman and to biological sex.The Assembly will air on ITV1 at 10pm on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsDavid TennantTransgenderJK RowlingnewsShareReuse this content"

I won’t let this rest | Gordon BrownMichael SavageMedia editorSat 26 Apr 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Apr 2025 14.11 EDTShareThe former prime minister Gordon Brown has made a new complaint to British police over allegations that Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper empire obstructed justice, after stating he has spoken to officers involved in the original phone-hacking inquiry.Writing in the Guardian, Brown said one of the detectives had alleged they believed there was “significant evidence” that News Group Newspapers (NGN) deleted millions of emails to pervert the course of justice.In the article, Brown states that the former officers told him that if they had been aware of the background to the email deletions, they would have pushed for further action.Brown said one former officer told him: “If we had known this in 2011, we would have investigated fully and taken a different course of action including considering arrests.”“Today I am making a criminal complaint to the Met and CPS alleging that I am, along with many others, a victim of the obstruction of the course of justice by News Group,” he writes. “This is not an allegation made lightly.It is informedby recentlyavailable evidence, and by thestatements of senior officersinvolved in the original investigations into unlawful news gathering, who have now stated to me that they were misled.”NGN strenuously denies any allegations of evidence destruction. It said the Crown Prosecution Service concluded in 2015 that there was no evidence that company email deletions were carried out to pervert the course of justice.In January,NGN apologised to Prince Harryfor phone hacking by journalists at its Sunday tabloid, the News of the World, and the “serious intrusion by the Sun between 1996 and 2011 into his private life, including incidents of unlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for the Sun”.The apology was part of an out-of-court settlement to end litigation brought against NGN by the prince andTom Watson, a former Labour deputy leader.Brown said the settlement had “not closed an era of investigation and litigation into media corruption. It has opened it up”.Brown’s complaint to the Metropolitan police follows details ofclaims made by former detectivescontained in a document filed with the high court in London.Their statements were made in support of the long-running phone-hacking litigation pursued against NGN by Harry and Watson.View image in fullscreenTom Watson gives a statement outside the high court in January after he and Prince Harry settled with NGN.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersThe skeleton legal arguments of both sides,reported by the Guardian, were not made public at the time and the claims have not been tested at trial because of the settlement.No admissions were made about the allegation of illegal destruction of evidence, which NGN strongly denies. The company said it would have successfully fought the allegation if the case had gone to trial.In his piece for the Guardian, Brown accuses Will Lewis, now chief executive of the Washington Post but then a senior NGN executive, ofattempting to incriminate him and Watson.He claims a false allegation against them was used to justify the deletion of emails to officers involved in Operation Weeting, the Met investigation launched in January 2011 to examine phone-hacking allegations.His accusation relates to documents disclosed in high court civil actions last year, which included a minute taken by the Met police of a meeting detectives held with Lewis on 8 July 2011.In the meeting, Lewis said the company had been told of a plot involving Brown and Watson to obtain the emails of Rebekah Brooks, the then chief executive of News International, through a third party. Lewis was the company’s general manager at the time.View image in fullscreenFormer senior NGN executive Will Lewis, who has previously denied wrongdoing, is at the centre of Gordon Brown’s allegations.Photograph: Elliott O’Donovan/APBrown states that one of the investigating officers has now said to him that NGN “falsely implicatedGordon Brown. If I had known this I would have made arrests for obstruction of justice.”NGN apologised to Watson over the idea of a plot as part of the settlement of his case, stating the company now understood “this information was false”.However, the company has said they believed at the time that the threat was genuine and would have proved this at trial. NGN planned to cite a 2011 email from Brooks, not previously made public, expressing concern about the internal security of the company’s IT systems.NGN’s skeleton defence also noted that a range of security measures were subsequently taken. The company also refers to a letter sent in January 2011 by Watson to the then Met assistant commissioner, John Yates, disclosed ahead of trial. In it Watson claimed to have been approached by former company employees with “knowledge of the information technology arrangements of News International”, NGN claimed.Lewis has previously strongly denied wrongdoing. He did not comment when approached by the Guardian.In its skeleton defence, NGN strenuously rejected allegations of a cover-up. A spokesperson stated that there was a lack of contemporaneous evidence in support of the claimants’ case and that NGN had a strong a lineup of witnesses who could confirm its own position. They said thestatements of two former officers with concernswere a “selective and partial consideration of the contemporaneous documents”.According to NGN’s skeleton argument, the deletion of emails had “long been in the planning, for sound commercial, IT and practical reasons”, and that Harry and Watson’s claims in this area had drawn on “wholly unreasonable inferences from an incomplete account of the facts, many of which are taken entirely out of context”.An NGN spokesperson said that when Operation Weeting was initiated, the company handed incriminating material to police, while officers were immediately made aware of “the steps NGN had taken in relation to its historic email archive as well as the actions it had taken to preserve relevant evidence”.View image in fullscreenRebekah Brooks, former chief executive of News International, with Rupert Murdoch.Photograph: ShutterstockThey said NGN worked alongside specialist IT police officers for months to reconstruct its electronic archives.“The allegations of email deletion had formed part of the prosecution case in the criminal trial in 2013/14,” they said. “The investigation into News International concluded in 2015, almost 10 years ago, with a lengthy statement by the CPS deciding that no further action was to be taken in the light of there being no evidence to support an allegation of wrongdoing.”Brown writes that the police should request a series of court documents submitted during years of litigation, including from former NGN employees and ex-police officers.He also calls for prosecutors to step in – and for parliamentary committees to reopen their inquiries into the deletion of emails. He also asks the attorney general, Richard Hermer, to intervene.A spokesperson for NGN said: “NGN once again strenuously denies that there was any plan to delete emails in order to conceal evidence from a police investigation.”They said Brown was an “unreliable complainant driven by vendetta and revenge for perceived wrongs by NGN”. They said NGN figures working with police on company emails “acted throughout with the utmost integrity and at all times followed the protocol agreed with the [Metropolitan police] in order to provide access to and restore data”.“Mr Brown’s concerns again provide an inaccurate summary of allegations dealt with in the civil proceedings, which have already been extensively investigated and litigated,” an NGN spokesperson said. “It is not uncommon for retired police officers to hold views about their failure to achieve a conviction or matters that have not gone their way in court … There are officers from the 2011 to 2015 investigations who, in possession of all the facts, would not agree.”A Met spokesperson said: “While we acknowledge that information emerging from civil proceedings is of interest to the public and the press who may be seeing it for the first time, in the vast majority of cases it is material that has already been considered as part of the numerous investigations and reviews that have previously been carried out.“We are aware that parties in this recent case indicated an intention to pass material to us but we are yet to receive any such correspondence. In the event that we do, we will consider it carefully and proportionally, recognising the need to explore genuine lines of inquiry but acknowledging the significant resources already committed to past investigations.”Explore more on these topicsPhone hackingGordon BrownWill LewisRupert MurdochPrince HarryTom WatsonNational newspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

The stars have aligned. The great wait is over. Come see. It will not be televised.”The brothers are thought to be back in each other’s good graces, with Noel confirming to TalkSport earlier this week that rehearsals for the tour will begin in the next few weeks.

However, the capital’s 33 local authorities have spent less than £40m between them. Somehave saidthey do not have the resources, expertise or time to decide how to spend it.The money gathered from this fund must be spent on carbon reduction measures in local areas. These include energy efficiency improvements to council housing and other buildings that would lower energy bills for tenants, as well as renewable energy projects and district heating schemes. The cash can also be given out as community grants, and some councils have used it to fund education projects, tree planting and community food-growing schemes.The data, obtained through freedom of information requests, shows a wide variation in spending by councils up to the end of last year. Some authorities have spent all of the funding they have collected from developers while others have spent none. The vast majority have spent less than 20% of the cash.The Guardian was told by a number of councils that some of their unspent cash – about £15m in total – had been allocated for projects but not yet spent. Meanwhile, Greater London Authority figuresshowcouncils have at least another £150m on the way from developers.Amount collected by councils through London’s carbon offset funding since 2Zack Polanski, the deputy leader of the Green party and chair of the London assembly’s environment committee, said progress had been “unacceptably slow and inconsistent”.“Thousands of Londoners are stuck in cold, damp and mouldy homes while their bills keep climbing,” he said. “It’s unbelievable that despite having the funds available to fix this, councils are sitting on the money year after year, leaving the most vulnerable to suffer.”Polanski said the situation “reeks of complacency” and he blamed the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, for a failure to deliver a clear net zero plan.Tower Hamlets (£20m), Islington (£18.5m) and Westminster (£16.1m) councils have received the most offsetting cash from developers. Tower Hamlets has spent just over a quarter at £5.3m and Westminster has spent £2.4m – about 15%. Both say they have significantly more cash allocated for projects. Islington has spent £12.1m, the most of any London borough by some distance and about 65% of its pot.Isaac Beevor, a partnerships director at Climate Emergency UK, which monitors the climate action of councils across the country, said Khan needed to “get a grip” on his policy to achieve his target of a net zero London by 2030.Tower Hamlets has spent just over a quarter of the £20m it has received in carbon offset funds since 2016“This money could have been spent on retrofitting council homes, planting trees and greening our boroughs, or supporting community energy,” he said. “Some councils have utilised the fund, so there is no valid excuse for those who have spent the last decade refusing to spend a huge pile of cash destined for climate action. We would expect all London boroughs to be ramping up their climate action by spending this money.”He added: “This situation highlights flaws in these schemes: if funds aren’t spent, emissions from new developments have not been offset.”A City Hall spokesperson told the Guardian “urgent talks” were taking place with councils about speeding up the delivery of projects. They said the amount of money collected and spent by councils had been increasing year on year, but added: “A key challenge is the pipeline of deliverable projects available for funding.”London Councils, an umbrella group representing the capital’s boroughs, said there were “undoubtedly challenges to overcome” and pointed out that Khan’s recommended price of £95 for each tonne of carbon dioxide emitted had been devalued sinceit was set in 2021.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Councilstold the Greater London Authoritylast year that as well as lacking the required funding, they did not have the time, expertise or resources needed to get projects off the ground.London Councils has now launched a series of workshops to advise boroughs on how to spend the money.The majority of London councils charge developers the recommended £95/tonne CO2, but this is only a guide. As of last year, three Labour-run councils have started charging developers more – not with the aim of raising more cash, but to discourage offsetting, which the Climate Change Committee says “should not be relied on” to decarbonise buildings.Another 15 councilsare said to be looking into raising offsetting costs. Beevor has urged all councils to do this, saying it will encourage developers to hit net zero emissions on-site and remove the need for mitigation projects altogether.Merton council, which in 2003 introduced the pioneering“Merton rule”requiring new developments to generate 10% of their energy from renewables, now charges developers £300 per tonne of CO2. Lewisham has set a new price of £104, while Westminster now charges £330 for electric-based schemes and £880 for gas-based schemes.Haringey council in Februaryallocated all of its outstanding carbon offset fundingto projects including the Haringey Community Carbon Fund, which awards grants to community-led decarbonisation projects such as solar panel schemes, upcycling wood workshops, school uniform swaps and football boot recycling.Of London’s 33 local authorities, 28 declared a climate emergency in 2019 or 2020, announcing bold net zero targets and sweeping commitments to cut private vehicle use, divest pension funds from fossil fuel companies and improve energy efficiency of council housing.Last year, the Local Government Association found two-thirds of councils were not confident of hitting the net zero targets, saying climate action was being “strangled” by a complex web of hard-to-reach Whitehall funding pots.Explore more on these topicsCarbon offsettingGreenhouse gas emissionsLocal governmentLondon politicsLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Federal prosecutors said at trial that she had raised more than $70,000 for the statue of aLas Vegaspolice officer who was fatally shot in 2014 in the line of duty, but had instead spent it on cosmetic surgery, rent and her daughter’s wedding.Adelson, who is worth $35bn,spent $100mon re-electing Trump in 2024, but apparently decided not to intervene when the Review-Journal, Nevada’s largest newspaper, attacked him on Friday.The newspaper’s editorial criticized Trump’s pardon of Fiore, who was due to be sentenced next month, in no uncertain terms.“The pardon, which was brief and contained no explanation, is an affront to the federal jury that heard her case and sends precisely the wrong message to public officials tempted to enrich themselves through their sinecures,” the Review-Journal wrote.“In addition, pardons are typically reserved for those who were wrongly convicted or the victim of some other miscarriage of justice. There is no evidence that either occurred in this case. Instead, it’s difficult to argue that political considerations weren’t the primary motivation for granting relief to Ms Fiore.”Trump quietly pardoned Fiore, a firm supporter of his, on Wednesday, and the move only came to light after Fiore wrote about the clemency in a Facebook post. The White House confirmed the pardon, but did not elaborate further.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One survey found a majority describing the president’s second stint in the White House so far as “scary”.Along with poor ratings on the economy and Trump’s immigration policy, a survey released on Saturday found that only 24% of Americans believe Trump has focussed on the right priorities as president.That poll comes as Trump’s popularity is historically low for a leader this early in a term. More than half of voters disapprove of Trump’s performance as president, and majorities oppose histariff policiesand slashing of the federal workforce.The scathing reviews come as Trump next week marks 100 days of his second stint office, and suggest Americans are already experiencing fatigue after a period that has seen global financial market nosedives and chilling deportations, including of documented people.A poll by the Associated Press-Norc Center for Public Affairs Researchpublishedthis weekend, found that even Republicans are not overwhelmingly convinced that Trump’s attention has been in the right place.Republican unity to be tested in talks over Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’Read moreA narrow majority, 54%, ofRepublicanssurveyed said that Trump is focussed on the “right priorities”, while the president’s numbers with crucial independent voters are much weaker. Just 9% of independents said that the president is focussed on the right priorities – with 42% believing Trump is paying attention to the wrong issues.About four in 10 people in the survey, 39%, approve of how Trump is handling the presidency overall, and only about 40% of Americans approve of Trump’s approach to foreign policy, trade negotiations and the economy.Meanwhile, aNew York Times/Siena College pollof registered voters on Friday found that Trump’s approval rating is 42%, and just 29% among independent voters. More than half of voters said Trump is “exceeding the powers available to him”, and 59% of respondents said the president’s second term has been “scary”.While Republican leaders typically receive strong scores on economic issues, Americans have been underwhelmed by Trump’s performance. The Times survey found that only 43% of voters approve of how Trump is handling the economy – a stark turnaround from aTimes poll in April 2024, which found that 64% approved of Trump’s economy in his first term.Half of voters disapproved of Trump’s trade policies with other countries, and 61% said a president should not have the authority toimpose tariffswithout congressional approval, while the Times reported that 63% – including 40% of Republicans – said “a president should not be able to deport legal immigrants who have protested Israel”.Further on immigration, a Washington Post-ABC-Ipsos poll on Friday found that 53% of Americans now disapprove of the president’s handling of immigration matters, while 46% approve. In February the majority was the other way, with half of those surveyed approving of Trump’s approach on that issue.The Postreportedthat as support has drained away on this topic, at this point 90% of Democrats, 56% of independents and 11% of Republicans dislike the way Trump is dealing with immigration.The poor reviews have dogged Trump all week. An Associated Presspollon Thursday found that about half of US adults say that Trump’s trade policies will increase prices “a lot” and another three in 10 think prices could go up “somewhat”, and half of Americans are “extremely” or “very” concerned about the possibility of the US economy going into a recession in the next few months.Polling conducted by the Trump-friendly Fox News has brought little respite. A survey published on Wednesday found that just 38% of Americans approve of Trump on the economy, with 56% disapproving.The Fox News poll found that 58% of respondents disapproved of Trump’s performance, and 59% disapproved on inflation. Just three in 10 Americans said they believed Trump’s policies were helping the economy, and only four in 10 said Trump’s policies will help the country.Among generation Z, generally regarded as those born between 1995 and 2012, a staggering 69% told pollsters for anNBC Stay Tuned surveythat they don’t approve of Trump’s handling of the economy and the cost of living. Gen Z participants complained of struggling to even pay the rent in some places, let alone buy a home, and they worry about inflation.A minority of gen Z people polled thought the country would be stronger if more people lived by traditional binary gender roles and more than 90% of those polled said they believed foreign students with visas or green cards should have the same due process protections as US citizens. This comes amid the Trump administration declaring there are only two genders, male and female, andarresting and detainingsome pro-Palestinian student activists without due process.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpRepublicansUS politicsTrump administrationUS foreign policyUS economyUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The unorthodox policy and the frequent avoidance of due process has brought about aclash with the judicialbranch of the US government in a battle over the constitution.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), National Immigration Project and several other allied groups said in a statement that deporting children who are US citizens, as in these two cases, are a “shocking – although increasingly common – abuse of power”.US district judge Terry Doughty in Monroe,Louisiana, said the two-year-old girl, who was referred to as VML in court documents, was deported with her mother to Honduras.Denied, detained, deported: the most high-profile cases in Trump’s immigration crackdownRead more“It is illegal and unconstitutional to deport, detain for deportation, or recommend deportation of a US citizen,” said the judge.He scheduled a hearing for 19 May “in the interest of dispelling our strong suspicion that the government just deported a US citizen with no meaningful process”.VML was apprehended by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) on Tuesday with her mother, Jenny Carolina Lopez Villela, and older sister when Villela attended a routine appointment at itsNew Orleansoffice, according to a filing by Trish Mack, who said the child’s father asked her to act as the child’s custodian. The girl’s father is seeking to have her returned to the United States.Immigrants of all sorts with cases in process, pending appeals or parole, have routinely been required to regularlycheck in with Ice officers, sometimes for many years. And so long as they had not violated any regulations or committed any crimes, they were usually sent on their way. Now, as the Trump administration pushes for the massarrestanddeportationof immigrants, check-ins have become increasingly fraught.According to Mack, when VML’s father briefly spoke to Villela, he could hear her and the children crying. According to a court document, he reminded her that a US citizen “could not be deported”.However, prosecutors said Villela, who has legal custody, told Ice that she wanted to retain custody of the girl and take her toHonduras. They said the man claiming to be VML’s father had not presented himself to Ice despite requests to do so.VML is not prohibited from entering the US, federal prosecutors said..She was among two families deported from Louisiana, also including one pregnant woman, the advocacy groups noted.The Department of Homeland Security and the justice department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.“These actions stand in direct violation of Ice’s own written and informal directives, which mandate coordination for the care of minor children with willing caretakers – regardless of immigration status – when deportations are being carried out,” the ACLU said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She is still breastfeeding her daughter, who suffers from seizures, her lawyer, Claudia Cañizares, said.Cañizares said she tried to file paperwork with Ice to contest the deportation on Thursday morning but Ice refused to accept it, saying Sánchez was already gone. Sánchez is not a criminal and has a strong case on humanitarian grounds for staying in the US, Cañizares said.Donald Trump, whose presidential campaigns havefocused heavilyon immigration, said earlier this month he wanted to deport some violent criminals who are US citizens to El Salvadoran prisons, where he removed hundreds of Venezuelans and some Salvadorans last month without even a court hearing. He sent them toa brutal prisonfor suspected gangsters and terrorists, claiming they were all violent criminals when it has since been argued that most were not and even if they were they had the right to due process.The comments from Trump about sending US citizens or what he termed “home grown” criminals to another country to be incarcerated have alarmed civil rights advocates and is viewed by many legal scholars as unconstitutional.TheUS supreme courthas ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate and effectuate” the return of Maryland residentKilmar Ábrego García, whowas sentto the country on 15 March with hundreds of others despite a US court order protecting him from deportation.Opinion polls in the last week show Trumpstruggling for approvalwith voters who were surveyed, including on some of his hardline anti-immigration tactics.Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationLouisianaDonald TrumpUS politicsNew OrleansHondurasnewsShareReuse this content"

The complaint alleges that when the arrest team identified themselves to courthouse security, and waited in the public hallway outside Dugan’s courtroom, she confronted them and ordered them to report to the chief judge’s office. Then, according to a court officer cited in the complaint, Dugan directed the defendant and his lawyer to a side exit from the courtroom, which led to a private hallway.In responseto Dugan’s arrest, Representative Glenn Grothman, a Wisonsin Republican, accused Dugan of being a “liberal judge [who] would go so far as to obstruct federal law enforcement in order to protect a violent illegal immigrant from arrest”.Tony Wied, another Republican representative of Wisconsin in Congress, demanded Dugan’s resignation. “Absolutely unacceptable,” Wiedwrote, adding: “Not only are activist judges trying to thwart the president’s agenda, now they are actively breaking the law to protect illegal aliens. Judge Dugan should resign immediately.”Democrats, including Wisconsin’s governor, Tony Evers, condemned the FBI’s arrest of Dugan as an overreach of executive power by Donald Trump.Everssaid:“In this country, people who are suspected of criminal wrongdoing are innocent until their guilt is proven beyond reasonable doubt.” He went to add: “Unfortunately, we have seen in recent months the president and the Trump administration repeatedly use dangerous rhetoric to attack and attempt to undermine the judiciary at every level, including flat-out disobeying the highest court in the land and threatening to impeach and remove judges who do not rule in their favor.”Referencing the US president and the White House’s own messaging of likening Trumpto a king, the state’s Democratic senator, Tammy Baldwin,said: “Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country … By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this president is putting those basic Democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No double standards.”But Wisconsin’s Democratic representative Gwen Moorecounteredthat what she called the administration’s “willingness to weaponize federal law enforcement is shocking and this arrest has all the hallmarks of overreach. Federal law enforcement coming into a community and arresting a judge is a serious matter and would require a high legal bar.”Milwaukee’s city council members also released a statement,saying:“Perhaps the most chilling part of judge Dugan’s arrest is the continued aggression by which the current administration in Washington DC has weaponized federal law enforcement, such as ICE, against immigrant communities.”Similarly, Milwaukee county board supervisor, Miguel Martinez,said: “The people will not stand for an administration that continues to weaponize our justice system as a means to intimidate immigrant communities, made clear by the cumulative actions over recent weeks.”Becca Balint, a Vermont Democrat who sits on the House judiciary committee,toldAxios that there should “absolutely” be a probe into Dugan’s arrest. “On the face of it, this is dangerous and outrageous and it is designed to intimidate our judiciary,” she said.Her fellow House judiciary committee member, Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin,said: “This is a drastic escalation and dangerous new front in Trump’s authoritarian campaign of trying to bully, intimidate and impeach judges who won’t follow his dictates.”“We must do whatever we can to defend the independent judiciary in America … This is an unmistakable descent further into authoritarian chaos,” he added.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsWisconsinUS immigrationFBInewsShareReuse this content"

They worry that a huge industrial project would bury the great resurrection. And it’s only the latest crisis with which they have grappled.For all its grandeur and rocking street pageants,New Orleansfaced another crisis after theNew Year’s Day terrorist attackkilled 14 on its globally famed Bourbon Street. Would the killings turn away tourists? The city doubled down on security as it hosted the NFL’sSuper Bowlin February, with help from the state government. Lavish media coverage followed. The city rolled into Mardi Gras in early March, with crowded parades, nightclubs, restaurants and art galleries, a healthy boost for New Orleans’s $8bn tourist economy.Yet to come: the bittersweet 20th-anniversary commemoration ofHurricane Katrina, when the city nearly drowned on global television. On 29 August 2005, the 175mph winds drove a 25ft water surge from the Gulf of Mexico up 90 miles of ragged wetlands, smashing the federal levee system, flooding an area seven times the size of Manhattan. In the city’s Black-majority Ninth Ward,people on rooftops pleaded for rescue as bloated bodies lay below. A subsequent federal investigation faulted the US army corps of engineers for negligent operation of the levees. “The worst engineering catastrophe in US history,” said a national engineers’ society.The army corps operates a shipping link known as the “industrial canal” that runs from the Mississippi River levee five miles north to Lake Pontchartrain, dividing the ward into the Upper and Lower Ninth. During Katrina, an unloosed barge shattered the canal’s protective wall. Water gushed across the sprawling Lower Ninth Ward, more than 20ft high in places, spilling into the adjacent suburban community of St Bernard parish, where levees also broke.View image in fullscreenAn aerial image shows the industrial canal along Jourdan Avenue in the Lower Ninth Ward neighborhood of New Orleans in 2021.Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesThough poor and scarred by crime, the Lower Ninth Ward had a 61% home ownership rate, the city’s highest. But many dwellings with mortgages paid had no insurance. The area fell into dense overgrowth for years. Slowly, the gritty rebuilding began. A strain of gentrification came with writers and artists seeking affordable spaces. Today’s Lower Ninth Ward – population 5,000 – is two-thirds less populous than it was in 2005.The same army engineers who were responsible for the levee failures that redefined the Lower Ninth Ward after Katrina now oversee river-related projects with the port ofNew Orleans, a political subdivision of the state that is one of Louisiana’s most powerful institutions. Its portfolio of warehouses, wharves and other properties earn rent, while fees from cargo, cruise ships and railroads add to its projected 2025 revenue of $27m. A public hearing on 20 February reviewed one of the big ticket projects being pursued by the entity that markets itself as PortNOLA.Such gatherings rarely draw 50 hostile people, such as those who came that day from Holy Cross, named for a high school of stately brick which was displaced by Katrina damage. The community now consists of condos and apartments along the levee, a linear park with riverine vistas for families, kids, dogs and joggers.Survivor of notorious New Orleans child sex abuser priest speaks out for first timeRead moreThese community members know their history. And they worry those spinning the project as an industrial victory for the region could annihilate a post-Katrina comeback symbol – as well as a vital bohemian enclave of the arts – in the process.The project at issue involves an empty warehouse on the levee, a facility known as the Alabo Street wharf. It is being leased to Sunrise Foods International, a Canadian multinational with plans to rebuild it into a terminal for importing organic grain from foreign ports. A spokesperson told the Guardian the port had spent $37m through January on preliminary engineering design and permit support. It has also spent $3.3m for upgrading a long-dormant Norfolk Southern rail line which will take cargo on Alabo Street to link with tracks on the median of St Claude Avenue, a main Ninth Ward thoroughfare.At an open house last fall, residents decried the prospect of 24 rail crossings, sirens, clanging bells, traffic gridlock and trains trundling over streets where children play. “This has never been about where we are as a stabilizing community,” said the Rev Willie Calhoun of the Fairview Mission Baptist church. Calhoun called the project’s plans as presented by the port, Sunrise and Norfolk Southern “a dog and pony show”.Calhoun and others joined Stop the Grain Train, the name of a movement led by small business owner Jeffrey Wittenbrink. Findings the group acquired through Freedom of Information Act requests stoked complaints about secrecy. Sunrise has since posted a study insisting grain dust will not be a threat. But Calhoun unloaded grain as a longshoreman in the 1970s after air force duty in Vietnam, and he said: “Grain dust is not good for anybody. I asked Sunrise about their system to get it out of the terminal into the railcar. They said they were still in design. How do you permit it without an environmental impact statement?”An army corps of engineers spokesperson told the Guardian that the agency had not received two of the relevant permit applications for the wharf project.Wittenbrink’s group met with city council members seeking help. Soon thereafter, council member-at-large Helena Moreno, a candidate for mayor in October, wrote to the port chief executive officer, Beth Ann Branch. Moreno cited residents’ “fear regarding safety, health and noise issues, as well as concerns about the devaluation of their property and the potential destruction of their neighborhood if the grain terminal project proceeds”.Branch declined the Guardian’s interview request. However, the port of New Orleans press secretary provided information to the outlet.On 20 February, Branch and five board members sat for an hour of comment, listening.One Holy Cross resident, Patricia Ordinate, held a walker and told the officials they were “destroying an entire neighborhood”. “It’s criminal and inhuman!” she said.Jolie Robichaux said: “We moved to Holy Cross for peacefulness. We have not heard a plan for safety!”Another man cried, “You should all be ashamed,” while accusing the port of withholding information.Jennifer Ward sat holding a Stop the Grain Train sign. With a long background as a curator for galleries, she did not testify. A Holy Cross homeowner, Ward leases an 11,000-sq-ft building called Art Conscious, a ground floor gallery and upstairs print and framing business, in Arabi, a St Bernard village just below the Lower Ninth. Ward has six employees and is hiring. Her home and larger business have a combined value of $1.5m, she told the Guardian.Suspects of Super Bowl reporter’s death allegedly planned drug-and-steal schemes for yearsRead moreWard said her home value on Zillow had fallen $40,000 since the port plan became public, though a direct correlation is impossible to gauge. “I am scared to death that if this area goes industrial, what I have made here will be lost,” Ward said after the hearing.“This plan is an atrocity after everything the neighborhood has survived,” Gary Lavigne, a Ninth Ward historic renovation builder, told the Guardian.As residents filed out of the port hearing, Branch congratulated board member James Carter – a Black attorney and former city council member – for having been named the honorary king of a carnival parade.A renaissance arts districtAs TR Johnson – an English professor at New Orleans’ Tulane University – sees it, the Ninth Ward “has replaced the French Quarter as a catalyst of New Orleans arts”.“This cluster of neighborhoods … has evolved into an enclave of artistic production that marked the French Quarter from the 1920s through the 70s,” he says.A look at some of the area’s residents supports the notion that it is a renaissance district. They include the distinguished Mexican novelist Yuri Herrera (a Tulane professor), author most recently of Season of the Swamp; the painter Regina Scully, whose 2017 New Orleans Museum of Art exhibit made her Japanese-inspired cityscapes a hot item with collectors and galleries across the country; and Leyla McCalla, the pop singer and cellist formerly with the Grammy-winning Carolina Chocolate Drops.To name a few others, there is also bestselling novelist Jami Attenberg; African American photographers Chandra McCormick and husband Keith Calhoun; Black Masking Indian artist Demond Melancon, who won the 1858 Prize for contemporary southern art; environmental photographer Ben Depp; members of RAM, the Haitian rock band; singer Dawn Richards; the memoirist Anne Gisleson; painter Gina Phillips; and film documentarian Katherine Cecil.View image in fullscreenDamage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005.Photograph: David G SpielmanThe resurgent cultural footprint stretches across the city line into St Bernard, whose population of 40,000 is down from 75,000 in 2005. Arabi, the site of Ward’s Art Conscious building, is a slow-tempo section of St Bernard with artists’ studios scattered about. It is home to the Ranch, a film production soundstage. In adjacent Chalmette, a repurposed Ford auto plant developed by attorney and arts patron Sidney Torres III is an arts center on the National Register of Historic Places.PortNOLA’s expansion plan includes the multibillion-dollarLouisianaIndustrial Terminal (LIT) in Violet, a community 8.6 miles south of Arabi. Servicing the superport will require crushing an 1,100-acre cypress and wetlands forest to erect an elevated highway for 1,728 industrial trucks to travel 17 miles daily to Interstate 10. PortNOLA has invested $107m in site acquisition and other costs.Irony hovers here like a mushroom cloud. The LIT is in a $14bn federally funded flood protection zone the army corps of engineers executed in upgrading the levees post-Katrina. The port’s LIT budget of $1.8bn includes $300m in federal funds. But it requires a permit by the army corps which, if approved, would then have the agency gutting its own post-Katrina remedial work through dredging and facilitating destruction of the coastal forest, a storm-surge buffer.The wheel of history rolls backwards in this scenario.‘Ghost kitchens’, fast casual and higher prices: how the pandemic changed the US restaurant industryRead moreIn 1963, the port and the army corps, with locals’ support, began dredging for the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet – or MR-GO, a 76-mile artery – with Congress’s approval as an alternate shipping route downriver to the Gulf of Mexico. Construction wrecked a forest of cypress trees and tidal wetlands, a buffer to storm surges comprising more than 23,000 acres in St Bernard. MR-GO opened a sluiceway for Hurricane Betsy’s Gulf waters barreling into the city in 1965, with deep flooding in parts of St Bernard and the Lower Ninth Ward. Seventy-six people died in Betsy, thefirst stormof $1bn in assessed damages. More than 160,000 homes flooded, with bodies found in scattered attics.Forty years later, Katrina’s storm surge followed a similar route, wreaking far greater damage in the Ninth Ward and St Bernard in terms of death, cost and population loss. Today’s New Orleans of 357,767 people is down from the 484,674 in 2005. Many residents were too poor to move back after the natural disaster. “MR-GO never delivered the results its boosters promised,” writes the historian Craig Colten, citing a meager impact of “about 3% of the New Orleans port’s freight tonnage”. In 2009, by political consensus, the corps began filling inMR-GO, as the wetlands’ reseeding began.St Bernard officials oppose the Violet superport. Torres, an attorney, in challenging the plan cites a PortNOLA public notice that 1.8m cubic yards of “native materials will be excavated and filled with” nearly 3.9m cubic yards of river sand.Torres in a legal motion said there would also be nearly 2.4m cubic yards of crushed stone and paving with more than 1m cubic yards of thick reinforced concrete. “Debris removal and stone must be trucked,” he said. “The existing vital forest will become a giant concrete hardscape covered by over 14m tons of materials. There is no reversing the impacts of this environmental devastation.”Advising St Bernard’s local government, architect-engineer John Vickerman is a maritime consultant based in Williamsburg, Virginia, specializing in freight logistics for heavy cargo ports across the globe. Vickerman did consulting for PortNOLA on a 2017 plan. He evinces a trace of scorn, calling the Violet LIT project “risky” in a Guardian interview. “Consider the environmental risk of some 1,700 container trucks a day to transport ship cargo” to I-10, he said. Vickerman cited downriver sites in the community of Plaquemines parish that have “better connections to road or rail”.Vickerman’s report argues that the river dimensions at Violet can’t accommodate mega-ton supercargo ships without help from outsize tugboats to literally turn around before leaving the dock, meaning “82% of the navigational river traffic would be completely blocked during vessel departures from LIT”. Vickerman’s document criticized PortNOLA for “neglect[ing] to conduct and/or share crucial project due diligence information and justification analysis to rigorously evaluate and justify the LIT” proposal.“The permit application for the proposed LIT project in Violet is still in review,” an army corps spokesperson said in an email. The spokesperson said the applicant was working through an environmental assessment and that the agency anticipated hosting a public hearing in the summer “to gather … feedback on the permit application”.Resurrection tidesNew Orleans seduced the Kentucky-born artist Gina Phillips, who earned a master’s in fine arts at Tulane in the late 1990s. As her works gained sales and critical notice, she put down funds in 2004 on a blighted house in the Lower Ninth Ward as part of a Federal Housing Authority package for first-time buyers. Just off the river, Phillips’s lot abutted an earthen levee along the industrial canal. She plunged into long days of sweat-equity repair work. With paintings that explore southern identity, she liked the Lower Ninth quilt of churches, shotgun houses and vegetable gardens. Some folks raised chickens. Some hunted rabbits and squirrels in the savannah near the back swamp by Bayou Bienvenue. Six days before Katrina, with work nearly done, Phillips visited friends in Richmond, Virginia. She was heartsick less than a week later realizing her house was underwater.Custody spat over New Orleans escape-artist dog settled with visitation agreementRead moreA mile down from Phillips’s place, the late rock and R&B legend Fats Domino and his wife raised eight children in a baronial home with an adjacent shotgun house. The army corps’ harbor patrol vessels rescued Fats and his family from the Katrina flood. They soon made it to Baton Rouge to stay with friends. When Domino moved back to a New Orleans suburb, graffiti on his old house reading “RIP Fats We Love You” became a must-stop on “disaster tour” buses from downtown hotels, tourists agog at the Lower Ninth’s washed-out streets, feral dogs and cats roaming trash mounds. About a million people in and around New Orleans evacuated. Many took years to rebuild their homes, with $3.3bn in federal aid for homeowners who were underinsured.In July 2006, Phillips began a long slog of renegotiating loans, dealing with the Road Home federal assistance program. “I didn’t have flood insurance because it was in a so-called safe zone.” She had $90,000 invested when the flood hit. Road Home eventually paid $150,000. After restoring an 1,100-sq-ft house, she built a studio in the yard with oak trees. She calculates their value at $500,000, “but that’s arbitrary if the army corps ends up widening the industrial canal”, she said. “Who wants to live next to a multiyear construction zone?”View image in fullscreenA painting from Gina Phillips’s Fats Domino series.Photograph: Will Crocker/Gina PhillipsAfter the federal report on its levee failures, and litigation from citizens’ groups, the army corps has moved slowly on an envisioned $1bn new lock for the industrial canal. It is now projected to take 13 years. Members of a group billing itselfthe Canal Will Kill Nolaattend meetings with hard questions. A short documentary featuring Dr Joshua Lewis of Tulane University’s ByWater Institute for Coastal Studies captures the history of hurricane destruction abetted by flawed development projects such as MR-GO.“The lock replacement would devastate neighborhoods on both sides of the canal for an unknown period of time,” said Sam Bowler, a Lower Ninth Ward metal sculptor and community organizer. Residents fear that the lock work, which involves widening parts of the artery, will crack their walls and foundations and affect home values and quality of life. “We keep asking, ‘How long will it take? What’s the impact of pile driving?’ They have to demolish a gigantic amount of underwater concrete. The levee walls have failed twice [in 1965 and 2005]. They’re asking for a third shot. Really? The alternative is to find another navigational route.”In 2008, Phillips began her Fats Domino series, an exhibition over several years celebrating the Lower Ninth’s most famous resident as a resurrection symbol. The legendary singer died in 2017. The family’s restored home faces the renamed Fats Domino Avenue, just above the city line and the Arabi arts district.From England to the Lower NinthRaised in Dorset, in the south of England, Katherine Cecil lives today with her children, ages 12 and seven, in a steamboat gothic house a block from the river in the Lower Ninth. The kids ride bikes on the levee. Ship foghorns boom like basso profundo bullfrogs. “Sometimes you hear bullets at night – but the birds sing in the morning, making it rather idyllic,” Cecil said.In the early 2000s, while studying for a master’s degree in literature at Tulane, Cecil grew intrigued by the city as a cultural crossroads and transitioned into documentary work. She filmed the 2006 mayor’s race. The incumbent, Ray Nagin, a Black businessman who won in 2002 with 86% of the white vote and 38% of African Americans, cast himself as a post-Katrina populist, advocating for displaced Black people. He defeated the liberal Mitch Landrieu, at the time the lieutenant governor, with 83% of the Black vote and a mere 21% of whites. Cecil’s documentary, Race, shows the election as a referendum on Blacks’ right of return. Nagin never delivered once re-elected. Unable to run again after his second term, he went to prison for bribery. Landrieu won in 2010 and led a major rebuilding of the broken city before becoming the White House’s infrastructure czar during Joe Biden’s presidency.View image in fullscreenA tug boat pushes a barge with construction equipment up the Mississippi River past the Alabo Street wharf in New Orleans.Photograph: UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesPortNOLA’s plans for the Alabo wharf, some six blocks down the levee from her house, haunt Cecil for its parallels with herwork-in-progress: the multi-platform Claiborne Avenue History Project, with Dr Raynard Sanders, an urban scholar.In the mid-1960s, amid the civil rights movement and before Blacks voted en masse, the city tore down several miles of stately oak trees on the grassy neutral ground of North Claiborne, the crosstown avenue with an industrial canal bridge between the Upper and Lower Ninth Wards. Bulldozing the vertical park saw scores of Black businesses on Claiborne sacrificed for a highway overpass that linked the suburbs to the French Quarter and downtown business district. The Tremé neighborhood lost a quarter of its population and was economically devastated for years.“Most residents who saw the oaks go down are elderly and don’t remember much opposition,” Cecil said. “Dodie Smith-Simmons, a legendary activist, told us they were too busy fighting for civil rights to realize what the city was doing. There is a similarity with the port and Alabo. These infrastructure projects are presented as done deals with almost no opportunity for public comment. The port began the train tracks here before an environmental evaluation. In the 60s, the city made no effort to solicit input from people; the bulldozers came out of nowhere.”Saying “there’s a stealth aspect to this”, Cecil called for a moratorium until “a fully objective environmental evaluation can be done” on dust control and cost management.What it takes to raise a neighborhoodThe Louisiana national guard’s Jackson barracks – brick buildings on a lush lawn – lie on St Claude Avenue just before the city line where Arabi begins. The Rev Willie Calhoun lives seven blocks from there on Delery Street, by his childhood home. He recalls the 1960s’ Lower Ninth Ward as a “tight neighborhood fabric, [with] close families”.Louisiana coerced unhoused people into an unheated warehouse – and paid $17.5m for itRead moreThe pastor, his wife and mother evacuated before Katrina. The flood reached 20ft there. “I rebuilt my house and my mother’s from the ground up,” Calhoun said. “The bonus God gave me was the years I had left with my mom.”The man “around the corner, he drowned. One of my schoolmates, she and her sister drowned in the attic. On this block now we have four houses and seven empty lots.”Calhoun worked 32 years with the Federal Aviation Administration. “I retired in order to rebuild. Insurance paid $100,000. Road Home gave me $47,000. The gentleman who did my claim said I hadoverbuiltfor the area – it would be $300,000 to rebuild. Before the flood I was debt-free. To rebuild, I had to take [a small business loan] I’m still paying on today.”View image in fullscreenGeorge W Bush tours reconstruction efforts at the Louisiana national guard Jackson barracks in New Orleans on 20 August 2008.Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesHe estimated perhaps five of more than 50 non-profits “that came here after the storm … are left”.“Even though properties here are dirt cheap, it’s expensive to rebuild,” he said. “We haven’t gained an understanding of what it takes to raise a neighborhood. I guess that’s why they figure they can industrialize it – and why we keep fighting.”Several blocks away from Calhoun’s home, on a street near the Jackson barracks, Regina Scully has a grassy yard and rebuilt house where she has lived and worked for nearly a decade. Her sister, novelist Helen Scully, is finishing a law degree at Loyola University New Orleans and lives nearby.Regina Scully’s odyssey is one parable of the Lower Ninth.Domestic installations out on the streetRaised in Virginia, Scully studied at the Rhode Island School of Design. In 2004, after several years in New York, she moved to New Orleans, where her mother, sister and brother had gone. Her father had taken a job as a Loyola University dean.Her work back then focused on “abstract figures, very psychological and large in composition,” shesaidin a 2021 interview with the Artful Mindmagazine.As Katrina bore down, she went to Mobile, where her mother had family. She returned months later to the flood-battered city. Helping friends dig out to salvage their homes, she took photographs of castoff toys, coat hangers, lampshades, tricycle parts. Her paintings took a sharp realistic turn in abstract style.In 2008, she began a master’s in fine arts at the University of New Orleans. She soon found space to paint with a job managing a bed-and-breakfast in Bywater, the Upper Ninth neighborhood of Victorian cottages and camelback houses with tropical yards, cheek to jowl with Greek revival manses, warehouses and old stores being repurposed as homes and studios. Meanwhile, across St Claude Avenue, Habitat for Humanity was building houses in the upstart Musicians’ Village, today an Upper Ninth entertainment hub.Scully felt a metaphysical pull to the Lower Ninth, photographing “dead houses and strewn shapes, like domestic installations out on the street, and it shook everything up for me”. She reflected one recent afternoon, surrounded by paints, brushes and varied objects arrayed throughout her front rooms and kitchen. A cat lounged in the yard outside the screen door. Scully spoke of being fixated on “how water can be so destructive and yet so beautiful”. Her style evolved into vistas of water melding with shards of land, objects and people mixed into the flow, sensations of beauty amid destruction.View image in fullscreenMindscape15, by Regina Scully.Photograph: Gary Michael Gittelson/Courtesy of Regina ScullyHer break came in a 2011 exhibition, Double Crescent, of five New Orleans artists and five from Istanbul, chosen by the influential New York curator Dan Cameron. In the catalogue, Cameron calls her work a “representation of the Gulf Coast environment, its strong symbiosis between land and water and its ongoing dialogue between gestation and decay … a world where boundaries keep shifting”.She moved to the Lower Ninth in 2016, paying $225,000 for a 3,000-sq-ft house that is mostly work space. “Basically,” she said, “I was priced out of Bywater because the studio rent kept going up along with the home prices.”In 2017, at 42, Scully had a major exhibition at the New Orleans Museum of Art, Japanese Landscape: Inner Journeys. Having never visited Japan, she did intense study in the museum’s archives, focusing on the animated, abstract landscapes of Nangaartists in the Edo period (1603-1868) known for fluid brushwork in black ink. Memories of the flood shadowed Scully’s immersion in the Japanese style. “She considers the beauty of nature, its vastness, and its potential destruction,” wrote Lisa Rotondo McCord, Noma’s curator for asian art, “pushing the boundaries of her practice to explore different environments and spaces within”.Life in the Lower Ninth was not always pastoral. A drive-by shooting near Scully’s house several years ago was jarring. But, she said, “I don’t hear many gunshots today”, perhaps a reflection of an overall drop in violent crime that the city has reported.Scully is still pushing boundaries. She recently severed ties with her local gallery and sells her work via referrals from her website. Every few weeks, high-end collectors drive past the Alabo wharf and visit her house to see pieces that range in price from the low to upper five figures.Most of her neighbors are Black. “This is a flourishing place,” she said. “My neighbors and I get along well. The creative spirit is strong but has a delicacy as it grows.“If the Alabo development goes through it would cut up these neighborhoods, and we’d be crushed by the pollutants and noise.”Options and issuesJean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville founded New Orleans in 1718 on an oxbow of the great river for its geo-strategic value, 90 miles upriver from the Gulf. He ignored French engineers advocating for Biloxi, Mississippi, and broke ground near present-day Jackson Square, securing the city’s raison d’etre. Even with the fusion of the climate crisis, sea rise and land subsidence, the river is an economic lifeblood. The port of south Louisiana, with 54 docks along the lower Mississippi,ranksfirst nationally in key indices of cargo.But the separate PortNOLA, once a pre-eminent docking area in stand-alone terms, has been steadily slipping. It ranks 15th of the top 30 individual ports, well behind the top five: Los Angeles, Newark, California’s Long Beach, Georgia’s Savannah and Houston in overall cargo. Several reasons explain this. For one, New Orleans’s Crescent City Connection, the bridge across the Mississippi to its west bank suburbs, is not high enough to facilitate supersized cargo ships – and proximity to rail and trucking lines is also key.Population is another factor pivotal to an economy supporting a major port. Houston has been growing for years. New Orleans is well behind its pre-Katrina population. But unlike the 2010s, when young people flocked here for jobs with digital startups, it has seen a decrease of 6.65% since the 2020 census, according to the World Population Review. In 2020, it had 383,997 people. Today the figure is about 357,767. Those 26,000 exiles, part of 50,000 who left Louisiana, departed for better jobs, less costly housing and more affordable insurance – and to escape hurricanes, according to various studies.Rebuilding a population turns on promoting the promise of life. New Orleans’ historic appeal has been a rooted culture with an authentic quality of life. To that end, the Lower Ninth and St Bernard stand as miracles of American resilience.View image in fullscreenDestroyed homes in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.Photograph: David G SpielmanThe port of Plaquemines downriver from Violet hasproposeda joint venture with PortNOLA to place the superport at its facility. How the major investment in Violet would be recouped is a sticking point. Louisiana’s governor, Jeff Landry, has remained neutral. The Avondale shipyard on the Mississippi River’s west bank in the New Orleans area suburban community of Jefferson parish is potentially an alternative site for the grain terminal.PortNOLA’s two-pronged plan for the Alabo wharf and the Violet super-terminal reflects the politics of mid-20th-century urban renewal – and high-scale land use that prized economic development over expendable communities. Many such projects sacrificed sustainable neighborhoods for highways as well as river and industrial expansion. Today’s research-driven impact statements and regional planning bodies weigh past mistakes – like disasters – in gauging benefits to citizens in the way.The secrecy behind the port’s logic of “start building, get permissions later” ignited a political firestorm with the leading contenders for mayor. Council members Helena Moreno and Oliver Thomas, a son of the Ninth Ward, united against the Alabo plan. For the army corps of engineers to greenlight PortNOLA’s permits means reversing its post-Katrina agenda of protecting the city, with a cynical wink and nod to plans that would smash two areas that beat the odds as comeback zones with the Mississippi River central to the fabric of their respective neighborhoods.Jeffrey Wittenbrink, the Ninth Ward activist, invokes a long-rangeplan, Redeveloping the Crescent, a prize-winning study of a repurposed riverfront advanced by local architects in 2008. The plan envisions sequenced spaces along the levee as a greenway from the French Quarter down to St Bernard. The Alabo wharf, says Wittenbrink, would be one hub of the linear park and become a magnet for building population in affordable neighborhoods with economies of scale.For Wittenbrink, the solution lies in purchasing enough of PortNOLA’s property in the Lower Ninth to engineer a shift in location to Avondale Global Gateway, the port across the river on the west bank with a 200-acre industrial site. That would mean a joint venture among the port, Sunrise Foods and Avondale far from residential areas. PortNOLA and Sunrise could amicably terminate their lease. “They would both make money,” he said.Wittenbrink thinks the conversion of the Alabo wharf and nearby port properties would facilitate restaurants and spaces for concerts and workshops, anchoring the comeback. “If the port and its board are open to selling the property, including two warehouses off Alabo wharf, it offers little downside,” he said.His group is working on a prospectus to seek “public and philanthropic funding sources” – about $60m.Based on meetings he’s had with people on different sides, Wittenbrink says he thinks “the port would seriously consider this if we can come up with the money”. He refused to disclose details.In a city as poor as New Orleans, $60m is a tough hunt. Yet in real world terms, it’s rocket fuel for the resurrection zone the rest of the world wrote off years ago as a lost cause at the bottom of America.Jason Berry is the author of City of a Million Dreams, a history of New Orleans and subject of a documentary film to be released in AugustExplore more on these topicsNew OrleansShipping industryLouisianaHurricane KatrinaInfrastructurenewsShareReuse this content"

Over just 138 pages, a passing dream next to the Heritage Foundation’s922-page doorstop, Graham considers the origins of Project 2025, its aims and effects so far.There’s a reason Project 2025 came out so long.“They’re looking at a 100-year timeframe,” Graham said. “They’re looking at things from the New Deal and saying, ‘This is where the government went wrong, and we need to fix these things. We need to change them permanently and reframe what the government does and what its relationship with every American is.’”The New Deal is the name given to the vast expansion of the federal government under Franklin D Roosevelt in the 1930s, in response to the Great Depression and laying the foundation of the modern US state.Project 2025 waspublishedin 2023. As the 2024 election loomed, Democrats raised alarms about its hardline policy recommendations on issues including climate, LGBTQ+ rights, reproductive healthcare and more.Incendiary rhetoricraised awareness too. Kevin Roberts, Heritage president and author of the Project 2025foreword, said he and his allies were “in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be”, then peppered his own book with images of fire and destruction. In praise of Roberts, JD Vance, Donald Trump’s running mate, said it was time to “load the muskets”.To Graham, such bellicose rhetoric was “terrifying” but also, in retrospect, a clear signpost to things to come. “To say that publicly before the election is really a strange public relations choice. It’s such a chilling thing to say. But you know, it told us what they wanted.”Amid controversy, Trumptried to distance himselffrom Project 2025 and its authors. But then he won the election. At the outset of his second term, he duly unleashed slashing cuts to federal staffing and budgets and a barrage of executive orders advancing policies directly linked to Project 2025 or firmly in its spirit.Graham is anaward-winningreporter, used to working fast. He started writing The Project “at the very end of November”, weeks after Trump defeated Kamala Harris, “and turned the book in in mid-January”.He wrote the book, he said, because “we the press, we the American public, had talked a lot about Project 2025 during the election, and it felt like it had kind of gone away – but it remained really relevant. And I felt like there was a lot in it that I didn’t understand, and a lot that had been missed.”During the 2024 election, experts did indeed advise that such policy plans for possible administrations have existed for decades but have rarely been enacted. The sheer size of Project 2025 might also have lulled some into a false sense of security. Like many reporters, Graham “had dabbled in parts of it”. Unlike many, he found “it was a different experience to read the whole thing altogether.“I think it is both more radical in some ways than it came across – like, when you’re just reading atomized policies, you don’t get what a social program it is – [but] one of the other things that I think is interesting is how there are ideas that I think are either [only] fairly objectionable or might have widespread appeal, right next to ones that are totally out in right field. You’ll be in the same paragraph or in the same chapter.“And the third thing I think is interesting is the way there are disagreements within the text, either between the authors or between the authors andDonald Trump. Those cleavages within the right I think are worth paying attention to now.”Trump opponents looking for cleavages will not find them in the influential office of management and budget, now directed by Russ Vought, a Christian nationalist,advocateof “traumatizing” political enemies, and Project 2025 co-author. The original director of Project 2025, Paul Dans, fell victim to political necessity in 2024, forced out of the Heritage Foundation as Trump came under pressure – but remains a true believer, recentlydeclaringTrump’s actions in office to be beyond his “wildest dreams”.But there is also Elon Musk. The world’s richest man has led Trump’s so-called department of government efficiency, or Doge, inattacking federal agenciesand departments with startling speed and recklessness.“This is one of the places I have been most surprised,” Graham said, “because I think the methods that they lay out [in Project 2025] are really important. I thought that an important part of this was going to be how deeply people like Russ Vought had thought about, ‘OK, how can we work within the bounds of the law to achieve these things? How can we rework the bureaucracy?’ And in fact, Musk came in and just blasted right through it and made it a lot easier for them, and a lot faster. I certainly didn’t expect that. It’s not contemplated in the book or in the original document.”Nor are Trump’s beloved tariffs much loved by Project 2025 and its free-trade-loving authors.Graham said: “There are these big differences within Project 2025. The most obvious place is the chapters on tariffs … they [also] disagree with Trump on Ukraine. They’re much more hawkish on Ukraine, and anti-Russia. You have this sort of standard, ‘We stand up for Israel, We oppose Iran,’ sort of thing, but foreign policy is barely mentioned. It’s all about China. And Trump talks the talk on China, but then many of the things he’s doing, like tariffs, which are discussed in Project 2025 but not as a major priority, are alienating the rest of the world, which makes it very hard to take on China.“But then, even something as small as how to handle childcare, you have different people having different views [within Project 2025]. One of the things that jumps out at me is they did a really good job of figuring out how to meld these longstanding social and religious conservative priorities on to Maga. They find places where they can work with Trump.Trump is very interested in talking about trans rights and Democrats, and men are very interested in fighting back much more broadly on gender norms, LGBTQ+ rights, and so … Project 2025 becomes sort of like a tip of the spear to get Trump’s attention. They care about “wokeness”, and DEI, maybe for different reasons than he does, but they’ll attack that, and it gets him onboard.On another key issue of Trump’s second term, Graham sees the White House and the ideologues of Project 2025 much more closely aligned.Project 2025 is “very focused on illegal immigration, but also on legal immigration. Overall, the point is to have fewer people who are born overseas in the US, by whatever means necessary. And so they talk about mass deportation, and they talk about detention centers, but they also talk about reducing the number of visas that people get and trying to … find people who have lied on their citizenship applications, to revoke citizenship, denaturalization.“There are things where you see maybe not a direct correlation but the same spirit. So we see in Project 2025 an argument that we need to crack down on student visas from quote, unquote, unfriendly countries, and use student visas as a sort of tool of political warfare.”Trump may not be implementing Project 2025 word for word but its authors have much to delight them. Conversely, Graham’s book is sprinkled with lines that prompt grim laughter.Consider the case of James Sherk, a Trump adviser on civil service and labor issues in the first term who drafted “Schedule F”, a proposal to reclassify about 50,000 civil service jobs as political, thereby allowing a president to fire such people at will. Under Joe Biden, Schedule F was shelved. Ahead of Trump’s second term, Project 2025 advocated putting it swiftly to use.Last year, Sherkspoke to ProPublica. “The notion we’re going to can 50,000 people is just insane,” he said. “Why would you do that? That would kneecap your ability to implement your agenda.”Under Trump,more than 260,000government workers have been fired, taken buyouts or retired early.The Project ispublished in the USby Random HouseExplore more on these topicsProject 2025Donald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now often you’ll walk around and have nobody else there. It feels empty. You definitely feel the absence of life on those lots.”‘It’s a gut punch’: how the California wildfires affected film and TV workersRead moreLike theonce proud industrial factoriesof the midwest, the dream factories of southern California are in decline. Last year was the worst for on-location filming in Los Angeles since tracking began 30 years ago apart from pandemic-hit 2020. Of all the TV shows and feature films that North American audiences watch, only one-fifth are now made in California.This is because Hollywood is facing intense competition for film production from domestic rivals such as Atlanta and New York, and international challengers such asAustralia,BritainandCanada, all offering more aggressive financial incentives. California’s politicians stand accused of resting on their laurels too long.Donald Trump has a plan but, critics say, it will be no more effective for Hollywood than his notorious tariffs for the rust belt. The US president’s appointment of the actorsMel Gibson, Sylvester Stallone and Jon Voight(combined age 233) as “special ambassadors” to rescue the local industry met with widespread scepticism. Instead campaigners are focused on the hard graft of legislating new tax incentives in California’s state government.Scarpa, whose recent credits include Gladiator II and Napoleon, adds: “The state and the city are both struggling with big fiscal issues and in a way it becomes an arms race: is LA going to be able to compete with eastern Europe? We have the best people in the world here but often producers find themselves shopping for the best price. If LA wants to remain a hub of production, they’re going to have to have some form of tax incentives to compete with them.”Hollywood has been synonymous with film for more than a century. Southern California’s sunny weather allowed year-round outdoor filming while land and labour were cheaper than in eastern cities. Film-makers such asCecil B DeMilleand companies such as Paramount and Universal set up studios that ensured a creative ecosystem of actors, directors, musicians, writers and technicians. Hollywood burnished its self-mythology through films such asSunset Boulevard, Singin’ in the Rain, The Player, Mulholland Drive and La La Land.View image in fullscreenGloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard.Photograph: Granger/Historical Picture Archive/AlamyCalifornia continues to boom. According to IMF data released this week, the state’s nominal GDP reached $4.1tn, surpassing Japan’s $4.02tn and placing California behind only the US, China and Germany as thefourth biggest economy in the world.Yet while the tech giants of Silicon Valley continue to thrive, Hollywood is facing an existential crisis. The first quarter of the year saw downturns in every category of production compared with the same period in 2024, according toFilmLA, a non-profit that handles film permits for the city and county.Shoot daysdeclined 22%over that period and just 13 TV pilots were made, the lowest tally ever observed by FilmLA. Meanwhile average occupancy rates for the majority of stages were 63% last year, down from 69% in 2023. Andaccording to the Hollywood Reporter, the number of recording days booked for music scoring stages dropped from 127 in 2022 to just 11 so far this year.The malaise threatens “below-the-line” crew members such as grips, electricians, carpenters, set decorators, sound engineers, costume designers and makeup artists who came to Hollywood because that was where the work was. If that allure fades they could take their talents elsewhere, sending the ecosystem into a death spiral.The warning signs are everywhere. Los Angeles is now merely one of 120 jurisdictions around the world that offer some form of incentive for film-making. In February, the streaming giant Netflixannounced a $1bn investmentto produce 20 films and TV series in Mexico annually over the next four years. Last week Texaspassed a billthat would more than double the money spent to lure film and TV production to the Lone Star state.The flight from Hollywood has even prompted comparisons with Detroit, the “motor city” that, with the struggles of the car manufacturing industry, went from one of America’s most prosperous cities toone of its most troubled. Factories shut down, thousands of jobs were lost, the population collapsed and the city ultimately declared bankruptcy.Philip Sokoloski, vice-president of integrated communications for Film LA, says:“I don’t think we’re past the point of rescue, but Detroit offers an example of what happens when everything is in your hands and you fail to work to keep it. For California, for greaterLos Angeles, we’ve maintained leadership in this industry for a century.“Generations of people have invested their time, their sweat and their dreams into building this business and it’s been ours to lose. California has underestimated the staying power of its competitors when it comes to their desire to have a slice of Hollywood for themselves.”California remains the production leader, Sokoloski notes, but its share of the cake is down to an all-time low of just 20%. “That’s not what most people would think of when they think of Hollywood as a dominant presence in the industry. It’s very small, the smallest we’ve ever seen it, and as a result what happens to a region when the thing you’re best known for four out of five times is done somewhere else?”View image in fullscreenA firefighting helicopter drops water as the Sunset fire burns in the Hollywood Hills in January.Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesLast October, Film LA made the case that California needs a vast expansion of its film and TV tax credit to maintain its competitiveness.Stay in LA, a grassroots campaign, is pushing for action. The state governor,Gavin Newsom, has proposedmore than doubling the money allocated annually to California’s film and TV tax credit programme from $330m to $750m.Two bills are now working their way through committee in the state legislature. Some politicians warn that the tax incentives will represent a corporate giveaway to wealthy studio bosses; others argue that more importantly they are about keeping jobs in California and offering workers a wage to match the high cost of living.Mary Flynn, an actor who has noticed a drop in her auditions and work opportunities, reflects: “This is how bleak it is: we’re at a point where poor and working-class people are advocating to our government to provide tax incentives for big film studios to keep the work in California so that we can keep working because we can’t compete with Atlanta, where the minimum wage and things like that are lower. They’re taking advantage of tax opportunities but also how much they have to pay into labour.”The drive comes after a punishing few years that have included the end of the streaming boom, pandemic, strikes andwildfires. Flynn adds: “We have exhausted so many resources and even in the midst of all this at Sag-Aftra [Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists] we have video game actors still on strike.“We are very much still hurting so it’s now up to the leadership at large to do what they ran on, which is to protect work and advocate for working-class people. Every single politician that sits at the state level in California advocated on that promise so now they’ve just got to deliver.”Soon before his return to the White House, Trump described Hollywood as “a great but very troubled place” and declared that Gibson, Stallone and Voight would be his “eyes and ears”, helping to bring it back “bigger, better, and stronger than ever before!”View image in fullscreenJon Voight, Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone.Photograph: Valerie Macontimothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesBut Flynn for one is not pinning her hopes on the trio, noting that Voight has adopted “financial core” status with the Sag-Aftra, making him a fee-paying non-member who is allowed to work on both union and non-union projects. She adds: “He’s not only abandoned his fellow union brethren but any work in this town that is worth a cent is union-made; George Clooney and Tom Cruise are in Sag-Aftra, they are not fi-core.“I don’t know what someone like Jon Voight is going to do to save all of our industry when he hasn’t really been in it seriously in a minute. I highly doubt that they would be able to be our knights in shining armour. It’s not a basket I’m putting my eggs in.”Indeed, there is little sign of the promised rescue mission, with industry insiders reportedly saying it has been mostly “crickets”. The ghost of past failing metropolises persists. Last year Scott Galloway, a business school professor and podcaster,told Matthew Belloniof Puck that “LA is a much-better-weather version of Detroit right now.”Belloni comments: “There are certainly differences from what happened in Detroit where the entire manufacturing industry left, and with it, the entire business is now a shell of itself. The entertainment industry will always have some root and connection to Los Angeles because of the infrastructure that is here and by that I mean the studios and the talent agencies are not talking about upping their headquarters and moving to Nashville or London.“But he’s not wrong in the sense that the core rank-and-file middle class of the entertainment industry is being hollowed out, much like it was in Michigan. It’s never been more expensive to live here and, for many of these artists, it’s never been more difficult to find a job.”Explore more on these topicsFilm industryLos AngelesUS televisionTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She’s another victim ofDonald Trump’s hardline stance, and a symbol of a travel and tourism industry expected to miss out on billions of dollars this year due to the government’s policies and actions.“I don’t feel safe,” Cheryl, who asked that the Guardian not use her name for fear of reprisals, said. “I love my kids and family more than anything, it’s only feeling unsafe is stopping me. I’m too old and tiredto sleep on concrete.”US’s $2.36tn tourism business fears ‘Trump slump’ over tariff turmoilRead moreShe isn’t the only one who has concerns – despite Trump’sclaim this weekthat “we treat our tourists great.”The number of overseas visitors to the USdropped by 11.6% in Marchcompared with the previous year, including a 17.2% decline in people traveling from western Europe, according to US government data. And given much of the visibility about detentions and deportations of travelers came from mid-March onwards, that figure is due to decline even further, which would be devastating to the tourism industry and beyond.Canadians, unhappy with Trump’s repeated threats to colonise Canada as a “51st state”, have been at the forefront of the decline. Canada’s major airlines have been forced to reduce flights to US destinations including Las Vegas, New York and Los Angeles, asbookings so far in 2025 have plunged, while car visitsdeclined by 32%in March.This was supposed to be a bumper year for US tourism. After a steep drop-off for the industry during the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of international visitors was expected to finally return to pre-2020 levels. Not any more.Adam Sacks, president ofTourism Economics, a tourism research group, said that before Trump’s inauguration his group had predicted a 9% increase in international travel to the US in 2025. They are now expecting a 12% drop in international travel.“You’re looking at substantial losses this year, about a $10bn loss this year in international travel spending relative to last year,” Sacks said.“It comes down to the basic principle that we’ve seen over decades, which is that travelers can go wherever they want, whenever they want. So antipathy towards a destination will have noticeable effects. It’s highly elastic to those sorts of external factors, and then you add to that the high-profile detainments which got a lot of press, particularly in Europe.”People in Spain and Germany appear to have been particularly deterred, with 25% and 28% fewer visitors, Travel and Tour Worldreported. The UK, Germany and other European countries haveupdated their travel guidelinesfor people planning to travel to the US, potentially dampening more travel, and it is already being felt in some of the country’s most popular destinations.Ticket sales for the Statue of Liberty have dropped by 6% so far in April,the New York Postreported, while hotel bookings for New York City hotels later this year are down 20% on last year. In Los Angeles, where the tourism and hospitality industry employs more than 500,000 people, people are equally concerned.“The way we are perceived globally is we are blowing up not just our economy but everyone else’s economy,” Jackie Filla, president of the Hotel Association of Los Angeles, toldthe LA Times.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asked if people were “scared” to come to the US, the president said: “No. We treat our tourists great. We’re the tourism capital of the world. There’s nobody – no place like this.”It’s not just hotels and tour guides that will be affected. Money spent by international visitors filters through a number of different industries: from entertainment to retail, transportation to restaurants. And the decline may not be just restricted to foreign visitors.Meanwhile the number of people making domestic trips is also expected to decline, Sacks said, as Trump’s trade war threatens to increase prices and cut people’s disposable income.A surveyby MMGY, a travel marketing company, 80% of Americans said their travel behavior will change as a result of the ailing economy.In a sort of grim consolation for those who decry the US’s political divides, Democratic and Republican states are expected to be hit equally hard.“It’ll affect blue states and red states alike. Florida is highly exposed to the Canadian and European markets. Texas is highly exposed to both European and Latin American markets. And California and New York are highly exposed to international travel,” Sacks said.“So there’s nowhere to hide.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsTrump administrationTrump tariffsUS politicsEconomicsTariffsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Not only was he a star quarterback at Colorado, he was coached there by his father, Deion, one of the greatest football players of all time and one of US sports’ biggest personalities.Shedeur Sanders’s fall exposed the cruel heart of the NFL draft industry | Oliver ConnollyRead moreBut aside from his celebrity, Sanders wasconsidered one of the best players in the draftat football’s most important position. While there were concerns over his size, arm strength and genuine arguments that his success at Colorado was partly down tohis brilliant No 1 receiver, Travis Hunter, most analystshad him as a first-round selection, or a second-round pick at worst. Mel Kiper Jr, the NFL’s most prominent draft analyst, ranked Sanders as the best quarterback available – superior even to Miami’s Cam Ward, who went No 1 overall.But as Thursday’s first round wore on, team after team passed on the 23-year-old. If that was a surprise then Friday’s second and third rounds were stunning as three quarterbacks considered inferior to Sanders – Tyler Shough, Jalen Milroe and Dillon Gabriel –were picked by teams with need at quarterback. That led to Sanders facing the third day of the draft, usually reserved for players deemed to have flaws or with limited skills. Kipersaid he was “disgusted” by Sanders’s slide.The move from the Browns was somewhat of a surprise as they had already drafted a quarterback, Gabriel, in the third round. The Browns, however, are looking at quarterback options. Their starter, Deshaun Watson, will miss the entire 2025 season after rupturing his achilles. But even before his injury,Watson’s Browns career had been a disaster, and the Browns were looking to move on from him. Sanders will compete with Gabriel, Kenny Pickett and veteran Joe Flacco to take over Watson’s starting role.“I would say I’m extremely grateful for the opportunity throughout everything,” Sanders told reporters after he was drafted. “I don’t ever focus on the negative or even think about the negative because the positive happened so fast and it’s a change of emotions. For me, it was just playing quarterback. That’s what it’s about. You can’t be up, too low or anything. You got to be able to celebrate. And when we score a touchdown, we celebrate for a little bit. Now it’s back to time to work, it’s time to go.”Speculation had been mounting about why Sanders had slipped down the draft board. One executive from a team in need of a quarterback,told ESPN on Fridaythat there was “no smoking gun, but it’s not just football either”. The executive went on to say that Sanders’s talent did not make up for the attention and media circus that would accompany the quarterback.But Jerry Jones, whose Dallas Cowboys have three-time Pro Bowler Dak Prescott at quarterback, dismissed anonymous league sourceswho had called Sanders “entitled”.“I don’t know how many scouts have visited with me about the character of the Sanders group,” said Jones, who is close to the Sanders family, “but they should because it is absolutely up with the very best there’s ever been in sport.”Now, after a bruising few days, Sanders has his chance to prove his case with the Browns. He may also take comfort in the story of another quarterback who went in the later rounds: the 199th pick of the 2000 draft, a Michigan prospect named Tom Brady.Explore more on these topicsNFLCleveland BrownsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

All three judges returned the same 116-112 scorecard in favour of the bigger, more poised and seasoned fighter who still had to weather some rocky moments when Benn hurt him.Eubank Jr was wobbled on numerous occasions but Benn, 28, was just too wild to administer conclusive punishment. In contrast, the 35-year-old landed the more effective blows, often in clubbing combinations, and Benn looked on the brink of being stopped in the last minute of the fight. Despite a cut eye and swollen face, Eubank Jr poured on the pressure as he went in search of the knockout.When his victory was confirmed Eubank Jr sank to his knees in relief and joy – while Benn, who had been so courageous, looked devastated.Chris Eubank Jr beats Conor Benn by unanimous decision – live reactionRead moreIt was a frenetic and violent brawl, short of finesse and class. Benn’s limitations were exposed while Eubank Jr suffered from the weight-cut rehydration clause which made him an additional $1m but caused him so many problems this week. They were both exhausted and drained but Eubank Jr matched the younger man for ambition and resolve – and he is the better boxer. He is entitled to enjoy his victory to the full because his gamble paid off. Eubank Jr had backed his knowhow and conviction against a lesser opponent and, more worryingly, the risk he took with his weight.A few hours earlier the muted hum that had settled over the stadium was replaced by a huge cheer as the big screens lit up with a surprising sight. Chris Eubank Sr stepped out of a suitably fancy car to the delight of a suddenly animated crowd that could not quite believe the old fighter had decided to attend in support of his estranged son. Those cheers then turned into a guttural roar as Eubank Jr walked across to greet his father.View image in fullscreenChris Eubank Sr with his son before Chris Eubank Jr fought Conor Benn.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersNo one seemed to care if it was a canny ploy – it looked and felt like a genuine reconciliation.Five minutes later, the dressing room cameras cut to the sight of Benn in his underwear. Sustained booing filled the arena and escalated when Eddie Hearn, Benn’s promoter, appeared next. The Eubanks, for once, seemed to be the good guys.Benn came out swinging, frantically, and the pattern was set. He missed more than he landed but his sheer aggression ensured a tight contest. There were plenty of warnings from the referee to both fighters, for their roughhouse tactics, and constant chatter between Eubank Jr and Benn. There were also moments of real drama. Eubank was hurt in the third but, in the next round, he nailed Benn with a shuddering right uppercut. Chants of “Eu-bank … Eu-bank” echoed around the arena but Benn fought back and they went toe-to-toe in a fierce battle.The scoring was tight but then, in the eighth round, Eubank Jr slowly began to beat up Benn who sagged against the ropes.. It was even more intense in the ninth as Eubank Jr was cut over his right eye after an accidental clash of heads. He was hurt again in the next stanza but ended it in the ascendancy.Eubank was three points clear as they started the final round – which he utterly dominated as Benn wilted amid the ferocity.View image in fullscreenChris Eubank Jr (left) and Conor Benn fall.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PARather than fighting for any titles the two men, who are normally separated by two weight divisions and operate below the elite level of world-class boxing, were put together in a crude money-making scrap built on the exploits of their fathers in the 1990s, cheap talk of family feuds and “bad blood”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Eubank Jr agreed to the request – and his confidence was justified.Eubank Jr shrugged aside the damaging effects of a perilous rehydration clause, which meant he could add only 10lb to his official weight on the morning of the fight. At least he made the 170lb rehydrated weight limit, which earned him an extra $1m, and compensated for the fact that he had lost exactly half that amount on Friday morning when he was less than an ounce over the stipulated middleweight mark.The previously undefeated Benn should have spent less time this week celebrating Eubank Jr’s weight tribulations and steeled himself for the biggest test of his modest career in the ring. He was also consumed by the idea that victory would have offered some kind of redemption after he had spent almost 1,000 days in the shadows of infamy following two positive results in two separate drug tests in 2022. But winning a domestic dust-up would not have cleansed the stain from Benn’s reputation.View image in fullscreenChris Eubank Jr celebrates with his father.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersEubank Jr will strut around with his typical air of entitlement because, throughout the long and protracted buildup, he has been by far the most impressive man among all those involved in selling this shameless promotion. Eubank Jr has spoken intelligently, amid his own bombast, and been a trenchant critic of Benn and his promoter, Eddie Hearn.The ring is unforgiving – and, for all his grit and guts, Benn could not quite match a bigger and heavier operator as experienced and savvy as the inimitable Eubank Jr.Explore more on these topicsBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

The fireworks were lit and the men in blue and red sprinted towards him from all sides of this stadium: here, at last, it was. TheCopa del Reyfinal, a firstclásicofinal in 11 years, had a winner. They had been a goal up and a goal down, they had thought they had a last-minute penalty to win it, but now the Catalan side had done it. Real Madrid had fought and rebelled, but eventually they were defeated 3-2.You might call it a game of two halves, but there were four of them, and they had been superb. They also had an unlikely man there at the heart of a decisive moment: Pedri, Kylian Mbappé, Aurélien Tchouaméni and Ferran Torres had all scored and now it was Koundé who did. It had also had a very, very likely man standing in the middle of what might have been the decisive moment: after all the talk about referees, after Madridhad boycotted pre-match activitiesand the threat that they might boycott the game itself, it was indeed the officials who took the spotlight at the decisive moment.Barcelona 3-2 Real Madrid (aet): Copa del Rey final – as it happenedRead moreRicardo De Burgos Bengoetxea, who had cried in the pre-match press conference, prompting that no-show from Madrid, gaveBarcelonaa penalty with 30 seconds of normal time remaining. But Pablo González Fuertes, the video assistant referee whose talk of taking action against those who criticised officials had so incensed Madrid, called him to the screen. And so there they were, time run out, a decision to make. Eventually the penalty was withdrawn, and so it went to extra time and Koundé’s moment.What a relief that Madrid had not boycotted this, even if at the end they may have wished they had. They played their part in a brilliant final that swung back and forth, where exhausted players gave everything – one that dignified this competition more than what had happened the day before. At the end of it, Barcelona – whose high line, life lived on the edge, had seen a Madrid goal and two penalties ruled out by the offside flag – had the trophy. Madrid were furious, but it had been some occasion.How exhausted everyone was. How this game had swung. How long ago, those early moments felt. It had taken took 56 seconds for Madrid to even touch the ball and then, when they did, they immediately lost it again, the tone was set already. In a first half in which Madrid found themselves always arriving a fraction later and Barcelona dominated, they fell behind to a lovely Pedri goal.Twice they might have equalised, two of those three flags denying them, but Barcelona were dominating, seemingly in control until the half-time introduction of Mbappé and a new mentality shifted everything. Arda Guler and Luka Modric too tipped the balance. Madrid were alive and could sense of vulnerability hidden until then. Every action felt like an opportunity. Pressed, Barcelona were finding it hard to get out and even harder to resist.View image in fullscreenKylian Mbappé (right) scores Real Madrid’s equaliser from a free-kick.Photograph: Joan Monfort/APThe equaliser came when Mbappé was dragged down by Frenkie de Jong. Madrid wanted a red card, the fans chanting about corruption at the federation, but they got something better. From the free-kick, Mbappe bend beyond Szczesny’s hand. Running to the touchline he gestured the way Cristiano Ronaldo once did against Barcelona: “Calm down, I’m here.” Barcelona knew: Mbappé was involved in another swift move with Bellingham that sent Vinícius Júnior skipping clear again, Barcelona rocking now. There was a speed and intent about Madrid, a directness, that soon led to Tchouaméni rising to head Madrid into the lead. Into the corner, they went, leaping about.But as the celebrating players broke Antonio Rüdiger had to be treated, a huge bandage applied to his leg. The significance of that was perhaps seen when with six minutes left, he couldn’t catch Torres as the forward ran on to Lamine Yamal’s lovely pass, went past Courtois and struck a clean, low, angled finish into the empty net to make it 2-2. Rüdiger, in his defence, continued and made a huge interception to deny Lamine Yamal as he raced into the area deep into added time. He also might have been fortunate not to be punished for what then appeared to be a foul in the area on Ferran Torres.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just maybe not with 30 seconds left. Raphinha dashed in from the right and went down under challenge from Raúl Asencio. De Burgos Bengoetxea gave the penalty. From the VAR room, though, González Fuertes called him to have another look. Minutes passed, conversations were had, pressure was applied. And in the middle of the storm, the last thing he could have ever wanted, the referee who says his son pays for moments like this too stood there alone. A single decision, a million consequences, so many thoughts to be blocked out.

It could be. I’m not sure if I will come back. So, I don’t know, I don’t know what to say. I mean, I’ll come back, maybe not as a player, of course. I hope it’s not, but it could be.”Djokovic, who had received a first-round bye as a seeded player, had arrived after a stressful few weeks. His otherwise encouraging performance in Miami ended with a difficult loss to Jakub Mensik in the final. He then lost his first match at the Monte Carlo Masters to Alejandro Tabilo of Chile.View image in fullscreenItaly’s Matteo Arnaldi reacts during his defeat of Novak DjokovicPhotograph: Juan Medina/ReutersBoth of those losses, however, were partly explained by the eye infection Djokovic suffered in Miami, which was still lingering a week later. This time, the 37-year-old simply looked listless and off the pace as he lost his serve at the start of the match and failed to find any real rhythm until the end.Afterwards, Djokovic said he had started the tournament with low expectations and he has to accept this “new reality” in his career. “Not big at all, to be honest,” he said of his expectations.“I was hoping I could play one more match than I played in Monte Carlo. Kind of a new reality for me, I have to say. Trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament. It’s a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis, so it’s kind of a challenge for me mentally to really face these sensations on the court, going out early now regularly in the tournaments.”I really want to play the best tennis. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to do that in Roland GarrosNovak DjokovicDjokovic continued: “But that’s, I guess, the circle of life and the career, eventually it was going to happen. Now I’m trying to use this as a driving force for the future. Obviously grand slams, I was saying many times, are the most important tournaments for me. Which doesn’t mean that I don’t want to win here, of course I wanted to, but grand slams are where I really want to play the best tennis. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to do that in Roland Garros, but I’ll do my best.”Arnaldi is a talented 24-year-old with the potential to rise far above his ranking of No 44. He makes life difficult for opponents with his defensive abilities and potent forehand. Still, Djokovic simply would not have lost this match in previous years and this result was another brutal defeat in a season filled with them. Djokovic has lost in the opening round of consecutive Masters 1000 events only once.“[For] 20 years, I didn’t experience what I’m experiencing in the last 12 months,” he said. “Early exits and way too many.

Griekspoor has defeated numerous top players in recent weeks, including Alexander Zverev and Daniil Medvedev, and he is one of the best servers in the world.

A few minutes earlier, the Aston Villa goalkeeper had been pumping his fists in delight after Jean-Philippe Mateta’s penalty miss appeared to have kept his side in the game.Yet already leading through Eberechi Eze’s stunning goal in the first half, Palace were not to be denied. Ismaïla Sarr thumped the ball past Martínez from distance after another cheap Villa turnover and the Senegal forward was mobbed by his teammates as Oliver Glasner led a group hug with the substitutes on the bench.Eberechi Eze revs up Crystal Palace to ‘go all the way’ after making FA Cup finalRead moreThere was still more than half an hour to play at Wembley but Unai Emery’s side – without the injured Marcus Rashford to call on – already looked well beaten, the rigours of a long campaign having finally caught up with them potentially. Not that Palace will care one bit as they can now look forward to a thirdFA Cupfinal in their history, with Sarr adding his second for good measure in stoppage time to round off a perfect day. Perhaps this time their story will have a happy ending.Villa hadn’t been past the fourth round since being thrashed 4-0 by Arsenal in the final a decade ago and have now lost seven of their last nine visits to Wembley.Emery’s record against Glasner is even worse: four defeats in five meetings during the last 12 months that culminated with this disappointing display on the biggest stage of all. Villa have played at some of Europe’s most imposing arenas already this season during their run to the quarter-finals of the Champions League but were second best throughout and must pick themselves up quickly to stand a chance of returning next season via the Premier League.There was a tangible sense of anticipation before kick-off as both sets of supporters made themselves heard. With Palace contesting their third semi-final in the last nine years, a banner quoting Elvis Presley’s “Can’t Help Falling in Love” was the centrepiece behind Dean Henderson’s goal.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze curls Crystal Palace into a first-half lead at Wembley.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe news that Rashford was missing after picking up what Villa described as “a knock” at least made Emery’s team selection straightforward. Ollie Watkins was back to lead the line as one of three changes from the last-minute defeat against Manchester City in midweek, with Marco Asensio and John McGinn also returning.Palace looked happy to try to hit them on the break, with Boubacar Kamara picking up the game’s first booking for hauling down the marauding Mateta. He soon had Tyrick Mitchell for company when he was cautioned for impeding Asensio.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Palace were incensed when the referee, Anthony Taylor, ruled that Mateta had fouled Ezra Konsa after pinching the ball from the Villa defender and finishing past Martínez. Their anger didn’t last long, however, as Sarr forced Pau Torres into a mistake and the Senegal forward laid the ball on the plate for Eze to apply the brilliant curling finish. He has now scored four times since breaking his duck for England against Latvia in March, having previously managed only three all season.Villa tried to respond but found Palace’s well-organised defence a tough nut to crack, with Konsa denied by the sprawling Henderson after Watkins had won a corner. Palace should have doubled their lead on the stroke of half-time but somehow Mitchell couldn’t make proper contact with his right foot after being picked out by Daniel Muñoz.Emery didn’t look amused as he marched down the tunnel and Villa’s players were sent out early for the second half. They almost found an equaliser within five minutes of the restart but Henderson pushed McGinn’s half-volley wide before producing an even better save to deny Lucas Digne.View image in fullscreenIsmaïla Sarr sealed the win with his second goal of the match.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianPalace’s next chance came from the spot when Kamara brought down Eze inside the area after a clever pass from Adam Wharton and Anthony Taylor had no hesitation in awarding the penalty. Yet Mateta could not make them pay as his effort clipped the outside of the post and went wide, cueing a loud roar of approval from Martínez. His next act, however, was to pick the ball out of his net after another mistake from Villa allowed Wharton to win back possession. Mateta was the provider as Sarr unleashed an unstoppable shot from outside the area before celebrating in front of his adoring fans.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Emery unloaded his bench and Leon Bailey came closest to making it a nervy finish, only for his goalbound effort to deflect off Torres on the ground and over the bar. This was just one of those days for Villa, who could have lost by more had Sarr not fluffed an easy header before finishing off Eddie Nketiah’s pass late on to make it three.

Never before had a team in the top five tiers of the English game been promotedin three successive years– until now. Even their owners, Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, would have been laughed out of town for writing a script like this.In the end it was a dominant 3-0 win over Charlton that sealed their spot in the Championship for 2025-26, another former Premier League team toppled. Ollie Rathbone’s strike and Sam Smith’s double put the Reds on the path toLeague Onepromotion with a game to spare, and consigned the Addicks, along with Wycombe and Stockport, to the playoffs.Championship roundup: Cardiff relegated while Luton stun CoventryRead moreWrexham had been hosting Boreham Wood, Dorking and Yeovil as recently as spring 2023. Next year, the visitors to the Racecourse Ground will include Leicester, Southampton and Sheffield Wednesday. The last timeWrexhamwere in such illustrious company in the second tier was back in 1982. The sleeping dragon has awoken.Reynolds and McElhenney haveoften dominated the spotlightin this story and for all their big bear hugs and beaming smiles from the directors’ box, this still felt like a moment for the Wrexham fans to savour. They charged on to the pitch in their thousands at full-time, setting alight red flares, waving Welsh flags and banging drums in delight. And they would not be budged.Even James McClean, the veteran Wrexham captain, struggled to take in the scenes, as fans celebrated on the pitch around him. “I know it’s the old cliche, but look at this. How do you put it into words? To go into the history books and be the captain and given the honour of leading that is incredible.“You don’t get success without a strong dressing room and that doesn’t just come from the dressing room, it comes from the management, the fans, our families, the staff behind the scenes – it’s one big group effort. You see how tight we are, we’re a well-oiled machine and a successful one.”The 12,774 sell-out crowd had arrived in expectant mood, having ticked off their first victory of the day four hours before kick-off, when Leyton Orient’s Randell Williams scored what proved to be the only goal of the game against Wycombe. If that left the Chairboys in a precarious position, two points behind Wrexham having played a game more, it also served as a perfect pre-match pep talk for Phil Parkinson and an extra boost for the home supporters, who created a red wall of noise.View image in fullscreenWrexham co-owner Ryan Reynolds sips a beer before Wrexham faced Charlton.Photograph: Jon Super/APIt did not take long for Wrexham’s players to respond to the sizzling atmosphere. A set-piece was tapped short by McClean, with Matty James rolling it onto Rathbone to lash home. It was a blockbuster goal worthy of the occasion. Cue wild celebrations.The jubilation was to get wilder still. Wrexham’s second goal stemmed from a delicious chip over the defence from James, with Smith swivelling to volley a cute chip into the corner. Even the seldom extravagant Parkinson struggled to contain his emotions this time. Red balloons and pyro went up in the stands. There was more of the same when Smith nodded in his second to seal it with a final red stamp.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Amid all the glitz and glamour and the glare focusing on the club’s owners, the former Bolton and Bradford manager has been the proverbial calm hand on the tiller, the proven coach steering his side up the leagues.Parkinson dedicated the day to the Wrexham “collective”, his players, the fans and, of course the owners, with whom he may soon start plotting a path to the top tier. “Everyone has been talking about making history all season,” he said. “The trajectory has been a rapid one. You can never take these medals away from us.”From Reynolds, who had drank a few beers with supporters before kick-off – and will doubtlessly enjoy a few more in the coming days – there was a brief soundbite to the media amid the on-field celebrations. He said: “The aim has always been the Premier League.” The Championship: beware.Explore more on these topicsLeague OneWrexhamCharlton Athleticmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Then they imploded in a manner that perhaps reflected the frustrations of a long, hard season when, all too often, a team who were League One residents two years ago proved not quite good enough to bridge the growing chasm between the top and second tiers.Nicolas Jackson ends drought to sink Everton and lift Chelsea’s top-five hopesRead moreWhile Sam Morsy and Liam Delap became distracted by running feuds with Newcastle’s Joe Willock and Dan Burn respectively, Ben Johnson was sent off in the 37th minute after receiving a second yellow card. If the first, for simulation in the face of Burn’s challenge was contentious, the second, for a blatant tug on Isak after the Swede invited contact, seemed plain stupid.Hats off though for a sanguine McKenna’s honesty. “I thought we did a pretty good job in the early stages and it might have been different with 11 v 11, but 11 v 10 the challenge was just too big,” said the Ipswich manager. “I don’t think there was any need for the referee [Michael Salisbury] to give Ben a yellow card for the simulation and I think there could have been room for discretion with the second.“But the challenge was just too big for us this season. Of course there’s things we would do differently now but it was a pretty big jump for us. The players have given everything and we’ve given it our best shot yet we’ve fallen short. Now we’ve got to stick together, keep doing the right things and use this as a springboard.”Confirmation of Ipswich’s relegation came on a day when the outstanding Kieran Trippier rolled back the years for Newcastle and normal service was resumed as Howe exchanged hospital grapes for his trademark managerial chewing gum and returned to the home technical area.By the second half the after-effects of the pneumonia that had forcedHowe to miss Newcastle’s past three matchesand hospitalised him for several nights were perhaps taking their toll as, unusually, he spent long periods sitting down in the dug out.“It was great to be back,” said the Newcastle manager. “It was a difficult first half, we had to be diligent and patient but we’ve put ourselves in a strong position.”View image in fullscreenEddie Howe waves to the Newcastle fans on his return to the touchline against Ipswich.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAOutside St James’ Park, Sir Bobby Robson’s statue looked resplendent, if a little over-dressed for the spring weather, in a half and half Ipswich/Newcastle scarf. The former England coach managed both clubs with distinction and his memory was serenaded with evocative chants of “only one Bobby Robson”.If only Robson could still have been around to see Delap – incidentally, a striker on Howe’s summer shopping list – swiftly use his power of acceleration to destabilise Burn and unleash a couple of decent shots before Bruno Guimarães had a goal disallowed for a foul on the visiting goalkeeper Alex Palmer.At that stage Isak looked badly out of sorts and Newcastle were missing Joelinton’s midfield dynamism. The bad news for Howe is that the Brazilian is due to see a knee specialist this week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As Inter travel to Barcelona for Wednesday’s semi-final first leg, the mind turns inevitably to their1-0 reverse at the Camp Nou 15 years ago– “the most beautiful defeat of my career” as José Mourinho has described it.Playing with 10 men for a little over an hour,Inter secured a 3-2 aggregate victory. Suddenly it became apparent that it didn’t matter whether you had the ball or not: you could win even with 19% possession. But the outcome was only part of it. The whole tie was played out amid an apocalyptic atmosphere symbolised by the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull, whose eruption made it impossible to fly over western Europe, forcing Barcelona to travel to Milan for the first legby bus.Gary Lineker’s critics have got it wrong. It’s reasonable to talk about more than sport | Max RushdenRead moreFor some it was good against evil; for others an upstart rebel daring to challenge the empire of aesthetic order. It felt fundamental. At the time, Barcelona, with Lionel Messi in his early pomp, seemed invincible.Pep Guardiolahad won the treble in his first season and, more than that, had revolutionised how football was played. The game suddenly became an enormousrondo, supreme technique allying with developments in playing surfaces so first touches could be taken for granted and superiority was achieved by the manipulation of space on the pitch.It was Total Football reimagined for the modern age, and its devotees took its principles with a zeal that at times tipped into sanctimony. For Mourinho, being overlooked for theBarcelonajob confirmed in his mind that in his time as a coach at Barcelona under Bobby Robson and Louis van Gaal he had never truly been accepted.They had called him the Translator, not only because that was what he had initially been, but to highlight that he had never been a player, that he was not of the club, that he was an outsider. He was not, as Guardiola was, one of their own.View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola clashes with Zlatan Ibrahimovic at the Camp Nou. The tension between them had boiled over in the Barcelona dressing room in the league match after the first leg in Milan.Photograph: Manu Fernández/APThere had always been a cynical streak to Mourinho’s football but at Porto and Chelsea his grounding at Barcelona had been apparent. His side had pressed and been capable of dominating games by controlling possession. But at Inter he began the move to becoming the anti-Barcelona: if they want the ball, we will play without it; if they want to press high, we will sit low.There were still moments of counterintuitive attacking, but the shift to the “he who has the ball has fear” phase of his career was under way. Barcelona would end that season in La Liga with 99 points; they lost only four games in all competitions. They seemed almost invincible, dominant and revolutionary, likely to become the first club in theChampions Leagueera to successfully defend the European title.Whatever impact that 14-hour bus journey had on Barça, Inter played brilliantly in the first leg. Pedro put Barça ahead but Wesley Sneijder levelled before half-time. Mourinho told his players that if they kept playing as they had they would win 4-1. He was one off, as Maicon and Diego Milito hit second-half goals. Milito had been just offside and Barça probably should have had a penalty, which allowed them to claim they had been unfortunate, but Inter had won comfortably.That weekend, having been left on the bench for a game at Villarreal, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a big-money signing from Inter the previous summer, raged at Guardiola in the dressing room, kicking over a metal skip that was used to transport kit. Guardiola simply picked it up and walked out. For Ibrahimovic, this was proof of Guardiola’s beta status: he was a “frightened little overthinker” with his team of “obedient little schoolboys”, far removed from the charismatic leadership of Mourinho.View image in fullscreenBarcelona’s Sergio Busquets is fouled by Inter’s Thiago Motta, who was shown the red card after the challenge.Photograph: Víctor R Caivano/APThis was football as soap opera and psychodrama, subplots everywhere. Mourinho named the same starting XI as in the first leg but, shortly before kick-off, it emerged that Goran Pandev had been injured in the warm-up and he was replaced on the left of midfield by the Romanian full-back Cristian Chivu. It was probably happenstance rather than being part of the some great Mourinho plot, but it fitted the narrative of him as some great Machiavellian puppet master.Inter were absorbing the pressure well when, with 28 minutes gone, Thiago Motta was shown a straight red aftera slight flex of the fingersin the face of Sergio Busquets. The Barça man clearly overreacted, at one point peeking between his fingers to see what action the referee was taking. But Motta, who had already been booked, did (lightly) push him in the face; a second yellow would have been entirely reasonable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bojan Krkic then had the ball in the net for what would have been an away-goals winner, but the goal was ruled out for a handball by Yaya Touré, a decision that could have gone either way and was debated just as furiously as the red card.A thrilling, operatic tie had profound consequences. Teams learned to ignore the siren call of Barcelona’s possessionAs Mourinho charged on to the pitch in celebration, Barcelona turned on the sprinklers. That, perhaps, was his greatest triumph: to reduce the club that had spurned him to an act of pettiness. Their halo had slipped and it was he who had dislodged it. Mourinho, having shown he could tame Barça,got the Real Madrid jobas a result, leading to perhaps the most all-consuming drama football has ever known as Guardiola reached his apogee, winning a third straight title and another Champions League,then resigned, exhausted, after Mourinho’s Madrid had claimed the league the following season.Madrid, once a club obsessed byseñorío, doing things the right way, became seduced by the consolations of imagined persecution, a trait they have still not shaken off.That 2010 semi-final was a thrilling, operatic tie that had profound consequences. Teams learned to ignore the siren call of Barcelona’s possession, to stay in shape and play without the ball, asChelsea did in beating themin their 2012 semi-final. And clubs and fans realised that you could choose your own truth, live in your own world of alternative facts.

I was just very, very happy inside and I shared my emotions with the people around me and the fans. But I will never be the one who is the loudest nor the weirdest in the moment.

Southampton, Leicester and Ipswich have earned less than West Ham’s 13 points in 14 games. The thing those three clubs have in common: they have been relegated.In theory, West Ham’s trip to Brighton offered a chance for redemption asPotter returned to the clubwhere he enjoyed three and a half seasons. And there was no better time to play them with Fabian Hürzeler’s side winless in five league games.Yet, two different stats were a sign of what was to come: Brighton had conceded at least two goals in each game of that winless run and West Ham were without a comeback win all season. A 3-2 Brighton victory should have been no surprise really.Potter said: “I’m not a robot. I’m a human being as well. I stand there myself. I give everything to what I’m doing. Of course I’m going to be upset … If you want me to swear, I can swear.”Brighton dominated possession in the first half and Hürzeler’s side looked much more threatening thanPotter’s team.View image in fullscreenKaoru Mitoma heads home Brighton’s equaliser against West Ham.Photograph: Maja Smiejkowska/ReutersBrighton’s pressing and probing paid off in the 13th minute when Yasin Ayari curled a stunning strike into the top right corner from the edge of the box. Simon Adingra, who often found himself in space on the left, played the ball infield to Brajan Gruda who teed up Ayari for the finish.Adingra found himself involved in the action again when his goal was ruled out for offside after a fantastic double save from Alphonse Areola. The Ivorian winger tapped in from six yards out but as soon as he started to celebrate, the flag went up to signal that Mats Wieffer had strayed offside in the buildup.West Ham, who played with three at the back, struggled to control the midfield, instead relying on their counterattack. Tomas Soucek had a couple of chances in the first half, the first of which hit the side netting from a tight angle after Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s pass. His second opportunity was even better: a towering header tipped on to the crossbar by Bart Verbruggen.Still it was not enough from Potter’s side. What West Ham lacked in finesse was made up for in away support. Perhaps relenting to pressure from the crowd, Potter finally did what needed to be done. He brought on Niclas Füllkrug.View image in fullscreenCarlos Baleba (centre) comes back down to earth after celebrating his brilliant third goal.Photograph: John Walton/PAThe change added a new dimension to West Ham’s attack with their front three made up of the speedy Jarrod Bowen, the strong MohammedKudus and the tall Füllkrug. They got their reward within two minutes of his entry, albeit without Füllkrug’s involvement, as Wan-Bissaka threaded a ball through to Bowen who cut it back for Kudus to tap in.Yet, the attack seemed to be the only thing going for West Ham as Potter delayed making another change. Against the run of play, Bowen curled in a perfect cross for Soucek, who had the simple task of heading past the keeper from four yards out.Potter was seven minutes away from the biggest victory of his West Ham career but his former club did not get the memo. With the clock ticking down, Brighton launched the ball into the box. Gruda headed the ball across to KaoruMitoma who headed in the equaliser with two minutes to go. The stadium erupted.Then, just when you thought it could not get any louder, Carlos Baleba decided to rival Ayari and curl in a winner from the edge of the box. Delight for Hürzeler and despair for Potter.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrighton & Hove AlbionWest Ham Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The 1-0 victory was a crucial step in Chelsea’s Champions League pursuit. Still, when the ball hit the back of the net Jackson looked to have tears in his eyes as he emotionally celebrated alongside his teammates. It was the striker’s first in 14 games and amid the hosts’ recent struggles up front, it felt like a welcome breakthrough, belied that the job of securing their European ambitions is far from over.“We never had doubts with the ones who struggled for parts of the season” said Enzo Maresca, who was celebrating his 50th Chelsea match in charge with a one-match touchline ban after picking up a third yellow card of the seasonagainst Fulham last weekend. “We had to support them even more and Nico finally found a goal today.”Bayern v Mainz, Newcastle v Ipswich, Brighton v West Ham, and more: football – liveRead moreBefore kick-off, Chelsea had averaged more shots per game at home than any otherPremier Leagueside this season with 18.8 and the trend continued on Saturday. The hosts had five shots in the first half against an Everton side who had little to play for after safety was confirmed last weekend. The visitors offered little going forward despite attempting to target Moisés Caicedo, who was playing out of his preferred position at right-back at the expense of the captain, Reece James, to make room for Roméo Lavia in midfield, back for the first time in over a month.The hosts’ first chance came in the ninth minute after Pedro Neto nearly latched on to Lavia’s neat ball over the top which Jordan Pickford was quick off the line to claim. A minute before Cole Palmer, who has now gone 17 matches without a goal, briefly got goalside of the Everton defence but had Levi Colwill’s pass from over the top smothered from under his feet. The 22-year-old continued to struggle and was outshone by the rest of Chelsea’s frontline.Noni Madueke was the first to truly test Pickford after breaking clear on the left, cutting inside and curling in a low, powerful shot with his weaker foot the England No 1 managed to palm away at full stretch.The breakthrough came when Pickford passed the ball out to Beto, the 6ft 4in striker too easily bundled off it by Trevoh Chalobah near the halfway line. Chelsea wasted no time in the transition as Enzo Fernández played a straight pass to Jackson who swivelled and rifled a low shot into the bottom corner.View image in fullscreenNicolas Jackson fires into the bottom corner from the edge of the area.Photograph: Tony O’Brien/Reuters“He has to retain the ball. Simple as that,” said Everton manager, David Moyes, of Beto. “We are trying to improve, we are trying to get better at retaining possession. If you look at modern football, you can talk about 100-200 goals scored due to mistakes. Our centre-backs chose to split at that moment.”The opener was Jackson’s first goal since 15 December and Maresca celebrated loudly from the back of the press box. “A disaster, to be honest,” he joked on his obstructed view. “I prefer to be on the bench. You want to say something but no one can hear.”Quick GuideChelsea v Everton match factsShow● Chelsea are unbeaten across 30 home Premier League games against Everton since a 1-0 loss in November 1994 (W17 D13), the Blues’ longest unbeaten home league run against an opponent.● Only against Leeds (36 between 1953 and 2001) have Everton had a longer winless away run in their league history (D13 L17).●  Everton have scored fewer away goals than any other Premier League side this season (12), with today being the eighth time they’ve failed to find the net on the road this season.● Nicolas Jackson’s goal in the 27th minute was the first that Chelsea have scored in the first half of a Premier League game in seven outings, bringing an end to what was their longest first-half drought in the competition since February-March 2012.OptaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Late in the first half Robert Sánchez collided hard into Vitaliy Mykolenko and the referee, Chris Kavanagh, gave the hosts a free-kick when it looked more like Sánchez charged into the full-back. Had he not still had contact with the ball then the Chelsea goalkeeper might have faced a penalty from the visitors. Soon after, Everton’s first chance fell to Abdoulaye Doucouré after a floating cross from Mykolenko but the Malian’s header was wildly off the mark.View image in fullscreenChelsea manager, Enzo Maresca, watches the action unfold from the back of the press box at Stamford Bridge.Photograph: Tony O’Brien/ReutersJackson, feeling himself certainly, almost doubled his side’s lead after intercepting Nathan Patterson’s weak backpass but Pickford came to his right-back’s rescue with a stop. Later on, the striker thought he had a second after Marc Cucurella’s shot was palmed straight to his path but he was offside.Everton have been draw specialists, with 14 in the league this season – the most of any side – but they lacked attacking intent even when Chelsea let off in the second half. Sánchez shook off his nervy first-half performance to save their best chances, with Beto hitting a super strike in the 63rd minute the goalkeeper sharply parried away before he tipped Dwight McNeil’s shot.Since his arrival, Moyes has made Everton a defensively disciplined side, with only Liverpool, Arsenal and Nottingham Forest conceding fewer goals in the top flight. But their failure to score in a league-high of 15 games proves, withthe club’s newest American billionaire investor, there is a lot of work to be done next season.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaEvertonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Wolves have accrued 32 points in 18 games; Leicester have gained four points in this period, losing 17 of Ruud van Nistelrooy’s past 19 games, to seal a humiliating return to the Championship.“Six in a row,” chanted the South Bank as Wolves continued their best top-flight winning sequence since 1970. Their chance to make it seven – which they have only managed once in their entire top-flight history, in 1946 – comes at Manchester City on Friday. “First the points, then the pints,” sang the fans. “Vítor Pereira, we’ll see you in ‘Spoons.” The manager will be bought a pint in whichever pub he enters in Wolverhampton this summer.By then, Cunha’s future will surely be sealed as United have reportedly agreed to pay the £62.5million asking price stipulated in the Brazilian’s new contract signed in February. “He’s a special player,” Pereira said. “He’s committed to his teammates and the football club to do the best we can in the rest of this season.“I don’t have a crystal ball. I can say he is committed to us now and I am happy.”Cunha scored the opener 12 minutes before the interval, a fine goal epitomising his finely tuned partnership with Rayan Aït-Nouri.Cunha has done his bit to help extend Wolves’Premier Leaguestatus by at least another season, but his maverick, almost sepia-tinted, approach to the game – he spends a higher proportion of his game time walking (77%) than any other player in the Premier League – makes him a rare luxury player. His body language is mixed, and his pressing negligible. Therefore he needs to weigh in with the marvellous goals, assists and creativity that helped seal this game.View image in fullscreenJosé Sá saves Jamie Vardy’s penalty.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersHe had already run from deep in his own first half to send one shot just wide, as Leicester backed off meekly, and had another effort saved as Wolves sensed an easy kill.His goal was a beauty. Cunha collected the ball from Toti just inside the Leicester half, played it out wide and received the return from Aït-Nouri, who ran on to the striker’s perfectly weighted ball towards the corner flag. Aït-Nouri had time to control the ball, come inside and wait for his team-mate to take the position just outside the six-yard box from where the cross was turned in.That was his 17th goal of the season, all but two coming in the Premier League, and shows why he feels he deserves to be playing for an elite club.Strand Larsen missed from two yards out before mocking himself moments later when making it 2-0, getting on the end of Cunha’s superb angled pass before sliding home his shot for his 13th goal of the season, and sixth his past six games.Vardy earned then spurned his penalty midway through the second half at 2-0. With 198 goals from 497 games for Leicester, the former non-league and England striker looked set to stagger towards his double century as he ran onto Bilal El-Khannouss’s pass and rounded Sá while dangling a leg. But the keeper got sharply down to Vardy’s spot-kick to complete Leicester’s miserable day.View image in fullscreenWolves’ Jørgen Strand Larsen celebrates his goal by poking fun at his earlier miss.Photograph: Cody Froggatt/PAVan Nistelrooy, his own future far from certain, has called upon his players to provide Vardy with a fitting send-off to his stellar career with the club. Perhaps this new incentive can act as a lightning rod for the final four games, with Southampton next up. “There is a lot to play for, like Jamie’s last games,” the manager said. “Supporting our captain should be motivation enough alone to push out everything that’s left. I really wanted him to score to get us back in the game but also for himself. That summed the game up.”Cunha again broke away down the left to slide in another superb pass for Rodrigo to round off Wolves’ victory.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWolverhampton WanderersLeicester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The former Arsenal striker claims everyone needs to help fix the “systemic challenges” in women’s football.He said on Instagram: “I’ve got to say I’m very disappointed by what Eni has said. She knows how I’ve helped her, supported her publicly. And I know the previous conversations she’s had with me and my management. So, for me, I’ve seen your apology on social media, but I can’t accept it. But I also want to move on from it.”Wright continued: “But the thing about where the women’s game is, it can’t be about individuals like me. It has to be about the collective. And because of the past, we know that men blocked the women’s game for 50 years. Because of the past the game has serious systemic challenges and it’s going to take everyone to help fix it. So for me, I’m always going to give back to the game that’s given me so much.”The 61-year-old concluded by thanking fans for their support throughout an emotional week.Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballIan WrightFootball politicsSport TVTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

But Harry Kane will miss next week’s game after picking up his fifth booking and a suspension.Leroy Sané fired in after good early work from Serge Gnabry to give Bayern a 28th-minute lead. Bayern doubled it with Michael Olise’s solo effort and superb finish from a tight angle five minutes before the break. Sané twice hit the woodwork in the second half before Eric Dier headed home their third goal in the 84th.Thomas Müller came on late in the second half to make his 500th league appearance for the club. The 35-year-old, who is leaving at the end of the season after 25 years with Bayern, is only the fourth player to reach that mark in theBundesliga, featuring for just one club.View image in fullscreenThe referee Bastian Dankert shows a yellow card to Bayern Munich’s Harry Kane, who gestures in disbelief.Photograph: Matthias Schräder/AP“It’s not ideal but we won,” said Bayern’s coach, Vincent Kompany, of Kane’s yellow card. “But it is not like a final. We will play 34 games this season and I think [injured] guys like Jamal [Musiala], Alphonso [Davies], Dayot Upamecano and [Hiroki] Ito also have to celebrate the title. Every title you have to celebrate it like it’s your first so I don’t think it will make much of a difference for Harry. It doesn’t take away a single per cent of his contribution this season.”With 24 league goals this term, the 31-year-old England captain looks set to become the first player to be crowned the league’s top scorer in each of his first two Bundesliga seasons. “Crazy, crazy decision,” said Kane of his booking. “It’s kind of my story that I’ll miss the Leipzig game. But no worries, I’ll celebrate more than anyone else.”Bayer Leverkusen beatAugsburg2-0. Patrik Schick struck in the 13th minute with Leverkusen’s first real chance, drilling in from the edge of the box for his 19th league goal of the season.Leverkusen put the ball in the net once more a little later but Nathan Tella’s header at the far post was ruled offside. They made amends in first-half stoppage time when Emiliano Buendía curled a shot past Finna Dahmen to make it 2-0 and ensure three points for the hosts.Borussia Dortmundconceded a stoppage-time equaliser but still managed to score a last-gasp winner through Waldemar Anton for a 3-2 win atHoffenheimthat boosted their chances of making next season’s Champions League with three league games left.Anton slotted into an empty goal with seconds left to play for the winner, lifting Dortmund to sixth place on 48 points with their fourth win in the last five league games. Dortmund remain three points off fourth place – the last spot to offer automatic Champions League qualification – afterFreiburgwon 1-0 atWolfsburg.Serhou Guirassy and Julian Brandt scored Dortmund’s first two goals, the former also having a penalty saved at 1-0. Adam Hlozek scored Hoffenheim’s first equaliser and then Pavel Kaderabek equalised in stoppage time. But Dortmund kept up the pressure before carving out the winner from Germany international Anton.RB Leipziglost 4-0 atEintracht Frankfurtin the late game and are only one point better off than Dortmund. The result cemented Frankfurt’s hold on third place.In France, the Egyptian defender Mohamed Abdelmonem suffered a cruciate ligament injury in his right knee duringNice’s 3-1 win over Paris Saint-Germainon Friday. “His injury will remain the dark cloud hanging over Nice’s victory in Paris over PSG. It was in the 63rd minute of the match at the Parc des Princes when Mohamed Abdelmonem collapsed in Nice’s penalty area,” Nice said in statement.“The first images led us to fear that it was a serious injury. The various medical examinations carried out immediately after the match confirmed … Mohamed has suffered a cruciate ligament rupture. OGCNicededicates the three points to him and will do everything possible to support him during his months of recovery so that he can return to the pitch even stronger.”The victory lifted Nice to fourth in the table with 54 points from 31 games and ended the champions’ chances of an unbeatenLigue 1season.In Saturday’s games,Lyonkept in touch with the Champions League qualification places with a 4-1 win overRennes,with Alexandre Lacazette, Corentin Tolisso, Malick Fofana and Georges Mikautadze all on the scoresheet.

Chris Eubank Jr’sunanimous-decision victoryover Conor Benn gradually developed into a contest so action-packed that it was tempting to completely overlook the tawdry buildup or the fact that it was only their famous surnames that had guaranteed both boxers career-high paydays.During a scrappy start, you could be forgiven for thinking the fight had perhaps peaked two hours and five minutes before the first bell. That was the moment when Chris Eubank Jr arrived at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium with a smirk and – perhaps more notably – his supposedly estranged father by his side in a suitably ostentatious sheepskin jacket, looking like a 1980s football commentator who had won the pools.Suitably measured reactions came from Johnny Nelson, the former world champion and Sky pundit, who said: “Seeing these pictures put a lump in my throat,” then promptly changed his pick from Benn to Eubank Jr based purely on his dad swanning out of a posh car with his son. The Dazn commentator Adam Smith was equally subdued: “He’s here! And the crowd are going wild – father and son reunited, simply the best. And that is the picture of the year so far.”View image in fullscreenNigel Benn (left) with Chris Eubank before their sons’ fight.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersIt was left to Billy Joe Saunders, an old Eubank Jr foe and someone who is rarely accused of being the voice of reason, to inject some common sense. Talking to Nigel Benn in the hour before the fight, he hit the nail squarely on the head: “Everyone is saying: oh look, Eubank Sr is here – you’re not in the ring; neither is he. It’s the sons fighting, not the dads – they did that years ago … It doesn’t matter if he’s got 10 Seniors here with him.”Yet at least both dads being ringside laid bare what the contest was all about: for all the talk of Conor and Chris Jr forging their own legacy, this was built almost entirely on their fathers’ work more than three decades ago. Both accompanied their sons to the ring and even got an introduction from Michael Buffer, which doesn’t tend to happen for ringside parents.Eubank Sr even went to hug and chat to a visibly uninterested Conor, which was unusual – and indeed understandably unwelcome – minutes before the fight began. He got a heartier embrace from Nigel, the two having buried the hatchet long ago.Alongside the famous fathers in the best seats sat Gordon Ramsay, who has spent more time ringside than he has kitchenside over the past 20 years, Idris Elba and a host of Premier League footballers, including Declan Rice and Marcus Rashford. Proof that for all the fact that fight aficionados might roll their eyes at the nepotism that led to this contest, not to mention the two positive drug tests that caused its postponement yet somehow increased its hype, the fight had definitely crossed over into the mainstream.But for all the cynicism, the fight itself turned into a barnburner. It began slowly, Benn all effort and not much finesse, having a particularly strong round three where he wobbled his larger foe. Eubank Jr, the more proven, experienced competitor, took over after that and almost certainly won the next three. Then, after halfway, a combination of Benn’s indefatigable endeavour and Eubank Jr’s exhaustion yet refusal to give ground led to a blistering firefight with both men trading haymakers.If professional boxing is a test of will and skill, there was, perhaps, a so-so supply of the latter but a gigantic supply of the former. As the crowd roared and the smaller Benn winged in an endless supply of blows, his trainer Tony Sims – a voice of wisdom in a maelstrom of madness – gave his charge the right advice of making room for his punches. “He’s leaning all over you, take a step back and let your hands go,” Sims implored. Yet Benn’s lack of in-ring smarts meant he was unwilling or unable to follow such sage instructions.Instead it was Eubank Jr who – yes, akin to his father in his prime – somehow found a second tank of petrol when it appeared the first had run dry. He willed himself through the last two rounds, winning them clearly to seal a decision that was deserved, even if the three 116-112 scorecards did not quite reflect the 28-year-old Benn’s effort.View image in fullscreenConor Benn and his promoter Eddie Hearn face the media after the defeat by Chris Eubank Jr.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersAfterwards, Eddie Hearn, Benn’s promoter and not a man to turn down a hyperbole when he has a shot at it, assessed: “Unbelievable! I couldn’t split them at the end. I thought Conor Benn was winning the fight, I thought he lost the last two rounds … But forget that, just unbelievable respect for both men. I could not be prouder of Conor Benn – for what he’s been though [two positive drug tests, never explained to the public] and the heart he’s shown in the ring tonight.”At least everyone could agree on the latter. Both boxers came to the ring in trunks that were exact replicas of their fathers’ from their first war in 1990. But if both came in cosplaying as their dads, both left having proven their guts and toughness beyond any doubt.Boxingis a curious sport where the best events sometimes fall flat and those mired in controversy sometimes show us something noble. For all that was ugly, worrying and distasteful about why this fight occurred, few could deny the pure courage on show inside the ring.Explore more on these topicsBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

On the eighth day of theWorld Snooker Championshipat the Crucible, Ronnie O’Sullivan, Mark Williams and John Higgins all rolled back the years.There have been plenty of shocks so far, but the three legends of the game are made of tough stuff. Williams is 50, the other two 49, but the class remains. They have won 14 world titles between them and who would bet against that figure rising to 15 a week on Monday?Higgins had to come back late on Saturday night to finish his gruelling last-16 tie with the improving Xiao Guodong, leading 12-11 when they ran out of time at the end of their morning session. Xiao won the first when they resumed to force a decider, but Higgins held his nerve to win 13-12 and take him into a quarter-final against Williams.The Scot is now the world No 3 after a fine season, which included winning the prestigious Tour Championship two weeks before this event, and said: “The three sessions – I really enjoyed them because it’s an unbelievable venue to play in. You play some good minutes, the pressure is on you and the crowd are all getting involved. You can’t replicate playing here.View image in fullscreenJohn Higgins celebrates after coming through a final-frame decider to beat Xiao Guodong and reach the quarter-finals at the Crucible.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA“Winning some of the big events has given me an inner belief I can get over the line. Even going into that last frame there. Am I a believer again? Yes.”On facing Williams, he said: “It’s incredible [that we are still going], and you throw Ronnie into the mix as well. Three special players, you have got to say that. I don’t care if I’m calling myself that a little bit.”Williams secured his place in the quarter-finals with a 13-10 victory against Hossein Vafaei, winning four out of seven frames having led 9-7 overnight.O’Sullivan soon took control against the Chinese Pang Junxu on Saturday afternoon, finishing the first session of their last-16 match with a 6-2 lead.Mark Allen hits 147 then loses as Barry Hearn warns Crucible ‘not fit for purpose’Read moreThe seven-time winner claimed each of the first four frames, with breaks of 58, 91, 50 and 63, before Pang, the world No 27, got off the mark by registering the contest’s first century break, making a 119. The Rocket swiftly hit back to secure frame six and after Pang took frame seven, O’Sullivan concluded the session by re-establishing a four-frame advantage to take into Sunday’s second session.Williams, three times the champion at the Crucible, advanced to the quarter-finals as he saw off Vafaei 13-10.The Welshman extended his two-frame lead at the start of the session to 11-8, but Vafaei took the next two frames to get within one of level pegging before Williams wrapped things up, finishing with a break of 115.The marathon clash between Higgins and Xiao could not be decided inside three sessions. Facing a race against time to complete the match before the afternoon action commenced, four-time Crucible champion Higgins won two frames in a row after the mid-session interval but was frustrated by Xiao with the winning post in sight, as the world No 14 battled back to make it 12-11 just over four hours after the session began.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With time running out in the session, Higgins took the next frame despite missing a fairly straightforward pink at 65-0 up to open the door for Xiao, who was unable to amass the points he needed to overturn his deficit. Requiring one more frame to win the match at 1.40pm, the 49-year-old appeared on course for victory but let Xiao back in and was punished.On Saturday evening,Luca Brecelevoked memories of hisamazing triumph two years agowhen he produced a display of superb attacking snooker to take a 7-1 lead againstDing Junhui. The Belgian is in danger of losing his top-16 ranking, having performed poorly ever since winning the Crucible crown, but was in irresistible form, leaving Ding helpless.Zhao Xintong, tipped by many to win the world championship, possibly this year, leads his Chinese compatriotLei Peifan10-6 after winning the morning session 5-3. Chris Wakelin, who has already beaten two fancied players in Neil Robertsonand Mark Allen, lies in wait for the winner in the quarter-finals.Si Jiahuitook a 5-3 advantage overBen Woollastonon Saturday evening. Si led 4-3 and seemed to have the final frame in his grasp but Woollaston, whoknocked out Mark Selbyin the first round, gained two snookers with only pink and black on the table, only for Si to sink the pink along the cushion to win the frame.Explore more on these topicsWorld Snooker ChampionshipSnookerRonnie O'SullivanJohn HigginsnewsShareReuse this content"

Thousands of seats will be empty on Sunday afterManchester Cityfailed to sell out their allocation of 36,230 tickets amid travel and cost concerns.When City faceNottingham Forest, it will be the 28th time the club have played at the new Wembley as a neutral venue since it opened 18 years ago. The allure has diminished while the price of attending a semi-final has increased, with tickets costing £150, £120 and £90 still available on Friday morning.Pep Guardiola says City body language showed they lost their ‘spirit’ this seasonRead moreThe finances and complications of getting back from London on a Sunday evening have left many supporters unable or unwilling to pay for a further trip to the capital. AllFA Cupsemi-finals have been held at the stadium since 2008, overturning the tradition of playing at neutral venues across England, as the FA sought to pay for the stadium in part via the Club Wembley packages that include guaranteed tickets to the matches.“One day maybe the FA Cup will play here in the north,” Guardiola said. “They will come here to Old Trafford, the Etihad, Anfield or Goodison Park. I understand the people. I’m not the person to say all around the world the middle-class people suffer economically and I understand completely it’s not easy for them. We would love [them to attend], but I understand they don’t come.“We will play for the people who come to Wembley, for the people who would like to come and cannot. I understand completely why they cannot come. I’m pretty sure they would love to, but don’t come because they can’t.”If City do reach the final, it will give the outgoing Kevin De Bruynea potential final shotat silverware with the club. The Belgian’s contract ends in the summer after City decided against offering him new terms and it is undecided if he will feature in the Club World Cup in June.The Belgian admitted he was“a bit surprised” that City did not look to keep himand is open to joining another Premier League club but Guardiola insists any uncertainty is not affecting De Bruyne.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So we are on that path.”Amorim said his decision to let Rashford and Antony go was backed by the club’s hierarchy. “That is clear,” he said. “It was my idea, but I try to help the team and sometimes help the players that needed something different – that’s all.”When approached by Unitedto replace Erik ten Hagin late October, Amorim wanted to take over in the summer.

But his stunning slide continued on Friday night when his name wasn’t called in the second or third round.Sanders was arguably the most recognizable college player in the country entering the draft – largely because of his father, Deion, the Pro Football Hall of Famer who brought an innovative, media friendly approach to college coaching at Jackson State and then Colorado. Shedeur Sanders played for his father at both schools and finished eighth in Heisman Trophy voting last season as the pair revitalized the Buffaloes program.Shedeur Sanders’s fall exposed the cruel heart of the NFL draft industry | Oliver ConnollyRead moreNFL talent evaluators were apparently less impressed than draft analysts realized. Few if any mock drafts had Jaxson Dart, Tyler Shough, Jalen Milroe or Dillon Gabriel getting picked before Sanders, but that’s what happened.“Thank you GOD for EVERYTHING,” Sanders posted on X during the third round.Sanders was initially rated by some draft analysts as a better QB prospect than Miami’s Cam Ward, who ultimately went No 1 overall to Tennessee. But as the draft drew closer, concerns began to emerge.One issue: Sanders was sacked 94 times over his last two college seasons. There also were worries about his arm strength and questions about how well he would adapt to playing for someone other than his father. And given his high profile, teams may be reluctant to pick him if they view him as a backup.That view seems to be supported by one executive from a team in need of a quarterback,who told ESPN on Fridaythat there was “no smoking gun, but it’s not just football either” when it came to Sanders’s fall. The executive said the quarterback’s talent was not worth the attention and media glare that would accompany him.Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who know the Sanders family, complimented the young quarterback’s character.“With my knowledge, I know where the character is there, and boy, it is great character,” said Jones, whose team does not need a quarterback. “It is an unbelievable competitive winning character for sports.”For a few moments on Thursday, it appeared Sanders’ wait might be over when the New York Giants traded up to the 25th pick, but the team opted for Dart out of Mississippi.The lone quarterback selection of Friday’s second round came when New Orleans passed on Sanders in favor of Shough, a 25-year-old who finished his college career at Louisville after stops at Oregon and Texas Tech. Shough was chosen 40th overall.View image in fullscreenFans watch a firework and drone show after the third round of the NFL draft.Photograph: Matt Ludtke/APThe Seattle Seahawks took Milroe out of Alabama in the third round with the 92nd overall pick. Two picks later, the Cleveland Browns selected Gabriel, who played at Oregon last year after stints at Central Florida and Oklahoma. Cleveland had five picks in the first three rounds and has a clear need at quarterback after the team got little production out of Deshaun Watson, who will miss the upcoming season with a torn achilles tendon. Gabriel joins Kenny Pickett and 40-year-old Joe Flacco in the Browns’ quarterback room.Derrick Harmon’s mother dies shortly after learning son selected in NFL draftRead morePittsburgh were also considered a potential landing spot for Sanders, who visited the Steelers’ facility before the draft. The Steelers’ only quarterbacks are Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson, although there is speculationthey could sign the 41-year-old Aaron Rodgersin the coming weeks.The Steelers took Oregon defensive lineman Derrick Harmon with the 21st overall pick Thursday. They didn’t have a second-round pick, but Sanders was still available when their turn came again in the third round. Pittsburgh instead picked Iowa running back Kaleb Johnson.Another player regarded as a potential first-round selection had a longer wait than expected. Michigan cornerback Will Johnson, who was in the green room during Thursday’s first round, went to the Arizona Cardinals in the second round with the 47th overall pick. A reported knee issue caused Johnson’s stock to fall.“It’s just frustrating,” Johnson said. “I know what I’m dealing with, and I know I’m healthy and I know how my body feels. I’m just going to go out there and show that on Sundays and show everybody what they missed out on.”The second round featured several trades.Seattle and Miami traded up to get picks early in the round. The Seahawks chose South Carolina safety Nick Emmanwori with the 35th overall pick. The Dolphins took Arizona guard Jonah Savaiinaea at No 37. Buffalo moved up 16 spots to take South Carolina defensive tackle TJ Sanders at No.41. The Bills dealt their 56th, 62nd and 109th picks to Chicago while getting the Bears’ 72nd and 240th picks in return.TJ Sanders will have an immediate opportunity to make an impact with offseason free-agent addition Larry Ogunjobi expected to miss the first six games for violating the NFL’s performance-enhancing drug policy.The second round also included the selection of three more players from national champion Ohio State, who had four players taken in the first round. Seven of the first 45 selections played at Ohio State.Explore more on these topicsNFLCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Gwyneth Paltrow is eating pasta againArwa MahdawiThe actor announced the change on her podcast. Apparently this is international news – and it has a serious sideSat 26 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Apr 2025 09.53 EDTShareLocal woman eats pastaYou’re going to want to sit down for this one, because there’s a lot to digest.Gwyneth Paltrow, who has consciously uncoupled from multiple food groups in the past, is bringing pasta back into her life. And she can have a little bread and cheese, too, as a treat.The actor and entrepreneur broke this news on arecent episodeof her Goop podcast, where she mused about all the fad diets she’s cycled through. “I went into hardcore macrobiotics for a certain time,” she noted. “That was an interesting chapter where I got kind of obsessed with eating very, very healthily.”More recently, Paltrow and her husband, Brad Falchuk, have been on the paleo diet. This is based on the idea that we should all have the same pre-agricultural food habits as our Paleolithic ancestors – a group of people who didn’tlive past the age of 35. While most interpretations of the paleo diet involve cutting out a lot of carbs, the “scientific” underpinning of this diet is bunk. Studies show that early humans had variable diets, influenced by a number of factors, and did, in fact,eat carbohydrates. Indeed, the average caveperson probably ate more carbs than the modern celebrity.Now, however, it seems the Goop founder is a little bored of the paleo diet. “I’m getting back into eating sourdough bread, and some cheese – there, I said it,” she said. “A little pasta after being strict with it for so long.”Why on earth am I writing about this? I’ll tell you why: because this little development in Paltrow’s digestive tract has made international news, getting coverage from the likes of theBBCto the Times of India. A wealthy white woman’s decision to (sparingly) eat spaghetti again seems to be getting more attention than the fact that kids are starving inGazaandSudan.This, by the way, is not the first time that Paltrow breaking bread has been deemed breaking news. In 2021, she revealed on a podcast that things hadgotten so darkin the early days of the pandemic that she had started eating carbs. “I drank alcohol during quarantine,” she said. “I was drinking seven nights a week and making pasta and eating bread. Iwent totally off the rails.” Do you know what Paltrow was binge-drinking while nibbling at sourdough, by the way? Honestly, you can’t make this up:quinoa whiskey.While all this may seem very silly, there is a serious side to Paltrow’s ever-changing palate. The Goop entrepreneur’s wellness ideas are highly influential – even if many of them are scientifically dubious. Over the years, she has arguably helped tonormalizerestrictive eating and glorifyorthorexia, an unhealthy obsession with healthy eating. I’m not trying to diagnose Paltrow with anything, to be clear, but I think it should be fairly obvious that going on a podcast to share that you now eat pasta, like it’s some sort of dirty little secret, is not a particularly normal thing to do. It should certainly be a sign to her followers that Paltrow isn’t someone you should look to for health and wellness advice.Of course, these bread revelations may be a sign of something else – perhaps they are a subtle recession indicator? With Trump’s tariffs poised to make everything more expensive, I cannoli imagine that we’re going to see a lot of people cutting back on meat and eating more pasta.Should sex education teach teenagers about consent?In a country that wasn’t run by anadjudicated sexual predator, this would be a fairly straightforward question. But it has proved quite thethorny issue in Indiana. Language that would have required teaching students about consentwas removedduring a meeting this week aboutSenate Bill 442. After a lot of backlash, the language wasput back in, but it sure says a lot about some Republican lawmakers that they find the concept of consent so controversial.Trump administration weighs $5,000 ‘baby bonus’ to boost birth ratesAccording to the New York Times, other pro-natalism proposals the administration is looking at include bestowing a “National Medal of Motherhood” on mothers with six or more children.Trump pardons politician who used money raised for slain police officers on plastic surgery insteadMichele Fiore, a former Las Vegas city councilwoman (once known as “Lady Trump”), was convicted of takingmoney meant for a memorialfor a fallen police officer and using it to pay for her rent, plastic surgery and her daughter’s wedding. Not only has she received an unconditional pardon, she intends to become ajustice of the peaceagain.Columbia cancelled Karen Attiah’s course on race and mediaI’m a big fan of the Washington Post columnist’s work. After having her course cancelled by Columbia, Attiah is now offering a condensed version online, which she describes as “an experiment in redistributing knowledge and capital”. It has had enormous interest already, but doadd yourself to the waitlistif interested.What does it mean when we call a woman ‘too muscular’?Bonnie Tsui’s new book On Muscleunpacks the waysin which we are conditioned to associate muscles with power and masculinity–and why that hurts us all. As Tsui notes, however, a shift in gendered attitudes toward muscle seems to be under way:a lot of womenare switching from cardio to weightlifting.

That is no surpriseSat 26 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Apr 2025 12.41 EDTShareTheTrump administrationclaims that its moves todefunduniversities,arrest and deportstudents and force schools todemoteormonitor professorsare meant to combat antisemitism, protect Jewish students and remove “Hamas-supporting” foreign nationals from the country. American pro-Israel groups including theAnti-Defamation League(ADL),Hillel International,Aipacand theHeritage Foundationhave united behind Republican measures to crack down on higher education and its putative antisemitism. Religiously identified groups such as theOrthodox UnionandChristians United for Israelhave joined the chorus, celebrating the punishment of supposedly antisemitic students and professors. Whatever their varied pasts, today’s pro-Israelgroups are not about protecting American Jews. Instead, they are allies in Maga’s war on free speech, academic freedom and the US’s democratic society itself.To be clear: the pro-Israel campaign to “protect” Jews by punishing anti-Zionist speech oftentargetsJews. After a student complaint about a tenured Jewish professor’s Twitter post, Muhlenberg Collegefired her. The ADL has rewarded Muhlenberg by grading it “better than most” colleges for fighting “antisemitism”. The ADL also accusedJewish Voice for Peace,a large, anti-Zionist Jewish group with chapters on many American campuses, of “promot[ing] messaging” that can include“support for terrorists”. Under pressure from the Trump administration,Columbia University expelleda Jewish graduate student and United Auto Workers local president who demonstrated against the war in Gaza.Dozens of my family have been killed by Israel in Gaza, and now Ziyad, too. Only one thing gives me solace | Ghada AgeelRead moreMost chillingly, the Trump administration recently sent all staff at Barnard College aquestionnaireinquiring if they were Jewish, ostensibly to gauge campus antisemitism. For many, the experience of being asked by the government to self-identify as a Jew was terrifying; as one historian put it: “We’ve seen this movie before, and it ends with yellow stars.”Canary Mission, a pro-Israel website that publishes information on students and professors who supposedly “promote hatred of the USA, Israel and Jews”, has been targeting an Israeli American scholar of the Holocaust along with many other Jews (including the author of this piece).Project Esther, an initiative launched by the conservative Heritage Foundation – the thinktank behind Project 2025 – blames the “American Jewish community’s complacency” for the “pro-Palestinian movement’s” ability to continue working for “the destruction of capitalism and democracy”. Maga’s pro-Israel partners do not protect Jews; they help Trump in his war on our academic freedom and open society more generally.Of course, unlike some pro-Israel groups, the Trump administration has a broader antipathy toward higher education. As JD Vance put it, “the professors are the enemy”. But the pro-Israel movement furnishes Maga with a crucial weapon in their war on this “enemy”: charges of antisemitism. The entire “US education system”, according to Project Esther, has been “infiltrated” by “Hamas-supporting organizations” that now “foster antisemitism under the guise of “‘pro-Palestinian,’ anti-Israel, anti-Zionist narratives … within the rubric of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and similar Marxist ideology”. Of course, by linking Palestinian solidarity with longstanding rightwing bogeymen like antiracism and communism, Project Esther gives away the game; their “antisemitic” charge is a tool to silence Maga’s left-leaning critics in higher education.Meanwhile, many pro-Israel groups seem to tolerate Maga’s proximity to antisemitism. If they didn’t, we might expect to hear more about Vance’smeetingwith Germany’s neo-Nazi-linked AfD,Steve Bannon’s singling out of “American Jews that do not support Israel and do not support Maga” as “the number one enemy to the people in Israel”, or Trump’s claim that the Democratic senator Chuck Schumer is “not Jewish” but “Palestinian”.The ADL went so far as todefendElon Musk’s apparent Nazi saluteat Trump’s inauguration. True, the ADL rightfully criticized some of these other incidents, as well as Trump’santisemitic advertisements, and his meeting withKanye West and Nick Fuentes. But these cases do not seem to merit breaking with Maga. Why? Because the pro-Israel movement advocates forIsrael, not American Jews.For this reason, the American pro-Israel movement has been collaborating in the Trump administration’s campaign to roll backeveryone’sconstitutional rights. By now, most of us have seen the footage ofMahmoud KhalilandRümeysa Öztürk, both students at American universities, being surrounded by groups of government agents and forced into the backs of unmarked vehicles. The secretary of state,Marco Rubio, promised that hundreds of other students have been stripped of their visas. Neither Khalil nor Öztürk have any demonstrated ties to Hamas. Khalil even spoke out against antisemitism, declaring that “antisemitism and any form of racism has no place on this campus andin this movement”. Furthermore, as a permanent resident and a student visa holder,both Khalil and Öztürk are guaranteed first amendment protections. Yet Hillel Internationalfailed to condemnthe arrests, and the ADL outrightcelebratedKhalil’s.I left behind an authoritarian state to move to the US. Now I see my new home falling to the same dark forces | Mona EltahawyRead moreUltimately, Trump and many in the pro-Israel movement have allied against free speech in higher education because it is a pillar of an open society that threatens both of them.The right has long had it out for universities.The pro-Israel movement, meanwhile, saw the campus encampments with horror; a wide cross-section of students and professors from a variety of religious, racial and ethnic backgrounds came together to speak out against Israel’s killing oftens of thousands of people.Even more galling for the pro-Israel movement, Jews actively participated in the protests – even conductingPassover seders, as well asKabbalat Shabbat and Havdalahservices amid them. These young Jews are not alone;less than halfof Americans now sympathize with Israel, andone-third believe Israel is committing genocide. These facts do not threaten American Jews, but they do threaten Maga and theheavily evangelicalpro-Israel movement. As long as increasing numbers of students, professors and many others speak out for Palestinians’ humanity, the pro-Israel movement, armed with disingenuous accusations of antisemitism, will aid Maga’s war on American higher education and democracy itself.Joshua Schreier is a professor of history and Jewish studies at Vassar College.Explore more on these topicsGazaOpinionIsraelPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warFar right (US)Trump administrationUS universitiescommentShareReuse this content"

We go to space because, he said – like George Mallory said of his reason to conquer Everest – “it is there.”While it is truer to say that the race for space between Washington and Moscow was driven as much by cold war competition as by humanity’s pioneering spirit and the imperatives of scientific exploration, billions of ordinary people around the world recognized as much at the time andstillwere able to marvel at our species’ accomplishments in the heavens regardless of the flag under which they were achieved, from Sputnik to the moon landing.And today, many more billions remain transfixed by the idea of the final frontier: they watch, spellbound, the live online footage from SpaceX’s reusable-rocket launches that are set to revolutionise space travel; pictures sent home by Martian-rover robot geologists; and black-and-white imagery from a spacecraft landing on the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, an object roughly 500m kilometres away and hurtling through space about 40 times faster than a speeding bullet – perhaps the hardest manoeuvre ever attempted by humanity.How Afrofuturism can help us imagine futures worth living in | Lonny Avi Brooks and Reynaldo AndersonRead moreThere is, however, also a cynical, “anti-space” ideology emerging, especially on some parts of the left. These space-critical partisans view the endeavour as a dangerous fantasy that distracts from the need to fix this world while delivering yet another source of carbon pollution and “extractivism”.They think that space-faring is an illusion that imagines we are free to trash this planet so long as there are other planets we can head off to. Off-world colonisation and space mining come in for especial opprobrium and are now cast as “neocolonial” (even if it is dead rocks that would be occupied this time, rather than the territories and bodies of other living humans). The geography professor Deondre Smiles is typical of this new critique, writing in arecent articlethat “a scientific venture such as space exploration does not exist in a vacuum, but instead draws from settler colonialism.” The Cambridge political scientist Alina Utrata meanwhiletells usthat space-faring is imperialist and extractivist, finding “root in the exact colonial logics that have justified settler genocide for centuries”.And even as thousands of people cheer on SpaceX reusable-rocket trials – which aim to slash the eye-wateringly expensive cost per kilo (or pound) of going to space, many others, also in their thousands, sneer at how “every rocket he launches explodes”. Part of this is an understandable, if simplistic, reaction toElon Musk’s far-right posting habits.Whatever subject the billionaire is excited about, too many progressives – often just as extremely online as Musk – can respond only with mocking scorn, regardless of the subject’s merits. (The snark also just wildly misunderstands what the purpose of these test launches is. When we push at the boundaries of what is currently technologically possible, and development of cheap access to space is very much at that frontier, we fail often – and by design. The aim of these failures is to find the weak points, learn what went wrong, and then improve. SpaceX in particular uses a fast iteration model – build, test, fail, fix, refine, repeat.)However, beneath the social-media clout-chasing cynicism and careerist academic-niche building, there is a more serious critique from many progressives that underlies it, often tied to environmental and social concerns. Space-faring is a Peter Pan fantasy that imagines we can escape the human condition, these figures say, a colossally expensive distraction from terrestrial injustices. We should stop polluting our planet before we head off to pollute another one. Why spend billions to send a handful of people to the moon while billions of other people still don’t have clean drinking water?Anti-space ideology amounts to a critique that unwittingly embraces a politics of neoliberal austerity while ironically undermining our ability to deal with the manifold ecological and social crises we faceKim Stanley Robinson, one of the world’s best-selling science fiction authors, insists his novels about the failures of colonies on Mars and the moon and of interstellar “generation starships” heading out beyond the solar system, are in fact all “climate fiction” or “cli-fi”, aiming to teach the reader the lesson that space will never be anything other than viciously inhospitable, and that the verdant Earth can be, must be, the only home we will ever have.In 2021,Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of Amazon and private space firm Blue Origin, offered the 90-year-old actor William Shatner a trip into space. Upon his return to Earth, the star of Star Trek said: “Everything I had thought was wrong. Everything I had expected to see was wrong.” He had thought humanity heading out into space was “the next beautiful step for our species”, but instead, “there was no mystery, no majestic awe to behold … all I saw was death.”Even Captain Kirk is telling us we must abandon our dreams of the final frontier.But for all its purported sobriety in the face of Musk fanboys and Jetsonian techno-utopianism, anti-space ideology amounts to a critique that unwittingly embraces a politics of neoliberal austerity while ironically undermining our ability to deal with the manifold ecological and social crises we face.There is in fact aleftcase for space. A fortiori, space-faring is much more likely to succeed under the economics of the left than that of the right.Space as crisis responseFirst, space scienceisEarth science. The climatologist James Hansen’s congressional testimony in the late 1980s about global heating was perhaps what first catalysed public and political opinion on the subject, but it was his research into Venus and its runaway greenhouse effect that inspired his investigations into climate change on Earth.Nasa’s Landsat program that uses satellites to remotely sense the Earth allows researchers to monitor deforestation, desertification, glacier and icecap melt, agricultural water use, and the spread of oil spills; to track greenhouse gas emissions, to forecast droughts and to test the accuracy of climate models. We would not be able to combat global heating, biodiversity loss, pollution and so many other environmental challengeswithoutspace-faring. Going to space is in fact taking care of problems on Earth first.Put another way, improving our ability to get to space will improve our ability to perform such Earth systems monitoring – and thus to deal with climate change and other environmental crises.And Landsat and other historic remote sensing efforts are only the beginning of what space-based monitoring will be able to contribute to solving the many ecological crises we face. Perhaps the single biggest contributor to biodiversity loss is not hunting, overfishing, climate change or even pollution, butagriculture, both in terms of its gargantuan land footprint and the inputs it uses.But the miniaturisation of satellites and the sharp drop in payload costs is already enabling the next generation of farming, “precision agriculture”, to radically reduce this sector’s outsized contribution to species extinction. The transformation comes from how remote-sensing can identify the threat of pests and crop defects much earlier and, crucially, at fine-grained intra-field level, thus reducing the volume of pesticide, fertiliser and water required, while boosting yields.Space science is a powerful weapon against the next major pandemic and against the smaller scale pandemics we currently struggle withThis means that less land will be required for the same output. A 2023 World Economic Forumanalysisestimated that satellite-assisted irrigation improvement alone, including better, faster spotting of leaks, could reduce water use by 5-10%. When one considers that agriculture uses almost two-thirds of global freshwater withdrawals, one realises these are not small numbers.Space-based remote sensing also is not limited to protecting ecosystems. Urban development planning, tracking the consequences of government policies, distributions of wealth, and dozens of other more directly socio-economic phenomena have strong spatial dimensions that make space-based remote sensing indispensable. Our current, more advanced ability to understand mosquito distribution, the prevalence of tick-borne diseases, and likelihood of helminth (parasitic worm) infections – widespread in many parts of Africa and Asia, and of many other infectious (and non-infectious) diseases likewise would be unimaginable without these eyes in the sky. Space science isn’t just Earth science, it’s also epidemiology. It’s a powerful weapon against the next major pandemic and against the smaller-scale pandemics we currently struggle with.Opposing space-faring thus unwittingly inhibits all this crucial activity.Moreover, for all of Musk’s cheerleading of the free market, much if not most of this work has historically been publicly funded and shepherded by public space agencies – and necessarily so, as such efforts would have been far too risky for profit-seeking enterprises, which need to be confident that there will be a healthy return on investment.SpaceX has been showered with billions in government grants, tax credits, subsidized loans and procurement contracts. It wasn’t really Musk who was the entrepreneur, but the state. Private satellite firms such asPlanet Labsthat sell their remote sensing services to farmers, municipalities, ports, architects, engineering firms and others who use such imagery and data to engage in real-time monitoring and long-term planning, would not be able to do what they do without the pioneering work of government space programs blazing a path to demonstrate the viability of space-faring without need to ensure profitability.And to this day, private space firms can only provide such services as are profitable. Yet there is far more that society needs to know from space than merely the information that can make money.This means we need leftwing space policy, not leftwing anti-space ideology.Satellite pollutionWe can see best what leftwing space policy would mean concretely when we consider the irony of how getting to space more easily has also made the study of space harder, specifically from the problem of “satellite pollution”.Satellites were once the size of a small car, but with miniaturisation, the instrumentation can now be packed into a device the size of a “Beanie Baby box”,according tothose engineers who pioneered the size reduction. Meanwhile, the cost of launch to low Earth orbit (LEO) has plummeted. Nasa’s Space Shuttle ferried its payloads to low Earth orbit (LEO) at cost of $54,000 per kilo but by 2018, SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy had brought that price tag down just $1,500/kg. Citigroup projects that this figure will plunge to about $100/kg by 2040. We are only a few years away from space access being cheap and abundant.But well before then, astronomers are alreadycomplainingthat light reflection from the huge increase in the number of satellites threatens their ability to do their job. Ensuring that satellites receive an anti-reflective coating only reduces the problem but doesn’t eliminate it, as the inevitable increase in collisions also increases the number of fragments of debris, which still reflect light back to Earth. As a result, astronomers are calling for regulations to introduce a cap on satellite pollution: any new satellite launches must be compensated by reduction in light pollution elsewhere. This ensures that the enormous benefit to humanity and our environment that is likely to come from cheap and abundant space access can continue to be pursued without endangering ground-based astronomy.Space-faring must remain primarily a public-sector-led endeavor, in service of all humanity, not private profitA public-sector space agency or government has no interest in the proliferation of space junk or light pollution, and so for them, such a cap on satellite pollution would simply be incorporated into the overall mission or legislation. But a private-sector firm must ensure continued profitability, and if such a cap is likely to threaten such profits, then the firm has an incentive to try to prevent its introduction. And, as with cases we are familiar with from every other industry, from tobacco to oil to pharma, these firms will lobby, engage in regulatory capture and even, as in the case of Volkswagen’s dieselgate scandal – engage in criminal activity to avoid this threat.We are thus faced with Hobson’s choice of the free-market fundamentalist case for space that ignores these negative externalities, and a cynical, technophobic leftwing case against space that ignores potential benefits. Regardless which side wins, humanity loses.What is absent from the discourse is the Neil Armstrongcritiqueof the commercialization of space. This does not argue against private spacecontractorsper se; there have always been private firms servicing public agencies such as General Dynamics, Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas. A public school doesn’t print its own notebooks or manufacture its own chalkboards. What it does say is that space-faring must remain primarily a public-sector-led endeavor, in service of all humanity, not private profit.However, surely at least the argument that we shouldfirstfix our ailing bridges and crumbling roads makes sense, let alone solve the housing and healthcare crises? This seems unarguable, but only up to a point. Not only does this forget that space exploration plays a crucial role in solving those very problems, such argumentation suffers from an odd acceptance of an austerity mentality in implicitly accepting that there is not enough cash to engage in both space faring and solving these problems at the same time.Of course at any one moment, even under a muscular, adequately funded social democracy, there would still be limited economic capacity, and democratic society is right to place greater emphasis on our most pressing concerns. Figuring out how the west can actually get high-speed rail lines built on time and on budget – or even just built – is plainly a more immediate worry than sending people back to the moon. But the European Space Agency’s 2024budgetis a record €7.8bn (the largest proportion of which, €2.4bn, is allocated for Earth observation), a pittance compared with the €240bn that EU statesspent in 2022on defense. Nasa’sbudget this yearwas $25bn, while the US Department of Defense in 2024 has more than $2tn inbudgetary resources, or about 15% of the federal budget.The world can afford a few more spacecraft as well as a few more hospitals, schools and sewage systemsat the same time, if only it gave up a few of its bombs.And even at the limit of what social democracy could tax and borrow, we still want wonder, beauty and inspiration, not just bare life. If we cannot have space exploration until every last child on Earth is free from starvation, then neither can we have music or cinema or sport.Leigh Phillips is a science writer and a political journalist"

The same can’t be said for the white voters who brought Trump to powerSat 26 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Apr 2025 03.28 EDTShare“What’s he done now?” My parents live in Cairo and I’m in New York City. We FaceTime once a week and that question is like a game we play. My parents ask about Donald Trump and I ask aboutAbdel Fatah al-Sisi, whom Trump calls “my favourite dictator”. Aren’t we Egyptian-Americans lucky – a dictator for each side of our hyphen.Tellingly, the “he” my parents ask about has dominated our conversations lately.I moved to the United States fromEgyptin 2000 and I have spent the past 25 years watching the US turn into Egypt – from encroaching state power to the increasingly unchecked role of religion in politics.After each travesty – the lies used to invade Iraq, the zealotry that destroyed abortion rights, the arming and financing of Israel’s genocide of Palestinians in Gaza – I thought: “Any minute now, there’ll be a revolution, they’ll burn things down.”And here is Trump, finessing that state power into a regime that, as with the regime in Egypt, istargeting culture, education, media, judges, students and any group or entity that poses a threat or even the potential of dissent to the regime. And I’m still waiting for the revolution.I now know, having lived in the US for more than two decades, that most white people in this country would rather hear comparisons to Russia or Hungary than Egypt or a place led by Black or brown autocrats, because even autocracies are separated along racial lines.I joined an anti-Trump protest in NYC earlier this month, which along with others across the country, was said to be thelargest single-day protestsince Trump’s return to the White House. The signs mocking Trump and his billionaire sidekick Elon Musk were clever and there were dogs dressed in coats that had “I bite fascists” written on them, but the rage had stayed at home. Revolutions need feet on the ground, yes. But they also need rage, and lots of it.White Americans are the largest voting bloc and the group most responsible for bringing Trump to power both times – and they are the least enraged. The privilege of whiteness means that for many in the US, the loss of rights only happens to people who aren’t white, far away somewhere, in places such as Egypt. Only Black and brown people in faraway countries end up with an authoritarian ruler. But, if anything, where the Trump regime is taking the US is infinitely worse than what is happening in Egypt, because Egypt’s footprint on the world is not nearly as damaging as that of the US. This is why I’m enraged at the lack of rage.White people in the US have a delusional amount of confidence in their government and institutions. They are childishly naive in believing that institutions will save them from autocratic power. That stubborn belief in their exceptionalism undergirds the refusal to see the fascism that Trump brought when he was first elected and that he is now cementing. Black and Indigenous people and people of colour have no such delusions. They do not expect institutions to protect them because they are so often hurt by those institutions. To people like me and others who have lived in and survived autocracies, white state power and its institutions have always functioned like a regime – so we are well versed in scepticism of anything that politicians say.No matter how often those of us from authoritarian countries, who know to be suspicious of state power, and those of us who have fought fascism – whether implemented through military rule or the rule of religious fundamentalists – warned and warned, white people in the US arrogantly shook their heads and said it couldn’t happen here. Because the US is like a teenager who is stubbornly determined in their own self-destruction.In Egypt, when I interviewed officials from the Muslim Brotherhood – political Islamists who were Egypt’s most powerful opposition to the regime – about their policies, their answer would invariably be “Islam is the solution”. Their goal was the establishment of an Islamic state. Though the group briefly ruled Egypt after the 2011 revolution before being overthrown by Sisi, never in its wildest dreams would the Muslim Brotherhood have imagined holding as much power as white Christian nationalists in the US, for whom Christianity is the professed solution and who are creating a white Christian state in the most powerful country in the world.If Pete “I want a crusade and I have enough Crusader crosses to earn it” Hegseth were a Muslim, the US would have invaded his country to save the “free world” from his jihad. It is easy to see theocracy when the theocrats and zealots don’t look like you.The US media have been able to report on the ways the Muslim Brotherhood politicised and weaponised religion. But they have failed to bring that same urgency to the politicisation of Christianity in the US, especially by the white Christian nationalists who have been instrumental in bringing Trump to power. White and Christian are considered default – the harmless norm – in the white-dominated newsrooms of the US.As a feminist, I am especially enraged at the inability of US media, as well as many white people generally, to see what religion has done to women in the US. During this term, Trump has so far rowed back any diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives andblocked federal fundingfor abortion services. During his first term, he appointed three conservative supreme court judges, whichled to the reversalof Roe v Wade and the removal of federal protection for abortion rights, meaning that individual states can ban abortions. These policies have been promoted by some white women, who serve as foot soldiers of the white supremacist Christian patriarchy. The women who helped destroy abortion rights, for example, are rarely analysed, examined and pathologised in the way that Muslim women are.Living in the US has radicalised me. Over the past 25 years my rage at thestate-sponsored patriarchyin both of my countries has injected anarchism into my feminism. Anarcho-feminist conveys the “don’t mess with me” level of rage I’m at. And unless (perhaps until) the Trump regime targets naturalised citizens, NYC will remain my home.Two years before Trump was re-elected, I began strength training. I can now deadlift and squat more than my body weight. The timing had nothing to do with the occupant of the White House and more to do with my personal goals, but my journey feels apt. Whenfascism flexes its muscles, it’s time to makefeminism dangerous again.The rage must come. It will come.Mona Eltahawy writes theFEMINIST GIANTnewsletter.

Thirty hours after the end ofRussia’s fake “Easter ceasefire”. It is 6.21am: feeling anxious, I call my father. He is travelling by train from the western part of Ukraine to Kyiv, due to arrive in 40 minutes. He picks up the phone, and from his cheerful tone I gather that he has not yet heard the news. I ask if the train is running late. My father says everything is fine, he can already spot familiar places in the Kyiv region. He wants to know why I doubt the arrival time. I tell him that sadly Russia has been shelling the country all night long. In Kyiv, I say, we have lived through one of the worst nights. “I’m jumping in a taxi,” I add. “I’ll see you soon.”Those who survive shelling often imitate the sounds of explosions when they talk about the experience. I instantly think of this when an early morning roll call of “how are you?” starts in the friends’ group chat. Whoosh. Whiz. Boom. Bang. The only thing I can write is the sounds of what came flying at us the during the night. Like a child learning to talk. Or a person who has lost the ability to speak.The air-raid siren in Kyiv began at 12.36am. And from then until morning, my consciousness was being torn apart by the flapping of the wings of doves of peace. The piercing whistle ofsomething Russian-North Koreanflying over our house – then the explosion. The threatening rattle of Russian-IranianShahed dronesabove us – and the explosion. Machine-gun bursts and the noisy activity of our air defence. Two explosions make our house jump, set off the sickening screeching of the car alarms and shatter the balcony windowpane. Explosions, and then the screaming starts outside.We hide in the bathroom – myself, my partner, Dasha, and our old chihuahua. There’s an explosion. The dog jumps up and tries to run, but Dasha catches him in a desperate leap. I ask her if she is OK, and she can only nod. She lacks words.I check the news and the main story is Donald Trump saying that it is easier for him to negotiate with Vladimir Putin than with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The world’s media present their versions of what the so-called “peace agreement” could look like. The details vary, but one thing remains constant – they all look likehumiliation for Ukraine. In a deal between two macho men who ignore everyone’s interests except their own, it seems Ukraine should pay a terrible price for daring to survive and fight.View image in fullscreenThe sculpture Volya by Ukrainian artist Oleksiy Sai, Kyiv railway station. ‘Volya’ is Ukrainian for ‘freedom’ and ‘will’.Photograph: X/Ukrainian railwaysThe terms of this peace agreement look more like punishment; an attempt to drownUkrainein postwar reconstruction and a future without any guarantees of peace. With no clear mechanisms in place to implement the terms, it looks more like an attempt to bring Ukraine to heel. Is it just easier for everyone to pretend that the 1994 Budapest memorandum never existed? This accord committed the US, Russia and the UK to guaranteeing Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity in exchange for the surrendering of nuclear weapons.We have found ourselves instead in a Trumpian world that deals not in facts, but in variants of different narratives, waiting to see which one will be picked and validated. This throwing around and testing of narratives, this attempt to shock and wow, is a world built on the logic of wrestling, which is so dear to Trump’s heart. Mr President, by the way, has been inducted into theWWE Hall of Fameand has been known to step into the ring himself. Trump’s politics are an imitation of real politics, just as wrestling is not real sport but imitates it. His politics are just as spectacular and exaggerated, a show with fictitious characters and ascribed conflicts. However, this charade shatters when it collides with the real world and real-world villainous dictators, and the lives of real people.And while I am trying to slow down the palpitations brought on by the explosions and screams outside my home, a crystal-clear realisation strikes me: if they fail to reach an agreement on their terms, with Trump’s tacit consent and the world’s non-interference, Putin will continue to rape Ukraine and its civilian population.And my question – why, after more than 10 years of war and more than three years of invasion, are we once again left one-on-one with a murderer? – is drowned out by more explosions. The air is filled with smoke. A black hazy blanket hangs over our neighbourhood. My country is on fire.At 6.33am, the air-raid alert in Kyiv finally gives the all clear. I jump into a taxi to the railway station to find my father.The first official reports start coming in. In Kyiv alone, there areat least 12 deadand 70 wounded. Russia’s combined peace strike consisted of70 missiles and 145 Shaheds. The Ukrainian defenders of the sky shot down 112 enemy air targets, and 16,000 Kyiv residents spent the night in the shelters – on subway platforms. The Russians, as is their custom, were aiming at residential buildings and civilians.Despite the shelling of the railway infrastructure, and injuries to a conductor in Zhytomyr and a train driver in Kyiv, Ukrainian Railways once again remind us that normality is possible, and my father’s train arrives two minutes ahead of schedule.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It might have caused voters to think such a person told lies and was untrustworthy.Politicians, like other human beings, have always fibbed – exaggerating, omitting, or misspeaking.But lying has a whole new dimension these days.During his first term in office, the leader of the free world wasfound to have made false or misleading statements 30,573 times: little fibs, mistruths and eventually big lies that at first seemed preposterous but eventually took root and convinced a majority.Now for the first time since Adolf Hitler propounded the virtue of big lies to “awaken the imagination of the public through an appeal to their feelings”, those seeking to persuade with no commitment to the truth have technological tools that the propagandists of old could have only dreamed of.Sharri Markson’s ‘exclusive inside information’ puts Coalition in poll position | Weekly BeastRead moreIt is another marker of the banality of the Australian election campaign that the devaluing of truth has not been seriously addressed. The campaign fortruth in political advertisingcontinues to hiss like a leaking balloon with – short of a hung parliament – little chance of reform.Electoral materials must be authorised, but there is no requirement for those producing ads and “created content” to ensure truthfulness, and communication that awakens the imagination is always slippery.Who knows now what is being pushed online? We do know that the parties, and associated lobby groups, have made hundreds of videos,designed to arouse, infuriate and, most importantly, to be shared.But what are they actually saying?The Australian Electoral Commission says that about 200,000 people a dayare visiting its website, many going to theStop and Consider guidanceon how to recognise, report and ignore misinformation. But there is no requirement for authorised ads to be lodged with the AEC.Once upon a time, when the video ads were national and television the means of distribution, you could be pretty sure that over a campaign you would see most of them. Now as television viewership plummets, those persuasive video ads are more likely to be onYouTube, Facebook and other platforms.During the voice referendum I was inundated with outrageous misinformation.

The key to campaign success is thought to lie in such videos, so this data reveals the seats where each party is most focused. The scale of the expenditure is extraordinary. At that point, Goldstein topped the chart, at $128,445, but even halfway through, the parties combined had spent five-figure sums in most electorates.Unless you were the target you wouldn’t have a clue about the claims and counter claims being made.

But more than ever politics is local, and the parties know that it only takes a few votes in many electorates to achieve their desired outcome. Advance’s Matthew Sheahan, flush with the success of his anti-voice campaign,observed, “Our target market is so small … If we are going to spend money and get a message to a mum who is 35 in Adelaide and thinking of voting Greens in the next election, if we can get a message to her 16 times … That’s the sort of number that will change her mind.”The sophistication of the attention economy is without precedent. Even Mark Zuckerberg was surprised to learn how Facebook had swung the 2016 election for Donald Trump.As Sarah Wynn-Williams documents in Careless People, it took a 10-hour flight to Lima for Zuckerberg’s closest advisers to convince him that “Facebook basically handed the election to Donald Trump”. A skilled Republican operative and embedded Facebook staff “basically invented a new way for a political campaign to shitpost its way to the White House, targeting voters with misinformation, inflammatory posts and fundraising messages … microtargeted users and tweaked ads for maximum engagement, using data tools we designed for commercial advertisers.”American research now shows that the online media ecosystem there isoverwhelmingly right wing– the shows might be about lifestyle, sport, or food, but the prevailing political ethos seeps through.The Guardian’ssurvey of youth mediasuggests that there is a different, more progressive, vibe here – but at some level that’s a punt, there is much we don’t know.The old regulatory tools need new teeth that demand greater transparencyif our protective democratic institutions are to do their job.Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025OpinionAustralian politicsAdvertisingcommentShareReuse this content"

The Met must actFormer UK prime minister makes criminal complaint against Rupert Murdoch’s media empireSat 26 Apr 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Apr 2025 13.09 EDTShareThegroundbreaking apologyto Prince Harry from Rupert Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers (NGN) has not closed an era of investigation and litigation into media corruption. It has opened it up. Far from ending one of the most sordid chapters in British media history, it is raising fundamental, troubling and as yet unresolved questions – and today I am making a criminal complaint to the Met and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) alleging that I am, along with many others, a victim of the obstruction of the course of justice by NGN.This is not an allegation made lightly.It is informedby recentlyavailable evidence, and by thestatements of senior officersinvolved in the original investigations into unlawful newsgathering, who have now stated to me that they were misled.One officer, who gave a statement to the court for Harry’s claim, has told me that they now believe there is “significant evidence” emails were deleted in a bid to pervert the course of justice. They said: “If we had known this in 2011, we would have investigated fully and taken a different course of action including considering arrests.” (NGN strenuously denies any allegations of evidence destruction.)For some time, the public have known that over three decades, and across every continent, NGN, marching under the banner of a “free press”, invaded theprivate lives of thousands of innocent citizens. It now admits“unlawful activities”occurred not only at the defunct News of the World but at its flagship daily, the Sun, carried out by private investigators working for the paper between 1996 and 2011.One private investigator, one of their hired hands, claimed to me in an interview that the use of unlawful methods by private investigators working for the Murdoch empire was endemic in the years before 2011. I do not believe I was wrong to have said in the House of Commons more than a decade ago that we were dealing with acriminal-media nexus.NGN destroyed millions of emails in the face of a criminal investigation, about 9m of which were never recovered. What now appears clear from court documents revealing the background to those deletions is that the Murdoch team did not only assault people’s individual liberties, but designed an elaborate cover-up. The result was that anyone scrutinising its operations would never discover the complete picture. (NGN argues that the deletion of emails had “long been in the planning, for sound commercial, IT and practical reasons”,that it made the Met aware of the deletions and steps it had taken to preserve evidence and that it worked alongside the Met to reconstruct its electronic archives.)What’s more, when this became known, Sir William Lewis (the former group general manager of NGN, and the current publisher of the Washington Post) attempted to incriminate Tom Watson and me, accusing us in statements made to the police in 2011 of theft and bribery. He falsely claimed a conspiracy by the two of us to suborn an unnamed employee who was, supposedly, handing us private documents. This was their pretext for shredding reams of evidence. As one of the investigating officers has said, they “falsely implicated Gordon Brown. If I had known this I would have made arrests for obstruction of justice.” (NGN states that its concerns were genuine at the time.)The investigation into NGN was closed down in 2015 but as this statement by officers conducting the investigation now shows, the investigation into perverting the course of justice was closed on the basis of wrong information.The authoritiesconcluded that “there is no evidence to suggest the email deletion was undertaken in order to pervert the course of justice”. Evidence from the civil case suggests the cover-up did not end with the destruction of what could have been vital evidence, but continued with statements to the police.The civil case, directly resulting in NGN’s belated admission of “incidents ofunlawful activities” carried out by private investigators working for the Sun, exposes not only three decades of lies but also its attempts to vilify some of those who claimed otherwise. In a series ofrevelatory articles, the investigative journalist Nick Davies revealed evidence that suggests NGN was not just using phone hacking and other means for the sensational coverage of private lives, but also spying on politicians whom they sought to influence. (This was denied by NGN.) This, he says, raises serious questions about whether such tactics may have been used during the supposedly secret negotiations that led to the formation of the 2010 coalition government.It is now for the police to request from the courts the statements made by dozens of witnesses, including former employees and ex-police officers, some of whom have now spoken to me. But the most telling condemnation of its tactics comes in statements from the victims of abuse, those maimed in the July 2005 bombings, the couples whose relationships were torn apart for ever by the unfair intrusion into their daily lives, and the families whose privacy was invaded when they were grieving for their murdered children – the Dowlers, the McCanns, the Paynes.Given the claims made in court documents about the deliberate deletion of emails and unlawful activities, the next steps are clear. Alongside the police, the director of public prosecutions, whose office appears to have been systematically misled, must now take up this serious challenge to the rule of law. Parliament, whose committees appear to have been misled, has a duty to reopen its investigations. The attorney general, who has just delivered an important and landmark speech on the importance of upholding the rule of law, has reason to ensure the extent of the lawlessness that has now been exposed is investigated as a criminal offence.This issue is not of mere historical interest. The Murdoch empire has already brought what should be a free media into disrepute. It is all law-upholding publishers that should have the greatest interest in securing justice, and in helping us achieve the further inquiry we seek.All of us benefit from showing that there is a difference between an honest media and one that corrupts the currency.Gordon Brown was UK prime minister 2007 to 2010Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Agoodjournalist, someone whose keyboard is a tool for exposing injustice, a truth-seeker who would risk life and limb to report their experiences back to the world? I know I couldn’t do it. I’ve interviewed people for a research project and was hopeless. I found myself shying away from asking the really difficult questions. There’s no way I could confront a corrupt official, or race to file a breaking story before a hostile regime tried to silence me, possibly for ever. I like to think of myself as the kind of person who would speak truth to power, but would I really, if my life was in the balance?One of the many privileges of being an actor is that it affords you the opportunity to dip your toes into other worlds and experiences from the safest possible distance. In the upcoming film Words of War, I have the honour of portraying the Russian journalist and human rights activist Anna Politkovskaya – a woman with immense courage and integrity who, despite numerous threats to her life, continued to be a blazing beacon of truth in a time and place where speaking truth was extremely dangerous. The film,which was partly inspiredby Politkovskaya’sobituary in this newspaper, allowed me to delve into her remarkable life and work. The experience gave me a deeper appreciation for the journalists who risk everything to tell the stories that inform and shape our world.View image in fullscreenMaxine Peake as Anna Politkovskaya in Words of War.Photograph: Damir ŠagoljThose who tell these stories face more threats than perhaps ever before. Journalism has become a dangerous profession; according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, more than 1,800 journalists and media workers have been killed while pursuing a story since 1992. Of these, at least 124were killed in 2024 alone, making last year the deadliest in three decades. Nearly 70% of these deaths were at the hands of the Israeli military in Gaza and Lebanon. There was also a sharp 56% increase in the number of press violationsagainst female journalistssince 2023, according to the Coalition for Women in Journalism, including detentions, harassment, physical assault, threats and intimidation. Threats aren’t reserved for war zones or authoritarian regimes. Journalists are also coming under attack in western democracies; on the US campaign trail, Donald Trumpspoke about revoking broadcast licencesand jailing journalists, while rich individuals in Britain havetargeted journalistswith insidious Slapps (strategic lawsuits against public participation).In preparation for my role as Politkovskaya, I immersed myself as much as I could in the lives of the people who report from the frontlines of conflict, corruption and catastrophe, reading about and talking face-to-face with some of these extraordinary women and men. Before leaving to film in Latvia, I had the honour of being invited to a memorial at St Brides Church, on Fleet Street in London, for the murdered American-Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. Abu Akleh was shot on 11 May 2022 while she wascovering raids in Jenin refugee campin the West Bank. She was wearing a helmet and a clearly marked press vest. More than 1,000 days have passed since her death, yet no one has been held accountable.What struck me that day was the outpouring of love and respect from Abu Akleh’s friends and colleagues in the wider journalistic fraternity. Like Politkovskaya, Abu Akleh was someone who dared to expose the truth. Reading about both of these extraordinary women while I prepared for the role, I was struck not only by their courage, but their clarity of purpose. These journalists were not thrill-seekers or fame-chasers. They were driven by something elemental: the absolute belief that telling the truth matters.‘If I die, I want a loud death’: Gaza photojournalist killed by Israeli airstrikeRead moreWe rely on journalists to expose injustice, hold power to account, and to shine light into the world’s darkest corners. Without them, abuse and corruption remain unchecked and unknown. As John Adams, one of America’s founding fathers, put it: “The liberty of the press is essential to the security of the state.” Yet everywhere that journalists are being threatened or silenced, this principle is being eroded. This is not only a problem for journalists, but a threat to all of us, and to our democratic freedoms.That’s why it is so important that we must protect those who do the work of asking hard questions, digging deeper beyond the talking points and propaganda, even when their work is dangerous. I urge everyone to watch Words of War and support press freedom, not just as a political principle, but as a personal responsibility. Defend the truth-tellers. Share their work. Push back against efforts to delegitimise them. The UN’s World Press Freedom Day takes place on 3 May, and anyone can show their support for this principle by donating to organisations such as theNational Press Club Freedom Centreand theCommittee to Protect Journalists.

Now we know we’re not ‘failures’Rhiannon Lucy CosslettA study shows the impact of feeding challenges on maternal mental health. With official help in short supply, it’s time to support each otherSat 26 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Apr 2025 14.06 EDTShareAnyone who has struggled mentally knows it is often only with time and recovery that you can challenge the destructive thought patterns that once plagued you. That said, hindsight can also be a strange thing. While collecting Republic of Parenthood columns for a book, I spent time revisiting my old articles about mystruggles with breastfeeding. I felt vindicated, as some of the things I wrote have since been confirmed.This week, the largest ever qualitative study on how difficulties with breastfeeding affects mothers’ mental health has beenpublished in Scientific Reports. More than 2,000 mothers were surveyed with 65% reporting difficulties with infant latching, “which seemed to impact mental health”.. Feeling like “a bad mum” and “like I had failed my baby” were some of the common reasons given by participants.These feelings are almost identical to thoseI wrote aboutthree years ago. I felt like “a failure” because “desperately wanting to feed your child with your body and not being able to taps into something quite fundamental, really. Something that may have the potential to make you depressed.” Being aware of the culture of guilt around breastfeeding helped, but it didn’t seem to stop these feelings.Which is why I want to say to any woman going through this today that you are not a bad mum and you are not failing your baby if you are struggling to breastfeed. These thoughts are coming from somewhere, but that place is not one of objective reality. I know it feels very powerfully true in this moment – I believe that is down to a combination of cultural conditioning, hormones and sleep deprivation – but they are a lie.Most of the women in this study reported being highly motivated to breastfeed – as I was – and yet they still found it challenging. The lead researcher, Elizabeth Braithwaite, from Manchester Metropolitan University’s Institute for Children’s Futures, told me she wanted to investigate this subject because she noticed how, when she had her own babies, she was one of the few women she encountered who had an easy experience of breastfeeding. This surprised her. After all, isn’t it natural? Isn’t it what we are built to do? Furthermore, there was very little research on how those challenges impacted maternal mental health.Yet women who find it smooth going are portrayed as the default, and before you have a baby there’s a kind of institutional omertà in the health service and among some antenatal course leaders about all the ways in which it can go wrong, from tongue tie and mastitis to prematurity and milk supply. It is highly infantilising, as though even suggesting potential difficulties might put women off. Combi-feeding is barely mentioned, treated not as a method that can empower parents and, as in my case, actually help them breastfeed longer, but as a gateway drug that will spiral into formula addiction (Braithwaite tells me she was disturbed by how many women referred to formula as “poison” in their survey responses).All of this is part of a “baby friendly” rationale that is intended to increase the numbers of women in the UK who exclusively breastfeed up to six months and the length of time they continue to do it to supplement solid food (two years is recommendedby Unicef and the World Health Organization) and sidelines maternal mental health in the process.No one is denying the well established health benefits of breastfeeding for babies, and women who want to do it must receive support to do so. But the way breastfeeding is promoted isn’t working: and the UK has one of the lowest rates in the world, with data from 2010 showing just 23% of womenexclusively breastfeedingat six weeks in England and 1% at six months. Services have been decimated, yet it is mothers, rather than politicians, who arebeing guilt tripped.“Breastfeeding is really intertwined with the idea of being a good mum,” says Braithwaite. “It’s both societal and in the way health professionals can treat you.” I think it is time we decouple breastfeeding and the cult of perfect motherhood, and stop conferring it with so much moral weight (meanwhile, the concept of “being a good dad” and the act of giving the baby a bottle in the night are not intertwined nearly enough).It’s a hangover from the past, visible in so many paintings of lactating Madonnas. And yet we know that long before formula human beings were devising alternative food sources to a mother’s milk. Breastfeeding challenges have always existed. Historically, did women who struggled punish themselves, or do what was needed for everyone’s survival?This moral weight we give “natural” motherhood is damaging. It ischampioned by a toxic political rightthat is heavily invested in wanting women barefoot and pregnant and has no interest in funding services that might support them. From giving birth to diet, any deviation from the “ideal” way of mothering can see you put under a microscope. Claims that a woman can simply manifest a natural birth or that pouches cause speech delay aren’t backed up by scientific evidence, yet that doesn’t seem to stop parents judging each other.Braithwaite understood that just because she found breastfeeding easy didn’t mean she was somehow better than all those mothers who didn’t. There are many improvements that can be made in terms of postpartum care (try funding it, for a start). In the absence of so much state support, though, parents need to care for each other, refuse to participate in this culture of guilt any longer and challenge those who do.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBreastfeedingRepublic of ParenthoodParents and parentingWomenMental healthcommentShareReuse this content"

During his 12 years in St Peter’s chair, Francis railed against Christian complicity with “America first”-type nationalist movements across the west. Here, looming over him on what turned out to be the eve of his death, was the White House embodiment of the insular, bullying politics he spent so much energy fighting against.What now? The pope “from the ends of the earth” will be laid to rest on Saturday in an unadorned tomb in Rome’s Santa Maria Maggiore basilica, after a funeral attended by about 50 heads of state and 130 delegations from around the world. Progressives inside and outside the church will hope that encounter with the US vice-president was not an ominous portent.Theantipathyshown by US Catholic conservatives towards Francis has been virulent, extreme and, at times, close to schismatic. Arch-traditionalists and historicantagonistssuch as Donald Trump’s religious cheerleader, Cardinal Raymond Burke, will see the coming papal conclave as an opportunity to stage a full-blown counter-revolution in the Vatican. How Vance and the Maga movement’s other swaggering Catholic blowhard,Steve Bannon, would love that.After a decade in which secular western politics has drifted steadily to the authoritarian right, could Rome now take the religious version of the same route, rolling back Franciscan reforms such as the introduction of blessings for same-sex couples? The answer is probably not. But it is not by any means certain that Francis’s progressive legacy is entirely safe.In order to promote the outward-facing spirit of his papacy, and reflect his conviction that the global south should carry more weight and influence in 21st-century Catholicism, the first Latin American popeensuredthat the cardinals choosing his successor will be the most diverse group in church history. A prolific record of 108 new appointments included red hats for bishops and archbishops in 25 countries that had never boasted a cardinal before.Many of the relative newbies from Africa and Asia are unknown quantities in Rome, and to each other. Some hail from episcopal sees that are well off the beaten track within their own countries. This influx from what Francis called “the peripheries” will make an always unpredictable voting process still more unreadable. But it also represents a significant recalibration of ecclesiastical power away from the rich west.Such a rebalancing does not necessarily translate to an automatic boost for progressive forces in the conclave. On issues relating to sexuality, “gender ideology”, abortion and the family, many African and Asian prelates have more in common with the “illiberal Christianity” of Viktor Orbán’s Hungary. There may be some interesting coalition-building to come between the churches of the global south, and the conservative Catholic representatives of post-communist central Europe.Anti-Francis theological hardliners could benefit from that. But a more globally representative electorate means that to become “papabile”, a candidate will surely need to share the late pope’s focus on global inequality, the rights of the poorest nations and the climate emergency. A less western conclave should equally guarantee continuing empathy with the fate of millions of migrants on the move, in a world of harder and harsher borders.2:12Catholics across the world from the Vatican to Gaza pay tribute  to Pope Francis – videoIn the medium term, Francis’s empowerment of the laity and the grassroots of the church will also complicate any back-to-the future restoration project. The “synod on synodality” was burdened with a terrible name, and liberal-minded Catholics have been severely disappointed by a lack of progress on issues such as female deacons. But by convening this vast deliberation on the future of the church – in which women voted for the first time alongside clerics on the way forward – Francis cunningly embedded a more open, inclusive culture at the heart of Catholicism. That momentum will be difficult for a new pope to uproot and defy.In truth, though, for all the premature speculation over papal runners and riders, the post-Francis future can only be viewed through a glass darkly. In Robert Harris’s novelConclave, a terrorist attack in Rome sets the stage for a defining choice between a Trumpian cardinal eager to roll back the clock and take on Islam, and a Christlike peace-loving rival from the global south, who will eventually choose the papal name of Innocent. The prospect of a similarly clearcut and satisfying narrative unfolding in May, as an unusually large gathering of 135 cardinal electors contemplate their options, is remote.Against a backdrop already transformed by the impact of the second Trump presidency, the moral stakes for the world’s largest Christian church are intimidatingly high. Francis was afierce criticof the global economic culture that legitimised the restless, amoral profit-seeking of capital, as it sought to undermine every human, environmental and territorial limit to its ambition. His papacy of “the peripheries” was in part dedicated to championing the interests of those forgotten and left behind by such a model.The Guardian view on the coming papal conclave: Catholics at a crossroads | EditorialRead moreBut amid the ethnocentric, nationalist backlash to globalisation, which in parts of the west was often associated with a spurious defence of Christian heritage, he was also called to defend the suddenly endangered postwar architecture of international law and universal human rights. As a new authoritarian era apparently takes shape, in which raw power is allowed to undermine democratic and legal norms, the late pope’s English biographer, Austen Ivereigh, hascompared the challengeshis successor will face to those facing the papacy of Pius XI 100 years ago.Francis’s gut response to the growing crisis was to champion a spirit and ethic of catholicity, in the widest sense of the word. This radically pastoral approach was encapsulated in his repeated insistence that the church he led should be open to “todos, todos, todos”. But that missionary advocacy of inclusivity applied to the secular world as well. In February, it formed the substance of his extraordinary indirect rebuke of Vance, after he had the temerity to cite Catholic doctrine on love as a justification for summary deportations and cuts to US international aid.In his coruscatingletterto US bishops, which would become the last major intervention of his papacy, Francis wrote: “What is built on the basis of force, and not on the truth about the equal dignity of every human being, begins badly and will end badly.” That act of witness should be the starting point of the next pontificate, if the Catholic church is to fulfil its true vocation in the age of Trump.Julian Coman is a Guardian associate editorExplore more on these topicsPope FrancisOpinionThe papacyCatholicismVaticanChristianityReligionEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

It is, he explains in the programme, where he made his professional stage debut in 1979. The return, from a lifetime of film work (though with a TV role very much still in play with Slow Horses), carries the sense of an older man in conversation with his younger self.Just as in Samuel Beckett’s 1958 one-act play – a monologue which becomes an existential encounter with past selves and the many voices we incorporate within us across a lifetime. So Beckett’s crabby writer ritualistically sits down on his 69th birthday to tape-record all that has come to be over his past year, as he does annually, and then begins listening to the voice of his younger self – or selves – first with haughty judgment of the romantic he once was and then the yearning, regret and desolation slowly creeps in.This is not only a one-man play but something of a one-man project for Oldman, who single-handedly directs, designs the set and performs, as well as co-producing the show. What could have been a disastrous vanity project is a startling piece of theatre, arresting and emotional, up there with the best of the modern day Krapps.He is surrounded by the accumulations of his past – books, files, boxes – which crowd around his desk. He climbs across a triangular heap of bric-a-brac to arrive at the desk and begin eating his bananas. The set design faintly resembles Winnie’s “heap” in Happy Days (written three years later) and conveys the same sense that Krapp is trapped, here in the detritus of his life’s hoardings.View image in fullscreenIn thrall … Oldman in Krapp's Last Tape.Photograph: Gisele SchmidtOldman does not go down the Vaudeville route with the play’s tragicomic elements – such as the banana eating. He is funny but never the clown. The opening silence, punctured with chomping, creaks of the desk in lieu of Krapp’s old joints, and squeals of the word “spool” (is he delighting in the word or fending off the lonely quietness around him?) has the audience leaning into his every sound and movement.Oldman becomes more vulnerable by inches. We listen intently to his character listening to himself. It is remarkable to build such intimacy in a space as big as this auditorium, but the beautiful, focused lighting by Malcolm Rippeth helps, along with crisp sound design by Tom Smith. Poignantly, the production features the same tape recorder used by Michael Gambon and John Hurt in their turns as Krapp. It lights up at the end, as if alive – the only part of Krapp that remains vital as the mortal fades, year by year.There is richness to Oldman’s voice – or voices – as he modulates his tone and delivery in the recordings to sound younger, and there is a hypnotic lyricism to the descriptions of a past lover. You feel Krapp’s alienation from this “other” man whose voice emanates from the tape – vigorous, sensuous, still hopeful; but he is also mesmerised, in thrall to him.“The earth might be uninhabited,” says younger Krapp, poetically, and the older man manifests the sentiment much more starkly, and without the poetry.The play makes for a negative kind of epiphany: Krapp’s intimations of mortality. That it is an encounter with the past for Oldman too gives this exquisite show all the more punch.At York Theatre Royal until 17 MayExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreSamuel BeckettGary OldmanreviewsShareReuse this content"

She talks about her shock diagnosis, conspiracy theories about her family, and the Instagram posts that get her in trouble with her kidsSat 26 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTShareIt’s been a decade since Tina Knowles started dictating her life story into her phone for her grandchildren and future great-grandchildren. She wanted them to know their history – her early life and world were so different from theirs, she might as well have been from another planet. Knowles, the youngest of seven, born to a docker and seamstress, grew up poor in segregated Texas. Her grandchildren, born to Knowles’s superstar daughters,Beyoncéand Solange, are growing up in Los Angeles and New York with unimaginable wealth, but under unimaginable scrutiny.A couple of years ago, Knowles started writing a book that was supposed to be her behind-the-scenes take on the outfits she had created for her daughters’ music careers – the dazzling triple-denimlooks she had cobbled together from fabric remnants and army-surplus stores, with almost no budget, for Beyoncé’s groupDestiny’s Childin the 1990s.She was still improvising costumes once Beyoncé had gone solo and could have her pick of designer clothes; even the singer’s spectacular recent Renaissance tour had input from her mother.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenBoth photographs: Mary Rozzi/The Guardian. Blazer and trousers: Alexander McQueen. Earrings: Gabriel & Co. Heels: KotsonasBut those stories from Knowles’s early life – the ones she was dictating for her grandkids – kept bubbling up, and she became more comfortable, she says, with the idea of sharing them. “Because, you know, my family’s very private,” she says; Beyoncé, notoriously so. Knowles dug out that old phone with the recordings and started listening. Eventually, she decided: “I can still be respectful and not tell their story, but tellmystory.” The result is her memoir Matriarch, a brilliant account of how a resilient little girl, born in terrible times, became a powerhouse, guiding her daughters to their potential without, it seems, all of them losing their sanity.Knowles is sitting in the back of a car, speaking on Zoom, looking phenomenally glamorous – red lips, cascading hair – having just come from a photoshoot. But I suspect Knowles always looks like this. (She has even taken toborrowing Beyoncé’s glittering stage costumesfor red-carpet events.)Now a multimillionaire businesswoman, Knowles raised arguably pop music’s greatest of all time. Beyoncé has won 35 Grammys, sold more than 200m records, performed at the Super Bowl, sung at inaugurations, and worked with everyone from Nile Rodgers toChimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Her mother’s life is now one of award ceremonies, beautiful houses, yachts, private jets, and business meetings for the hair and fashion lines they share. But Knowles has realised, she says, that a lot of the time, particularly with Destiny’s Child, the group she helped shepherd with her now ex-husband Mathew Knowles, her input was minimised, even criticised. “I didn’t take credit for things; I stayed in the background. Now I’m 71 and I want to be bold.” She laughs. “I don’t have those hang-ups any more, I’m just living out loud.”View image in fullscreenTina Knowles and her then husband Mathew in 2005.Photograph: Michael Caulfield Archive/WireImageKnowles, who is known by fans as Mama Tina or Ms Tina, is a great talker – warm and funny, with her charming Texas accent. She is acutely aware of her children’s privacy, but can’t help addressing some of the media stories about them. When Beyoncé was pregnant with her first daughter, Blue, in 2011 (she also has seven-year-old twins, Rumi and Sir), the strange theory that she was faking it, complete with false baby bump,enraged her mother. “It was one of the worst times of my life, because I couldn’t say anything,” says Knowles. “But, you know, we deal with rumours all the time. So at some point you just roll with the punches and say …” She pauses. “When they start messing with your kids, your kids signed up for this. But when they start messing with your grandkids, that’s when it gets really bad.”Knowles will sometimes address these things on social media. “I get in trouble with my kids all the time for speaking out. They’re like, don’t dignify that with an answer. And most of the time I’m able not to do that, but sometimes my little fingers just …” She flickers perfectly painted nails in the air as if she’s about to type. Mostly, though, she says, “it’s so silly, and the stupidity and the ignorance that people put out there, some of it is just funny. That’s what my kids say all the time. They’re like, some of this stuff is a joke, so why are you letting it make you mad?”There are topics, however, that she is tight-lipped about. There is no mention in the book of the 2014 incident in a lift after the Met Gala, where leaked CCTV footage showed Knowles’s younger daughter,Solange, attacking Beyoncé’s husband, the rapper Jay-Z, nor of his supposed infidelity. (The statement released after the lift footage emerged said they had apologised to each other and “moved forward as a united family”.) She also skirts over the breakup of the original Destiny’s Child in 2000 and the time Beyoncéremoved her father as their manager in 2011.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenBoth photographs: Mary Rozzi/The Guardian.

Vintage ring and bangles: Knowles’s own. Heels: Dolce & GabbanaAs matriarch of one of the most scrutinised celebrity families – as well as Beyoncé and Solange, Knowles also considers her niece Angie, and Kelly Rowland, the Destiny’s Child singer and actor whom she helped to bring up, as daughters – what does a family get-together look like? Who does the cooking? “I do a lot of cooking, but, thank God, I don’t have to do all of it any more,” she says. “We’re together most holidays, we vacation together a lot. We make sure that we stay close.”Do people often arrive by helicopter? I’m thinking of her description in the book of Beyoncé’s 40th birthday party in Italy, arranged as a surprise by Jay-Z,which Solange initially couldn’t make, only to arrive by helicopter the day afterwards. “No, that’s not normal!” says Knowles with a laugh. “But when we’re together, it’s very normal. It’s like any other family. We’ve got our shoes off and we’re relaxed and we’re talking and we’re having a good time with each other. Kids are running around.”When Knowles started writing, she thought she would finish the book in triumph – fabulous in her 70s, surrounded by family and grandchildren, her daughters on top of the world. Instead, it ends with a shock diagnosis of breast cancer.Last summer, Knowles had been at Beyoncé’s house in the Hamptons, playing in the pool with her granddaughter Rumi. She writes movingly of feeling a stillness in the air, “the singular awareness of being watched with love”. Knowles turned, half-expecting, she writes, to see her latemother standing there, but it was Beyoncé. It felt like four female generations all there together.The next day, Knowles went back to LA to have biopsies of a mass in each breast, which had been picked up in a mammogram three months earlier. She had had unusual mammograms before, which turned out to be nothing, and if the doctors weren’t hassling her to make an appointment, she thought, it couldn’t be anything to worry about. One lump was found to be benign, the other was cancer. It was caught early and removed, and she was reassured that the prognosis was good, but, she says, “it was like a punch in the face”.I taught my girls that other girls are not your competition. You are your own competitionView image in fullscreenBeyoncé and Solange, 1990.Photograph: Paul S Howell/Houston Chronicle via Getty ImagesShe had no intention of sharing the news publicly, she says. “I was, like, absolutely not, that’s nobody’s business but mine.” But she wanted to encourage other women to check, and to keep on top of their screening tests. Knowles thought she had had a mammogram in 2022, but because of the pandemic it was postponed and then forgotten. The cancer could have been diagnosed at an even earlier stage, she says. “That is my big reason for talking about it, because I want women to take the time and not put themselves last.”When she arrived at her room at the hospital, Solange, Beyoncé and Kelly were there. They prayed together and sang. Solange cheered Knowles up with memes, laughing together at the TikToker Jools Lebron’s viral “very demure, very mindful” video. A month later, Knowles had more surgery to remove a blood clot, and later got an infection;Beyoncé would insist on being on speakerphone to ask Knowles’s doctors questions. She moved into Beyoncé’s house, and an old friend came to help care for her. “It was really hard, really challenging,” says Knowles. “Something that I thought was going to be easy turned into something pretty traumatic, but I am doing so good now, and I am just so grateful and blessed that I am healthy. It could have been way worse.”What pulled her through? “Absolutely my faith, and my kids. My kids were …” Knowles pauses. “I can’t even explain how supportive they were.” Her voice cracks and she holds back tears. “This was a seven-day-a-week thing, and I felt, with them by my side, I could get through anything – and I did.” Did it affect her confidence? No, she says with a smile. “My confidence is better, actually. I decided that my silver lining of all of this would be a breast reduction, and, let me tell you, I wore a dress to the Billboard awards that I could never have dreamed of wearing before.” She laughs. “So that part, for me, has been awesome.”Neither has it brought fresh perspectives on life – those came a decade earlier, she says, when she turned 60. “I had the view that I would live each day as fully as I possibly can, and just live out loud, which doesn’t mean I’m loud or boisterous or anything. It just means that I am a priority, and I don’t feel bad about the good things that I’ve accomplished. I feel proud, I feel happy, I feel fulfilled.”She might have a new outlook, but has not forgotten her female ancestors. Rosalie, enslaved in Louisiana in the early 1800s, managed to hold on to her daughter Célestine when the white family who had enslaved them downsized. Célestine became pregnant by the slaver’s grandson; later, he would buy Célestine and their two children at a public auction. “I type those words, say them aloud,” writes Knowles, “and I feel that fear and rage in my blood, the trauma passed down through my DNA.” Living with the man’s white wife and children, Célestine would go on to have 10 more children by him – one of them, Odilia, Knowles’s grandmother.Knowles’s mother, Agnes – whose stories instilled a firm sense of Black pride and female strength – named her Célestine (Tina for short), after Knowles’s great-grandmother. Tina’s maiden name, Beyoncé, was a misspelling of the family’s surname – all her siblings had variations. When Agnes had asked for it to be corrected, she was told to be grateful that they had birth certificates at all. Tina named Beyoncé to honour her own name and her history.Knowles’s family lived in the island city Galveston, just off the Texas coast. She remembers the rocky bit of the beach that Galveston’s Black population was allowed to use, the areas in the backs of restaurants where they could order food, which they would have to eat outside. Having to stand at the back in buses.View image in fullscreenTina Knowles in first grade, c1960.Photograph: Courtesy of Ms Tina KnowlesIt was worse in Louisiana, where her parents were from. When Knowles was there visiting relatives in 1959, her cousins told her they had to wait outside a shop until the white children inside had finished. “I was really confused,” says Knowles. “It was very shocking to me.” And then there was her cousins’ reaction: “They were just OK with it, and they thought I was a troublemaker.” She pauses. “As an adult, I totally get it, because if I had pushed it, that could have been a very bad outcome.” Only four years earlier, 14-year-old Emmett Till, visiting relatives in Mississippi, was abducted and murdered after being accused of offending a white woman in a grocery store. “My mom would prep us for Louisiana,” says Knowles. “She was always saying, ‘You can’t do what you do at home, it’s a different place.’ I had the message, but I didn’t fully understand it until [the shop incident] happened.”For Agnes, drilling those rules into her children, however painful, was a matter of survival. One night, Knowles’s 17-year-old brother was arrested after falling asleep outside somebody’s house. Knowles, then in her early teens, remembers their mother praying, convinced the police were going to kill her son. “We were so afraid that we’d lost my brother,” she says. When he was released the following day, he had been beaten up so badly that his ribs were broken.From then on, the police would harass her family. Her father would be constantly stopped in his car. Waiting for her brother to pick her up outside the cinema, Knowles was questioned by police and taken to the police station when she refused to give her name. There were other traumatising, dehumanising incidents. Once she was violently ill, and her father took her to hospital. She was given an invasive vaginal examination, without explanation or consent, that left her bleeding. The doctors, seeing a Black teenage girl, assumed she was pregnant or had a sexually transmitted disease. They missed that she had viral hepatitis.“I had a lot of anger,” remembers Knowles. “I was just mad when I was a teenager, but didn’t really connect the dots about why I was so angry. It was tough years.” She wasn’t rebellious in terms of drugs and boys, she says, “but I was rebellious in my mouth. I was rebellious in being angry at my parents, and it wasn’t even their fault, but I was just mad.” Had she told her children about these experiences, or did they come as a surprise when they read her book? “I told my children. They know all of these things.”One of her early nicknames was Badass Tenie B, perfect for that spirited little girl. “That was not a term of endearment,” she points out. “It was like, that’s a bad little kid. She’s wild, talking back, she’s doing all these things.” Does she still feel like Badass Tenie B sometimes? Knowles smiles. “Now I can revel in it, I can enjoy it, and I can pull her out when I need to protect myself or my children, because I pulled her out all the time for my kids. Badass Tenie B would come out because that’s my protector.”By the time Beyoncé was born, in 1981, Tina was married to Mathew Knowles, then a successful sales executive, and living in Houston. It’s fun to read about Beyoncé as a challenging baby, whose two-hourly night wakings would only be soothed by jazz. Knowles also writes about Beyoncé’s shyness as a child; it’s hard to believe that now she performs to millions. What caused the transformation? “Performing changed her life. Even when she was shy, she was dancing and putting on shows, and she would just come alive at that time, which is why we got her in the dance class. When she was dancing, there was no shyness.” She pauses. “I don’t know if shy is the right word, but she is still reserved. She always has been and always will be. She’s not that person that walks into the room, like, ‘I’m here!’ I don’t think that changed. I just think that she has this other personality when she gets on stage.”Solange, born five years later, was always more outgoing, says Knowles, and a creative spirit. Later, she would become known for her performance art and groundbreaking album A Seat at the Table, which includes spoken-word interludes from her parents among its songs of Black womanhood. Knowles writes about not wanting Solange to be overshadowed by her older sister before she had a chance to develop her own talent.Did she worry about sibling rivalry? “I don’t know if I worried about it, but everybody who has kids that are five years apart, there is a time where they’re super close, and then when the older kid gets to be around seven or eight, that little kid is going to get on their nerves. I started seeing signs that Beyoncé was getting irritated with her, and didn’t want her around as much. I started seeing them being mean to each other, and that was scary for me, so I got them in therapy. It didn’t take long, because the therapist showed Beyoncé how that could be so damaging to her sister, and she loved her sister, so she became way kinder and more protective of her.”View image in fullscreenTina, Solange and Beyoncé at Solange’s birthday party, 2008.Photograph: Alberto E Rodríguez/Getty ImagesWas it a problem later, as Beyoncé’s megastardom eclipsed the careers of both Kelly Rowland and Solange? “No, I never worried about the competition or sibling rivalry with them as adults,” says Knowles. “They are so close, and they love and support each other, all three of them in every way. People try to make up that story, but it doesn’t fit, because they’re so different, and there is no rivalry between them.” How much of that came from Knowles? She writes that she made a point of never comparing them, always celebrating their differences. Did that help? “Absolutely, and I also taught my girls that other girls are not your competition. You are your own competition. Go and work harder so that you can top your own self. Don’t focus on them, because the time that you’re spending focusing on what they’re doing, you could be working on yourself and becoming better. They learned that very early. I think that philosophy had a lot to do with who they are now.”In the early days of Destiny’s Child, and its predecessor groupGirls Tyme, Knowles worried the girls were driving themselves too hard. “It was their choice – they lived and breathed music and what they were doing, and I would have to make them go and do stuff.” She would force Beyoncé and Kelly to go to high-school parties, she says, to give them a sense of normal 16-year-old life. “They would rather stay home and listen to music and rehearse, and I just didn’t feel like it was as balanced as it should be.” Meanwhile, Mathew created a “boot camp”, as Knowles describes it in the book, taking the girls running and getting them to sing the whole time to increase their lung capacity so they could perform challenging choreography on stage.Knowles had endured some tough years. She writes about being hit by a tax bill and the family going bankrupt. She had forgiven Mathew’s infidelities over the years, but eventually she left and moved with the girls into a small flat. She had set up a hairdressing salon, which was doing well, but it was a stressful time. “Your kids have to be your priority. I believe that with all my heart, but I do think that if I had to do it all over again, I would have balanced a little more in terms of myself. It was tough. I just didn’t have the time to focus on the pain of whatever else was going on in my life.”I’m close to my kids but at times they don’t want my input. They are adults. You have to let them grow upFor years, even after she left, Knowles’s marriage would be on and off. Several months after she filed for divorce in 2009, she started secretly seeing Mathew again: the couple took romantic cruises on their boat for several nights at a time before ending up at their Galveston beach house. If one of the girls called, worried their mother was lonely, their father would have to be quiet. There was one extraordinary incident when they rang to surprise Knowles on Mother’s Day, announcing they were on their way. It meant their father had to flee before they got there. The “affair” only ended when he confessed what reporters already knew – that he had recently fathered a child with someone else. Knowles would later get married again, to the actor Richard Lawson in 2015, but she divorced him nine years later when she was 70.If there’s one thing that’s clear from Matriarch, it’s that Knowles feels things deeply – whether that’s love for the people in her life or the rights of wider communities around her. Her Instagram page is often political – recently, it included admiring posts aboutSenator Cory Booker’s 25-hour evisceration of President Trump. She is a friend of Michelle Obama and she, Beyoncé and Kelly appeared at a rally for Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris. (Although, when I ask about the current situation in the US, she says: “I’m not going to talk about politics.”) She has also long been a supporter of LGBTQ+ movements and lost her nephew Johnny to the HIV/Aids epidemic. They were a similar age and had been inseparable childhood friends who both loved fashion and dreamed of getting out of Galveston. They lived together as adults, and he had helped Knowles’s family, running the household and designing clothes for the girls. (Years later, Beyoncé dedicated herRenaissance albumto the cousin she called “uncle”, who introduced her to the house music and disco made by queer people of colour that inspired the album.)View image in fullscreenKnowles with her nephew, Johnny. They were a similar age and had been inseparable childhood friends.Photograph: Courtesy of Tina KnowlesBy the late 90s, the HIV/Aids epidemic had killed many people within the gay community. “Johnny lost all his friends, and I was always fearful of it,” says Knowles. Then Johnny became ill. “We tried to protect him as much as we could, and tried to educate ourselves so that we weren’t condoning the ignorance that was going on at the time.” It was shocking to visit him at the hospice, where so many other young men had been disowned by their families. “I just find it really hard to believe that people could abandon their kid, no matter what they’re going through,” says Knowles. Johnny died in 1998 at the age of 48.Around the time of Johnny’s death, Destiny’s Child had a record deal and were starting to get big. Knowles had to fight for the girls, particularly their look, which she took charge of. They were sent drab clothes, and designers wouldn’t dress them. She writes: “The reality was that many did not want to give their clothes to these curvy Black girls.” Instead, Knowles came up with her own creations. So many are enduring: the camouflage looks for Survivor, or the strappy and cut-out leather-look creations for Bills Bills Bills. Some people at the label didn’t appreciate her input (one of Knowles’s arch chapter titles about this is “Tina is the problem”). The colours she chose, Knowles writes, were “too bold, too bright, too Black for them”.Sometimes, says Knowles with a smile, “I’ll look at some of the clothes and I’m like, ‘Oh lord, what were we thinking?’” But mostly their look worked and the group and their fans loved them. “I think the label just didn’t have this open mind to things – it had to be proven to them. And, in all honesty, we were country, we were from Texas. We had big hair, I love sparkle and it wasn’t what was happening at that time – we were going against the grain. But these were four Black girls from the south, and we worshipped Motown, so we wanted something different. They were unique.”Many parents, especially in the entertainment industry, who have been involved with their children’s careers end up falling out (Beyoncé’s relationship with her father hasn’t seemed so straightforward). Why hasn’t Knowles, who still works with Beyoncé three decades on? “I’m very close to my kids,” says Knowles, “and I also know when enough is enough, like, sometimes they don’t want my input, and I know how to keep my mouth closed and mind my own business. I also realised that my kids are adults. You’ve got to let your kids grow up.”View image in fullscreenDestiny’s Child wearing outfits designed by Knowles, 2001.Photograph: RJ Capak/WireImageThe book gives a mother’s-eye view of Solange’s artistic development, Kelly steadily forging her own path, and Beyoncé’s work ethic and steely determination. Knowles was there when Beyoncé, watching Whitney Houston sing the national anthem at the Super Bowl, declared that one day she would do the same (in 2004, she succeeded). And in the meeting at the record label where her daughter was told her first solo album, Dangerously in Love, didn’t have any potential hits, but refused to back down (it spent eight weeks at No 1).I ask her what she thinks are the most valuable lessons she has taught her daughters, and what she has learned from them. “They’ve taught me some great stuff. Beyoncé has taught me how to take a compliment, Solange has told taught me to be bolder, Kelly has taught me patience, and Angie has just taught me to laugh at stuff and not take it so seriously.”As for what she has left them, it’s “family first. Also what my mom taught me, which I think is the message they are passing on to their children – my mom would say, pretty is as pretty does. My mom would always say to me, ‘You’re a pretty girl, but one day you’re not going to be so cute, and what people are going to remember is how you acted and how you treated them.’”There is something moving about the wisdom passed through her family’s female line, and something energising about Knowles’s power seeming to grow as she gets older. Finally, she says, she has reached an age where she is content to be single. “I think, up until 70, I really felt like no matter how great my life was, I need to have a partner to make it whole. I don’t feel that way any more.” There is too much to do, even if Knowles seems to have unlimited energy. “You know, 71 is harder than 70, and 70 is harder than 69, but, I tell you, I’m going to try to keep my young spirit.” She smiles, dazzling. “The phrase ‘I can’t’ – I try not to use that too much.”Matriarch: A Memoir by Tina Knowles is published by Dialogue (£25).

Now often you’ll walk around and have nobody else there. It feels empty. You definitely feel the absence of life on those lots.”‘It’s a gut punch’: how the California wildfires affected film and TV workersRead moreLike theonce proud industrial factoriesof the midwest, the dream factories of southern California are in decline. Last year was the worst for on-location filming in Los Angeles since tracking began 30 years ago apart from pandemic-hit 2020. Of all the TV shows and feature films that North American audiences watch, only one-fifth are now made in California.This is because Hollywood is facing intense competition for film production from domestic rivals such as Atlanta and New York, and international challengers such asAustralia,BritainandCanada, all offering more aggressive financial incentives. California’s politicians stand accused of resting on their laurels too long.Donald Trump has a plan but, critics say, it will be no more effective for Hollywood than his notorious tariffs for the rust belt. The US president’s appointment of the actorsMel Gibson, Sylvester Stallone and Jon Voight(combined age 233) as “special ambassadors” to rescue the local industry met with widespread scepticism. Instead campaigners are focused on the hard graft of legislating new tax incentives in California’s state government.Scarpa, whose recent credits include Gladiator II and Napoleon, adds: “The state and the city are both struggling with big fiscal issues and in a way it becomes an arms race: is LA going to be able to compete with eastern Europe? We have the best people in the world here but often producers find themselves shopping for the best price. If LA wants to remain a hub of production, they’re going to have to have some form of tax incentives to compete with them.”Hollywood has been synonymous with film for more than a century. Southern California’s sunny weather allowed year-round outdoor filming while land and labour were cheaper than in eastern cities. Film-makers such asCecil B DeMilleand companies such as Paramount and Universal set up studios that ensured a creative ecosystem of actors, directors, musicians, writers and technicians. Hollywood burnished its self-mythology through films such asSunset Boulevard, Singin’ in the Rain, The Player, Mulholland Drive and La La Land.View image in fullscreenGloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard.Photograph: Granger/Historical Picture Archive/AlamyCalifornia continues to boom. According to IMF data released this week, the state’s nominal GDP reached $4.1tn, surpassing Japan’s $4.02tn and placing California behind only the US, China and Germany as thefourth biggest economy in the world.Yet while the tech giants of Silicon Valley continue to thrive, Hollywood is facing an existential crisis. The first quarter of the year saw downturns in every category of production compared with the same period in 2024, according toFilmLA, a non-profit that handles film permits for the city and county.Shoot daysdeclined 22%over that period and just 13 TV pilots were made, the lowest tally ever observed by FilmLA. Meanwhile average occupancy rates for the majority of stages were 63% last year, down from 69% in 2023. Andaccording to the Hollywood Reporter, the number of recording days booked for music scoring stages dropped from 127 in 2022 to just 11 so far this year.The malaise threatens “below-the-line” crew members such as grips, electricians, carpenters, set decorators, sound engineers, costume designers and makeup artists who came to Hollywood because that was where the work was. If that allure fades they could take their talents elsewhere, sending the ecosystem into a death spiral.The warning signs are everywhere. Los Angeles is now merely one of 120 jurisdictions around the world that offer some form of incentive for film-making. In February, the streaming giant Netflixannounced a $1bn investmentto produce 20 films and TV series in Mexico annually over the next four years. Last week Texaspassed a billthat would more than double the money spent to lure film and TV production to the Lone Star state.The flight from Hollywood has even prompted comparisons with Detroit, the “motor city” that, with the struggles of the car manufacturing industry, went from one of America’s most prosperous cities toone of its most troubled. Factories shut down, thousands of jobs were lost, the population collapsed and the city ultimately declared bankruptcy.Philip Sokoloski, vice-president of integrated communications for Film LA, says:“I don’t think we’re past the point of rescue, but Detroit offers an example of what happens when everything is in your hands and you fail to work to keep it. For California, for greaterLos Angeles, we’ve maintained leadership in this industry for a century.“Generations of people have invested their time, their sweat and their dreams into building this business and it’s been ours to lose. California has underestimated the staying power of its competitors when it comes to their desire to have a slice of Hollywood for themselves.”California remains the production leader, Sokoloski notes, but its share of the cake is down to an all-time low of just 20%. “That’s not what most people would think of when they think of Hollywood as a dominant presence in the industry. It’s very small, the smallest we’ve ever seen it, and as a result what happens to a region when the thing you’re best known for four out of five times is done somewhere else?”View image in fullscreenA firefighting helicopter drops water as the Sunset fire burns in the Hollywood Hills in January.Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesLast October, Film LA made the case that California needs a vast expansion of its film and TV tax credit to maintain its competitiveness.Stay in LA, a grassroots campaign, is pushing for action. The state governor,Gavin Newsom, has proposedmore than doubling the money allocated annually to California’s film and TV tax credit programme from $330m to $750m.Two bills are now working their way through committee in the state legislature. Some politicians warn that the tax incentives will represent a corporate giveaway to wealthy studio bosses; others argue that more importantly they are about keeping jobs in California and offering workers a wage to match the high cost of living.Mary Flynn, an actor who has noticed a drop in her auditions and work opportunities, reflects: “This is how bleak it is: we’re at a point where poor and working-class people are advocating to our government to provide tax incentives for big film studios to keep the work in California so that we can keep working because we can’t compete with Atlanta, where the minimum wage and things like that are lower. They’re taking advantage of tax opportunities but also how much they have to pay into labour.”The drive comes after a punishing few years that have included the end of the streaming boom, pandemic, strikes andwildfires. Flynn adds: “We have exhausted so many resources and even in the midst of all this at Sag-Aftra [Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists] we have video game actors still on strike.“We are very much still hurting so it’s now up to the leadership at large to do what they ran on, which is to protect work and advocate for working-class people. Every single politician that sits at the state level in California advocated on that promise so now they’ve just got to deliver.”Soon before his return to the White House, Trump described Hollywood as “a great but very troubled place” and declared that Gibson, Stallone and Voight would be his “eyes and ears”, helping to bring it back “bigger, better, and stronger than ever before!”View image in fullscreenJon Voight, Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone.Photograph: Valerie Macontimothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesBut Flynn for one is not pinning her hopes on the trio, noting that Voight has adopted “financial core” status with the Sag-Aftra, making him a fee-paying non-member who is allowed to work on both union and non-union projects. She adds: “He’s not only abandoned his fellow union brethren but any work in this town that is worth a cent is union-made; George Clooney and Tom Cruise are in Sag-Aftra, they are not fi-core.“I don’t know what someone like Jon Voight is going to do to save all of our industry when he hasn’t really been in it seriously in a minute. I highly doubt that they would be able to be our knights in shining armour. It’s not a basket I’m putting my eggs in.”Indeed, there is little sign of the promised rescue mission, with industry insiders reportedly saying it has been mostly “crickets”. The ghost of past failing metropolises persists. Last year Scott Galloway, a business school professor and podcaster,told Matthew Belloniof Puck that “LA is a much-better-weather version of Detroit right now.”Belloni comments: “There are certainly differences from what happened in Detroit where the entire manufacturing industry left, and with it, the entire business is now a shell of itself. The entertainment industry will always have some root and connection to Los Angeles because of the infrastructure that is here and by that I mean the studios and the talent agencies are not talking about upping their headquarters and moving to Nashville or London.“But he’s not wrong in the sense that the core rank-and-file middle class of the entertainment industry is being hollowed out, much like it was in Michigan. It’s never been more expensive to live here and, for many of these artists, it’s never been more difficult to find a job.”Explore more on these topicsFilm industryLos AngelesUS televisionTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Those words inspired a balletOakland Ballet Company takes on a harrowing chapter of US-Chinese history with a piece about Angel Island, ‘the Ellis Island of the west’Joy Lanzendorfer in Angel Island, CaliforniaSat 26 Apr 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 26 Apr 2025 12.45 EDTShareOne sunny March day on Angel Island, a hilly landmass in the middle of theSan FranciscoBay, a dancer with a 40-ft braid attached to her head glided across a narrow concrete walkway. The audience sat on chairs in front of a long wooden building: a former detention center where – from 1910 to 1940 – half a million people, the majority Chinese, were held for months, even years, in prison-like conditions.Sometimes called “the Ellis Island of the west”, Angel Island’simmigration stationis the unlikely setting, and inspiration, for an ambitious new work by the Oakland Ballet Company. It’s based on the people from 80 countries who were confined to the the island’s detention center, which was the result of the Chinese Exclusion Act and other racist laws designed to keep Asian people out of the United States. In response, the detainees carved over 200 poems onto the walls expressing their anguish and rage.Circa/LPO/Gardner review – Exhilarating, exquisite and extraordinary as Ravel melds with acrobaticsRead moreAs the ballerina moved, her braid stretched behind like the train of a gown while four other dancers shifted around her. One carried a wooden boat symbolizing the immigrant’s journey fromChinato the US. As the dance progressed, the braid seemed to change meaning. At one point, it was like a line of ancestry or memory connecting the woman to her home country. The next, it became a rope lashing the dancers together. When the woman tried to flee, it pulled taut, holding her in place. Then she wove it like a skein of yarn and cradled it in her arms. By the end, the braid was snarled around her body as she crumpled to the stage.View image in fullscreenImmigration officials examine Japanese immigrants aboard the ship Shimyo Maru entering Angel Island in 1931.Photograph: Historical/Corbis/Getty ImagesThe Angel Island Project premiers on 4 May at Oakland’s Paramount Theatre, with more performances planned in the fall. The ballet is the work of seven Asian American and Pacific Islander choreographers, each interpreting a poem from Angel Island and other harrowing tales in Chinese American history. It’s set to an oratorio by Chinese-born composer Huang Ruo, which will be performed by the Del Sol Quartet. Throughout, a choir will sing the words of the poems in Mandarin and English. “Like a stray dog forced into confinement, like a pig trapped in a bamboo cage, our spirits are lost in this wintry prison,” begins one of the verses. “We are worse than horses and cattle. Our tears shed on an icy day.”This poignant piece of theater has origins in the Covid pandemic. In 2021,Graham Lustig, Oakland Ballet’s artistic director, was dismayed to learn that one of his dancers was subjected to racial slurs due to the rise of anti-Asian hate in the US. In response, he partnered with the Oakland Asian Cultural Center and launched the annual Dancing Moons Festival, becoming the first program to feature the work of all-Asian artists.In 2023, Lustig discovered Ruo’s oratorio Angel Island, which was composed in 2021, and began developing a ballet about the detainment center.The project is expansive, an eight-part ballet exploring different facets of Pacific migration with 12 dancers, seven choreographers, a string quartet and 16-piece choir. “It’s the biggest project the company has ever taken on,” says Lustig. “And at its root, I think it’s a very compelling story about American history, which is less well-known. I think it deserves to be shone a light on.”View image in fullscreen‘It has been really special to dive into this history … and to ask some of those questions about who belongs here, who was allowed to be here, who wasn’t,” says choreographer Phil Chan.Photograph: John HeftiThis message has taken on even greater significance in recent months, as Donald Trump’s administration has begun its aggressive campaign to arrest and detain immigrant residents in the US, raising alarming parallels with the dark history of Angel Island a century ago.Phil Chan, an author and choreographer who lives in New York but grew up in Berkeley, created two pieces for the ballet. Like many Bay Area residents, he went to Angel Island on field trips as a child, but the history didn’t sink in at the time. It wasn’t until this project that he absorbed the full meaning of the poems on the barrack walls.“It has been really special to dive into this history, especially right now, and to ask some of those questions about who belongs here, who was allowed to be here, who wasn’t,” he says. “But at the end of the day, we’re all Americans, right? I don’t see it as just a Chinese American story. This is really an American story. It’s part of how we, all of us, got here.”Resurrecting historyWhile European newcomers stayed only a few hours at Ellis Island, other immigrants on Angel Island were typically detained from two weeks to six months. The longest stay was almost two years. They were interrogated, separated by gender, exposed to poor living conditions, and forced to endure invasive medical exams. It was all part of Chinese exclusion, a series of restrictive immigration laws that started withthe Page Act of 1875and continued until China became a US ally in the second world war.The different choreographers provide varied viewpoints within a larger story about the immigrant experience. In the case of Seascape, the piece with the braid and boat, classical Chinese dancer Feng Ye was given the poem: “The sea-scape resembles lichen twisting and turning for a thousand li. There is no shore to land and it is difficult to walk, With a gentle breeze I arrived at the city thinking all would be so at ease. How was one to know he was to live in a wooden building?”View image in fullscreenA group of Chinese and Japanese women and children wait to be processed, held in a wire mesh enclosure at the Angel Island internment barracks in the late 1920s.Photograph: APYe explains she chose the braid because of its importance in Chinese culture, the belief that hair carries memories through time, and her personal associations of homesickness when she first moved to the US from China nine years ago. Working with a 40ft prop presented technical hurdles for the performers, who risked tripping over or getting tangled in the braid. But, she adds, she embraced the risks as part of the dance.“It was a very big challenge because there are a lot of uncertainties, things we cannot control,” Ye says. “But it’s an interesting part of it to me. That’s like history. We don’t know the next step. We never know. And you cannot control it.”Waves of migrationIn addition to the immigration crackdown, the federal government is also censoring artistic expression it deems DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) in an attempt to silence voices that don’t fit in with the administration’s narrative of America. It haseliminated arts funding for underserved communitiesand is rescinding grants previously awarded for creative and educational endeavors. In early April, the government terminated a $25,000 grant to the Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation, which preserves and elevates the history of migration to the US through the Pacific. Executive director Edward Tepporn expects a second grant will soon be revoked, resulting in a loss of $100,000.View image in fullscreenAngel Island in San Francisco, where people from 80 countries were held in a detention center from 1910 to 1940.Photograph: Aerial Archives/Alamy“Without this funding, it definitely hampers our opportunities and abilities to tell these often invisible stories,” Tepporn toldCBS News.Given this, a ballet centering the talent of Asian and Asian American artists and depicting the painful consequences of history feels especially relevant. For example, a segment in the ballet entitled The Last Chinaman From the Titanic portrays the six Chinese men who survived the sinking of the ocean liner in 1912. One individual, Fang Lang, was found clutching a floating door, likely the inspiration for the well-known movie scene starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. However, when the survivors reached Ellis Island, they were barred from entering the United States and denied medical care. Chang Chip developed pneumonia and died in 1914.View image in fullscreenA mixed group of dancers in the Oakland Ballet Company bring their individual histories and backgrounds to the piece.Photograph: John HeftiIn the suite, ballerina Jazmine Quezada is hoisted into the air by the other dancers. As they turn, pushing her as high as they can, she lifts her arm skyward, reaching for something that she doesn’t receive. There is nothing to do but drop her empty hand.Chan’s finale for Angel Island Project focuses on waves: the dancers imitate the ocean waves bringing immigrants to this country, which turn into waves of people who come and keep coming, throughout the generations, despite exclusionary laws. There’s resiliency and hope in the act of migration, even as other things are left behind.It’s a message that rang true for many of the dancers, a mixed group from different backgrounds who brought their individual histories to the ballet. After the March preview on Angel Island, a woman asked the dancers if they had personal connection to the material. As the bay sloshed in the background, Quezada raised her hand.“My dad is from Mexico and my mom’s family is from Mexico, and they immigrated here. It’s just bringing up feelings about how much they struggled to get here and create a better life,” she said, tearing up. “I love them so much and I miss my grandparents. And I’m so glad for what they have done for me.”Explore more on these topicsDanceBalletMigrationCaliforniaWest CoastChinaSan FranciscofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Agoodjournalist, someone whose keyboard is a tool for exposing injustice, a truth-seeker who would risk life and limb to report their experiences back to the world? I know I couldn’t do it. I’ve interviewed people for a research project and was hopeless. I found myself shying away from asking the really difficult questions. There’s no way I could confront a corrupt official, or race to file a breaking story before a hostile regime tried to silence me, possibly for ever. I like to think of myself as the kind of person who would speak truth to power, but would I really, if my life was in the balance?One of the many privileges of being an actor is that it affords you the opportunity to dip your toes into other worlds and experiences from the safest possible distance. In the upcoming film Words of War, I have the honour of portraying the Russian journalist and human rights activist Anna Politkovskaya – a woman with immense courage and integrity who, despite numerous threats to her life, continued to be a blazing beacon of truth in a time and place where speaking truth was extremely dangerous. The film,which was partly inspiredby Politkovskaya’sobituary in this newspaper, allowed me to delve into her remarkable life and work. The experience gave me a deeper appreciation for the journalists who risk everything to tell the stories that inform and shape our world.View image in fullscreenMaxine Peake as Anna Politkovskaya in Words of War.Photograph: Damir ŠagoljThose who tell these stories face more threats than perhaps ever before. Journalism has become a dangerous profession; according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, more than 1,800 journalists and media workers have been killed while pursuing a story since 1992. Of these, at least 124were killed in 2024 alone, making last year the deadliest in three decades. Nearly 70% of these deaths were at the hands of the Israeli military in Gaza and Lebanon. There was also a sharp 56% increase in the number of press violationsagainst female journalistssince 2023, according to the Coalition for Women in Journalism, including detentions, harassment, physical assault, threats and intimidation. Threats aren’t reserved for war zones or authoritarian regimes. Journalists are also coming under attack in western democracies; on the US campaign trail, Donald Trumpspoke about revoking broadcast licencesand jailing journalists, while rich individuals in Britain havetargeted journalistswith insidious Slapps (strategic lawsuits against public participation).In preparation for my role as Politkovskaya, I immersed myself as much as I could in the lives of the people who report from the frontlines of conflict, corruption and catastrophe, reading about and talking face-to-face with some of these extraordinary women and men. Before leaving to film in Latvia, I had the honour of being invited to a memorial at St Brides Church, on Fleet Street in London, for the murdered American-Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. Abu Akleh was shot on 11 May 2022 while she wascovering raids in Jenin refugee campin the West Bank. She was wearing a helmet and a clearly marked press vest. More than 1,000 days have passed since her death, yet no one has been held accountable.What struck me that day was the outpouring of love and respect from Abu Akleh’s friends and colleagues in the wider journalistic fraternity. Like Politkovskaya, Abu Akleh was someone who dared to expose the truth. Reading about both of these extraordinary women while I prepared for the role, I was struck not only by their courage, but their clarity of purpose. These journalists were not thrill-seekers or fame-chasers. They were driven by something elemental: the absolute belief that telling the truth matters.‘If I die, I want a loud death’: Gaza photojournalist killed by Israeli airstrikeRead moreWe rely on journalists to expose injustice, hold power to account, and to shine light into the world’s darkest corners. Without them, abuse and corruption remain unchecked and unknown. As John Adams, one of America’s founding fathers, put it: “The liberty of the press is essential to the security of the state.” Yet everywhere that journalists are being threatened or silenced, this principle is being eroded. This is not only a problem for journalists, but a threat to all of us, and to our democratic freedoms.That’s why it is so important that we must protect those who do the work of asking hard questions, digging deeper beyond the talking points and propaganda, even when their work is dangerous. I urge everyone to watch Words of War and support press freedom, not just as a political principle, but as a personal responsibility. Defend the truth-tellers. Share their work. Push back against efforts to delegitimise them. The UN’s World Press Freedom Day takes place on 3 May, and anyone can show their support for this principle by donating to organisations such as theNational Press Club Freedom Centreand theCommittee to Protect Journalists. Remember: the next time you see a headline in the news that exposes corruption, injustice or extremism, someone may have risked their life to bring that information to you.Maxine Peake is an actorWords of War will be released on 3 MayDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I thought it looked a bit girlie for me. It was only during lockdown that I finally got round to seeing it. I found the first few episodes entertaining, but didn’t really connect with any of the storylines. I was the same age as the characters, but I had been in a relationship for four years, so Carrie’s disastrous dates felt far removed from my own experience. I saw the show as no more than a guilty pleasure, something to do while my boyfriend played PlayStation in the other room. I certainly didn’t think it would end my relationship.It was Charlotte who got me hooked. Specifically her relationship with Trey, her sexually repressed husband. There was so much nuance to the scenes between them. The show dramatised the uncomfortable, shameful parts of a relationship like I’d never seen before on TV. My boyfriend and I had moved in together that year, and he seemed to have completely lost interest in sex. I played it down to friends, saying I had gone off sex too – but I hadn’t. I told myself what was happening between us was a natural progression out of the honeymoon stage, but it hurt me deeply every time I tried to be affectionate with my boyfriend and he turned me away.Often he wouldn’t even verbalise the rejection. I remember booking a hotel for his birthday, and dressing up for him in beautiful lingerie, and him just sitting on the bed hunched over his phone, placing bets on football as if I wasn’t even in the room. When I tried to discuss it with him he would say he was tired from work, or that he didn’t feel he was in good shape, but no matter how much I reassured him that I loved his body, nothing ever seemed to change. I retreated into myself, and watched a lot more Sex and the City alone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She slinks into their bedroom, in a lacy nightdress, but Trey responds with derision. I started crying because it was a direct reflection of so many nights I had experienced. What moved me the most was Charlotte’s response to the rejection. She simply says: “I’m your wife, I’m sexual and I love you.” I’d been tying myself up in knots trying to rationalise my partner’s lack of interest, but Charlotte spelled it out so unequivocally.I rewatched the scene obsessively for hours that night. I thought about going into the other room and interrupting my partner’s video game, to explain how moved I was by what I had seen, but I knew he wouldn’t understand it. He thought Sex and the City was beneath him, and would literally run out of the living room when he heard the theme tune. And by that point, even mentioning sex would start an argument between us. The fact that I knew it would be pointless to even try to share the scene with him showed me how distant we really were.Over the next few months I started secretly looking for a flat of my own, and making concrete plans to leave. It was a struggle, because there were things I still loved about my partner. I found a shortened clip of the scene on TikTok that I could rewatch when I doubted myself. It felt so frivolous to give up a good man for something as supposedly meaningless as sex – but every time I heard Charlotte’s words I felt less alone. She reminded me that it was natural to want to express your love for your partner physically, and that I wasn’t strange, or perverted, for wanting sex. It was a difficult breakup, but I owe my happiness today to Charlotte’s heartfelt plea for affection.Did a cultural moment convince you to make a major life change?

But the contestants here compete in puzzles so unthinkably boring and complex that you’re baffled from the get-go. Then someone gets locked in a cage …Hannah J DaviesSat 26 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTShareBritain loves a good gameshow. And if there weren’t enough on our screens already, the quizmasters-in-chief, ITV, recently announced that they would be bumping off the reality-focused ITVBe in favour of a new channel dedicated to them. Hopefully it will have some better programmes than Genius Game (Wednesday 30 April, ITV1), a new series that answers a question no one was asking. Namely, what if we had more light entertainment shows that felt like being back in GCSE maths?Frustratingly, Genius Gameshouldbe good. David Tennant is the host, for God’s sake (though he joins the show via Zoom – maybe he’s elsewhere in the studio, or even at home, perhaps already aware it wasn’t worth the three-hour round trip from London, where he lives, to Maidstone in Kent, where it was filmed). Based on a South Korean series, a group of “geniuses” must compete in puzzles and games based on strategy and social manipulation, with Tennant confined to a TV screen in the corner, doing a very loose impression of Richard O’Brien inThe Crystal Maze. Contestants include Bodalia, an NHS doctor who is also a touring DJ; entrepreneur Bex, who doesn’t think academic qualifications are the be-all and end-all, but does proudly possess a 100m swimming badge; and comedian Ken Cheng, who is easily one of the funniest people on LinkedIn, known for his satirical posts that send up “hustle and grind” business culture. There seems to be real potential at the outset, with the sense that this bunch were cast for their charisma as much as their IQs (or, as lecturer Benjamin puts it, “I applied for gay Love Island, so I don’t know what the hell I’m doing here!”) Oh, and there’s a £50,000 prize pot, which isn’t to be sniffed at.Sadly, though, Genius Game is dire – the TV equivalent of walking into a party halfway through an extremely convoluted game you never quite catch up with, and which is unthinkably dull to boot. After eight minutes of indeterminable explanations, the first episode begins with a challenge centred on stealing money from hypothetical vaults. It has the air of a logic puzzle, but also relies heavily on the kind of alliances you’ve seen on literally every other reality TV show ever broadcast. Forensic scientist Scott declares himself to be “ruthless”, while doctor Bhasha says she’s “good at coming across trustworthy”. All of this would be really helpful if it were compelling telly, and not the sort of thing that requires regular onscreen diagrams and voiceovers to make sure the audience at home are still following. Where it does try to do “drama”, it ends up looking more like a guide to committing elder abuse; a retired businessman called Paul is reduced to a patsy for Scott’s scheming, and is locked away in a big cage in a way that feels undignified for everybody involved.As for the puzzles, you know that there’ssomethingvaguely intelligent happening here, but it’s all explained so poorly that Genius Game often feels like watching the Mitchell and Webb sketch where a quiz host shouts “Numberwang!” at random. In episode one, you can actually see the contestants blinking in slow motion as they figure out what they’re supposed to be doing – never a good sign. In episode two, the challenges are a little easier to understand but, sadly, just as boring. The main task (“humans” and “zombies” trying to work out who is who, to gain the most points) has nothing of the wit or the high-stakes backstabbing ofThe Traitors. By the time we make it to what is supposed to be a thrilling finale featuring a giant noughts and crosses board, my brain has switched off entirely. I am left pining for a real ITV quiz: a classic episode of The Chase, or even something featuring Ant and Dec. Where’sStephen Mulhernwhen you need him, eh?It would be easy to say that Genius Game is too lofty, misunderstood by the narrow-minded idiots at home. But nerdy gameshows can and do work: just look at Only Connect or University Challenge. The important thing is that they have to be entertaining, too – and it doesn’t take a genius to see that this one falls flat.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherDavid TennantfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This list, which includes the words “gender ideology”, “affirming care”, “confirmation bias”, “ethnicity”, “identity”, “immigrants”, “racism”, “prostitute”, “political”, “intersectional” and “privilege”, reads like a bingo card for Nell Zink’s astonishingly prescient new novel, Sister Europe, in which a large cast of racially, economically and gender-diverse characters convene over the course of a single evening to attend a literary awards ceremony in Berlin.On its surface, Sister Europe is a comedy of manners set among Berlin’s exclusive and elusive cultural elite. The prose is searingly quick, revelatory and funny: Zink’s dialogue reads like our best plays. Entertaining banter could be this book’s largest trophy, were it not for the contents of the banter, which are so ambitious and ethically interested that they make it clear that Zink is one of our most important contemporary writers.Like the film classicMy Dinner with Andre, in Sister Europe the interactions between characters are vehicles through which philosophical quandaries are explored. However, while the questions in My Dinner with Andre are largely posed in the abstract, here they are shockingly specific. For example, Demian, a German art critic, struggles to reconcile his admiration for the Arabic writer being honoured, Masud, with racist elements in Masud’s writing:On reading [Masud’s] books, Demian discovered to his consternation a grating and persistentanti-Black racism. Was it excusable? He excused it, on the grounds that it would be hard for ananti-Black racistto do much damage in Norway, where anti-Muslim racism was a deadly threat (admittedly much of it intersectional, directed against Somalis). Was it patronising to suspend his ethical standards because the man was a genius, or Eurocentric not to suspend them, and which was worse?In this way, Zink repeatedly names systems of power without being moralistic. She is simultaneously stringent and funny, which is disarming. Humour is one of our best tools for processing extreme violence: Zink knows this, and accordingly deploys her singular wit throughout.Zink endows each of her characters with both moral high grounds and glaring blind spotsOver the course of the evening, Zink’s characters vocalise their desires, fears and prejudices. Nothing, including narrating from the consciousness of an economically privileged 15-year-old trans girl who tries her hand at streetwalking, is off limits. The most working-class character in the book is an Israel-loving antisemitic German cop who takes bribes from pimps but also delivers an exacting critique of the decriminalisation of prostitution under the Social Democratic-Green German government in 2002.In this way, Zink endows each of her characters with both moral high grounds and glaring blind spots. In Sister Europe,as in life, who is the oppressed and who is the oppressor is not fixed. The ever-shifting flow of social and sexual power between the characters is nerve-racking and tantalising: there are no saints and no demons.Though her work is rarely discussed in the context of politics, Zink is one of our most ambitious and explicitly political writers. Here she shows us that the Trump administration’s embargoed words are not weapons, but questions. Nothing is more dangerous to a dictator than someone who can anticipate, and therefore interrogate, their actions. Sister Europeperforms an intellectually rigorous interrogation of the ideas the Trump administration deems most dangerous, all the while dressed in the outfit of an extravagant Hermes-clad literary gala.While this is a novel of ideas, the narrative is never cold or cerebral. It’s beautifully felt, and emotionally open-handed. I wanted love and joy for each of the 13 main characters, which the book (surprisingly!) delivers. As the long night is coming to an end, and morning is threatening to creep over the winter streets of Berlin, Zink’s large cast pairs off and an unlikely couple trade pillow talk:skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

I don’t want to be destructive of a living thing, flattening it with myidentity.” She said the word slowly. As though identities were something ubiquitous, but distasteful, like dust mites, that might be dispensed with, given careful hygiene.This book is not a rejection of identity politics, but a plea for the possibility of an evolving self; a bid against inner stagnancy. LikeErasure by Percival Everett, Sister Europe addresses the claustrophobia that can accompany an identity. No character, real or imagined, enjoys being flattened.Rita Bullwinkel’s novel Headshot is published by Daunt. Sister Europe by Nell Zink is published by Viking (£14.99).

Just when you think the zeitgeist is at its zenith, another opens:Casita Motelin Batemans Bay, promising “escape to a summer state of mind”;The Shoreson the Gold Coast, promising “poolside vibes, vintage charm and endless sunshine”.View image in fullscreenMotel Molly’s rooms feature rattan chairs, Scandi-style ceramics and peachy fabrics.Photograph: Liz KeeneUnlike the high-rise condominiums that have transformed places like the Gold Coast, the new-old motels are capped at two storeys and tend to offer roomier proportions and more fresh air than boxy new-build hotels in an equivalent price point.Renovating existing buildings is less wasteful than constructing a new hotel. Which doesn’t mean it’s easy. Berry View Hotel in Berry, also on the south coast, was in dire shape when builders “took the roof off and stripped it all out”, according to its general manager, Peter Holcombe. “The pool was horrendous green and curtains were nailed to walls.”View image in fullscreenThe ‘gateway to Berry’.Photograph: Lynden FossNow, people pull over to photograph the motel’s tangerine-coloured doors and stylish pool area.

In 2016 he opened The Slow hotel in Canggu, Bali, with his wife, Cisco Tschurtschenthaler, and in 2023 the couple opened Sea Sea Hotel in Crescent Head.

The owner of the Station Boardstore, JJ, says the town is “about 60/40” for and against Sea Sea. “Some people think it’s a bit swanky and say, ‘If you want that kind of thing go to Byron,’” he says.Gorrow gets it. He came here loads as a kid on surf trips with his dad. “The last thing we want is for this place to turn into the new Byron Bay,” he says. There was already a hotel here, he points out, but the owners “had lost the love”. Aside from doing a cracking trade in milestone birthday parties, Sea Sea is booking local bands, showcasing artists and surf films and has put in nearly 3,000 plants. “It will take time to earn our stripes with all the locals but we’re off to a good start,” Gorrow says.In 2022the Timothée Resortopened in Busselton, Western Australia, marketing its original 1980s breakfast hatches, because who doesn’t love near-extinct mod cons? They aren’t used for cornflakes, Tip Top bread and sachets of Nescafé though, because like all of the new-old motels the Timothee Resort has read the room and knows nostalgia is a visual lure only.

He writes that the uptake of cars in the 50s, and boredom with pub stays, made motels with en suites, a pool and colour TVs “a stylish and sophisticated way to travel” for families.View image in fullscreenThe pool at Sea Sea.Photograph: Tommaso RivaToday’s revamped motels vary considerably in amenities and cost. A midweek booking, off season, at the Berry View – where you have to leave the premises for breakfast – will set you back $175 a night for room with a queen bed, or $160 for a single. A summer weekend stay at Sea Sea, with access to its restaurant, bar, lounge, sauna, ice bath and pool, runs to $503 a night.If many of the made-over motels’ social media profiles are a sign, the demographic has flipped from families to photogenic young women in swimwear, with a heavy emphasis onClub Med-style imagery.Is that the kind of retro we want revived? Perhaps it gets others pouncing on the “book now” button but I’m rattled by how uncertain this marketing makes me feel about fitting in. Maybe the motels are simply yielding to the reality of theInstagram algorithm, or, less optimistically, maybe the body positivity movement was just a fleeting fantasy of a more inclusive future. It wouldn’t be the only progressive ideal sinking like a stone right now.The infantilising touches chafe a little, too. At The Kyah, a delightful motel in Blackheath that provides a much-needed alternative to the Blue Mountains’ typically frilly, fusty accommodation, the “do not disturb” door sign reads: “Soz, not right now … building an awesome pillow fort.”View image in fullscreen‘Should Ibe taking a dip?’Photograph: Liz KeeneEven Motel Molly’s cute “Gone for a dip” sign only makes sense when I read the reverse: “Having a snooze”. The quirky mantras feel vaguely dictatorial.Should Ibe taking a dip? Having a snooze? Building a pillow fort? Probably. Where are my #vacayvibes?The ubiquity of a single shared aesthetic that idealises the past is perplexing, too. Holidaying merely in another place isn’t enough any more: we want another time.But no matter how hard they’re trying for Amalfi Coast meets Palm Springs meets 1970s Los Angeles, the overwhelming here and now of Australia prevails. At Motel Molly, the violet-blue skies are filled with screeching birds, the trees hum with insects and the air is salted with sea spray. Unlike the all-pink palette, these appealing features are timeless.Explore more on these topicsAustralia holidaysAustralian lifestyleNew South Wales holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This rice is sweet, nutty and robust, and so good that you can hang a meal around it. You can’t really go wrong, but, for this recipe, I’ve added cannellini beans and feta for creaminess, green beans for freshness and a pomegranate molasses and lime dressing to keep things bright and zingy.Red rice and green bean salad with feta and pomegranate molassesThis is a great, low-effort spring evening meal in which the only “cooking” is boiling the beans and rice. Camargue rice can be found pretty easily in larger supermarkets and online; if you can’t get hold of any, you could substitute it for black rice, which is sometimes calledvenereor forbidden rice.Prep10 minCook25 minServes4-6 for dinner½ red onion, very finely sliced3 limes, squeezed to get roughly 5 tbsp juiceFine sea salt250g Camargue red rice300g green beans, topped400g tin cannellini beans, drained and rinsed15g fresh dill, finely chopped20g flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked and finely chopped200g block feta– make sure it’s a vegetarian oneFor the dressing4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil3 tbsp pomegranate molasses1½ tbsp honey, or maple syrup1 tsp sumac, plus a big pinch extra to finishPut the sliced onion in a small bowl, add a tablespoon of lime juice and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, then scrunch with your hands a few times and put to one side.Wash the rice in a sieve under cold running water until it runs clear, then put it in a large pot and add plenty of just-boiled water. Bring back to a boil, cook for 10 minutes, then add the green beans and cook for a further eight minutes, or until both the rice and beans are tender.While the rice and beans are cooking, make the dressing. In an empty jam jar, combine the olive oil, pomegranate molasses, honey, sumac, the remaining lime juice and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt, seal and give it all a good shake until emulsified.Put the drained cannellini beans, cooked green beans, cooked rice and chopped herbs in a large bowl, drizzle over the dressing and give the mix a good toss until well coated.Break the feta into chunks with your hands, scatter over the rice and lightly toss again. Tip out on to a platter, finish with the quick pickled onions and a sprinkle of sumac, and serve at room temperature.Explore more on these topicsSaladMeera Sodha recipesRiceVegetablesFoodVegetarian food and drinkBeans, pulses and legumesMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’m looking for four things in pasta. First, its ability to hold up during cooking: good pasta retains structure and form, which helps it retain flavour and digestibility, which are the second and third things I look for. If the opposite is true and the pasta is not muscular, there is a good chance it will be flabby one minute and pudding-like the next, which adversely affects flavour, digestibility and – the fourth thing I look for – its ability to hold sauce. This fourth aspect is interesting, because, while a more rustic-looking, fine sandpaper-like texture is the visibly good sauce-catcher, some apparently smoother surfaces are surprisingly good with sauce, which is why trying out different brands can be really worthwhile.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.To test, I looked at the spaghetti raw, for its colour and texture, then I cooked it according to the rule of thumb of a litre of water salted with 10g of salt for every 100g of pasta. I always bring the water to a boil, then add salt, then stir, before adding the pasta and letting it come to a boil again before starting the timer.I also cooked all the pasta according to the packet recommendations: if it offered a range of nine to 11 minutes, I did 10, setting the time for 30 seconds before to give myself enough time to get it out (at home, I usually give it a minute less than the recommended time). All dried pasta is made from a paste (dough) of hard durum wheat and water, which is extruded through holes in round plates called dies to form shapes – and, yes, itislike pressing Play-Doh through a plastic press as a child.If the packet notes “exuded through bronze”, that is what the dies were made from, and what gives the surface of the pasta texture, which is good for sauce-clinging. Teflon dies produce a smoother surface, which can also be pleasing. Have a look at your raw pasta and sniff it: some really does smell of wheat, others of wax. After being extruded, pasta shapes need drying, which is where the true art of a pasta maker lies, different shapes having different needs.The best supermarket spaghettiBest all-rounder:Barilla spaghettiView image in fullscreen£1.40 (500g) at Sainsbury’s£1.50 (500g) at Morrisons★★★★★While the strands don’t have a visibly rough texture, they do have texture once cooked and they hold sauce well, too. The suggested timing of nine minutes was spot on, and the pasta was muscular and had a really decent flavour. A standard but hugely likable and relatable pasta that works brilliantly with clams and other seafood.Best splurge:Rummo spaghettiView image in fullscreen£2.15 (500g) at Ocado£2.15 (500g) at Amazon★★★★☆Spaghetti grossi, or “big spaghetti”, with a dusty aspect and a rough texture, like salt on skin. The very specific 11-minute cooking time was accurate. Rustic is the word that comes to mind, as does chunky, which makes it feel like a pasta that dominates. Has a nice, pronounced flavour, with the wheat coming through in a way that is rare. We enjoyed this with a sausage and tomato sauce.Best bargain:Lidl Baresa spaghettiView image in fullscreen75p (500g) at Lidl★★★★☆Thin, shiny, a bit waxy and, at seven minutes, the shortest recommended cooking time, which was spot on. The right amount of firmness, lovely to wind around a fork, and a great example of how a good-value pasta cooked for the right length of time can be satisfying and rewarding. We enjoyed the rest of the packet with a smooth tomato and basil sauce.And the rest …Iceland Ragu spaghettiView image in fullscreen£1.25 (750g) at Iceland★★★★☆An almost show-off shine here, but also a pleasing texture. This was the only packet that noted the importance of boiling, not moderate heat. As recommended, we cooked it for 11 minutes, and that was spot-on, producing a firm, nicelyal dente, well-textured spaghetti – which is so pleasing because that made up for the average flavour. We cooked the rest of the packet withamatricianaand it was hugely enjoyable.De Cecco spaghettiView image in fullscreen£2 (500g) at Sainsbury’s£2 (500g) at Tesco★★★★☆Thin, slightly opaque and slightly textured makes this a slick-looking pasta. Bang on at 10 minutes –al dente, reliable. There’s maybe no great texture or deep flavour, but it’s pleasing nonetheless, if slightly waxy, which some might find appealing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Held up to the recommended 10-minute cooking time extremely well. A really reliable pasta in cooking and flavour.The food filter: which supermarket has the best extra-virgin olive oil?Read moreOcado spaghettiView image in fullscreen75p (500g) at Ocado★★★☆☆Very smooth to look at, but not shiny/waxy, and ever so slightly opaque. The recommended cooking time of 11 minutes was fine, and it held up, just about (it was close to gummy), but on a second attempt, nine-and-a-half minutes was much better. It has a decisive, and all too often elusive, wheat flavour: very decent.M&S Made in Italy spaghettiView image in fullscreen£2.30 (500g) at Ocado★★★☆☆Nice to look at, with a slightly dusty aspect and visibly rough texture. I followed the recommended 11-minute cook time, and the pasta maintained good structure and a nutty flavour, although next time I’d pull it out after 10 minutes. The thicker strings would suit all the classic Roman pastas: carbonara, amatriciana, cacio e pepe …Sainsbury’s spaghettiView image in fullscreen75p (500g) at Sainsbury’s★★☆☆☆Very smooth and shiny to look at. The recommended cooking time is eight to 10 minutes, so I did nine. It held up relatively well to cooking, although its smoothness made it seem a bit waxy, and the lack of texture wasn’t helpful with smooth tomato sauce; a richer sauce might work better, and finely grated cheese always helps to bring things together. Had almost no flavour, though.Tesco spaghettiView image in fullscreen75p (500g) at Tesco★☆☆☆☆Very thin and almost transparent. The timing range suggested is nine to 11 minutes, so I gave it 10, after which it was overcooked, flabby and gluey. So I tried again with nine minutes and it was too crunchy and flabby on the outside. Oh dear.Explore more on these topicsPastaThe FilterItalian food and drinkFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the weather is wilful and the air can turn chilly in a flash, and it’s this in-between time when soothing braises made with lighter ingredients are just what’s needed. I recently found a recipe for an Iranian chicken stew recipe that paired carrots and yoghurt, and its sunniness really appealed to me; I added cardamom for its evocative scent and chickpeas for body, and it was demolished by the troops. Pudding had to be simple, and both the biscuits and poached apricots can be made a few days ahead, so it is also blissfully easy. A lovely spring lunch for a lazy, sun-soaked day.Cardamom chicken braised with sweet onions, chickpeas and saffron yoghurt (pictured top)Beautifully scented, yellow-stained chicken that is as lovely served at room temperature as it is warm.Prep20 minCook1 hr 15 minServes6Sea salt and black pepper1 medium chicken, jointed, or use 8 chicken thighs, if you prefer3 tbsp olive oil30g butter2 large onions, peeled and thinly sliced4 celery stalks, finely chopped4 large carrots, cut at an angle into chunks4garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced2 tsp green cardamomseeds1 tbsp cumin seeds1 tsp black peppercorns500g drained jarred or tinned chickpeas1 small bunch fresh thyme, leaves picked300ml chicken stock2 large pinches saffron threads, toasted, crushed and steeped in 3 tbsp boiling water200ml yoghurt½ lemon1small bunch fresh parsley, leaves picked and roughly choppedCouscous or rice, to serveSeason the chicken all over, and put a large casserole pan on a high heat. Once it’s good and hot, add half the oil, then brown the chicken pieces, in batches, if need be, until golden all over. Transfer the browned chicken to a large bowl.Turn down the heat, add the remaining oil and all the butter, then gently fry the onion and celery for 10-12 minutes. Season with salt, then stir in the carrots and garlic.Meanwhile, toast the cardamom, cumin and peppercorns in a small frying pan until fragrant. Crush the spices, then stir them into the vegetables and cook for five minutes more.Return the browned chicken legs, thighs and wings (or all the thighs, if using those) to the pan, add the chickpeas and thyme, pour in the stock and two-thirds of the saffron liquid, and bring to a boil. Turn the heat right down to a very gentle simmer, then leave to cook for 12-14 minutes.Stir in the chicken breasts and cook for a further 12-14 minutes, or until the thighs are cooked through.Mix the remaining saffron water with the yoghurt and season with a little salt and pepper. Squeeze the lemon juice into the chicken, taste and adjust the seasoning, and serve with the yoghurt, parsley and some couscous (large, for preference) or rice.Rosewater apricots with pistachio butter biscuitsView image in fullscreenThomasina Miers’ rosewater apricots with pistachio butter biscuits.Ludicrously simple, but nonetheless delicious. Try serving the apricots with different ice-creams: pistachio, hazelnut, and vanilla are all great.Prep5 minChill1 hrCook1 hrServes660g golden caster sugar250g dried apricots2 drops rosewaterZest of1 lemon, pared off in wide strips (use a vegetable peeler), plus the juice of ½ lemon1 tsp vanilla bean pasteFor the biscuits80g pistachios, plus a few extra, roughly chopped, to finish125g softened unsalted butter70g caster sugar175g plain flour2 tsp fennel seeds½ tsp sea saltTo serveWhipped cream, greek yoghurtor ice-creamRoughly chopped pistachiosPut 350ml cold water and the sugar in a small pan on a medium heat and, once the sugar has dissolved, add the apricots, rosewater, pared lemon skin and vanilla, and simmer for 25 minutes. Off the heat, stir in the juice of half the lemon, then leave to cool in the pan.To make the biscuits, blitz the pistachios in a food processor to light crumbs – this should only take a few pulses; you want a mostly ground texture, but with some chunks. Using an electric whisk (or a hand whisk), cream the butter and sugar, then add the flour, fennel seeds and salt, and gently bring the dough together. Add the blitzed pistachios, shape the dough into a sausage, then wrap and refrigerate for an hour.Try this recipe and many more of Tommi’s creations on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, and line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper. Take the biscuit dough out of the fridge and cut it into 5mm-thick rounds – you should have 16-18. Arrange on the tray spaced slightly apart, bake for 15 minutes, or until the biscuits are very slightly starting to turn golden, then remove and leave to cool.Serve the apricots with some lightly whipped cream, ice-cream or thick yoghurt, and topped with some roughly chopped pistachios and the biscuits alongside for some welcome crunch. The apricots can be kept in their poaching liquid in the fridge for up to a week – I love them for breakfast.Explore more on these topicsFoodThomasina Miers recipesChickenMeatVegetablesFruitDessertMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"
